<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The historian's interior life is built from concrete sensory particulars—"pulse answered," tapestry "grew warm," axis "settled under her sternum"—and her choices narrow from collecting to becoming the story's vessel. The final renunciation (trading solitude for spin) carries visible cost and forecloses her prior autonomy. Minor weaknesses: her shift from collector to axis feels slightly asserted rather than fully earned through prior contradiction, and some interiority ("odd even among the remaining archivists") leans toward label rather than dramatized isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors immediately (historian, silo library, post-human twilight). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: three diaries deepen the displaced-axis mystery, and pressure tightens through the historian's choices to probe, locate, and finally transfer the tapestry into the silo's concrete. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): she becomes the axis she sought, the walls now hum with transferred dreams, and her solitude is visibly forfeited. Cost is legible in the final lines ("carrying nothing—because the story, at last, carried her"). One micro issue: the transition from abstract ("axis displaced") to physical mechanism (tapestry transfer) could be tighter, but the accumulative design holds and the closure reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The silo's verticality and repurposed grain infrastructure constrain her climb and catalog search; the concrete loading bay becomes the ritual site where she transfers the tapestry. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven ("air tasted of cooled ember and graphite," "copper glow"). The tapestry fragment itself functions as micro-setting, growing warm and tightening against her ribs, then blank after transfer—these shifts charge the closure image and prove the environment is not merely backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting stories walls have heard—is signaled in the second paragraph and escalates through three diaries that reveal the displaced axis. The historian's choices (probe with sable brush, climb to locate the second diary, press tapestry to concrete) narrow options and the final transfer forecloses her prior role with visible cost. One tightening point: the mechanism by which the tapestry "transfers" dragons into the silo could be more causally grounded, but the accumulative lens allows pattern-driven escalation and the cost at closure (solitude traded, her body now the axis) is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—what it means to be the vessel rather than the collector, the hinge between story and world—emerges through concrete particulars: diaries, tapestry, the silo's geometry. The final image (blank tapestry, walls humming, historian as displaced axis) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The line "traded her final solitude for a world that would spin around the hush of reclaimed places" reweights all prior listening and refusal, and the conceptual cost (individuality absorbed into structure) is undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the historian notices "tremor of old narratives," "bronze quiet," "threads tightening like muscles remembering." Diction remains consistent and elevated without slipping into therapy-speak. Minor friction: a few phrases ("the only creature still driven," "odd even among the remaining archivists") edge toward expository convenience rather than embodied perception, and some metaphoric density ("scream that had decided to stay") occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere or plot. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("scream that had decided to stay," "sunrise seen from underwater"). Two frictions lower the score: some metaphoric stacking borders on overwriting ("axis displaced," "yaw," "dial" cluster in quick succession without full clarity), and a few phrases loop conceptually ("bronze quiet" appears three times, sometimes as atmosphere, sometimes as closure image, blurring its charge). No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-human archivist, medieval tapestry, silos as story-vessels, axis as literal and metaphoric pivot—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of passive collector into embodied hinge is earned through the diary sequence. Minor limitation: the "displaced axis" premise risks abstraction and the final mechanism (tapestry transfer) leans slightly toward symbolic convenience rather than fully grounded transformation, but the emotional and thematic particulars (solitude forfeited, walls humming) anchor universals and avoid template safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's choices—probing diaries, climbing the silo, pressing the tapestry to concrete—drive all three major beats and the closure. Her oddness ("sensitively perceptive") enables the story's mechanism and her final transformation (becoming the axis) forecloses her prior role. Present from the opening, causally active in the middle (locating diaries, interpreting clues), and indispensable at closure (her body as the new center). "Odd" is mostly label-only, but her perceptual decisions carry the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment is signaled early (paragraph 8), recurs with escalating physicality (grows warm against ribs, threads tighten), and is causally central at closure (pressed to concrete, transfers dragons, goes blank). It enables the historian's quest (linking diaries) and charges the final image (walls hum with transferred dreams). Three-beat involvement with clear causal pressure and irreplaceability; removing it would collapse the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Displaced axis" is introduced in the first diary (paragraph 10), shapes the historian's interpretation (second diary: "loose stone … geometry of power would yaw"), and is literalized at closure (she becomes the axis, the world spins around her). It constrains her tactics (searching for the pivot) and the final reconfiguration makes the concept physical and felt. Strong closure linkage, though the mechanism by which an axis "settles under her sternum" remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is stated early (paragraph 3: "perceptive to the tremor of old narratives") and enables her ability to hear walls and interpret the diaries. It constrains no visible choice with cost; instead it functions as premise-level competence. The trait is setup and implicit in middle beats (probing, listening) but not tested or traded off at closure. Functional but closer to a background enabler than a driver of turns.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Probe" appears in paragraph 9 ("began to probe the scorched entries with a sable brush") and is the method by which she extracts "axis displaced." It recurs conceptually (locating, interpreting clues) and the final beat (pressing tapestry to concrete) extends the probing gesture into ritual transfer. Two beats shaped, causal pressure evident, and irreplaceable in the middle turn. Not quite indispensable at closure (the transfer is a different verb) but strongly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The diaries are not found "in a fireplace"; they are found between atlases (paragraph 6), on the sixth level (paragraph 15), and inside a repurposed grain hopper (paragraph 18). The "half-burned" state matters (fire tried to digest them, scorched entries must be probed), but the fireplace location is absent. The burning history shapes the mystery and the child's diary mentions a hearth, but the method as stated is not on the page. Functional thematic echo, but the specific setting detail (fireplace) is missing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The silo's verticality (spiral walkway, six levels, grain hopper at top) structures the historian's search and the loading bay's "smoothest stretch of bare concrete" becomes the ritual transfer site. The reclaimed, repurposed infrastructure (conveyor belts now lined with card catalogs) reflects the theme and the final image (walls vibrating, dragons transferred into curvature) makes the silo's geometry indispensable. Three beats shaped, strong closure linkage, and irreplaceability evident.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the final human dream" is stated in paragraph 2 and sets the post-human atmosphere ("bronze quiet," "remaining archivists"). It does not tighten decisions or create a ticking clock; the historian moves at her own pace with no temporal pressure. The timeframe is atmospheric setup only, not a constraint that alters tactics or charges the closure. Present and coherent but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To collect the stories walls have heard" is stated in paragraph 2 and dramatized across all beats: probing diaries, interpreting clues, pressing tapestry to concrete. The final transformation (becoming the axis, walls telling their own story) both fulfills and forecloses the motivation with visible cost (solitude traded). The desire is concrete, conflicted at closure (she stops collecting and becomes the vessel), and shapes the ending image. Strong causal role and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears in paragraph 2, recurs at the axis-settling moment (paragraph 26: "bronze quiet replacing the hollow"), and frames the exit (paragraph 30: "bronze quiet settle over her like a cloak"). The tone modulates from initial stillness to charged final image (shelves vibrating, wings uncurling) and the repeated phrase reweights from emptiness to fulfillment. Coherent through turns, charges the closure, and irreplaceable as the story's tonal anchor.</comment>
