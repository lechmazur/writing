<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is consistent and character-particular; her grief and determination filter through concrete sensory choices (pressing palm to sand, weaving canvas). Internal contradiction surfaces when she inherits her father's perception but chooses her mother's path, though this tension never escalates into a genuine on-page dilemma that forces a costly choice. The final act (planting the hybrid cutting) feels symbolically complete but lacks a visible forfeiture or renunciation that would foreclose an alternate path. Embodied emotion is present throughout, but the closure remains contemplative rather than decisively altered by internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through returning images (roses, canvas, blood-soaked earth) and shifts from destruction to growth. Orientation anchors early (greenhouse, three days post-tower fall). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira plants the hybrid cutting in the exact spot where her father's airbag fell, crystallizing her philosophy of transformation with the felt cost of accepting both violent and peaceful threads. The final image reweights prior material (father's restless spirit finding rest), though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass-domed greenhouse is well-anchored early and constrains choice through its enclosed, liminal space between desert and cultivation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze of sunset," cracked dome filtering light. The setting charges the final image when Mira plants the cutting "in the exact spot" where the airbag fell, converting spatial specificity into emotional resonance. Minor issue: the tower's fall and airbag crash are referenced but remain spatially vague outside the greenhouse perimeter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mira must reconcile her pacifist philosophy with her father's violent legacy through her garden work. Pressure accumulates through the night's grafting labor, each rose bearing "the weight of continuity." One meaningful tightening occurs when she weaves the sandbag scrap into stems, transforming her father's artifact into living memorial. Agency is present but contemplative; the final planting demonstrates endurance and acceptance rather than a choice between competing live options. The cost is legible (accepting all threads, violent and peaceful) but more philosophical than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through acceptance emerges organically from concrete particulars: blood-soaked earth yielding brighter blooms, canvas woven into stems, hunter and pacifist united in the garden. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "even destruction could be persuaded to grow toward the light." Subtext operates effectively in the contrast between her father's "senselessly perceptive eyes" and her mother's "gentle whispers." Minor slip: "tranquil blaze" appears as direct thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph rather than arising purely through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters consistently through Mira's horticultural expertise and grief. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices how canvas weave resembles her mother's hands, how roses bloom brighter where blood soaked earth. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("engraved quiet," "senselessly perceptive") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Diction at peak moments (grafting sequence, final planting) maintains clarity and emotional texture without melodrama.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("petals like burnished copper," "faint pulse of roots taking hold"). However, overwriting clusters in several beats: "engraved quiet" as metaphor strains coherence, and "senselessly perceptive" is awkwardly coined. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "She [verb]" stems across adjacent paragraphs. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs discussing "inculcating plants with values" restate the concept without advancing pressure. Information density is high in the grafting sequence but thins during expository reflection on her parents' philosophies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—pacifist daughter of a bounty hunter transforms his violent legacy through botanical grafting—offers a fresh synthesis of opposing values. Desert rose cultivation in a post-apocalyptic setting with a fallen obsidian tower suggests thoughtful world-building. However, the emotional arc (acceptance and integration of parental legacies) follows a familiar reconciliation template without unexpected complications. The method of literally weaving the father's airbag into plant stems is inventive and specific. Risk-taking in the quiet, meditative closure is appropriate to the lens but doesn't fully escape the safety of thematic symmetry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is the sole on-page character and POV; her identity as "bounty hunter's pacifist daughter" frames the central tension. She makes one key choice (weaving the sandbag into stems, then planting the hybrid cutting), which shapes the closure. However, her pacifist stance is established rather than tested; no moment forces her to choose between her father's methods and her mother's philosophy under pressure. Present across all three gates but her decisions feel contemplative rather than reversing live tactical options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears early (paragraph 3), is handled at the workbench (paragraph 9), woven into stems with thread (paragraph 11), and its pattern carries into the final hybrid rose (paragraph 17). The object bridges her father's violent life and her peace-garden, serving as the tangible link for the transformation theme. It drives two distinct beats (discovery and grafting) and is present in the closure imagery ("exact spot where her father's airbag had fallen"). Strong integration, though the cost tied specifically to this object could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" appears twice as descriptive phrase (paragraphs 5 and 19) but doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics. It functions as atmospheric motif rather than active concept; removing it would not break story logic. The silence presses against Mira but doesn't prevent an action or force a workaround. Present in setup and closure but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is attributed to Mira's eyes (paragraph 6) and enables her to notice that roses bloom brighter where blood soaked the earth. This observation informs her philosophy but doesn't constrain or cost her anything on the page. The trait is mentioned once, functions as a label rather than demonstrated through multiple acts of perception under pressure, and could be replaced with "keen observation" without structural change. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Sheathe" appears once (paragraph 11): "she sheathed the thorny stem inside the canvas strip." This is the central grafting action that binds father's artifact to her plants. It drives the transformation beat and shapes the closure (the hybrid rose with canvas-weave pattern). However, the action itself could be replaced with "wrapped" or "enclosed" with minimal narrative loss; it's the binding concept rather than the specific verb that matters. Present in setup (workbench preparation), development (the grafting), and payoff (the resulting hybrid), but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is named explicitly (paragraphs 7, 12, 18) and described as her mother's method. It frames Mira's philosophy and shapes her approach (singing, constant presence, weaving herself into the garden). The method drives the night's work and culminates in the new rose variety. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we see the result (roses with "values of forgiveness," "remembrance and transformation") but the on-page dramatization is limited to singing and physical grafting. Present across all three gates and shapes her tactics, but the method's specificity could be sharper to reach higher integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is anchored early (paragraph 1) and pressures every choice: the cracked dome filters the "tranquil blaze of sunset," the enclosed space protects the roses from desert harshness, and its liminal position between cultivation and ruin mirrors Mira's thematic work. The greenhouse supplies the workbench, the soil where blood soaked (enabling brighter blooms), and the "exact spot" for the final planting. The setting shapes tactics (she must work within this enclosure) and charges the closure image. Strong causal and atmospheric integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" anchors the story three days post-collapse (paragraph 2) and sets the frame for Mira's mourning and transformation work. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions; she works "through the night" (paragraph 15) without urgency or deadline pressure. Time passes (sunset to dawn) but doesn't constrain her choices or force trade-offs. Present in setup and provides context, but no live clock altering tactics. Functional framing without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To weave continuity through chaos" is stated explicitly (paragraph 20) and dramatized through Mira's grafting work: she weaves the sandbag into stems, creates hybrids that carry stories, and plants the cutting where her father fell. The motivation drives her night's labor and shapes the closure (accepting all threads and braiding them stronger). However, the desire is more told than tested; no moment forces her to choose between continuity and a competing want. Present across all three gates with moderate friction between stated aim and on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears twice (paragraphs 14 and 22) and describes the sunset light and the final garden state. The tone is coherent—meditative intensity throughout—and modulates subtly as Mira moves from grief (early paragraphs) through focused labor (middle grafting) to acceptance (final planting). The phrase charges the final image by naming the synthesis of peace and fire. However, "blaze" suggests more heat than the prose delivers in the closure beats; the ending reads contemplative rather than incandescent. Tone supports theme but doesn't fully embody the "blaze" half of the paradox in the climactic moments.</comment>
