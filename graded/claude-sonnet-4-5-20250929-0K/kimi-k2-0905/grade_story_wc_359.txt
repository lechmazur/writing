<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is present but often trades in abstract labels ("wonder needed certification") rather than embodied contradiction. The swallowing of the sheet registers as convenient transformation without visible struggle—no gag reflex, no cost beyond metaphor. His motivation to "certify wonder" is declared early but never conflicts with a competing impulse on the page; the aurora "strips away protective scales" yet we see no dramatized resistance or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors Elian and the ice cavern promptly. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through synesthetic color-beats and the aurora passage, culminating in the sheet ingestion. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights wonder from outlawed abstraction to embodied proof—but the cost is asserted ("dissolved into warm cider harmony") rather than felt as forfeiture or friction. The causal chain (bell ring → amber softens → sheet becomes drinkable) is efficient but convenience-smooth, offering no failed attempt or trade-off that would sharpen the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern supplies vivid particulars: "frozen eelgrass" piano strings, the Echoless Vein as aurora trap, "acoustic amber." Synesthetic color (violet footfalls, crimson ice-song) permeates every beat and charges the final image when the aurora is "released back to the sky." The glacier and sculptor's chisel frame the descent and ascent, lending spatial and thematic bookends. While the environment is rich, it does not meaningfully constrain a choice—Elian walks through obstacles that yield obligingly—keeping this shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—certifying wonder to the Council—is signaled early but never tested by opposition; no Council agent appears, no time pressure tightens, no cost accrues for failure. The Echoless Vein is billed as a guardian but dissolves upon Elian's exhale without resistance. The test ("prove he valued wonder over utility") is declared and instantly passed by ringing the bells once. No reversal, no foreclosed option, no visible price paid—escalation is asserted in imagery but not dramatized through agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as infrastructure—emerges through the amber sheet, the aurora passage, and Olesia's remembered axiom. The final image ("hush itself had been sculpted to make room for song") offers a resonant non-literal answer tied to prior particulars. However, the piece edges toward overt thesis ("awe was the only renewable resource") and the protagonist's internal arc is smooth rather than conflicted; no genuine cost complicates the answer. The swallowing literalizes the theme ("become its living document") in a way that feels more clever than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct synesthetic filter ("violet ripples," "crimson" ice-song). Diction is elevated and poetic, matching Elian's bell-ringer role. However, register occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("oscillating repose," "acoustic amber") that reads more authorial than character-particular. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. The voice texture is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure—peak moments (aurora passage, sheet ingestion) maintain the same lyric cadence as calmer beats, flattening urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or synaesthetic image ("breath crystallized into brief golden chords," "colors braided into a rope"). While vivid, the accumulation dulls propulsion—several beats paraphrase the same idea across adjacent lines (e.g., "wonder needed certification" → "certify wonder as essential" → "become its living document"). Template cadence appears in the aurora sequence: "Blue-green light licked… scarlet became brass, indigo became bass…" cycles through parallel constructions without varying syntax. Mixed metaphor: "heartbeat left his chest and orbited him like a cautious moon"—hearts don't orbit; moons don't exhibit caution. No severe loops touch closure, but density and ornament slow momentum throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synesthetic bell-ringer and sculpted-silence premise offer a fresh synthesis. The aurora as test and the amber sheet as ingestible music are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the underlying arc—lone seeker retrieves magical artifact to prove wonder's worth—follows a familiar template, and the Council opposition is mentioned but never dramatized. The piece commits fully to its lyric, sensory logic, and the final image (bells quiet, eyes blazing) reconfigures the opening ping. Risk-taking in dense figurative prose is evident, though it occasionally sacrifices clarity for texture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian frames the quest, walks through the cavern, rings the bells to free the sheet, swallows it, and climbs toward dawn. His choices (press palm to ice, kneel at the slab, ring bells, swallow sheet) drive each beat and the closure hinges on his ingestion decision. Setup: present in opening line. Development: navigates chambers, passes aurora test. Payoff: swallows sheet, becomes living document. Three gates met; causal involvement across at least three beats; closure depends on his action. Cost is conceptual (becomes proof Council cannot archive) but visible. No late arrival, high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber music sheet is the quest object, introduced by paragraph three ("amber music sheet rumored to be sealed"), reappears at the sphere's center ("amber music sheet hovering"), is freed by bell-song ("acoustic amber softened"), handled ("sheet into his waiting hands"), and ingested ("Elian swallowed the sheet"). Setup met, development (freeing it) shapes the climax, payoff is the swallowing that enables closure. Appears in at least three distinct beats with escalating function. Causal pressure: unlocking it requires the test. Closure linkage: ingestion transforms Elian into living proof. Specificity: the "acoustic amber" and "ochre lullabies" are unique to this object. Cost tied to it: he must internalize it to testify.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sculpted hush" is introduced early ("silence so perfectly carved"), returns as "the sculpted hush: a hollow sphere," and the final line ("hush itself had been sculpted to make room for song") reweights it thematically. Setup and payoff present; middle development is atmospheric rather than causal—the hush does not constrain a tactical choice, it is described and then metaphorically resolved. The concept charges the ending image but does not alter Elian's options mid-scene. Lyric resonance (early seed → final reprise) justifies mid-band placement, but lack of mechanical pressure or visible cost keeps it shy of 7+.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Synesthesia is introduced in paragraph two ("synesthetically blessed, and every footfall painted violet ripples"), enables navigation without lantern (functional constraint), appears throughout (crimson ice-song, heartbeat as silver halo, "refracted music" in eyes at closure). Setup met. Development: used to read the ice's message, perceive the aurora. Payoff: "eyes blazing with refracted music" charges the ending. Across at least three beats with causal and closure involvement. The trait enables core actions and appears in the final image. However, no visible cost or tradeoff is tied to the synesthesia itself—it is pure advantage, limiting score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unfetter" is the stated action ("to unfetter the amber score"), dramatized when Elian rings the bells and "the acoustic amber softened" to release the sheet. Setup: goal stated by paragraph three. Development: the test to prove wonder over utility is the means to unfetter. Payoff: the sheet is freed and swallowed, directly enabling closure. The action is not easily swappable—"retrieve" or "unlock" would not carry the same connotation of liberating something bound. Appears causally in the climax and shapes the final transformation. Cost: he must internalize it (swallow) to complete the unfettering. High specificity and closure linkage justify upper 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Walking "through the colors of the aurora" is introduced as the method ("walk through the colors of the aurora themselves, letting them strip away every protective scale"). Executed in the blue-green/scarlet/indigo passage where Elian tastes his childhood fear and the colors "braided into a rope that tugged the slab aside." Setup met by paragraph seven. Development: the aurora passage is dramatized as a test that strips defenses. Payoff: the aurora is released at closure ("cavern exhaled, releasing the aurora back to the sky"). Across three beats with causal function (enables passage) and closure linkage (reappears in final image). However, the mechanics are somewhat opaque—how does tasting fear translate to rope?—and no cost is dramatized (he discards fear "worth discarding" with no visible struggle). Mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ice cavern is the sole setting, introduced in the opening line ("stepped into the ice cavern"), and its features—three chambers, the Echoless Vein, the piano-slab, the hollow sphere—structure the descent. Setup immediate. Development: each chamber forces progression; the Vein is the test-gate; the sphere houses the sheet. Payoff: the cavern "exhaled" at closure, releasing the aurora. The setting supplies obstacles (the Vein, the slab) and the final transformation occurs within it. Spatial choreography is coherent. The cavern's elements constrain Elian's path and the climax depends on reaching its heart. High causal involvement and closure presence justify mid-7 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble" anchors the opening and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("the unknown sculptor struck marble again"). Setup and payoff present as a lyric frame. However, the chisel does not create urgency, track elapsed time, or alter Elian's tactics—it is symbolic parallelism rather than a live clock. Missing middle development (no time pressure during the quest). The reprise reconfigures the ping from "summons" to "invitation," offering thematic resonance, but no cost or constraint is tied to the timeframe. Lyric bookend qualifies for low-mid band but cannot reach higher without causal function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to certify wonder as essential" is stated explicitly ("wonder needed certification before the city's Council of Reason outlawed it") and drives the quest for the amber sheet. Setup met early. Development: the test to value wonder over utility enacts the motivation. Payoff: swallowing the sheet makes him "living proof the Council could not archive away," directly fulfilling the goal. The motivation spans all three gates and shapes the climax. However, it is told more than conflicted—no scene dramatizes friction between wanting certification and fearing the cost; Olesia's axiom supports rather than complicates. The Council is referenced but never present as opposition. Solid integration but limited internal friction keeps this in mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Oscillating repose" is named in paragraph nine ("the oscillating repose of the place took hold—calm that pulsed like a slow heartbeat, never steady yet never anxious") and the tone throughout maintains a meditative, lyric register even during the aurora test and sheet ingestion. Setup met. The tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure—peak beats (aurora passage, swallowing) sustain the same dreamlike cadence as descriptive passages, flattening urgency. Payoff: the final image ("bells quiet but eyes blazing") carries tension, but the oscillation is more asserted than dramatized through rhythm shifts. The tone is coherent and consistent, qualifying for mid-band, but lacks the dynamic range to charge the ending more powerfully.</comment>
