<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is distinctly textured through sensory perception and mapping language, with embodied choices (presses shard to deck, swallows cube, redirects future work). Internal contradiction emerges between professional complicity and present revelation, earning the final stance shift. However, the lover subplot feels ornamental rather than causally essential to the map-maker's arc, and the "withheld truth" realization arrives late without sufficient dramatized friction in earlier beats to ground the weight of self-implication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with conceptual repricing at closure. The piece teaches its mosaic pattern early (parallel bays, strand-weaving imagery) and uses density accumulation to reweight the stake. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the map-maker discovers her maps funded the cover-up, reweighting her craft with undeniable conceptual cost ("to chart not places but consequences"). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (cracked deck, spaceport, sensory map maker). One deduction: the causal link between selling maps and funding the cover-up feels abrupt and under-supported; the complicity reveal would benefit from one additional earlier cue.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay constrains movement and supplies the locker discovery; micro-setting (green shard, copper wire, locker) charges multiple beats and the final pocket gesture. Spatial choreography across parallel bays remains legible despite mosaic structure. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (dust tasting of rust, scent of grease/ozone/lilac, vacuum silence). The zero-g locker beat and the bay's "exhaling" final image both constrain and elevate closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover withheld truth about the lover's vanishing) is signaled early and tightens through the parallel-bay traversal. The locker discovery and self-authored note create one meaningful deepening that narrows options toward the complicity revelation. Agency is present in the final renunciation/redirection choice. However, the escalation feels more textural than pressure-driven; the protagonist's traversal encounters minimal resistance, and the cost of complicity (selling maps) is declared rather than tested on the page through a choice that forces visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (accountability for weaponized gifts, the weight of buried truths) emerges through concrete particulars: the shard's hum, the swallowed cube, the note's aphorism, the decision to redirect commissions. The final image (mapping tremor, ready to answer the bay's question) reweights the opening without stating a moral. One minor slip: "Truth is the mass of what you still carry after the universe forgets you" skirts the edge of theme-stating but remains anchored by the swallowing gesture and data-cube literalism, avoiding full sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature (sensory mapping idiom, technical-poetic diction: "launch drums," "sensory waypoints," "loom of strands"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Compression and elision (half-remembered meetings, vanished lover) are taught early and pay off at closure. Voice modulates under pressure without losing texture. Rhythmic control is strong in peak beats ("She swallows the cube like a seed"; "engines roar anew, cyclically spontaneous"). No filter-verb stacks or dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer action, image, and metaphor effectively. Rhythmic variety supports pressure. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without clear patterning (e.g., "strands tighten," "loom collapses," "copper wire of her veins," "bruised gold" within close proximity), creating mild overwriting that occasionally obscures propulsion. Two paraphrase loops detected: the shard's "cyclically spontaneous" descriptor repeats without adding pressure, and "weaving between worlds" recurs as echo rather than escalation. Applying −0.6 for figurative density and −0.2 for paraphrase.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory cartography, parallel-universe traversal, and complicit weaponization feels specific and non-obvious. The map-maker's particular craft (weighting absence, recording pressure) transforms the parallel-worlds premise beyond template. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic bays, swallowed data cube) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One deduction: the experimental-drive cover-up and militarized maps feel slightly under-grounded in world logic, relying on late exposition rather than earlier embedded detail that would make the twist inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sensory map maker: Signaled in opening line; drives traversal choices (presses shard, kneels, reaches, swallows cube); final decision to redirect commissions arises from her craft and complicity. Shapes setup, middle traversal, and closure redirection. Causal pressure and irreplaceability are high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Green glass shard: Present in opening third (found years ago, hums, sings louder tonight); constrains multiple beats (pressed to deck to open threshold, flares to redirect hand, pulses to guide return, goes dark at dawn, pressed to forehead at closure, pocketed for next threshold). Appears in five distinct beats and charges the final image. Causal, irreplaceable, and closure-linked.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds: Framed early (threshold through parallel universes, strands braid together); shapes middle tactics (stepping tightens strands, shard slices air into refracted corridors, locker floats in vacuum bay, weaving back through loom); final commitment to "weave between worlds until every buried truth is measured." Drives two major beats and closure decision. Specificity and causal pressure are strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cyclically spontaneous: Mentioned twice (shard "cyclically spontaneous" in para 4 and para 10, engines "cyclically spontaneous" in para 21). Describes the shard's behavior but does not constrain or enable a distinct on-page action with visible cost; the shard's flaring and pulsing could function without this label. Lyric reprise across opening and ending, but no middle development that forces a choice. One beat involvement with closure echo; replaceable descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Redirect: Appears in five beats (shard redirects balance toward doorway, air refracted into corridors that redirect hand, future commissions redirected toward revelation, tremor redirects toward next threshold). Shapes middle traversal and closure commitment. However, "redirect" often functions as descriptive verb rather than distinct dramatic action; swapping for "guide" or "turn" would not break story logic. Two-gate presence (middle, closure) with causal involvement but moderate replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Through parallel universes: Signaled early (para 6: "through parallel universes the threshold yawns"); mechanics shape middle beats (younger self in pristine bay, crater under twin moons, vacuum bay with locker, weaving back through loom leaves filaments); method is irreplaceable for the story's logic. Three-gate presence with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport repair bay: Anchors opening (cracked deck, shattered skylight, ruined geometry); supplies the locker and lover backstory; final exhalation image charges closure. Bay's abandonment state constrains the protagonist's solitary discovery and primes the cover-up reveal. Three-gate presence with moderate causal pressure; the bay functions as essential anchor but could be replaced by another decommissioned industrial site with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>In the murmur of half-remembered dreams: Appears in opening sentence as lyric frame ("murmur of half-remembered dreams") and echoed in para 19 ("meetings she half-remembered as dreams"). Does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics; functions as atmospheric descriptor and thematic coloring. Two-touch lyric reprise without middle development or visible cost. Late payoff (cover-up meetings) adds thematic weight but does not alter present-tense choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To discover the weight of a withheld truth: Motivation stated explicitly in para 9 and dramatized through traversal (locker search, note, cube ingestion, complicity revelation). Drives multiple beats and the final redirection to "chart...consequences" and measure "every buried truth." Internal friction emerges between craft and complicity. Three-gate presence with strong causal linkage and closure cost; slight deduction for one moment of tell-heavy phrasing in para 9.</comment>
