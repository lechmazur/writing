<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to clear the staff via transparency reads cleanly and her final choice to "let both go" carries weight. However, the interiority leans toward summary and reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; phrases like "heart drumming a funeral march for resentment" feel more declared than dramatized. Rico and Jun remain functional pressure-sources but lack distinct internal texture. The renunciation at closure is motivated, but the path there relies heavily on eavesdropping revelation rather than accumulating micro-choices that test her scruples in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira finds the lens, confirms no theft occurred, and releases both evidence and resentment with the open-lock doodle—a visible cost of choosing trust over vindication. The inferred lens is Causal with accumulative texture; the eavesdrop narrows options and the projector screening reweights the forecourt emotionally. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first ~100 words. One moderate slip: the cryptic ticket's doodles are explained via overheard dialogue rather than discovered through Mira's agency, which slightly softens the causal spine at the inciting reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt after rain and the projection booth are rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("dust floated like plankton," "rainwater still threading the crystal pillars") that charges the atmosphere. The setting enables key moves: the ventilation grate delivers the overheard confession, the exit sign hides the lens, the projector becomes the vehicle for silent apology. The body and attention filter work well under Mira's scruples-driven POV. Minor cap: spatial choreography occasionally compresses (Mira moves from booth to exit sign to booth without clear blocking), and the "resonant hush" recurs as a mood label rather than a concrete sensory anchor that constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—thaw mistrust with transparency—signals early and drives Mira's hunt for the lens. The eavesdrop delivers one meaningful tightening: she learns the doodles are a staged test, reframes her goal from exposing guilt to enabling absolution, and chooses silent reconciliation over confrontation. The projector screening exerts pressure on Rico and Jun, who fear exposure. Cost is visible in Mira's renunciation of vindication and theAnnotated open-lock ticket. One friction: the escalation hinges on the overheard revelation rather than a choice that narrows Mira's own options under mounting pressure, which slightly reduces protagonist agency in the peak turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—secrecy imprisons, honesty frees—emerges concretely through the lens hunt, eavesdrop, and projector screening rather than assertion. The open-lock doodle and "Staff Memories" reel answer the central question via image, not statement. Subtext operates in the colleagues' staged scavenger hunt and Mira's silent withdrawal rather than confrontation. The final image ("three colleagues swept the floor side by side, no longer guarding their silences") reweights prior mistrust with earned cost. Minor slip: "freed by honesty" and "imprisoned by secrecy" are articulated a bit too directly in the penultimate beat ("We were more afraid of staying frozen"), edging toward thematic echo, though the image work cushions it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds Mira's perspective cleanly with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("the timeframe after words become unnecessary," "ambiguously clear") that fits the hushed, reflective forecourt. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext when present. Two frictions lower the score: several lines compress metaphor and elevated diction in ways that strain voice plausibility for a night registrar under stress ("a funeral march for resentment," "the resonant hush returning, deeper now, like a chord resolved"), and Rico/Jun's brief exchange, while functional, does not yet establish distinct idiom. Psychic distance remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many lines doing double work (e.g., "dust floated like plankton in the beam of her pocket torch, settling on the obsolete projector whose lens was missing" anchors object, POV tool, and prior loss report). Several patterned artifacts accumulate: "ambiguously clear" and "resonant hush" recur as labels without fresh sensory grounding; "the timeframe after words become unnecessary had begun" and similar abstract constructions elevate register beyond a night registrar's likely interior voice under pressure; paraphrase loops appear ("heart drumming a funeral march," "pulse stumbled"). Template cadence in some beats ("She knelt… Then came voices… She almost stepped out… She withdrew…") and stock metaphor ("like a wound," "grew teeth") further dull momentum. These artifacts touch the middle beats but not the closure image directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −1.2 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—scavenger hunt staged to test scruples, enabling group absolution—offers a modest fresh angle on workplace-mistrust material. The cryptic-doodle mechanism and silent-film apology are specific choices that personalize the arc. Execution is competent but trends toward the safety middle: the eavesdrop conveniently delivers full context, the lens is exactly where it needs to be, and the emotional resolution lands symmetrically for all three colleagues. The lyric register and recurring "resonant hush" / "ambiguously clear" phrases feel more ornamental than inevitable. Transformation test: swap the concert hall for another venue and the core beats function unchanged, signaling moderate rather than high originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira (quiet night registrar) is present throughout, makes the closure choice to release evidence and annotate the open-lock doodle, and her scruples drive the hunt. She appears in setup (reconciling the till), middle (eavesdrop, lens retrieval), and ending (projector screening, handing back the ticket). Her decisions alter tactics: she withdraws silently rather than confronting, stages the screening rather than filing a report. Cost is visible in her renunciation of vindication. One friction: the eavesdrop delivers the key insight passively, slightly reducing the causal weight of her agency at the peak turn. Positive signals: early setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.5 = +4.7. Frictions: passive revelation −0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.2 net = 7.2, round down to 7.1. Adjust for modest agency slip in peak beat: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The projector lens is seeded (loss report three months ago), found mid-story (taped behind exit sign), and used at closure (fitted into projector to screen the reel). It drives two key beats: Mira's hunt and the screening that enables absolution. Removing the lens would break the scavenger-hunt logic and the closure vehicle. Positive signals: early mention +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.6 = +5.3. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3, but the lens is solved via eavesdrop rather than Mira's detective work, which slightly reduces its felt cost. Final: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" shapes Mira's motivation (transparency to thaw mistrust) and the ending gesture (open-lock doodle, releasing evidence). It reweights the forecourt's social state at closure. However, the concept is more theme-adjacent than a stake-generating constraint; it does not narrow tactics or impose a dilemma on the page—Mira's path is largely cooperative once she understands Rico/Jun's test. Positive signals: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0 = +2.4. Frictions: articulated as theme rather than a forcing function −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8, but the open-lock reprise adds modest charge: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" appears as a descriptor for the doodles early and as a final image of trust's weight. It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; instead it labels a tonal quality. The phrase recurs but remains ornamental. Positive signals: setup +0.4, lyric reprise +0.6 = +1.0. Frictions: label-only trait −0.6, no middle development −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.0 = 3.0. The final reprise ("ambiguously clear weight of trust") adds texture but does not alter Mira's choice: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eavesdropping is the pivot: Mira overhears Rico/Jun's confession, reframes her goal from exposure to absolution, and chooses silence. The action is signaled mid-story and drives the key reversal. Removing it would require a different mechanism for Mira to learn the truth. Positive signals: one key beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage indirect +0.8 = +2.5. Frictions: arrives mid-story (not early setup) −0.3, passive reception rather than active pursuit −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7, but the reversal is decisive: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cryptic doodles (key, cracked lens, sewn mouth) trigger Mira's investigation and recur at closure (open-lock annotation). They shape two beats: inciting curiosity and delivering the final image. However, the doodles' mechanics—how Mira decodes them—remain vague; the eavesdrop solves the puzzle rather than her interpretation. Positive signals: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0 = +2.5. Frictions: mechanics not dramatized −0.6, swappable with generic clue −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5, but the open-lock image charges the ending: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt after rain sets tone and houses the projector screening at closure. The ventilation grate enables eavesdropping, and the wet marble serves as projection surface. The setting enables key beats but does not constrain Mira's choices—she could have staged reconciliation elsewhere. Positive signals: setup +0.5, two beats (grate, marble) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9 = +2.3. Frictions: postcard description ("crystal whispering") at times −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0, but the projector screening's spatial use elevates: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is invoked early as mood but does not tighten Mira's decisions or impose a deadline. Time passes vaguely (she stays late, dawn arrives at the end) without on-page urgency. Positive signals: setup +0.4, thematic echo +0.3 = +0.7. Frictions: untracked clock −0.7, no tactical constraint −0.6. Base 3.0 + (−0.6) = 2.4, but the night-to-dawn arc provides loose structure: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to thaw mistrust with transparency" drives her lens hunt, reframes her response to the eavesdrop, and motivates the projector screening and open-lock gesture. The motive is signaled early, tested in the middle (withdraw vs. confront), and fulfilled at closure with visible cost (renouncing vindication). Positive signals: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.3, cost +0.5 = +5.1. Frictions: articulated in summary ("hoped to thaw mistrust") rather than shown in contradictory wants −0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7, adjust for mild tell-over-show: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" recurs across the story (booth, ventilation grate, forecourt after reel ends) and charges the final image ("the resonant hush returning, deeper now, like a chord resolved"). Tone coheres and modulates with pressure (quiet investigation, tense eavesdrop, hushed reconciliation). However, "resonant hush" functions more as a label than a sensory constraint that alters choice. Positive signals: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2 = +3.1. Frictions: label-only in some instances −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6, but the final-image reprise elevates: 6.6.</comment>
