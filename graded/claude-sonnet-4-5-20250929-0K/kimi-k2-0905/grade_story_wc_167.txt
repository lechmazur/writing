<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is densely imagistic but lacks genuine contradiction—she moves through her ritual with steady conviction, no competing impulses acting simultaneously. The scar, teacup, and harmonica function as remembered objects rather than pressures that force difficult micro-choices in the present moment. Her final act (hurling the prism) feels motivated by her trade and private craft, but the decision carries no visible cost or foreclosed path; she walks away smiling, conflict resolved too cleanly. Embodied emotion is present (pupils dilating, exhaling) but remains decorative rather than revealing contradictory states under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph and remain stable. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara enacts a ritual, memory-images accrue meaning through the prism's projection, and the final throw releases color into the town. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Mara's ledger is "balanced" and she smiles, with no visible price paid or path foreclosed. The prism dissolves into windows it heals, but this is a convenient resolution rather than a renunciation or endurance with on-page sacrifice. Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the ending beat specifies what Mara has lost or given up to achieve this communion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (salt wind, kelp, rust, violet thread of sky, black mirror of pond) filtered through Mara's professional and personal priorities. Spatial choreography is clean (ankle-deep, pier post, flat stone, horizon). The prism and the bay's drip-and-rings micro-setting constrain Mara's ritual sequence and charge the final image when light strikes town windows. The setting does not pressure a difficult choice, but it does supply the mechanism for her communion and closure, lifting the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to illuminate value in the mundane before the world's great inventory closed its ledger at sunrise"—is signaled early and frames Mara's ritual. The piece deepens through the three memory-images and the prism's flare, but no reversal or narrowing occurs; Mara's plan unfolds as intended with no friction or adaptation. Agency is present (she speaks, hurls the prism), yet the act forecloses no live option and carries no visible tradeoff. The ending grants her success without cost, failing the escalation test for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—ordinary beauty reclaimed through attention and ritual—emerges from concrete particulars (chipped teacup, dented harmonica, scar) rather than assertion. The prism's dissolution into windows offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Mara's final smile and the bay's "secret pattern" suggest earned wisdom, though the lack of felt cost at closure prevents the theme from fully reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and image (concentric rings as "dark syllables," light as healing agent), avoiding meta-commentary. Strong thematic coherence, minor slip in the too-tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, diction lyric and consistent ("noctilucent reckonings," "drip of condensation...striking the black mirror"). Perceptual signature reflects Mara's glazier trade (facets, panes, lattice) and her private craft of reading patterns. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("auroral residue still folded in the upper atmosphere," "brutal clarity"). Psychic distance is controlled, no head-hopping. The three spoken lines feel purposeful but slightly declamatory for peak-beat interiority. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm is generally controlled with varied sentence structure, but several phrases loop conceptually: "read between lines—of light, of wood grain, of the things people refused to say" restates the same idea three ways without adding pressure. "The prism atrium in mist" appears twice without clear meaning or differentiation. Figurative density is high throughout ("ribbons of silver fire," "ledger entries written by the night," "blades of color") without pattern-teaching or sufficient payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty. Paraphrase-loop check flags adjacent restatements in the opening third. Information density is strong in places (the three memory-images) but scaffold phrases ("she understood the assignment," "reckonings complete") externalize rather than embody. Applying −0.6 for figurative density and −0.2 for paraphrase loops, plus minor clarity drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The glazier-as-ritualist premise offers a fresh occupational angle, and the prism-as-lens-for-ordinary-beauty synthesizes setting and theme specifically. However, the structure—character performs solitary ritual, recalls three memory-images, speaks affirmations, and releases transformative object—follows a familiar lyric-accumulation template without bold transformation. The ending's healing-light-into-windows image is visually striking but conceptually predictable given the glazier trade. Emotional truth is present in the particulars (teacup crack, harmonica note, scar constellation), yet the arc lacks the friction or moral calculus that would elevate originality into the high bands. Mid-band for synthesis without daring risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choices (kneeling, placing prism, speaking, hurling) advance the ritual sequence. She is signaled early and her glazier trade shapes her perception ("fit panes...so perfectly storms slid off"). However, her choices do not create reversals or narrow options—the ritual proceeds as planned with no friction. She appears in the closure (walking back, smiling) but the ending is a confirmation rather than a decision with cost. Two gates (setup, closure presence) met; middle development is observation rather than constrained choice. Lyric reprise (first paragraph trade/craft → final walk as sail) adds resonance. Score in the 5.5–6.0 range for causal involvement without high-stakes decision pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism appears in four beats: pocket mention (setup), placement on stone (development), flare projecting lattice (deepening), and hurled-then-dissolved finale (closure). Its facets and mechanics matter—it catches light, projects color, and becomes the invisible lens in healed windows. The object is irreplaceable (cut from lighthouse atrium glass) and causally essential to the ritual's mechanism. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage. No visible cost tied specifically to the prism (Mara does not sacrifice it; it dissolves benignly). Score in the 7.0–7.3 range for essential multi-beat use with closure presence, minor deduction for lack of element-specific cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Noctilucent reckonings" is named once in paragraph five as dream-visions that prompted Mara's ritual ("ribbons of silver fire spelling out debts of beauty unpaid"). The concept frames her motivation but does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page—Mara enacts the ritual without friction or adaptation tied to this concept. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than active pressure. Setup gate met (signaled early), development and closure gates weak (theme-only presence). Swappable with "vision" or "epiphany" without structural loss. Score in the 4.0–4.5 range for functional but replaceable thematic element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reads between lines" is established early ("of light, of wood grain, of the things people refused to say") and demonstrated in Mara's interpretation of the pond rings as memory-ledger. The trait enables her to parse the concentric circles and assign meaning to each (teacup, harmonica, scar). It shapes one key turn—the moment she "understood the assignment" after reading the rings—and charges her spoken affirmations. Present in setup and middle development; closure linkage is indirect (her reading precipitates the final act). No visible tradeoff tied to this trait specifically. Score in the 6.3–6.6 range for essential enabling trait across two beats with moderate closure relevance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Commune" is signaled early ("carried the prism to the water's edge to commune with the noctilucent reckonings") and structures the entire ritual sequence: kneeling, waiting, reading rings, speaking, hurling prism. The action is irreplaceable—Mara's goal is communion, and each beat dramatizes a step of that process. Present in setup, middle (reading and speaking), and closure (prism throw as communion's culmination). However, the action unfolds without friction or adaptation; Mara completes the communion as intended with no cost or obstacle. Score in the 6.5–7.0 range for essential multi-beat action with closure presence, capped by lack of conflict or cost tied to the action itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method—reading patterns in pond rings—is signaled in setup ("read between lines...of light"), enacted in the middle beat ("reading the patterns in the rings...as if they were ledger entries"), and its output (three memory-images) directly precipitates Mara's spoken affirmations and the prism throw. The mechanics matter: drip strikes water, rings expand, Mara interprets each circle. Present in all three gates with causal pressure (the reading reveals what she must illuminate). Specificity is high (concentric rings, drip from pier post, black mirror). Score in the 6.8–7.1 range for essential method across beats with strong closure linkage, minor deduction for smooth execution without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn is anchored early and sustained throughout: salt wind, kelp, rust, violet sky, black pond, pier post, horizon. The setting supplies the mechanism (water for rings, drip for trigger, horizon for prism throw) and the timeframe pressure ("before everything shifts," sunrise as deadline). It constrains Mara's ritual spatially (ankle-deep, flat stone, pier) and temporally (dawn's "brutal clarity" as closing ledger). The bay's "secret pattern of rings expanding still" charges the final image. Present in all three gates with strong causal and atmospheric work. Score in the 7.6–8.0 range for indispensable micro-setting that shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Before everything shifts" and the sunrise deadline are signaled early and frame the ritual's urgency ("before the world's great inventory closed its ledger at sunrise"). Time advances across the sequence (dawn violet → sun prepares to audit → gulls begin riot), but no on-page decision is forced by the clock—Mara completes her ritual without visible time pressure altering tactics. The timeframe is setup and thematic frame, weak on middle development (no rush or adaptation), present at closure (sun catches prism, gulls signal morning's arrival). Score in the 5.7–6.2 range for functional frame that shapes motivation but does not constrain choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to illuminate value in the mundane"—is signaled explicitly ("she understood the assignment") and dramatized through the three memory-objects and spoken affirmations. It drives Mara's entire ritual sequence from setup (bringing prism to water) through middle (reading rings, naming items) to closure (hurling prism to heal town windows). However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; Mara pursues it without friction, cost, or competing want. No visible tradeoff between this goal and another need. Score in the 6.2–6.5 range for clear, multi-beat motivation that shapes action but lacks on-page conflict or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone is lyric, elevated, and contemplative throughout, with consistent diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "silent promise," "dark syllable," "invisible lens") and rhythmic control. It modulates subtly from stillness (opening dawn hush) to intensity (prism flare, spoken affirmations) to resolution (exhale, smile, riot of gulls). The tone charges the final image—light dissolving into healed windows, secret pattern continuing—with quiet radiance. Coherent across all beats and aligned with the accumulative lens. No tonal breaks or register clashes. Score in the 6.9–7.2 range for strong, purposeful tone that supports closure without bold risk or pressure-driven modulation.</comment>
