<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is specific and embodied—"his hearts ache with nostalgia for places he had never stood"—and his final choice to leave the gear behind is earned by the generational pattern he breaks. The grandmother's voice and the recurring crack metaphor ground motivation in concrete family history. Minor slip: the moment he "understood" the beacon's purpose leans slightly toward convenient epiphany rather than fully dramatized realization, though the sonar linkage and tactile engagement with the gear temper this.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to Earned Stasis): Kael seals his destined heart-crack by choosing transmission over rooted sorrow, leaving the gear as monument. The cost is legible—he walks on carrying "nothing except the echo," foreclosing inherited exile. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through sonar pulses, petals, and gear fractures until the beacon encounter reweights all prior motifs. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nebula garden constrains every choice: petals part to reveal the beacon, pollen "glittered like crushed diamonds" grounds the walk, and the vacuum requires sonar rather than speech. The gear's tactile warmth and vibrating teeth charge the final act. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) all pressure the closure image. Sensory hierarchy—hydrogen blossoms, crystalline paths, soft flameless glow—filters through Kael's professional exile perspective without tourist catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"share light without using fire"—is signaled early and tightens when the sharper echo arrives, forcing Kael off the path. The beacon discovery narrows options: he must marry past loss to future invitation or become another luminous bloom. Agency is enacted through the sonar-gear fusion, and the cost is visible: the generational crack seals, the gear goes quiet, and he becomes courier rather than exile. One meaningful tightening with a clear trade-off suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through concrete action: the impossible-ratio gear, the hidden beacon, and the grandmother's prophecy all converge in the final image of shared light without fire. "Patterns can be broken, if you are willing to become the wave that carries the break" reweights prior material without stating a moral. The petals-pausing moment and the garden's "troubling serenity" offer non-literal answers to the central question. No thematic echo; the ending sings rather than sermonizes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "calculating machine gear," "his hearts," and the nebula's "throat" all mark an otherworldly yet grounded register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the beacon encounter, wider during the final spiral meditation. Minor slip: "each petal a note in a song that approximated infinity" in the closing drifts slightly toward authorial summary, though the prior image work earns the reflection. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively—short pulses during the sonar sequence, longer cadences in the closing spiral—and information density is high: nearly every line advances character, world, or pressure. Minor loop: "the quiet sigh of falling petals" appears three times (opening, mid-story, closing monument beat) without sufficient reweighting between first two uses; the third reprise earns its place. Figurative language is coherent except one small clash: petals "dissolving" vs. "still fell" creates a temporal fuzziness. No scaffolding or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—generational exile + calculating-machine mysticism + nebula-as-garden + sonar as communication—feels specific and non-obvious. The impossible-ratio gear that resolves into rhythm rather than number is a fresh inflection on inherited trauma. Risk-taking: the petals pausing mid-air and the beacon crumbling to "startled fireflies" heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Transformation test: plot and arc would collapse if stripped to generic terms; the otherworldly specifics are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's choices drive all major turns: following the sharper echo, stepping off the path, pressing gear to beacon, and leaving the gear behind. Present early, involved in at least three distinct beats, and his final renunciation of inherited exile charges the closure image with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The gear is handled in opening (clutched, warm brass), middle (scrolling data, vibrating teeth), and climax (pressed to beacon, resolving ratio, growing quiet). Its impossible ratio enables the sonar tactic and its final silence marks the pattern-break. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Generational patterns shape every tactic: scratches record transits, fractures predict ninety-seven-year losses, and Kael's choice to break the pattern forecloses inherited sorrow. Present by paragraph three, drives the middle reversal (seeing his own future crack), and the closure hinges on his willingness to "become the wave that carries the break."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" is introduced early (the gear's ratio "slipped beyond the last decimal"), constrains measurement, and at climax the teeth blur in motion "approximating infinity" until the rhythm resolves. Visible tradeoff: finality is refused until the beacon encounter forces resolution. Could score higher if the attribute shaped one more mid-story tactic with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transit structures the entire arc: Kael walks the paths, pauses at his mother's plume, steps off-path following the signal, and finally walks on as courier. The sonar "transit not of feet but of resonance" redefines the action conceptually. Present across three beats and the ending, though the final "walked on" could feel slightly conventional without the prior metaphorical load.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is signaled early ("tuned the gear like a bell, sonar pinging through the hydrogen blossoms"), drives the discovery (sharper echo modulated by something external), and enables the climax (sonar passes through metal and light). Mechanics matter: pulses are questions, echoes return in chords, and the method cannot be swapped. Present in three key beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The nebula garden pressures every choice: vacuum requires sonar not speech, petals part to reveal the beacon, pollen grounds the walk, and the garden's "troubling serenity" modulates Kael's decisions. Micro-setting (gear, beacon lens) also alters tactics. The final image—"the nebula garden kept blooming, but now the colors sang"—charges closure with the environment's transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" frames opening and closing, and "petals...descending for three centuries" establishes deep time. The timeframe tightens when petals pause mid-air at climax. However, the phrase functions more as tonal anchor than live clock; no moment-to-moment pressure from elapsed time alters tactics. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized early ("share light without using fire; his people had once ignited suns...but the fires eventually consumed the guides") and conflicted throughout: staying means becoming a bloom, leaving means abandoning roots. The beacon encounter crystallizes the friction, and the final cool radiance shared across the dark enacts the desire with visible cost (gear left behind, exile transformed).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Troubling serenity" coheres from opening ("the garden answered with troubling serenity") through the petals-pausing beat to the final "widening spirals." Tone modulates with pressure—echoes make his hearts ache, the prophecy tightens around his ribs, then the garden holds its breath—and charges the closure image where serenity shifts from trap to transmission. Distinct and purposeful throughout.</comment>
