<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mireya demonstrates clear motivation and embodied stakes through action—kneeling, listening through the key, syncing her heartbeat—but interior contradiction is shallow. The "logically emotional" trait remains largely a label rather than dramatizing conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. Her final choice (teaching shadows to listen rather than save/destroy) is earned and forecloses violence, but the interior journey lacks genuine struggle or misbelief that compounds before resolution. The emotional calculus at the pivot ("if she saved... if she let...") is told more than enacted through competing bodily impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse engineer, pier, sunset, artifact crisis). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural, shifting to Causal at the climax when Mireya changes the bowing pattern to create a "third path." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (teaching darkness to listen rather than destroy) with visible cost: the key's teeth are worn smooth, her promise binds her to ongoing vigilance. One meaningful tightening occurs when ice begins to calve, forcing the pivot. Minor causality slip: shadows "tasting sound" and then being invited "to listen instead of consume" blurs whether they were already listening or needed invitation, softening the turn's mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful detail: ice pans knocking like organ pipes, pilings humming, slabs tilting like altars. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mireya's professional lens (frequencies, resonance, vibration). The key and Echo function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice—she must match glacier memory vibrationally or lose the town. Spatial choreography is clear (pier, ice below, shadows sliding closer). The recurring whale-bone object charges the final image when wrapped in her coat. Environmental pressure (calving ice) forces the third-path decision, elevating this to strong integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (protect the Echo or nightmares solidify) and pressure tightens when ice calves, forcing a trade-off between artifact and marina. Mireya's agency drives the climax: she chooses a third path by changing the bowing pattern, a decision rooted in her engineer expertise. One meaningful reversal occurs on-page (shadows hesitate, then soften into forgiven silhouettes). Cost is visible: the key's teeth worn smooth, her ongoing duty inscribed in the final promise. The "logically emotional calculus" moment risks abstraction but is grounded enough by the immediate physical peril (ice splitting, shadows closing) to sustain pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of absolution and mercy emerges through concrete events: the Echo's sonic function, shadows as drowned townsfolk, Mireya's choice to teach listening rather than impose salvation or surrender. The final image (stars in spiral, her promise to remain keeper) offers resonant closure without stating a moral. However, "logically emotional" and "sonic absolution" hover near prompt-label territory; the piece occasionally names its concepts ("vibrational matching," "forgiven longing") instead of fully embodying them through sensory particulars. The concept of teaching darkness to listen is fresh but benefits from late articulation more than earned accumulation across beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and aptly elevated for an engineer-mystic, with controlled diction ("frequencies rather than ridges," "fleshly ethereal"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic certainty matches Mireya's expertise (she "understood the logically emotional calculus"). Filter verbs and passive constructions appear but feel voice-motivated ("was dying," "were detaching"). Minor register drift occurs in peak beats: "vibrational matching that invited the shadows to listen instead of consume" reads more conceptual than embodied under stress. The prose maintains distinct perceptual signature (resonance, sound, memory) but sacrifices some immediacy for lyric distance during the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in the middle (glacier memory, bone mechanics, shadow transformation). However, figurative language density is excessive in non-closure beats: "sunset bled... like a wound healing in reverse," "spilled out like warm blood, fleshly ethereal," "altars," "organ," "lullaby"—mixed metaphors (blood/salt/iron/whale-song) blur coherence. Paraphrase loop between "teaching darkness to listen" (penultimate paragraph) and "taught darkness to listen" (antepenultimate) is minor but present. Template cadence in the final paragraphs ("she would adapt... she simply sat... she whispered") slightly dulls momentum. These artifacts do not touch the core closure beat but accumulate to −0.8 within this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse engineer, whale-bone artifact, sonic lullaby, and shadow-as-unresolved-dead is specific and non-obvious. The third-path resolution (teaching shadows to listen rather than binary save/destroy) feels earned in hindsight by Mireya's adaptive expertise. "Logically emotional" and "vibrational matching" risk abstraction but are grounded through action (bowing the key, syncing heartbeat). The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. Minor swappability: the marina and whale-bone could be replaced with another sacred object/location pairing without deep structural loss, though the specificity (whale ear-bone, drift-ice) elevates particularity enough to avoid mid-band stagnation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya (azure-coat lighthouse engineer) is present throughout, introduced immediately. Her choices drive all major beats: kneeling to listen (early), drawing the bow (middle escalation), changing the bowing pattern to the third path (climax), and wrapping the Echo in her coat (closure). The coat itself reappears charged in the final beat, absorbing the Echo's thrum. Two distinct choice-beats with causal pressure and closure linkage; specificity (engineer of vibrations, keeper of keys) matters. Cost is visible (worn key, binding promise). Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key appears in paragraph 3 (setup), is used mid-scene to conduct the marina's lament (development), then driven into the pier to sing the exact frequency (climax), and withdrawn cooled with teeth worn smooth (closure). The key's transformation (teeth worn smooth as river stones) carries visible cost and charges the final image (resting "like a sleeping child"). Specificity matters: teeth filed into frequencies rather than ridges, conducted sound, grew hot. Three functional beats plus closure reprise with reweighted meaning (duty done, song vibrating in marrow). Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is named early (paragraph 7: "Without its sonic absolution, the town... would lose the frequency") and drives the dominant stake. The method involves matching frequencies to heal the Echo and teaching shadows to listen, shaping Mireya's tactics (bowing pattern, tempo increase, mother-whale frequency). It appears in the closure unit ("sealed by sonic absolution") and the coda ("map of absolution written in light and bone"). However, the concept risks being more thematic backdrop than mechanical constraint—Mireya's choices would work similarly if framed as "harmonic healing" or "resonant mercy." Mid-high integration but replaceable synonym test suggests 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is introduced in paragraph 5 ("something ancient and logically emotional, a mind that reasoned through resonance") and invoked at the climax ("the logically emotional calculus") and the ending ("Mireya—logically emotional—let tears fall"). The trait is more label than dramatized contradiction; it does not visibly constrain a choice with on-page cost. The calculus moment (save artifact vs. marina) could function identically without this descriptor. Present across three beats but ornamental rather than causal. Setup and closure linkage without middle development constraint yields mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Adapt" is signaled early ("Mireya had adapted to this sound over years") and drives the climax: she adapts her rhythm to sync with the ice's slow centuries, then adapts the bowing pattern to weave a third path. The final promise includes adapting the lighthouse lamp to broadcast the frequency across winter. Two distinct causal beats (sync, third path) plus closure commitment. The action is specific to her engineer role and irreplaceable—simply "changing" or "adjusting" would not carry the same iterative, responsive connotation. Strong integration with visible cost (ongoing adaptation as duty).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is introduced in paragraph 11 ("To heal the Echo, she had to vibrationally match the memory of that glacier"), shapes her middle tactic (drawing the bow to "sync to the ice's slow centuries"), and defines the climax choice ("a vibrational matching that invited the shadows to listen"). It reappears in the closure when the Echo is sealed and the marina remains intact through resonance. The mechanics matter: frequencies, glacier memory, mother-whale call. Setup, development (matching glacier time), and payoff all present. Specificity and causal pressure across three beats justify high integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is introduced in the opening line and grounds every beat: creaking pier, ice pans knocking together producing chords, pilings humming, ice calving to pressure the climax choice, and ice quieted in the resolution. The setting supplies the acoustic mechanics (organ pipes, resonance) central to the method and pressures Mireya's decision when slabs tilt. Spatial choreography is clear; the marina's destruction is the price of one option. Setup, development (ice as resonant mind), and payoff. Strong environmental constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The fleeting golden sunset is named in the opening line, reappears when the Echo's fissures glow "with the same amber as the sunset," and vanishes ("Sunset's last shard vanished; night took over") marking closure. It provides atmospheric urgency and a ticking clock, but does not mechanically tighten Mireya's choices—she could act at dawn or midday with similar stakes. The timeframe is present across three beats (setup, middle glow, night closure) and tonally coherent, but replaceable with minor edits (e.g., "under the rising moon"). Setup and payoff without middle constraint on tactics yields mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation to protect the sacred artifact (Echo of First Mercy) is introduced in paragraph 6 ("the sacred artifact she had sworn to protect") and drives every choice: kneeling to listen, drawing the bow, changing the pattern, wrapping the Echo in her coat, and promising to remain keeper. The motivation is conflicted at the climax (save artifact or marina) with visible cost (worn key, binding promise). Setup, development through escalating stakes, and closure all present. Desire is dramatized through action and friction between competing goods, not merely told. Strong integration with undeniable causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" is established early through imagery: coat flapping "like a flag of truce between worlds," notes spilling "like warm blood, fleshly ethereal," shadows with "luminous" faces. The tone modulates with pressure (mournful chords, eager wet movements, glowing fissures, harmless dark) and charges the final image (tears tasting of salt/iron/whale song, stars as absolution map). Coherent across beats and purposeful, though occasionally the lush diction risks obscuring immediacy during peak action. Setup, development, and closure linkage present; tone shifts support rather than flatten pressure. Solid integration without indispensability.</comment>
