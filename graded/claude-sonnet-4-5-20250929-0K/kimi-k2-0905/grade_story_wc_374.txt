<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's transformation from skeptic to weather-bearer occurs through exposition rather than embodied choice under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("rational mind finally tasting what her body had always known") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The woman with silver hair appears as a mystical guide delivering insights rather than forcing difficult decisions. Key moments—the convergence, the seed exchange—are declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land early, satisfying that test. However, the closure relies on summary transformation ("feeling the compass ring cool...knowing that tomorrow she would wake") rather than a decisive on-page change with legible cost. The story shifts from seeking understanding to "becoming" a weather-bearer, but this shift is told through exposition in the final paragraphs rather than enacted. Under a Causal lens, the link between the woman's presence and the protagonist's acceptance lacks because/therefore pressure—the skeptic simply "melts" without visible forfeiture of her former stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lavender bluff and aurora provide vivid sensory anchors. The forests' "elections" create atmospheric specificity but remain decorative—they do not constrain the protagonist's choices or alter her path. The compass ring's physical properties (warming, glowing, cooling) track across beats and participate in the ending, qualifying as micro-setting. However, the bluff itself functions primarily as backdrop; the protagonist could converge with the weather-woman in any elevated location without structural change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning why some carry weather—is signaled early but resolved through exposition rather than escalating pressure. The convergence moment ("their personal atmospheres began to merge") could constitute a turn, but it arrives without visible cost or tactical narrowing. The woman's departure and seed gift feel ceremonial rather than hard-won. No on-page choice forecloses a path; the skeptic's resistance "melts" passively, and the seed promises future transformation that occurs off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of acceptance versus skepticism is stated directly ("what can only be known through acceptance") rather than emerging from particulars. The forests' democratic elections run parallel to the human weather convergence but never intersect causally, reading as ornamental parallelism. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "some storms are meant to be shared...every person's atmosphere is a vote." The seed and compass ring are positioned as symbols but their thematic charge is announced rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and lyric, with consistent texture ("tasted spring rain and winter's first snow simultaneously"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("human embodiments of atmospheric phenomena that science could measure but never truly explain") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The woman's dialogue carries suitable gravity, but the protagonist's interior voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—her way of noticing is generic rather than shaped by her skepticism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear with purposeful rhythm and varied sentence structure. Several paraphrase loops appear: the forests' election results are described twice in adjacent paragraphs with minor variation, and the protagonist's transformation is restated multiple times in the final third ("some people carried weather because they were weather," "her own weather for the first time," "what she needed to become: a weather-bearer"). The closing paragraph stacks three forward-looking summary beats that restate rather than advance. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "futuristic nostalgia" appears twice without clear grounding in concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise of people who carry weather systems offers a fresh speculative angle. However, the execution leans on familiar mystical-guide structure: a seeker meets a wise elder who imparts transformative wisdom before vanishing. The taste-based method is specific but underused after setup. The forests' voting subplot adds texture but never integrates causally with the human arc. The convergence of weather-bearers could be distinctive, but it resolves through declarative summary rather than surprising consequence rooted in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and focalizes the narrative. Her skepticism is declared but not tested through difficult choices—she observes, tastes, and ultimately accepts without visible cost. The final transformation occurs through passive reception of the woman's teachings rather than decisions that narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Appears in at least four beats: initial mention, pressed to lips to taste, glows during convergence, cools at dawn, and reappears in final line pointing "toward what she needed to become." Physical state changes (warming, glowing, cooling) track causally with emotional beats. However, its "emergent compass" property is told rather than demonstrated—it doesn't guide a single on-page navigational choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The concept is explained ("one that didn't point north but toward whatever you most needed to find") but never enacted. The ring points "to the space between them" once, but this is description rather than constraint. The emergent property exists as thematic claim without altering tactics or options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears only as descriptor for the aurora light show. It colors the atmosphere but does not constrain action or enable any choice. The phrase recurs in the final line attached to "futuristic nostalgia" but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The convergence of the two weather-bearers appears at midpoint and generates the cyclone effect. It drives the protagonist's acceptance and the woman's gift of the seed. However, the act itself is passive ("as she stepped closer, their personal atmospheres began to merge") rather than a choice with visible cost, and a similar mystical encounter could serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Introduced early ("each person's weather left a distinct flavor on her tongue") and used in two beats: tasting ozone/lavender, then tasting spring/winter simultaneously when meeting the woman. The method signals her unique perception but does not constrain attempts or shape tactics—she tastes, but tasting does not guide her next move or cost her anything.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Named early and supplies the aurora backdrop. The eastern slope is mentioned as a destination, but the bluff's elevation or terrain does not constrain the convergence. The protagonist descends at dawn, but this is transit rather than choice shaped by the setting. The aurora and lavender scent provide atmospheric texture without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The forests' elections are mentioned multiple times and results are announced, but this temporal frame does not pressure the protagonist's decisions. The election outcome (oak president, maple transition, pine guardian) is parallel decoration. "As dawn approached" provides a time marker for the woman's departure but does not tighten the protagonist's window for action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stated clearly in the opening ("She had come to learn why some people carried weather") and remains the nominal goal. The woman directly answers the question ("You're like me...you've been fighting it"), resolving the motivation through exposition. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Futuristic nostalgia" appears twice as a label (attached to the aurora, then to the compass ring in the final line) but does not modulate with pressure or emerge from scene texture. The tone reads more as lyric-mystical throughout, with no clear tension between future and past that charges the ending.</comment>
