<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual signature—framing silence as language—remains consistent and drives her choices. Internal contradiction appears in her flicker of distrust versus methodical trust in maps, and her final choice to leave without translating the silence shows renunciation with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present ("curled inside her ribs like warm smoke"), though some moments lean toward abstract perception ("empathy was the compass"). The motivation shift from curiosity to interpretive empathy is earned through concrete experiences with the footage and chapel, but the closure choice feels more passive witnessing than active forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered observations (torn map, footage comparison, fresco peeling, chapel opening) toward a conceptual repricing at closure where "the known world was the blank margin." The closure reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (choosing not to translate), though the cost remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes the chapel opens to matched stillness, narrowing her interpretive options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, henge lintel shadow, torn map, and chapel threshold work as micro-settings that constrain Elara's interpretive moves and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful: rain "hissing," "one disciplined beam of stormlight," the stone's pulse. The torn parchment aligning with the lintel's shadow anchors the conceptual geography. The fresco vault's peeling layers and the chapel's stone bench supply tactile grounding that shapes Elara's understanding at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (interpreting silence as language versus emptiness) is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the chapel responds to matched stillness. One meaningful turn: her recognition that "the chapel did not open by force" forecloses the conquest approach. The final choice—to leave without translating—shows renunciation with cost (no footage carried, only openness). Agency reads as attention and endurance under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more deepening than confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (silence as language, borders as interpretive acts) emerges organically from the torn map, looped footage, and chapel threshold without explicit thesis. The final image—"every map eventually reopens at its tear"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the interpretive question. The fresco vault's century-by-century resealing and Elara's choice not to translate avoid moralizing. Minor slip: "empathy was the compass that spun until it pointed nowhere and therefore everywhere" trends slightly abstract, though grounded by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a perceptual signature: Elara notices torn edges, alignment, and "the silence was not absence but a map framed upside-down." Diction is elevated and controlled ("jagged edge dividing the inked coast," "scream wearing silence"), matching the contemplative stance. Distance modulates appropriately during the chapel entry. Minor register drift: "methodically curious nature, usually a calm lantern" reads slightly precious, and a few constructions lean lyric-abstract ("shielded openness of someone who has heard silence speak") without full embodiment under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high across beats. However, some lines carry overwriting: "the omission here was a scream wearing silence," "warm smoke," "mineral hush," and "one disciplined beam of stormlight" cluster elevated metaphors without breathing room. Minor paraphrase loop: the chapel opening is restated across multiple sentences ("did not open by force; it reopened when someone outside had grown quiet"). Propulsion remains strong, but the figurative load in peak beats approaches ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of torn map, time-lapse footage, and silence-as-language is specific and non-obvious. The turn—stillness as prerequisite for the chapel's opening—feels earned in hindsight. Risk is present in the quiet, non-confrontational closure and the inverted cartography conceit. The fresco vault's century-resealing and Elara's renunciation of translation avoid stock resolutions. Minor derivative note: the "map of the unknown" frame and empathetic-listener-discovers-truth premise echo common contemplative templates, though the execution particularizes it through the footage mechanism and the physical tear/threshold alignment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her perceptual choices (comparing footage, recognizing the tear/shadow alignment, entering the chapel, choosing not to translate) drive all major turns. Setup is immediate, development spans the footage comparison and chapel entry, and payoff occurs in the final renunciation. Causal pressure: her methodical observation enables the stillness-matching insight, which forecloses conquest and opens witness. Cost: she walks away "carrying no footage," accepting incompleteness. Swappability is low; another character archetype would not generate the interpretive frame.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The henge appears in setup (lintel shadow aligns with map tear) and at closure (the shadow/tear alignment reframes known/unknown borders). It constrains Elara's spatial and conceptual navigation. However, it is not handled or used in distinct beats—only observed once and later recalled. The alignment is crucial to the interpretive turn, but the henge itself remains more symbolic marker than active object. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) and causal linkage to the closure lift it into mid-band, but lack of middle development and tactile engagement limit further elevation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "whispered chapel" (silent chapel in text) is central: it appears in setup, drives the footage mystery, supplies the middle insight (opens to matched stillness), and houses the closure action where Elara sits and chooses not to translate. The concept shapes stakes (interpret silence) and tactics (achieving stillness to enter). The doorway's open/closed paradox and Elara's final witness inside fulfill all three gates. Cost: renunciation of translation. Specificity is high; another location would not carry the silence-language thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is labeled early ("Elara's methodically curious nature, usually a calm lantern, flickered now") and shown through her frame-by-frame footage comparison and systematic observation of the torn map alignment. It constrains her approach—she trusts maps' confessed limits, resists conquest—and enables the stillness insight. However, the trait does not face a visible tradeoff or cost on the page; it guides but does not block. Two-gate presence (setup, development) and one beat involvement place it in functional mid-band, but lack of closure friction or visible sacrifice caps elevation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the core verb: the chapel reopens when matched stillness is achieved, the fresco vault is reopened every century, and "every map eventually reopens at its tear." Setup and development are clear; the action drives the interpretive turn and closure image. The reopening mechanism (stillness prerequisite) is irreplaceable and charges the final witness. Cost: Elara's acceptance that she will not live to see the parchment's edges knit. Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Minor swappability: "unlock" or "reveal" might substitute with edits, but "reopen" carries the cyclic, trust-based resonance the piece needs.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Comparing footage is introduced early (projector setup, frame-by-frame comparison) and drives the middle insight (lightning-bleached matching frame reveals the door paradox). The method is specific and irreplaceable—only time-lapse comparison could establish the door's change without human intervention. However, it does not appear in or shape the closure beat; once Elara enters the chapel, the footage mechanism is abandoned (projectors fill with water). Two-gate presence (setup, development) and one beat involvement place it solidly mid-band, but lack of closure participation prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault is setup, middle, and closure: rain "rinsing the world so it could speak," the vault's flaking frescoes revealing century-layered maps, and rain "washing the threshold clean" at the end. The setting supplies the interpretive metaphor (layers of story, secrecy kept by rain) and constrains Elara's understanding (she must match the vault's stillness). The stone bench and stormlight beam charge the closure. Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Cost connection: the vault's patience mirrors Elara's renunciation of immediate translation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "spot where a map tears" anchors the entire spatial and conceptual frame: the torn parchment divides known from unknown, aligns with the lintel shadow, and at closure "the edges knitted together in slow fiber-years she would not live to see." Setup and payoff are clear; the tear recurs with reweighted meaning. However, "timeframe" as clock or deadline is absent—the piece operates in contemplative present without urgent ticking. The tear functions more as spatial/conceptual threshold than temporal pressure. Lyric resonance (first line to closure) and charged reprise lift it into mid-band despite missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is stated early ("Her motivation was not conquest but empathy") and dramatized through Elara's frame-by-frame patience, her palm-press to stone, and her final choice to leave without translation. The motivation drives the stillness-matching insight and forecloses conquest tactics. Cost: renunciation of immediate understanding and carrying "no footage, only the shielded openness." Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Minor slip: the motivation is partly told rather than discovered through friction, and the empathy-compass line trends abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" as tone is present throughout: Elara's careful trust in maps' confessed limits, the rain "rinsing" rather than erasing, the chapel's "hush that curled inside her ribs," and the final "shielded openness of someone who has heard silence speak." Tone modulates with pressure (flickers during the footage comparison, settles during the chapel witness) and charges the closure image. The phrase itself appears only at the end, but the tonal stance (receptive yet protected, interpretive without conquest) is coherent across all beats. Three gates met; closure linkage is strong.</comment>
