<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is richly embodied through concrete actions—mapping dreams with chalk, unscrewing brass limbs, reading rings aloud—but her motivations remain abstract ("learn what trees witness"). The protagonist's final choice to return with "watering cans and quieter footsteps" feels decorative rather than earned by prior contradiction or cost. Internal conflict is muted: Mara proceeds methodically without meaningful hesitation or competing impulses that would deepen the stakes of her repair work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images (dreams as mercury beads, numbered trees, moonlight healing) that converge at closure when the sextant becomes a cedar. The closure unit qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the transformation from instrument to tree reweights the "quantified sorrow" premise with visible cost (the astronomer's tool is irrevocably lost, replaced by living witness). The pin-drop timeframe is seeded early and echoed at closure, though its causal function remains oblique. Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchor within the first two paragraphs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stormlit tower setting pressures action throughout: moonlight heals Mara's thumbnail and later refracts through the sextant's cracks to manifest spectral trees, directly enabling the transformation. Spatial choreography is precise (parapet, spiral stairs, corridor one floor below) and sensory detail—rain hissing, wind holding its breath—modulates with scene pressure. The tower's stones "drinking moonlight" and old mortar sealing cracks charge the final image of the cedar rooted in parapet stones, making the environment indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—deconstructing quantified sorrow to learn what trees witness—is signaled early and tightens as Mara maps dreams, lowers ambient sorrow by "measurable milligrams," and transforms the sextant. The piece achieves one meaningful deepening when she "understood then: the trees witness every calculation" and begins unscrewing brass limbs, an action that forecloses the instrument's return and carries visible cost (loss of the astronomer's tool). The pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is gradual rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sextant's transformation: the story interrogates how grief is quantified and whether witness can heal. The final image—a cedar "rings accumulating not sorrow but ordinary time"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The notebook's closing instruction "quantify nothing" reweights the astronomer's calculative approach with conceptual cost (his method broke under the burden). Subtext operates in the silence of trees, the pin as "bookmark in an unfinished story," and Mara's promise to listen rather than measure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices "split thumbnail," "canvas bag," "carpenter's chalk"—details filtered through her maintenance worker lens. Diction is elevated and lyric ("constellations of sorrow," "mundane miracles") but voice-motivated and consistent. The prose compresses beautifully under pressure: "Moonlight poured through the fractures, refracting into spectral trees" maintains clarity while charging the moment. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"dreams as beads of mercury," "tower's shadow became a second tower upside-down," "cones would roll down... like tiny sextants"—creating textural richness but occasionally stacking metaphors in adjacent sentences without breathing room (−0.4). The phrase "mundane miracles rearranged matter" and "Instructions for Future Repairs: apply moonlight, speak kindly, quantify nothing" edge toward thematic statement rather than image (−0.3). Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is strong. Some filter verbs ("she imagined," "she understood") could tighten under peak pressure, though voice motivation mitigates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—quantified sorrow stored in trees, released through moonlight repair—offers a fresh synthesis of fairy-tale logic and eco-grief. The sextant-to-cedar transformation feels inevitable in hindsight, seeded by the thumbnail-healing discovery and the astronomer's numbered-tree nightmare. The maintenance worker protagonist brings specificity (carpenter's chalk, drainage channel repair) that grounds the fantastical elements. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications to the cedar's future cones as "tiny sextants."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive all key turns: she sets the sextant on the parapet, maps dreams with chalk, aligns the broken sextant toward the moon, deconstructs it piece by piece, and reads rings aloud—each action narrows options and advances the transformation. Her final decision to return with watering cans closes the arc. Present in setup (climbing the tower), development (mapping and understanding), and payoff (the deconstruction and her vow to listen). Causal pressure is strong; the transformation would fail without her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sextant appears in setup (carried in the bag, "brass limbs twisted like a dead spider"), development (set on parapet, dreams clinging to metal, used as sightline for moonlight), and payoff (deconstructed limb by limb, transmuted into cedar). Handled across at least four beats; its broken state enables the moonlight refraction that manifests spectral trees. The transformation from measuring-grief instrument to living witness is irreplaceable and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow shapes stakes and tactics: Mara maps dreams to lower "ambient sorrow by measurable milligrams," assigns a "Sorrow Index 3.7," and the sextant breaks under the burden of trying to measure tree-grief. The concept pressures the middle action (mapping, labeling) and is visibly reweighted at closure when the notebook's final instruction reads "quantify nothing." Present in setup (broken sextant "quantified sorrow"), development (mapping and indexing), and payoff (rejection of quantification). Causal role is clear but the concept functions more as thematic frame than embodied constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Moonlight healing is seeded early (thumbnail knits closed), enables the key middle action (moonlight "poured through the fractures" to manifest trees), and completes the transformation (brass softens into wood under moonlight). The attribute constrains tactics: Mara must align the sextant toward the moon at night during the storm. Cost is visible—transformation requires the storm's withdrawal and the sextant's destruction. Present in all three gates; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Deconstruction is the central action: "unscrewing the brass limb by limb, laying each piece on the dream-grid where moonlight could heal it" triggers the transmutation. The act is prepared by mapping dreams and understanding tree witness, then executed in a sustained beat that drives the climax. Removing this action collapses the closure; no synonym could replace the specific dismantling of the grief-measuring instrument. Present in development and payoff; causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mapping scattered dreams is signaled early (Mara "began to map scattered dreams that clung to the metal"), its mechanics matter (chalk grid on stone, each bead lowers sorrow, dreams "brimmed" before alignment), and it enables the transformation by preparing the surface for moonlight healing. The method shapes two beats: the mapping itself and the final placement of brass on the dream-grid. Swappable with "collecting" or "capturing" at lower cost, but the grid's spatial constraint and the mercury-bead imagery give it specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The stormlit tower by moonlight is essential: moonlight heals (thumbnail, sextant), the storm provides rain and lightning that pressure the atmosphere, the parapet offers the stage for alignment and transformation, and the tower's stones "drink moonlight" to seal cracks. Setting enables the core action (moonlight must reach the sextant) and charges the final image (cedar rooted in parapet stones). Present in setup, development, and payoff; irreplaceable. The tower's corridor (where the pin drops, where the astronomer collapsed) adds layered meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pin-drop moment is seeded in the opening ("Tonight, at the moment a pin is heard"), dramatized mid-story ("she heard the pin drop—one floor below"), and echoed at closure ("the moment of the pin already dissolving into morning, yet the echo lingered"). It anchors the timeframe and adds symbolic weight (signal of collapse vs. bookmark), but does not tighten tactics or alter Mara's moves. The transformation proceeds independently of the pin's timing. Present in setup and payoff; lyric resonance is strong, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to discover what trees witness is stated in the opening and answered at closure when Mara "understood then: the trees witness every calculation humans make against them." It drives her to map dreams and deconstruct the sextant, seeking the answer. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or visible friction. No cost is attached to the discovery itself; Mara's choice to return and listen feels like natural extension rather than hard-won shift. Present in setup and payoff; functional but not deeply pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mundane miracles tone is established early ("moonbeam had knitted her split thumbnail closed") and sustained throughout: ordinary repair work (chalk, unscrewing brass) layered with fantastical transformation (dreams as mercury, brass becoming wood, cones as tiny sextants). The tone modulates subtly—storm urgency gives way to "hush" during transformation, then morning calm—and charges the final image: "mundane miracle waiting among the witnessing trees." Coherent across all beats and integral to the piece's lyric-accumulative method.</comment>
