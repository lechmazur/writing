<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ellery's grief-driven agency is embodied and contradictory—he conducts impossible music to "tend" memory, knowing it cannot restore Quinn. The moment he hears the giggle and chooses to kneel rather than pursue it demonstrates earned acceptance with visible cost. Minor slip: "macerate...hope shredding muscle" edges into anatomical overwrite that momentarily pulls focus from the emotional choice. The wife's surprised chuckle at the end completes the relational arc with felt change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Ellery accepts that "tending to the unspoken does not mean bringing the dead back; it means giving absence a shape echoing can carry," then places the pull-cord by the hourglass—a visible renunciation of resurrection fantasy with conceptual cost. The accumulative lens holds: density increases through tunnel acoustics, layered lullaby fragments, neighbors' porch lights, wife's chuckle, and the house exhaling "something very like a laugh." Orientation anchors clearly by line four (Ellery Kite, garage, post-loss timeframe). One meaningful deepening occurs when the sniffle becomes giggle, forcing Ellery to reframe his project from literal restoration to symbolic haunting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The echo-chamber tunnel constrains and charges the entire climax: its concrete acoustics enable the lullaby layering and the giggle's multiplication, and Ellery physically presses his palms to the wall to feel vibration travel "through stone into his bones." The pull-cord handle and hourglass function as micro-setting anchors that bookend the piece. Spatial choreography remains clean (garage → street → tunnel → home). Minor gap: the suburban houses and porch lights are gestured at but remain generic; one specific sensory anchor (dog breed, streetlight hum) would have lifted the neighborhood into lived particularity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore Quinn's laughter to break the house's silence—signals in paragraph two and tightens decisively when the tunnel returns only "engine, only echo, no bright marble laugh," forcing Ellery to shift from literal resurrection to symbolic tending. The pivot to "gentler, feeding fuel in measured sighs" narrows tactics under visible cost: he must renounce the fantasy and accept echo as sufficient haunting. The wife's chuckle and the house's exhale land the relational and atmospheric consequences on the page. Escalation coheres under the accumulative lens with no coincidence solving the problem; Ellery's agency—conducting, then kneeling, then placing the cord—drives each turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the empty hourglass, the cracked pull-cord, the tunnel's acoustic memory, and the final placement ritual answer "how do we tend absence?" without stating a moral. The line "tending to the unspoken does not mean bringing the dead back; it means giving absence a shape echoing can carry" risks exposition but is immediately dramatized by Ellery wrapping the cord and the house exhaling—embodied acts that reweight prior material. The tunnel as "organ pipe ready to sing" offers a resonant, non-literal closure image. No safety-hedging or thematic toggle; the piece commits fully to grief as ongoing presence rather than resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with tight psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "memory, he believed, could be tended, coaxed, maybe even restored" and "hope shredding muscle" reveal Ellery's internal idiom. Diction remains character-consistent even under peak stress ("macerated itself against his ribs" fits the mechanical-music frame). Minor register drift: "the afterimage of laughter, the way night sky holds the glow of a spent firework" reads slightly elevated for a grief-stricken father in a tunnel at night, though it stays within literary third-person bounds. No head-hopping; the wife's chuckle is observed from outside, preserving focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high: "He understood then that tending to the unspoken does not mean bringing the dead back; it means giving absence a shape echoing can carry" does triple work (realization, thematic hinge, tactic shift). Figurative language is vivid but occasionally stacks: "memory...could be tended, coaxed, maybe even restored," "heart macerated itself against his ribs, hope shredding muscle," and "laughter...like a rubber ball made of light" cluster within two paragraphs, risking density overload. "Mournfully eager" appears twice with identical phrasing (handle in graf 4, engine in final graf)—a minor loop. No causality breaks or major opacity; the closure beat remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief ritual, suburban acoustics, and industrial tool as instrument feels specific and non-obvious; the tunnel as collaborative organ transforms a familiar trope (man processing loss alone) through embodied action. The piece commits fully to its metaphor without retreat: Ellery's conducting, the tunnel's return of laughter, and the wife's response all grow from prior particulars. Minor proximity note: the empty hourglass marking death's moment has canonical resonance, though the 3:07 a.m. timestamp and pull-cord ritual particularize it. Risk-taking—lyric compression, minimal dialogue, accumulative closure—heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ellery's identity as "leaf-blower symphony conductor" frames expectation in graf 2, drives the tunnel performance (conducting with both arms, shaping noise into lullabies), and his final choice to place the pull-cord by the hourglass closes the arc. The role constrains his tactic (he uses the blower, not speech or another tool) and his conducting gesture under pressure embodies the stake. Present across setup, middle performance, and closure placement. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability high (the conductor frame charges every beat).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pull-cord handle appears in graf 4 ("cracked pull-cord handle...a thousand gusty crescendos"), graf 5 ("dangled, mournfully eager"), is yanked to start the blower in graf 8, swings "like a pendulum that had finished counting heartbeats" in graf 23, and is "laid...gently against [the hourglass's] glass belly" in the penultimate graf with the whispered charge "Keep it safe." Four distinct beats; early signal; closure participation with charged reprise and visible cost (renunciation of future use). The "mournfully eager" phrase recurs, reweighting from hopeful (Quinn's yank) to elegiac (finished counting).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Tending to the unspoken" is named explicitly in graf 7 ("memory...could be tended, coaxed, maybe even restored"), tested through the blower performance (graf 8–20), and restated with cost in graf 22 ("tending to the unspoken does not mean bringing the dead back; it means giving absence a shape echoing can carry"). The concept shapes Ellery's tactic shift from literal restoration to symbolic haunting and charges the final placement ritual. It narrows options (he cannot resurrect Quinn, only haunt the tunnel) and the cost is visible (he walks home without her, but with the echo). Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure moderate to high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" appears twice: graf 5 ("The handle dangled, mournfully eager, as if it still expected the small hands of his daughter Quinn to yank it awake") and graf 23 ("the tunnel waited, an organ pipe ready to sing whenever a mournfully eager engine...might pass through again"). The trait colors Ellery's perception of the tool and primes the reader for the elegiac tone, but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—it describes rather than drives. Setup and closure reprise present; middle development absent. Lyric resonance lifts it into mid-6s, but swappability ("sorrowful," "longing") and ornamental use cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Macerate" appears once in graf 15: "Ellery's heart macerated itself against his ribs, hope shredding muscle, because the sound was impossible and familiar." The image embodies Ellery's contradictory hope and sets up his choice to shift throttle settings in the next graf, but the action itself (heart macerating) is metaphorical interior state, not a plot turn. It colors one beat without driving escalation or closure. Introduced at midpoint; no closure participation. Functional but replaceable with "pounded," "tore," or similar visceral verbs. One beat involvement; causal pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The method is signaled in graf 10 ("shaping the noise into half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind, the only songs Quinn had let him sing") and executed across graf 11–18 (tunnel breathes "in broken lullaby," blower "whined into a lower register, a lullaby almost human"). The mechanics matter: Ellery's throttle adjustment and the tunnel's acoustics together produce the giggle. The method constrains his tactic (he cannot speak or sing directly; he must use the blower's off-key wind) and charges the closure (the tunnel remains "ready to sing whenever...a father's broken lullaby might pass through again"). Setup, development, payoff; causal pressure high; irreplaceability high (the lullaby frame is specific to Quinn's nightmares and cannot be swapped).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The "echo-chamber tunnel...a concrete throat where every sound lingered like a ghost" is introduced in graf 6, enables the entire climax (graf 8–21: "tunnel caught the mechanical howl and threw it back in layered chords," "tunnel played choir," "feeling the vibration...travel through stone into his bones"), and remains in the final image as "an organ pipe ready to sing." The setting's acoustic properties are irreplaceable—no other location could produce the layered lullaby or the giggle's multiplication—and constrain Ellery's choice of venue and tactic. Ellery walks to the tunnel, presses his palms to its wall, and the neighbors hear the spill from "both ends." Setup, development, payoff; causal pressure maximal; closure charge undeniable. The tunnel is the story's fulcrum.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final grain slips through the hourglass" is anchored in graf 1 ("3:07 a.m.") and graf 5 ("She had died in spring; the grass had grown long, then long again"). The temporal weight—months of silence, no audience except memory—pressures Ellery's choice to act tonight and charges the hourglass's return in the penultimate graf as a measure of elapsed grief. The time constraint is psychological (how long can the house hold silence?) rather than tactical (no literal countdown), but it tightens the dominant stake. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is implicit (the passage of "long, then long again" grass growth). Causal pressure moderate; cost tied to duration of loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "restore lost laughter to a household" is dramatized in graf 2 ("the house forgot how to laugh"), tested in graf 13–14 ("he heard something else: a faint, wet sniffle...the sound was impossible and familiar"), and reframed with cost in graf 22 ("tending to the unspoken does not mean bringing the dead back; it means giving absence a shape echoing can carry"). Ellery's choices—lifting the blower, walking to the tunnel, adjusting throttle, kneeling, placing the cord—are all driven by this desire, and the wife's "soft, surprised chuckle" in graf 27 lands partial success with visible cost (echo, not resurrection). Friction between want (Quinn back) and reality (only echo) charges every beat. Setup, development, payoff; causal pressure high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Tone coheres from "the house forgot how to laugh" through "every sound lingered like a ghost," "a sour orchestra tuning in the dark," "the tunnel itself seemed to breathe in broken lullaby," "a true haunting that would hum whenever wind passed through," to the house exhaling "something very like a laugh" and the tunnel waiting as "an organ pipe ready to sing." The haunting is neither horror nor mere metaphor—it is acoustic persistence with relational weight. Tone modulates with pressure: elegiac in setup, eerie when the sniffle appears, tender when Ellery kneels, and quietly hopeful when the wife chuckles. The final image ("a true haunting") names and charges the closure without breaking the established register. Coherent, pressure-responsive, and indispensable to the ending's effect.</comment>
