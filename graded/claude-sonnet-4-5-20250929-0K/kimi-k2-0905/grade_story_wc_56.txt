<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and shapes her actions throughout, but the late-act journals deliver resolution too cleanly without forcing a meaningful inner contradiction. The father's betrayal is discovered rather than wrestled with on the page. Interiority leans toward elevated summary ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies") that sounds more like authorial thesis than a character's lived perception under pressure. Captain Riga remains functional but one-dimensional, applying pressure without her own stake or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens—Mara decodes logbooks, finds coordinates, locates the bunker, reads journals—and holds it through closure. Orientation is prompt: canal, twilight, barge established early. The ending shift (sundial into crate, turning toward other cities) reads as Charged Poise with felt cost: relinquishing the heirloom and accepting a long dismantling mission. One objection: the journals appear conveniently intact and fully confess exactly what the plot needs, reducing friction at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The barge canal, fog, lanterns, and half-submerged bunker are vivid and purposeful. The sundial's gnomon with shell-fragment marks and the wax-sealed crate supply tactile, constraint-driven detail. Spatial choreography is clean: bow, deck, reedy cut all track. The canal as "a scar trying to heal" charges the final image without becoming heavy-handed. Micro-setting (the sundial, the crate) effectively stands in for broader geography at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the father's lies—is signaled early and pursued through logbook translation, coordinate discovery, and journal retrieval. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial coordinate matches the log's erased margin. The climax journals deliver full confession without forcing Mara to synthesize partial clues or make a trade-off, slightly flattening the peak. The cost at closure (relinquishing the sundial, committing to a long mission) is visible but arrives quickly after discovery.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—dismantling inherited lies—emerges from concrete action: erased logbook entries, the father's field journals, the sundial as complicit heirloom. "Architecture of lies" recurs but functions more as thesis label than earned image. The ending avoids moralizing and offers a resonant non-literal answer: Mara will read inscriptions aloud during morning radio silence, trusting "serene upheaval" to do patient work. The final image (wake as sentence, sundial's absence as new weight) reweights prior material without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("serene upheaval," "palimpsests of altered routes") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under canal-barge conditions. Riga's cigarette-and-command voice is sketched efficiently. The phrase "by the silence of morning radio" recurs as motif but reads slightly mannered. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or exposition dumps harm momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language ("whale that had mistaken war for ocean," "wake spreading like a sentence") sharpens key images. However, several beats exhibit template cadence and synonym churn: "serene upheaval" appears three times, "architecture of lies" twice, "silence of morning radio" thrice, creating a loop effect. "Thoughtfully clear" as an adverb + adjective pair feels constructed. Minor clarity slip: "meek obedience of something old that welcomed final purpose" anthropomorphizes the barge without clear motivation. Deduct −0.8 for patterned recurrence and register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The barge-as-archive and the pocket sundial holding a coordinate are fresh inflections on the inherited-lie premise. The synthesis of war memory, logbook palimpsest, and serene upheaval is specific and committed. However, the core arc—protagonist discovers parent's war crime via hidden documents—maps closely to a familiar template. The ending mission (reading inscriptions aloud) gestures toward bold risk but remains abstract rather than dramatized. Transformation is present but incremental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara is introduced in paragraph one as "errant legend seeker," frames her motivation in paragraph four, makes key choices (cross-check coordinate, ask Riga to beach, salvage crate, close sundial, redirect barge, plan future disembarkation). Three gates met; causal pressure across multiple beats; closure participation (she closes the sundial, redirects the barge). Not indispensable—another investigator archetype could perform similar moves—but her specific legend-seeker past and her decision to "train instincts" and then teach others elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sundial appears in paragraph one (heavy, twilight), paragraph five (gnomon tooth-marks, dent), paragraph six (light on numerals), paragraph twelve (angled toward moon, reveals coordinate), paragraph twenty-two (closed, slipped into crate with journals), paragraph twenty-five (absence as new weight). Five beats; early setup; causal middle (coordinate discovery); closure participation (relinquishment charges final image). Specificity high: the gnomon's dent and the scratched coordinate are irreplaceable. Scores ≥7.0 confirmed by visible cost (Mara lets it go).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hindsight clarity" is named in paragraph two, paragraph eighteen ("arrived not as lightning but as tide"), and implied in the logbook work and final realization. It shapes Mara's reflective stance and her slow-burn discovery method. However, it does not constrain a live choice or narrow options under pressure on the page; instead it describes the story's emotional texture. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle development weak. Functional but closer to atmosphere than tactic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears once in paragraph fifteen ("Riga saw the thoughtfully clear resolve in her eyes") and once in the final paragraph ("felt the sundial's absence as a new kind of weight—one that kept her upright, thoughtfully clear"). Label-only usage; no scene shows Mara making a choice because of clarity versus intuition or emotion. Introduced late (second half); no middle constraint; closure mention is summary. Cap 4.6 for missing setup; apply −0.4 for ornamental late reprise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Salvage" is named in paragraph two (legend seeker context), paragraph eight ("learning to read… salvaging truth"), paragraph seventeen ("Mara salvaged a rotting crate"), and paragraph twenty-three ("training instincts sharpened by salvage"). Early seed; drives the climactic retrieval (crate from water); closure participation (salvage as method for future missions). The crate salvage is the pivotal physical turn. Cost visible: wet journals, inherited mission. Irreplaceability high—"excavate" or "recover" would not carry the scavenger-historian flavor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Training instincts" is introduced in paragraph eight ("each evening, Mara trained her instincts by those logs") and returns in paragraph twenty-three ("training instinstincts sharpened by salvage, she would disembark…"). Two beats; early signal; closure linkage (method for future mission). However, the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page moment shows her instincts sharpening under test or enabling a choice the untrained could not make. Lyric reprise without middle constraint. Functional thematic bracket.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The canal is anchored in paragraph one (twilight, cool breath), supplies the barge journey and fog visuals (paragraph eleven), and the reedy cut destination (paragraph fifteen). The bunker's mouth and the listing deck are concrete. The canal as "scar trying to heal" charges the final sunrise image. Three gates; spatial choreography clean; closure participation strong. Not indispensable—a river archive or coastal warehouse could serve—but the canal's liminal, forgotten-war quality fits tone and stakes well.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Silence of morning radio" appears in paragraph three (Mara slips aboard by that silence), paragraph nine (logbook entry dated "the morning radio silence of 14 April"), paragraph fourteen (dawn "when morning radio still slept"), and paragraph twenty-three (future readings during that silence). Four touches; early setup; thematic payoff. However, it does not impose a live deadline or tighten a choice—time remains fluid and untracked. Atmospheric marker rather than tactical constraint. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; +0.2 for closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is stated in paragraph four ("to understand the architecture of lies"), dramatized through logbook decoding (paragraphs eight–ten), coordinate cross-check (paragraph thirteen), and journal reading (paragraph seventeen). Mara's choices (ask Riga to beach, open the sundial, salvage the crate, redirect the barge) all trace to this want. Closure reweights it from personal understanding to public dismantling mission. Three gates; causal pressure; visible cost (inherited mission, relinquished heirloom). High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named in paragraph six ("the serene upheaval that always preceded revelation—calm outside, quake within"), paragraph eleven ("serene upheaval made visible" in fog and lanterns), paragraph eighteen ("hindsight clarity arrived not as lightning but as tide"), and paragraph twenty-three ("letting serene upheaval do its patient work"). Tone is consistent and modulates with discovery beats. However, the phrase itself feels thesis-like and recurs as label rather than embodied perception. Closure participation strong (calm wake, patient work). Functional but slightly overexplained.</comment>
