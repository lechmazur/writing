<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—impatience as a "second heart rattling its cage," patience cooling into "a smooth, dark stone." Motives are clear: he must provide the exact instant for revolution, and his internal conflict between impatience and the role requiring patience drives micro-choices (waiting, kneeling, timing the compass press). The final renunciation (leaving the compass, walking away) forecloses his role with visible cost. Minor deduction for the litany feeling slightly on-the-nose, though it's immediately embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through moon-path observations and magnetic pulses until the spiral tightens to a keystone moment; closure lands as Charged Poise when Elian presses the compass and the lantern signal blinks—options crystallize, the revolution begins, impatience cools. Cost is legible: he leaves the compass as offering, his role complete. Orientation anchors (sanctuary, frozen lake, viaduct) arrive early. One small friction: the mechanics of how his mapping triggers the village signal remain slightly abstract, but the causal accumulation through observation→pattern→timing→signal holds under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, magnetic viaduct, and ice as "unwritten page" are vivid and purposeful. The viaduct's hum and polarity shifts constrain Elian's choices (when to kneel, when to press the compass); the ice's thickness matters for the pouch placement. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elian's professional lens (polarity like breath, moon ricochets). The compass on ice and the viaduct's spark-sheet charge the final image. Micro-setting (slate, compass, ice) functions as setting and pressures closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: provide the exact instant for a patient revolution. Pressure accumulates through moon-path deviations, viaduct pulse deepening, and the spiral tightening to a keystone point. The tightening is meaningful—Elian must wait for the precise instant or the revolution fails. Agency is renunciation and timing: he kneels, presses the compass, and leaves it as the revolution begins. Cost is visible: his impatience cools, his role ends, the coast will wake different. One beat of escalation (moon skews three degrees, pulse changes) plus the closure crystallization suffices for this length under the textural lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—patience as sculpted discipline, revolution as timed silence—emerges from concrete actions (mapping, waiting, kneeling) rather than assertion. The litany "sculpt patience from impatience, chip by chip" is repeated but then embodied as impatience cools into a carried stone. The final image (compass left on ice, coast waking different) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: change begins with a quiet map. Subtext operates in gesture (breathing on the pouch, kneeling) and the charged reprise of impatience/patience. No moralizing; complexity held without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; distance remains consistent. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated—"dropped mirror," "coin balanced on a wire," "reverse snowfall"—and the perceptual signature (tracking ricochets, reading polarity like breath) is character-specific. Syntax modulates with pressure: shorter clauses as the moon climbs, longer reflection earlier. Minor friction: a few metaphors ("twin heart of impatience," "lung full of frost") approach decorative density in adjacent lines without full payoff, though they remain legible and coherent. No head-hopping; interior access clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (moon paths, viaduct pulse, spiral tightening all advance). Figurative language is dense—"moon's single silver eye," "train of reverse snowfall," "horizon mapper"—and mostly coherent, but in the middle third ("stone answered only with silence and the slow drip of thawwater," "lake cracked its knuckles") a few stock gestures and near-paraphrase appear. Opening and closing lines are strong; no loops or scaffolding in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion hold; minor deduction for metaphor density without full pattern-teaching in one passage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Horizon mapper" guiding a magnetic revolution by moon-path tracking is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis. The premise—revolution as patient timing rather than storm—transforms familiar material through specific detail (basalt, polarity, graphite slate). Elian's role (not warrior or orator, but the one who gives the instant) and the closure image (compass left on ice, lanterns blinking, sparks drifting) feel inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative pressure, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Authentic vision coheres across voice, subject, and style.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elian (vigilant horizon mapper) is present from line one. His observation-driven choices—tracking moon paths, noting the tremor, timing the compass press—create the key turn at closure. Setup early, development through mapping choices, payoff when he presses the compass and the signal blinks. Causal pressure: his role is to give the exact instant, and he does. Cost tied to the character: he leaves the compass, his impatience cools, his role ends. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magnetic viaduct after rain appears early (thawwater drip from viaduct) and recurs: its hum and polarity shifts are tracked across three beats (initial hum, pulse deepening, final spark-sheet). Development: the viaduct's field tremor shapes Elian's mapping and timing. Payoff: sparks drift down as the signal blinks, and his compass surrenders. Cost connection: the viaduct's buckling will blackout towers, and Elian's timing depends on its pulse. Specific mechanics matter; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Patient revolution is signaled early ("revolution begins long before the first shout; it begins as a pattern you almost ignore") and shapes stakes on the page: Elian must wait for the exact instant or the revolution fails "if launched a breath too soon." Development: his mapping and waiting enact patience versus impatience. Payoff: the lantern signal blinks, the coast will wake "changed not by storm but by the quiet map." The concept alters tactics (waiting, timing) and charges the closure image. Specific and felt.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" as attribute appears in one key phrase ("drawing softly purposeful lines") and is embodied throughout: Elian's actions are restrained yet deliberate (kneeling, breathing on the pouch, pressing the compass at the precise instant). Setup implicit early, development through his waiting and timing, payoff in the closure where wildness is "restrained...honoring the boundary." Visible tradeoff: he must suppress impatience to give the exact instant. Could be more explicitly tied to cost in a single choice; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears late but transforms prior material: "unyoke the coast from the capital's clockwork." Setup through the revolution premise, development through mapping that will "blackout relay towers," payoff when the viaduct sparks and the coast wakes different. The action redefines options: breaking the capital's control is the revolution's purpose. Cost: Elian's role is to enable this unyoking, and he completes it. Specific verb; irreplaceable for the political stakes. Late arrival reduces score slightly but transformation and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is signaled early ("began tracking moon paths the way his mother once followed shoreline birds: not the direct beam, but the ricochets") and its mechanics shape attempts: he transfers after-images to slate, notes the moon path skewing three degrees, and waits for the moon to reach the spiral's eye. Development: the method reveals the tremor and timing. Payoff: "At the precise instant the moon balanced on the rail's highest curve, Elian pressed his compass." Essential across beats; irreplaceable for the closure timing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary by a frozen lake is anchored in the opening line and recurs across beats: Elian steps outside onto snow-crust, walks to the lake's center where ice is thickest, kneels to set the pouch. Development: the lake's surface as "unwritten page" and the sanctuary's cold stone frame his waiting. Payoff: the sanctuary roof's glass bell rings, and the ice holds the compass offering. The setting constrains his movements (walking on ice, kneeling) and charges the closure image. Essential and specific.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the lake freezes over" is signaled early ("He had arrived after the lake froze over, as the elders instructed") and tracks across nights: "Three midnights ago," "On the seventh night," "When dawn crept over the horizon." Development: the frozen state enables his ice-walking and the moon-path tracking window. Payoff: the timing culminates at the precise instant when the moon balances. The timeframe tightens decisions (must wait for the exact moment) and alters tactics. Specific and felt.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to sculpt patience from impatience" is signaled early via the litany and embodied throughout: impatience as a "second heart rattling its cage," the struggle to wait, and the final cooling into "a smooth, dark stone he could carry." Development: the motivation drives his choice to keep mapping despite impatience. Payoff: "feeling impatience finally cool into the shape he had sought." Friction between wants (to act now) and costs (revolution fails if too soon) is visible. Essential and charged.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tone "restrained wildness" is coherent from the opening ("vigilant," "cold stone") through peak pressure ("restrained wildness honoring the boundary between beauty and burn") to the ending (leaving compass, coast waking "different...by the quiet map"). The tone modulates with pressure: reflection early, compressed perception as moon climbs, charged stillness at closure. The viaduct's spark-sheet and glass bell exemplify restrained wildness. The tone charges the final image (quiet map, not storm). Indispensable for the concept and closure effect.</comment>
