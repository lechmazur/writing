<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation is clear and her "helix-minded" trait shows in her tinkering and recursive planning. The piece offers concrete embodied detail ("boots grinding red grit," "blood threading from her hairline") and her contradictory impulses appear in the phrase "each twitch of the wrench both error and correction." However, interiority leans toward poetic description rather than genuine internal conflict; the arc from attempt to failure to resolve feels more like a prescribed pattern than earned struggle. The final smile and immediate pivot to "already modifying tomorrow's helmet" arrives without sufficient on-page cost to her stance or self-concept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates densely layered images and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Mara removes the helmet, finds sketches she didn't draw, and commits to return—a crystallized stance with felt cost (failed extraction, bloodied, burned-out mirror). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (canyon, moonlight, engineer). One meaningful deepening occurs when the moon shifts angle and engines collapse, forcing her back into singular flesh. Minor causality question: the sketches in her pockets feel retroactively convenient rather than earned by prior perception beats, softening the closure's logical grip.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon functions as an active constraint: moonlight angle calibrates the mirror, quartz veins hold entangled memories, and the moon's shift collapses the attempt. Sensory selection is purposeful—lunar silver, cold light, red grit—and filtered through Mara's engineer lens. The broken periscope mirror and the canyon's fracture-state pressure her choice and charge the final image when new seams crack open. Spatial choreography (rim, lip, chasm below) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: extract entangled worker dreams to resurrect them as machines. One clear tightening occurs when the moon slides and the mirror's angle fails, collapsing the engines mid-assembly—an on-page reversal driven by environmental constraint. Agency is present but muted: Mara calibrates, activates, then endures collapse; the final choice to return with better tools feels more like default persistence than a trade-off that forecloses a live option. The cost (bloodied, burned mirror) is visible but does not visibly alter her stance or narrow future paths on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—resurrection of abandoned potential, recursion, transformation—emerges through the canyon-as-archive conceit and Mara's iterative method. The final image (new quartz seams, kept hunger, walking the rim) offers a resonant non-literal answer without stating a moral. "Chaotically precise" recurs purposefully and the sketches she draws unknowingly reweight the failure. However, phrases like "archaeology of abandoned dreams" and "transformation never ceased" veer toward overt thematic declaration rather than letting particulars speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited and the prose carries a distinct lyric-technical texture ("copper lace," "helix mind," "turbines bud in her marrow"). Distance is consistent except for one line—"the phrase the townsfolk spat when they saw her inventions walk backward"—which assumes community knowledge not dramatized and feels like authorial intrusion. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("fruition," "synaptic plasticity gone feral") that, while voice-motivated, strains plausibility for real-time perception under extreme stress. No dialogue present; internal voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme and sustained throughout high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching that pays off at closure: "chasm breathed cold light," "periscope mirror abandoned by some giant," "synaptic plasticity gone feral," "engines mid-birth clattered to dust." Mixed metaphors appear ("cold fire," "mercury seeking its old shape," "turbines bud in her marrow") that dilute clarity. Several lines loop or paraphrase: "chaotically precise" recurs identically three times, and the final paragraph restates "transformation" and "archaeology" without added pressure. Template cadence in the dream-sequence section ("a boy wanting… a woman sketching… a man humming") and stacked present participles flatten rhythm. Applying artifact penalties: density without payoff −0.6, mixed metaphor −0.4, paraphrase loop −0.2, total deduction ~−1.2 from a baseline mid-7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—mining consortium piping worker dreams into quartz as quantum coolant, engineer using salvaged periscope mirror to retrieve them—is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its science-fantasy premise and follows implications (angle precision, synaptic rewiring, engine assembly from drill-bit shards). However, the transformation-through-pain arc and the determined-inventor-will-try-again resolution follow familiar templates. The dense figurative overlay sometimes substitutes for grounded causal detail, and the "chaotically precise" refrain, while thematically apt, becomes a decorative label rather than a lived constraint that alters a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara frames the opening, calibrates the helmet (a decision with felt stakes), activates the device, experiences collapse, removes the helmet, and resolves to return—present across setup, middle crisis, and ending. Her choice to press forward despite calibration difficulty and her choice to tear the helmet free are on-page decisions that alter tactics and outcome. However, her final resolve feels like default persistence rather than a trade-off that forecloses an alternate path, limiting indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The broken periscope mirror appears in setup (unpacked, described with angle stakes), middle (flares at activation, feeds moonlight into cortex), and ending (lies dark, silver burned out). Its fractured state and angle precision constrain the attempt and its failure directly causes collapse. The mirror's "wolf tooth" jagged quality and shift from silver flare to darkness reweight its meaning across beats. Strong causal role in two beats and closure linkage, though the specific periscope provenance (submarine graveyard) remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Entangled memories are seeded early (worker reveries piped into quartz, quantum drill shatter), shape the middle beat (Mara becomes every miner, memories twist helical and rewire her), and drive the attempt's mechanics. The concept enables her to raise drill-bits and assemble engines, a causal pressure point. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"entanglement" is asserted more than demonstrated through specific rule or constraint that Mara must navigate. Present across beats with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Chaotically precise" is introduced early as childhood déjà vu (screwdrivers turn left when meant right), recurs as townsfolk epithet, and frames her calibration ("each twitch both error and correction"). It colors her method but does not visibly constrain a choice with cost; she succeeds at calibration and the failure stems from the moon's movement, not from her trait causing a mistake. The attribute is more thematic label than on-page lever. Present with moderate involvement but limited causal bite.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Modify" appears in setup (Mara's intent to modify her circuitry), executes at the helmet activation (cold fire, synaptic rewiring, turbines budding), and recurs at closure ("already modifying tomorrow's helmet inside her helix mind"). The act of modification drives the peak beat and the ending stance. The stakes—overwrite motor cortex versus map buried wishes—are tied directly to this action. Strong presence and causal centrality; not easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Synaptic plasticity is seeded early ("synaptic plasticity gone feral" enables mirror-to-cortex feed), powers the middle transformation ("Through synaptic plasticity the dreams rewired her"), and the vial of synthetic neurotrophin signals the method. It enables the rewiring but remains more mechanism-assertion than a rule Mara must tactically manage. Present across setup and peak, with moderate causal role, but the mechanics do not constrain her choices in a way that generates visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The moonlit canyon is present throughout: lip/rim stage Mara's position, the chasm's quartz veins hold the memories, fractures reflect lunar silver and guide calibration, the canyon "answers" when engines rise, and new seams crack open at closure. Moon angle (zenith, then slide) directly controls success/failure. The setting's geometry and light actively pressure the attempt and charge the final image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "period of profound transformation" is mentioned in the opening (planetary alignment, corporate collapse, memory-erasing auroras) but these elements do not constrain Mara's actions or tighten decisions on the page. The moon's movement provides a live clock for the activation beat, but the broader transformation period remains backdrop. Setup presence, minimal middle constraint, no closure participation. Mostly ornamental context.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams" is stated early, dramatized through her calibration and activation, and reaffirmed at closure ("her archaeology of light"). The desire drives the attempt and shapes her resolve to return. However, internal friction is limited—she never questions whether these dreams should be resurrected or weighs competing wants. The motivation is consistent and central but not conflicted in choices. Present across beats with clear but uncontested linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone blends technical precision with lyric intensity: "cold fire," "quaking through her muscles," "reverie," "helical" recursion. The piece modulates from measured setup through sensory peak ("suddenly she was every miner") to quieter charged resolve. "Quaking" recurs in the final line as "the reverie that still quaked through her muscles," reweighting the opening's "quaking reverie." Coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative lens, though the extreme figurative density occasionally obscures rather than charges pressure.</comment>
