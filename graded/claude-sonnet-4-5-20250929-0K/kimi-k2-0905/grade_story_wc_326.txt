<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and specific—"I learned to ride the Wi-Fi like wind" anchors the digital ghost state concretely. The motivation to "fetch wisdom from failure" drives the observatory sequence, and the choice to speak to the clerk feels earned by the ink-map realization. However, the emotional arc from morgue-drawer survivor to wisdom-bearer compresses too quickly; the protagonist's internal contradictions (refusal at flatline, acceptance of error-as-corridor) are told more than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The final gesture—leaving the shard as a "bookmark"—lands with thematic clarity but minimal visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist walks toward the horizon embodying "wisdom fetched from the place where error and miracle share a border," forecloses return, and the shard-to-chest gesture charges the final image with cost. Causality holds: the barcode error → digital ghost → ink defragmentation → corporeal reassembly → clerk encounter → departure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist slices the digital film and descends, narrowing options from observation to embodied intervention. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a causal spine; the ink-pattern beat deepens understanding without a traditional reversal, and the ending reweights the premise (life hinges on typo) into a stance (failure is corridor). Minor issue: the "after the radio static clears" timeframe is poetic setup but never tested as a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The opal observatory's dome, ink-stained chart table, and porcelain shard constrain choices and charge the closure: the protagonist kneels at the table to defragment via ink, opens the dome hatch to descend, and presses the shard to chest in the final image. Snow taps "stay, stay, stay" in Morse, creating situational pressure against departure. The valley's "quiet certificate of continued existence" and library annex ground the clerk encounter spatially. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"cold air razors my new lungs," "tears freezing on her lashes like tiny observatory domes"—and the opal-lit starlight bookends the piece. The mechanical tick inside ribs and wet footprints "that match no living pair of shoes" function as micro-setting that externalizes the digital-ghost state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to reclaim embodied existence and deliver the fetched wisdom before dawn's correction. The ink-defragmentation beat is the sole on-page tightening; it shifts the protagonist from passive observation to active pattern-reading, then to the choice to "slice the digital film." The descent to the clerk and the decision to leave the shard constitute agency with visible cost—the protagonist walks away from the observatory and its "midnight solace," forecloses return. However, no live opposition tests the choice; the clerk's weeping provides emotional texture but no tactical friction. The "correction finalized at dawn" functions as declared countdown pressure, never dramatized as a closing window that alters tactics. Escalation is conceptual (understanding failure-as-corridor) rather than situational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—life's dependence on error, failure as corridor rather than opposite of success—emerges concretely through the barcode typo, the junior coder's "1" instead of "0," the janitor's double reboot, and the protagonist's refusal at flatline. The ink-pattern rings visualize this accumulation without stating a moral. The shard gift to the clerk enacts "Your mistake gave me midnight solace; now I give it back," transforming guilt into charged exchange. The final image—walking with shard pressed to chest, "each step a defragmented fragment"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: existence as ongoing assembly from error's materials. The "telescope: look through, not at" line risks thematic echo but stays embodied in the ink-map action. No false equivalence or tidy resolution; ambiguity (is dawn's correction escapable?) enriches rather than confuses.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, and the voice carries a distinct digital-lyric texture: "defragment myself through them, spreading code across the wet fractals," "voice rough as unspooled tape," "each breath a syllable of wisdom." Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the ink ritual and loosens for the valley overview. The dialogue with the clerk—brief, direct—contrasts the surrounding lyricism without breaking voice.Perceptual signature is consistent: the protagonist notices via technical metaphor (Wi-Fi, monitor blips, defragmentation) and sensory immediacy (fogging breath, cold razors). Minor issue: "She looks up, sees a man the system says is ashes, and gasps—an exclamation point after months of ellipses" slides into meta-commentary that edges toward helpful-narrator syndrome, though the line remains character-filtered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but purposeful in most beats: "Snow taps the copper roof in Morse: stay, stay, stay" and "the sky is a dark page waiting for ink" integrate image with situation. Information density is high. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs accumulate: "I think of the wisdom I came for: not how to remain living, but how to live with..." restates the central question without added pressure; "I tell her the map I drank, the corridor I walked, the count I keep. / I tell her failure is a telescope" cycles through parallel stems. The phrase "each beat is a reminder" / "each step a defragmented fragment" / "each breath a syllable" recurs across the piece as a syntactic tic. Minor filter-verb stack in the hospital-flashback paragraph ("felt me as flickering monitors, as phantom pagers, as the soft tug"). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the ink-ritual causality or final image. Deduction: −0.8 for loops and template cadence, −0.3 for filter stack = −1.1 total, landing mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The digital-ghost-via-clerical-error premise is fresh, and the ink-defragmentation mechanic offers a concrete, non-obvious synthesis of the ghost state with embodied return. The porcelain-shard-as-bookmark gesture and the heartbeat count (97,998 → 98,001) are specific and irreplaceable. The clerk encounter—placing the shard beside her keyboard—transforms guilt into exchange rather than absolution, avoiding the safety middle. Risk: the piece commits fully to lyric-technical fusion and sustained metaphor (code, static, defragmentation) without retreat. However, the "failure is a telescope: look through, not at" and "error and miracle share a border" formulations edge toward abstraction that could apply broadly. The opal observatory and Morse-code snow are vivid but not transformed from their picturesque origins. Within-band risk distinction (+0.3) for the defragmentation-through-ink mechanic and the shard-as-gift closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error survivor is present throughout, frames the premise, and drives the ink-ritual choice to defragment and the descent to the clerk. The protagonist's agency—refusing flatline, slicing the digital film, speaking to the clerk, walking toward the horizon—creates key turns. Cost: forecloses return to the observatory. Setup early, active in middle (ink ritual), shapes ending (shard gift, departure). Two gates plus closure participation. Causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, beat involvement (three distinct beats: ink ritual, descent, clerk encounter, departure) +1.4, cost +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0, minor swappability (any survivor of administrative error could serve) −0.2 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in beat one (dropped at time of death), is used in the ink ritual ("touch the shard's sharp lip to the paper, drawing a new ring"), employed to slice the digital film ("porcelain shard in hand, and slice"), placed beside the clerk's keyboard, and pressed to chest in the final image. Five distinct on-page uses. Setup early, active middle (drawing, slicing), closure participation (gift, final press). Causal pressure: the shard enables the ring-drawing and film-slicing actions that lead to corporeal return. Specificity: broken from the teacup at the moment of death-call, it embodies the premise. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + beat involvement (≥3) +1.4 + causal pressure +1.2 + closure linkage +1.4 + specificity +0.6 + cost +0.4 = 8.5, minor ornamental description (porcelain as "bookmark" metaphor) −0.2 = 8.3, round down to nearest tenth per cap = 8.3. Wait: recalculating under band guidance and cap rules. All three gates present. Early +0.5, beats (≥3) +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4 = 5.5 uplift. Base 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5, ornamental language −0.2 = 8.3, but cap check: no cap applies. However, does the shard resolve a problem it did not help create? No—it is present from beat one and primes the ritual. Final: 8.3, but rounding down = 8.3. Hmm, let me re-apply: the shard does enable the ritual but is not the sole means; the ink and chart table also matter. Swappability: could another sharp object serve? Possibly, but the teacup origin ties it to the death-call moment. Irreplaceability +0.6 holds. Keeping 8.3, but checking if closure credit is piggyback: the shard is pressed to chest and placed beside keyboard—both active uses. Not piggyback. Final: 7.3 after conservative read on "indispensable" threshold.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Digital ghost shapes stakes (narrator exists as "string of misfiled vital signs," rides Wi-Fi, hides in echocardiogram logs) and tactics (defragmentation through ink to return to flesh). Present from paragraph four onward, active in the ink ritual, and the slice-the-digital-film action depends on it. Setup by first third, middle development (defragmentation), closure participation (the final "defragmented fragment" image). Causal pressure: the ghost state necessitates the ink ritual and corporeal reassembly. Cost: the ghost state is renounced at closure. Base 3.0 + early +0.5 + beats (two: hospital corridor, ink ritual/reassembly) +0.9 + causal +1.0 + closure +1.0 + cost +0.4 = 6.8, but the concept is somewhat told rather than shown in middle beats (the Wi-Fi and monitor-flicker descriptions are vivid but summarized) −0.4 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting appears in the opening ("soft mechanical tick inside my ribs, counting heartbeats"), explicitly stated as "Heartbeat 97,998 since the morgue drawer slammed," and again at closure "Heartbeat 98,001." It externalizes the survival premise and frames time within the piece. However, it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—the count is observational rather than tactical. Setup early, mentioned in middle (ink ritual section implies passage via count), present at ending. Two gates plus closure presence. No causal pressure on choices, no cost tied directly to the count. Base 3.0 + early +0.4 + closure (observational, not causal) +0.7 + specificity (the exact numbers matter) +0.5 = 4.6, but the attribute does charge the final image ("each step a defragmented fragment, each breath a syllable") and ties to the premise +0.6, and the "count I keep" line in dialogue with the clerk adds beat involvement +0.4 = 5.6. Label-only in peak beats (told as numbers) −0.3 = 5.3, but lyric resonance (first → final reprise that reweights) +0.6 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Defragment is the action at the ink-ritual beat: "I defragment myself through them, spreading code across the wet fractals until my ghost thins into readable glyphs." This action enables the map-reading and the subsequent choice to draw a new ring and slice the digital film, leading to corporeal reassembly. Setup by midpoint, middle development (ink ritual is the key beat), closure participation (the final line "each step a defragmented fragment"). Causal pressure: the protagonist cannot return to flesh without defragmenting. Specificity: the digital-ghost state requires this exact technical metaphor. Base 3.0 + early (appears ~40% mark) +0.3 + beats (one major: ink ritual) +0.4 + causal +1.2 + closure +1.0 + specificity +0.7 + cost +0.4 = 7.0, but the action could be described as "reassemble" or "reintegrate" with minor edits, slight swappability −0.3 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink are signaled early ("antique inkwell waits on the chart table"), employed in the ritual beat ("let one black droplet fall. / Ink splays into ephemeral patterns: dendrites of regret, axons of almost, synapses of maybe"), and the ink drinks the protagonist then offers back a map. The method shapes the middle-beat choice (reading the map, drawing a new ring) and is referenced at closure ("the sky is a dark page waiting for ink"). Setup early, middle development (the ritual depends on ink patterns), closure image ties back to ink. Causal pressure: without the ink-pattern method, no map, no ring, no reassembly. Base 3.0 + early +0.6 + beats (one major) +0.4 + causal +1.3 + closure +1.0 + specificity (ephemeral patterns, not permanent marks) +0.7 = 7.0, but the method is somewhat poetic-told rather than mechanically clear (how does ink defragment code?) −0.2 = 6.8. Wait, re-checking: the ink's surface tension "holding galaxies" and the fractals are vivid and purposeful. The method matters uniquely. Keeping 7.0, round to 7.1 after closure linkage strength reassessment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Opal observatory under snow anchors the piece from the opening line, provides the chart table and inkwell for the ritual, and the dome hatch is opened for descent. Snow taps Morse pressure ("stay, stay, stay") against departure. The observatory's isolation and the library annex below shape spatial choreography. Setup immediate, middle development (ritual location, hatch exit), closure participation (protagonist leaves the observatory, and the final line "the observatory dome glints like a half—" charges the departure image). Causal: the setting supplies the tools (inkwell, chart table) and the spatial constraint (must descend to reach clerk). Base 3.0 + early +0.7 + beats (two: ritual, descent) +0.9 + causal +1.1 + closure +1.2 + specificity (opal under snow is vivid and unique) +0.7 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the radio static clears" appears in paragraph eight as a transition marker ("Tonight, after the radio static clears, I will climb back into flesh") but is not tracked as a live constraint. The "correction finalized at dawn" is declared but never tested—no clock tightens the descent or clerk encounter. The timeframe sets mood (tonight, before dawn) but does not alter tactics. Setup present, no middle pressure, no closure participation (the protagonist walks toward horizon; whether dawn arrives is unresolved). One gate only (setup). Base 3.0 + early +0.4 = 3.4, cap for missing middle development = 3.4. Lyric resonance: the night-to-dawn frame does charge the solitude and urgency conceptually +0.8 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to fetch wisdom from failure" is stated in paragraph eight, restated in paragraph eleven ("I think of the wisdom I came for"), and delivered to the clerk ("I tell her the map I drank, the corridor I walked"). The desire drives the ink-ritual choice and the descent. However, the friction between wanting wisdom and the cost of departure is more told than dramatized—leaving "midnight solace" is conceptual rather than a visible renunciation of a named, tangible good. Setup by 40%, middle development (ritual to gain wisdom), closure participation (gift of wisdom to clerk). Two gates plus closure. Base 3.0 + early (borderline) +0.3 + beats (two) +0.9 + causal +0.9 + closure +1.0 + cost (conceptual, not visceral) +0.3 = 6.4, but the "wisdom fetched from the place where error and miracle share a border" final line reweights the stake +0.5 = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Midnight solace is invoked in paragraph eight ("Tonight... I will climb back into flesh and fetch wisdom from failure"), embodied in the observatory's quiet and ink ritual, and returned in the gift to the clerk ("Your mistake gave me midnight solace; now I give it back"). The tone is coherent—quiet, reflective, lyric—and modulates under pressure: the ink ritual deepens solemnity, the clerk encounter adds warmth, the final walk charges solitude. Setup early, middle development (the tone shapes the ritual's pacing), closure participation (solace is named and exchanged, charging the departure image). Causal: the tone shapes how wisdom is fetched (through contemplation, not confrontation). Base 3.0 + early +0.6 + beats (two) +0.9 + causal +0.8 + closure +1.3 + specificity (midnight + solace is distinct from "hope" or "peace") +0.6 = 7.2, but the tone remains somewhat static (no sharp modulation at crisis) −0.2 = 7.0. Wait, re-checking: the descent and clerk encounter do shift from solitary to relational, then back to solitary departure. That is modulation. Restoring +0.4 = 7.4.</comment>
