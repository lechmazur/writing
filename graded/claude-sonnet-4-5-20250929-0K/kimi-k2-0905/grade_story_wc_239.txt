<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The witness remains a cipher throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion, no micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists entirely of abstract meditation ("the cosmic illusion was not that things end, but that endings are separate from beginnings") without character-particular texture. The final "tipping" into self-puncture reads as metaphysical assertion rather than earned change rooted in prior causality. No visible cost forecloses a path; the protagonist drifts through predetermined spiritual stations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words: who this witness is, where precisely she stands, when this occurs within any stake-driven timeline. The "universe's hiccup" functions as handwave rather than constraint. No causal linkage—she arrives, wanders, kneels, exits—each beat could be reordered without altering outcome. The closure ("the curve unifies") is asserted conceptually but lacks visible cost or a before/after that changes options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The temple library supplies vivid images—cracked basalt, flapping pages, spiral floor—but none constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography (seven steps left, three forward, two diagonal) reads as ornamental pattern rather than lived navigation. The dictionary's physical transformation (pages drifting, cover bulging) charges the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the environment itself remains postcard backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"unravel cosmic illusions"—is declared but never tested by a reversal or forced trade-off. No tightening: the witness proceeds through each station (opening dictionary, walking spiral, kneeling) without opposition or cost that narrows options. The "final walk" sequence asserts deepening but dramatizes no agency, renunciation, or price. Coincidence (the hiccup, the self-shelving library) drives all movement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—endings and beginnings unified—emerges clearly through the spiral image and the dictionary's recursive closure. The final line "here, the curve unifies" offers conceptual repricing, but it arrives as philosophical label rather than earned from concrete particulars. The motif of "spiral arbitration" recurs but never constrains a choice; it's named, not dramatized. No counter-reading is invited; the thesis is stated outright in paragraph eleven.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register and a distinct perceptual signature—"resounding hush that tasted of starlight and dust"—throughout. POV remains stable (close third), and the narrator's way of noticing (abstractions rendered as sensory events) is coherent. However, no dialogue appears, and under peak pressure the diction stays ornamental rather than compressing to match urgency. Psychic distance never modulates; the witness observes herself with the same detached lyricism at every beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density in nearly every sentence—words "corkscrew," shelves "bow inward like accretion disks," memories "slide down the curve"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops: "the witness is the witnessed" echoes "she saw herself multiplied into every observer" without added pressure. Template cadence in paragraphs 4–7 (repeated "She [verb]" openers). Stock metaphors ("pregnant universe," "ants of ink") muddle clarity. Sentence rhythm is algorithmically lyric rather than modulating with scene needs. Information density is low; many lines restate the same cosmic-unity thesis.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—cartographer of endings in a collapsing library—echoes widely used writing-prompt templates (librarian/archivist in metaphysical space). The spiral motif and dictionary-as-universe are familiar symbolic moves. No transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; the witness's journey is a meditation tour rather than a choice-driven arc. The final image (shelving the library inside herself) is poetic but predictable given the setup. Derivative premise penalty (−0.8) applies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "end of history witness" is present throughout and named early, but she makes no decisions that alter tactics. Observation without agency dominates; she wanders, opens, kneels, stands—all passive receipt of mystical process. The role functions as thematic label rather than driver of key turns. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The softcover dictionary is handled in three beats: arrival (pages flutter), mid-story (word corkscrews off page), and climax (laid on axis, closes itself). Its transformation (swallowing alphabets, bulging cover) drives the spiral's mechanics and charges the closure image. Early signal, causal involvement, closure linkage present. However, it resolves a metaphysical problem it did not help create; the witness's stake exists before she opens it. Strong integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Spiral arbitration" is named in paragraph eight and defined ("every contradiction must orbit a common center"), but it never constrains an on-page choice. The witness does not practice arbitration; she surrenders to it. The concept is thematic echo rather than tactical method. Present, coherent, but swappable with any meditative-unity metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" appears in paragraph four as a label for her patterned steps (seven left, three forward, two diagonal). The trait does not enable or constrain later action; the steps themselves are ornamental choreography without cost. Label-only mention, no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Unify" is the explicit goal and recurs in the closure line ("the curve unifies"). The witness's actions—walking the spiral, pressing her forehead to the book—gesture toward unification, but the story could function identically if her goal were "to dissolve" or "to merge." The action is thematic rather than causally distinct. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Journeying inward while walking out" is signaled in paragraph seven and enacted in the final walk (paragraphs sixteen–seventeen). The method shapes the closure beat—"walking outward while remaining at the still center"—and the spiral's narrowing lane embodies the paradox. Two-beat involvement, closure linkage, but the mechanics are asserted rather than tested under pressure. Mid-band for thematic reprise without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is named early and supplies vivid details (cracked basalt, shelves that sing, marble floor). It provides the spiral axis and the dictionary's resting place, shaping the closure choreography. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; any metaphysical space would serve. Present across beats, closure-adjacent, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Universe's hiccup" is named in paragraph two and bookends the story (paragraph eighteen: "the hiccup ended"). It functions as framing device but never tightens decisions or tracks elapsed time. The witness has no clock; actions unfold in dreamlike sequence without urgency. Present at setup and closure, but vague and untethered to tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To unravel cosmic illusions" is stated in paragraph five and revisited in paragraph eleven ("the cosmic illusion was not that things end…"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized in choice; no friction between desire and cost appears on the page. The witness pursues the goal without obstacle or internal conflict. Declared but not embodied under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" opens and closes the story and recurs in paragraphs twelve–thirteen. The tone is coherent throughout—meditative, hushed, gravity-laden—and modulates subtly (brightens in paragraph fifteen, deepens in paragraph twelve). It charges the final image ("the hush swallowed its own echo"). Three-beat presence, closure linkage, tonal consistency. Strong integration, though the static mood limits top-band eligibility.</comment>
