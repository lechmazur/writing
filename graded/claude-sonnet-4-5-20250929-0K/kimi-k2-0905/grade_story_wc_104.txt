<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist demonstrates clear motivation (seed preservation) and executes strategic choices under pressure. However, interiority remains thin—her emotional texture is told through metaphor ("patient as drought-grass") rather than embodied contradiction. The final smile and humming feel like performed satisfaction rather than earned complexity after eleven years of captivity. No visible internal conflict complicates her agency at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes spatial anchors (carnival, redemption center, Tilt-A-Whirl) and traces a clear causal chain: decode keys → locate vault → retrieve seeds → scatter/flee. The closure unit is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: she plants seeds, fires the arrow as a banner, and walks away while "resilience will already be standing in green ranks." Cost is conceptual (regime will reclaim ground; she walks with chains still dragging) but legible. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative flourishes (recurring carnival imagery, musical cipher). Minor orientation delay—who she is and her exact goal clarify only after the opening beat—but the pattern pays off. One meaningful tightening occurs when guards are lured and tangled, narrowing her window before the wall falls.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The carnival setting is vivid and purposeful: cracked mirrors, buckled doors, netting that traps guards, the Tilt-A-Whirl hatch concealing the vault. Sensory detail is selective and advances action (cellophane flashing, dust rolling, "dry breath of earth"). The piano bench and operator booth constrain tactics and enable the protagonist's solution. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The micro-setting (redemption center, booth) charges the final image when she scatters seeds "with the same reverence a child saves a single ticket."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: protect the seed vault from regime looters before the wall collapse buries it. One tightening occurs when guards storm in and she must impede them without gunfire, forcing the dance-and-net tactic. The resolution is driven by her agency (decoding, luring, planting), and cost is legible: regime will reclaim ground by dusk, she walks away still chained. However, the guards' superstition-driven hesitation feels convenient, and the netting trap materializes without prior setup, softening the earned quality of the turn. Escalation under the Causal lens is present but modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "liberation is only the first prize; the real victory is what you plant afterward." The seed-as-liberator motif recurs purposefully and charges the closure image when she scatters grains and walks south. Subtext operates in the ringmaster's welcome, the minor seventh cipher, and the arrow's flight as banner. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing. One slip: "seeds work on schedules older than tyrants" edges toward overt thematic statement, though it remains tied to action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the narrator's detached, ceremonial perspective. Dialogue (the ringmaster's line) feels purposeful and distinct. However, the prose leans heavily on figurative compression ("patient as drought-grass," "articulated absence," "seeds…singing") that occasionally obscures immediacy—e.g., "footprints that spelled the same minor seventh in dust" strains credibility. Perceptual signature is present but static; the voice does not modulate under peak pressure (guard confrontation reads at the same poetic register as the opening).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clarity is mostly maintained, but several lines exhibit figurative overload that slows comprehension: "taped beneath a piano bench by the last music-man before the regime padlocked the turnstiles; he had died singing, but not before he encoded the vault's location in the order of keys left stuck to cracked velvet, a silent chord that could open earth instead of ears" packs nested clauses without clear priority. Minor paraphrase loop: "she scattered a fistful…pressing each grain into the soil" restates the planting action. Template cadence in the final third: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" across three consecutive beats. Stock metaphor: "sunlight pouring in like brass band music." These artifacts cluster near the closure sequence, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carnival-as-resistance-site and musical-cipher-to-vault premise offer a fresh angle on liberation narratives. Specific details (cellophane feathers, minor seventh cipher, amaranth/quinoa/millet grains) anchor originality. The transformation test holds: swapping setting and method would require fundamental rewriting. However, the patient-liberator-who-waited-years and seeds-as-future-hope beats are familiar templates. The ringmaster's-welcome moment and footprints-spelling-the-chord in dust feel ornamental rather than inevitable. Risk-taking in structure (lyric compression, carnival motifs) heightens atmosphere but occasionally sacrifices causal transparency.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chained liberator present in setup, drives middle choice (impede guards), and walks away in closure with chains still dragging. Decisions alter tactics: she uses chains as distraction, dances guards into netting, retrieves and plants seeds. Cost is legible (regime reclaims ground, she flees unchained but still bearing manacles). Two beats of active choice, closure linkage strong, specificity high (manacles from dictator's parade float).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Arrow appears in opening (testing balance), middle (flicked to flash cellophane, distract guards), and closure (nocked and fired as banner). Two distinct beats of use. However, the arrow's strange fletching (cellophane from teddy-bear prizes) is described but its unique properties do not constrain tactics or enable a choice unavailable with any projectile. Swappable with a torch or flag without structural change. Closure cameo (flight reflected in mirrors) is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Clandestine seed vault is signaled early (encoded location), shapes middle choice (must reach it before wall collapse buries it), and dominates closure (she retrieves and scatters seeds, walks away as "resilience will already be standing in green ranks"). Stakes hinge on vault access; the entire tactical sequence (decode, impede, retrieve, plant) derives from its location and fragility. Cost tied to vault: she secures seeds but regime will reclaim ground. Irreplaceable—remove vault and the story loses its stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Patiently strategic trait is label-asserted in opening ("every strategic second showed") and reflected in her eleven-year wait and the careful guard-luring tactic. However, the trait is not dramatized through a visible tradeoff or cost; patience and strategy align seamlessly with success. No on-page moment where strategic caution conflicts with urgency or forces a loss. Mentioned in closure framing ("patient strategic promise") but remains descriptive rather than constraining.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Impede action occurs at the story's pivot: she must stop guards without gunfire to prevent premature wall collapse. This choice narrows options and forces the dance-and-net tactic. The action is causally necessary (gunfire would bury the vault) and drives the middle turn. However, the mechanics (guards hesitate due to superstition, netting conveniently present) soften earned quality. Present in two beats (initial confrontation, tangle), links to closure by buying time. Not easily swappable—remove impede and she cannot reach the vault.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Decoding piano-key arrangement is signaled early (bench found last night, pattern C-E♭-G-B♭ clarifies as "south"), enables middle choice (she knows to dig beneath Tilt-A-Whirl), and reappears at closure (taps four-knock pattern to open hatch, hums the chord). Mechanics matter: the cipher is the only on-page means to locate and access the vault. Two beats of use, causal pressure high, specificity strong. However, the method is recounted as prior action ("she had found…had sat…sounding each mute key") rather than dramatized on the page, which reduces immediacy and earned quality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival redemption center anchors all action: cracked mirror wall for surveillance, buckled door guards enter through, netting that traps them, Tilt-A-Whirl operator booth concealing vault hatch. Setting provides resources (netting, booth access) and pressures choices (must avoid noise to prevent collapse). Micro-setting (booth, hatch) is handled tactilely and shapes closure (she pries open, taps pattern, retrieves seeds). Spatial choreography clear across moves. Environment is irreplaceable—remove carnival and the entire tactical sequence collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "when the wall comes down" tightens decisions: she must decode, reach vault, and impede guards before artillery strikes perimeter. Clock is legible—guards arrive as outer wall is breached, explosion sounds at midpoint, she flees as sirens converge. Time pressure narrows her window and forces the no-gunfire tactic. Present in three beats (waiting for wall, explosion, post-collapse flight) and charges closure ("regime would reclaim ground by dusk"). However, exact elapsed time is vague and the wall's fall feels more inevitable than suspenseful.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation to plant resilience is stated early ("plant resilience in dry soil so children…might still taste bread") and enacted at closure (she scatters seeds, presses grains into soil). Desire drives all on-page choices: decode to find vault, impede to protect it, retrieve and plant seeds. Cost is legible—she secures the vault but regime will reclaim ground, and she walks away unchained yet still dragging chains. However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted; no on-page friction between her desire to plant and competing pulls (e.g., safety, vengeance). Internal simplicity lowers dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Staggering grace appears as recurring phrase ("staggering in its grace," "staggeringly graceful moment," "staggering grace") and shapes diction (lyric compression, elevated metaphor, ceremonial pacing). Tone is coherent through turns and modulates at the explosion beat ("sunlight pouring in like brass band music"). Final image charges tone: she walks south, humming, "counting measures until the harvest would rise with staggering grace." However, the phrase is over-applied (three explicit uses) and tone remains static under peak pressure—guard confrontation reads at the same poetic register as reflective passages, flattening urgency.</comment>
