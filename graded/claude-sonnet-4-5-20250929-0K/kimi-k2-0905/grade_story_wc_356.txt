<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Myrrh's olfactory sensitivity and ambition drive consistent micro-choices (testing seed readiness, timing the graft, breathing through her mouth). Interiority is concrete and embodied through scent perception. The shift from "ambition loosen[s] into gratitude" reads earned through the tree's reciprocal holding-still, though the final epiphany risks slight abstraction. Internal contradiction appears briefly but could press harder under peak stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Anchors land clearly by the second paragraph (Myrrh on rope bridge, corpse flower seed, treetop village). Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: serenity shifts from goal to companion, the notebook is offered to wind-spirits, and descent toward the tide reweights prior material with felt cost (leaving the journal, releasing the chase). The cadence shift and lyric reprise charge the final image. One meaningful deepening—graft succeeds early, astonishment reversed—tightens pressure under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The rope bridge, platform, living trunk with scarred bark, and spider-silk all constrain Myrrh's graft technique; the highest boughs' cultural rule (wind-spirits trade wisdom for fragrance) shapes her greeting ritual. The seed's materiality (veins aligned with doodled bloom, figure-eight knot allowing sway) directly affects outcome. Sensory hierarchy filters through olfactory bias (wildflower, carrion, almond-gum, bruised banana). The micro-setting of bark and silk charges the closure when the notebook is left on the highest bridge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: achieve serenity within motion by grafting the corpse flower without alerting pollinators. Pressure coheres through olfactory risk (one wrong note spoils years), timing to the forest's pulse, and the need for stillness within sway. The reversal—village astonishes her instead—narrows her ambition into gratitude with visible cost (she releases the notebook, ends the chase). Agency is clear in the graft-site choice and the ritual offering. The tightening is meaningful but one pass; entering 8.5+ would require a second trade-off with sharper price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (motion as stillness, serenity as companion rather than goal) emerges through the graft mechanics, family custom of hidden doodling, and the corpse flower's early bloom. The final image—serenity walking inside her footsteps—resonates without stating a moral. The undercurrent of wisdom operates via scent and ritual rather than assertion. Slight risk: "What is hidden feeds what is revealed" borders on overt thesis but stays grounded in the wrapping-paper custom and the seed-bloom alignment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: olfactory metaphors (seed "exhales," tide "thinks," scent "speaks honesty") anchor voice throughout. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Minor debt: elevated register occasionally drifts ("olfactorily sensitive," "moon-mulled violets," "cambium") without full naturalization in high-pressure beats, and a few filter verbs ("felt ambition loosen") soften immediacy. The lyric compression is purposeful and legible, but the diction peaks in density where plain urgency might serve closure better.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., tide reversal carries rumors, almond-gum scent summons childhood). Rhythm varies purposefully. Two frictions lower the score: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without rest ("tide's thought," "hush inside roar," "olfactory storm"), risking decorative density in peak beats; and "She journalized" recurs twice with near-identical internal monologue structure, creating a micro-loop. No causality break, but the ornamental layer accumulates −0.6 under the artifact screen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of corpse-flower grafting, olfactory sensitivity, family wrapping-paper ritual, and treetop village is specific and non-obvious. The turn (village astonishes protagonist instead) grows from prior particulars. Minor limitation: the herbalist-seeks-serenity frame is a familiar meditative-journey template; transformation through grafting mechanics and scent-as-language lifts it, but the emotional arc (ambition → gratitude) follows a well-worn path. Risk-taking in lyric compression and sensory prioritization adds +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Myrrh's choices drive all key turns: testing seed readiness, climbing to the highest platform, greeting wind-spirits with scent, aligning seed veins with doodled bloom, stitching the graft, and leaving the notebook as offering. Early signal (first line identifies her as herbalist), multiple beats (test, climb, graft, descent, offering), causal pressure (her olfactory judgment enables the graft), and closure linkage (offering journal closes the arc). Ambition as a trait shapes tactics under stress.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Corpse flower seed appears in at least four beats: cheek test for readiness, wrapped in indigo paper with alignment to doodle, pierced and stitched to bark, and the bloom at moonrise that validates the graft. Early signal (second paragraph), causal pressure (its rot-timing dictates all moves), closure participation (bloom fulfills the promise and triggers the notebook offering), and high specificity (dark veins, carrion promise, figure-eight knot). Removing it breaks the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The undercurrent of wisdom shapes Myrrh's tactic: "motion could be stillness if timed to the forest's own pulse." It informs her waiting, her ritual greeting, and the graft-site choice. Scent as wisdom-carrier (iron, bruised banana, forthcoming bloom) reweights the middle. The phrase recurs explicitly twice and implicitly in the closure (serenity as companion). Partial closure linkage via the scent-wisdom exchange and the notebook offering. Mid-range: concept frames stakes but doesn't alter options as sharply as the seed or custom.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Olfactory sensitivity constrains multiple on-page actions: testing seed readiness by cheek contact, waiting for "faintest breath of carrion promise," breathing through her mouth to mute the olfactory storm during grafting, and recognizing almond-gum scent of her mother. Early signal (third paragraph), causal pressure (trait enables precise timing to prevent pollinator alerts), visible cost (muting her primary sense during peak stress), and closure participation (wildflower hush she no longer needs to chase). Essential to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Journalizing anchors two beats: recording "Seed breathes; tide thinks; I must move without disturbing either" and later "Stitch holds; seed sighs; village sways; I sway inside the sway." The final act—drawing spiral of smoke around seed, wrapping notebook, leaving it for wind-spirits—is the closure gesture. Early signal (fifth paragraph), causal use (journal becomes offering), closure participation. Mid-high: the act matters but could be replaced with another ritualized record-keeping without full structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Family custom of doodling secret nature on wrapping paper interiors is seeded early (mother's spirals around leaping hare), Myrrh uses it to wrap the seed (doodled bloom exhaling birds, veins aligned), and the closure act wraps the notebook in indigo paper with spider-silk. Early signal (sixth paragraph backstory), causal use (alignment ritual during graft), closure participation (final wrapping for wind-spirits). The custom's mechanics—hidden meaning revealed only when undone—mirror the theme. High integration; removing it would break the ritual logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Treetop village supplies the living trunk with ceremonial graft scars, the highest platform accessible only by narrowing planks, and the cultural belief in wind-spirits that shapes Myrrh's greeting ritual. The village's collective sway ("swayed like a single breathing organism") and the platform's constant motion provide the exact condition needed (motion within calm). Early signal (first paragraph), causal pressure (site selection), closure linkage (highest bridge for notebook offering). Essential to graft feasibility and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "turning of the tide's thought" brackets the story: tide reverses at opening, sap rises "with the moon-dragged sea" during graft, corpse flower opens "at moonrise," and Myrrh descends "toward the reversing tide" at closure. The tidal rhythm mirrors the story's pressure cycle. Early signal (opening line), thematic charge (tide's thought recurs), closure participation (descent toward reversing tide). Mid-high: time shapes atmosphere and pacing but doesn't tighten tactical decisions as sharply as a live countdown would.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Serenity within motion is stated explicitly in backstory (mother's hare drawing), tested during the graft (figure-eight knot allowing sway without tear, "I sway inside the sway"), and resolved in closure (serenity "no longer a goal but a companion walking inside her footsteps"). Early signal (sixth paragraph memory), causal friction (ambition vs. gratitude), closure participation. The desire drives all choices and the arc completes when she releases the chase. Strong integration; slight abstraction at the ending line prevents full top-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Wildflower hush tone pervades: "hush, where wildflower scent drifted," "hush answered," "hush inside roar," final line "wildflower hush following like a scent." Tone modulates with pressure (olfactory storm during graft, lullaby at bloom) and charges the closure image. Early signal (second paragraph), coherent through turns, closure participation. The tone is consistent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative lens. High-mid: a single additional pressure-driven tonal shift in the grafting beat would lift it further.</comment>
