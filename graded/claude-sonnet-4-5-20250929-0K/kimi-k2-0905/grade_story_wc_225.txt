<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marek's interior landscape is specific and contradictory—he searches for forgiveness through geometry yet understands partway through that solving is not the path. The chess-tutor guilt is embodied through his habit of translating "silence into strategy" and his tournament calm returning under pressure. The phantom-king sequence and final gesture of righting the fallen piece earn his shift without therapy-speak. Minor deduction: the duke's daughter remains abstract; her trembling hands are told rather than shown in a live beat, and Marek's realization that he can meet her "without the old choke of guilt" edges toward summary rather than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marek completes the gesture of righting the king, the village resumes, and he walks toward the road "now simply walking" with the king in his pocket—a quiet acceptance that forecloses the circling of regret with felt cost (exile ends, but the daughter's fate remains unknown). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered chess metaphor, frayed-thread decoding, and labyrinth-walk until the final cadence shift ("The board is wider than the mistake") reweights the dominant stake. Orientation is clear by the opening lines (exiled tutor, time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth). One meaningful deepening occurs when Marek realizes the labyrinth is a mirror, not a lock, and walks it to separate remorse from shame. Cost is visible: he accepts that teaching means forgiving the teacher, carries the king as token, and leaves without knowing if reconciliation is possible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The time-frozen village (baker mid-loaf, children mid-tag) and platinum labyrinth are vivid and constrain Marek's journey: he must decode the tapestry threads and walk the physical maze to break the enchantment. The "woven hush…like thick felt" and "steel-blue glow of the frozen moment" are specific and reflect the story's arrested quality. The stone chessboard at the labyrinth's center with the fallen king is the pivotal object that enables closure. Minor limit: the village itself remains somewhat generic (baker, weaver's cottage, fountain) and the thunder functions more as atmospheric motif than spatial constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is self-forgiveness, signaled early ("winnow guilt from memory") and sustained. Pressure tightens when Marek decodes the suicidal king-walk in the tapestry and realizes "forgiveness was not forgetting but reframing the game so the loss became instructive rather than definitive." The climactic choice is his decision to walk the physical maze ("the only way out was to step forward, not solve") and right the fallen king—an act that costs him the safety of exile and circling regret. The agency is renunciation and acceptance with visible consequence: time resumes, he pockets the king, and walks toward possible reconciliation without guarantee. One deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the chess-as-life metaphor, frayed-thread decoding, and labyrinth structure: forgiveness requires accepting the loss as instructive rather than definitive. The final line—"The board is wider than the mistake"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry's border are purposeful motifs that constrain and accumulate meaning. The suicidal king-walk and Marek's realization that "teaching also means learning to forgive the teacher" avoid banality through embodied particulars (the phantom game, the righted piece). Very minor slip: "threads lifting in the new breeze, carrying the decoded game into the sky like a script no longer needed" edges toward overt symbolism in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter (chess metaphors, geometry, "fierce repose of tournament halls") is distinct to Marek. Diction is controlled: "winnowing that separated useful remorse from paralyzing shame" and "the lines of his face rearranged into the fierce repose" are precise. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "consequence could also be held in place, examined, rewound" and "the folds of regret he kept circling" read more like authorial summary than embodied thought under pressure. No dialogue is present (correctly, given the solitary frame). Psychic distance remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice well. Information density is high in the tapestry-decoding and labyrinth-walk sequences. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "pridefully ignoring her trembling hands after each loss; when she fled to war and did not return, he blamed himself" restates causality that could be compressed; "forgiveness was not forgetting but reframing" and "useful remorse from paralyzing shame" echo the same distinction in adjacent beats. Template cadence: multiple sentences begin with participial openers ("Working by the steel-blue glow," "He traced the final thread," "He righted the king") in the second half. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "threads lifting…like a script no longer needed" mixes vehicle (textile/text) without contradiction. These issues do not obscure closure but reduce propulsion in the middle third. Deductions: paraphrase −0.4, template cadence −0.5, total −0.9 routed to Q7 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess-tutor guilt, time-frozen village, and labyrinth-as-mirror is specific and non-obvious. The frayed-thread cipher and suicidal king-walk transform familiar forgiveness arcs through embodied particulars. The ending gesture (righting the fallen king) feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and metaphor density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limit: the time-freeze premise and labyrinth trial echo familiar fantasy/fable templates; transformation through the chess lens and the final line's wisdom lift it above derivative but do not fully escape the enchanted-village archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marek decodes the tapestry (middle), realizes the labyrinth is a mirror (turn), walks the maze, and rights the king (closure action). His choices drive all major beats and the ending would collapse without his agency. Early setup (exiled tutor frame), middle involvement (decoding, walking), and closure participation (righting the king) all present. Causal pressure is high and the cost (leaving exile, accepting uncertainty about the daughter) is visible. Swappability is low: the chess-tutor identity shapes every metaphor and tactic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is introduced early (fountain, "corridors glinting with stormlight"), reappears when Marek realizes it is "not a lock awaiting a key but a mirror," and structures the climactic walk. It constrains his choice (he must walk it physically) and the stone chessboard at its center enables the closure gesture. Two distinct beats (observation, realization/walk) plus closure linkage. Deduction: the labyrinth itself is described but not handled or physically engaged until the walk; earlier mentions are observational. Cap applies for single extended engagement rather than spaced recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Woven hush" appears in the opening description ("woven hush lay over every cobblestone like thick felt") and implicitly returns when time resumes ("the village inhale," threads lift in breeze). It frames the arrested-time premise but does not constrain a mid-story choice—Marek's tactics (decoding, walking) would work identically with "frozen silence" or another synonym. Lyric reprise reweights the stake at closure (hush breaks), reaching mid-band. Swappability and ornamental middle use limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is dramatized in the opening ("pressed his palms together until the knuckles blanched, fidgeting productively with the rhythm of a man translating silence into strategy") and his "restless fingers" are the only movement in the frozen village. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a later choice with cost—it characterizes him but remains ornamental. No middle beat tests the fidgeting against pressure, and it does not return at closure. One functional mention caps the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Winnow" is signaled early ("winnow guilt from memory"), enacted during the labyrinth walk ("each footstep a winnowing that separated useful remorse from paralyzing shame"), and the final line echoes the concept ("even a frayed thread can guide the hand back to the whole weave"). The action shapes the resolution but is somewhat abstract—Marek's physical walk and righting the king are the visible acts; "winnowing" describes their internal effect. Two beats (setup, walk) plus thematic closure linkage. Swappability is moderate: "sift," "separate," or "discern" would function similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads is introduced when Marek notices the tapestry border ("fragmentary notation—algebraic chess coordinates…half-erased by wind yet still decipherable"), enacted in a full beat ("Working by the steel-blue glow…he decoded the frayed threads…each stitch a move in an unplayed game"), and pays off when he understands the suicidal king-walk pattern that reframes forgiveness. The method is specific (chess notation in textile), signaled early, and its mechanics (reading the stitches, setting up the phantom position) shape his realization. Three gates met. Minor deduction: the decoding itself does not constrain his next move—he could walk the labyrinth without it—so causal necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The time-frozen village provides the arena (arrested baker, children, weaver's cottage, fountain with labyrinth) and the enchantment's resumption proves Marek's shift perturbed it ("his inner shift had perturbed the enchantment," "Time snapped forward"). The setting constrains his journey (he must decode and walk within the frozen frame) and the resumption of time is the closure marker. Setup, middle pressure, and closure participation all present. Deduction: the village functions more as backdrop than micro-setting that alters tactics—Marek's choices would work in any enchanted space. Spatial choreography is generic (fountain, cottage doorway) rather than particular.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder that never quite arrived" appears in the opening and the thunder "finally rolled across the roofs, loud and cleansing" when time resumes at closure. The timeframe is more atmospheric frame than ticking clock—Marek's actions are not racing against the thunder's arrival, and the "lull" does not tighten his decisions. Lyric reprise (opening → ending) is purposeful but the thunder does not constrain middle tactics. Swappability is high: "during the frozen moment" or "in the stillness" would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness is the dominant stake, signaled early ("winnow guilt from memory, a penance disguised as geometry"), tested when Marek decodes the suicidal king and realizes "forgiveness was not forgetting but reframing," and resolved when he rights the fallen king and walks toward the road "now simply walking" with the possibility of meeting the duke's daughter "without the old choke of guilt." The motivation drives every choice and the cost (accepting uncertainty, leaving exile) is visible. Friction between want (erase guilt) and discovery (must accept, not solve) creates pressure. All three gates met with strong causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is introduced explicitly ("the old fierce repose of tournament halls…that calm that is not gentle but predatory in its clarity") and returns at closure ("the lines of his face rearranged into the fierce repose of a man who has learned"). The tone—controlled intensity, chess-like calm under pressure—coheres through the decoding and labyrinth-walk beats and modulates slightly when time resumes (sparrows, thunder, breeze). The diction supports the tone but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("consequence could also be held in place, examined, rewound"). The final image charges the tone with cost (he does not smile, but his face shows learning). Setup and closure participation strong; middle coherence solid with minor register slips.</comment>
