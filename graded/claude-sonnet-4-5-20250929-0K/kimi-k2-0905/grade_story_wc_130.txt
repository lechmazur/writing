<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The conjurer's internal life is richly rendered through embodied perception—pressing glass eyes against stone, reciting primes, feeling weight resolve into warmth. The master's disappearance and the protagonist's grief-driven quest create clear motivation, though the final act (planting seedlings in the astrolabe, sealing them) feels more symbolic than a choice with visible stakes. Interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("emotion is not a number but a locus of possible intersections") where concrete contradiction would sharpen pressure. The ending gesture of walking forward "gently inventive" is thematically coherent but lacks a foreclosed path with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (crystal fruit, primes, fog-braiding vectors) and the closure—astrolabe projection triggering seedlings, stone sealing—reweights the orchard from death to dormancy with visible cost (no body, no farewell, only approached limit). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal narrowing; the tightening moment (glass eyes align, mosaic opens) deepens understanding without a decisive external change. Cost is conceptual and felt but diffuse; the final image of resumed dripping and the protagonist stepping into the desert lands cleanly under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly realized through selective sensory detail—stalactites exhaling cold dust, calcite fruit ringing under boots, turquoise mosaic spiral. The setting constrains action (climbing the tree, aligning eyes with the spiral's origin) and charges the closure image (dripping resumed, seedlings sprouting). Micro-setting elements (glass eyes in the tree fork, astrolabe's projection) function as constraint and resonance. Spatial choreography is clean; the protagonist's movements through the orchard are trackable and purposeful, with the environment evolving causally from silence to music.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the ambiguous loss of the master—is signaled early and sustains pressure through the conjurer's ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when the glass eyes align and the mosaic opens, narrowing options from abstract grief to concrete action. The protagonist's agency is embodied in the ritual steps (placing eyes, climbing, projecting light), though the escalation accumulates through texture and atmosphere rather than reversals. Cost is visible in the acceptance of ambiguity ("no certainty, only buried optimism") but remains conceptual; no live option is foreclosed with immediate stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as motion, not stillness—emerges through particulars (primes as heartbeat, fog-braiding, equation balancing) without overt statement until "the mathematics of emotion finally summing to motion." The astrolabe and seedlings offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the conjurer's question, reweighting prior silence as withdrawal rather than death. Subtext operates in gesture and image (glass eyes as twin moons, integral sign cradling a heart). The final paragraph's "buried optimism" risks becoming explicit thematic summary but is anchored by the sensory image of resumed dripping and the desert as unsolved problem.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and texture-rich, with a distinct perceptual signature (mathematical metaphors, secretive conjurer idiom, "gently inventive"). POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—compressed syntax during the ritual, expansive reflection in memory beats. However, elevated diction occasionally strains credibility for mid-crisis thought ("locus of possible intersections," "tectonic plates of turquoise memory") where simpler embodiment would sharpen immediacy. No dialogue; the solitary frame fits the concept. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated register—which risks overwriting in a single-scene piece. Mixed metaphors appear: "dovetail with the dark" is abstract, "vectors of longing" mixes geometry with emotion, "turquoise memory" personifies without clear vehicle. Template cadence emerges in the middle third ("I understood then," "I realized," "I lifted") where repetitive stems flatten propulsion. Information density is strong; most lines advance atmosphere or ritual. Clarity holds despite ornate diction, but the prose does not breathe; no plain sentence anchors the lyricism, creating cumulative drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-as-equation, conjuring-as-mathematics, and orchard-as-instrument is specific and non-obvious. The glass eyes functioning as lens for astrolabe projection, seedlings sprouting from liquid starlight, and mosaic as mechanism all feel organic to the invented logic. The piece avoids stock fantasy beats (no spell-casting, no mentor's ghost) and commits fully to its metaphorical premise. However, the core emotional arc—protagonist seeks closure for ambiguous loss, performs ritual, gains acceptance—is familiar; the fresh angle lies in execution rather than structure. Risk-taking in voice and imagery elevates but does not transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The secretive conjurer is present throughout, framing expectation and driving all on-page action (placing eyes, climbing, projecting light, harvesting seedlings). The trait "secretive" is less visible than "conjurer," which shapes every beat. Choices advance the ritual and alter the orchard's state, though the final walk forward is more thematic closure than decision with cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass eye pair appears early, is handled in multiple beats (placed on mosaic, aligned with spiral, wedged in tree fork, project light), and charges the closure image (staying in the tree as watchers, reflecting moonlight). The object's convex curves and alignment with the spiral's origin enable the mosaic's opening; later projection through the eyes creates the integral-heart symbol. Specific properties matter; irreplaceable. Cost is indirect (left behind, keeping watch).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss—the master's disappearance without body or farewell—is the dominant stake, signaled early and sustained throughout. It shapes every tactic (ritual steps, reciting primes, aligning eyes) and the final acceptance ("no certainty, only buried optimism"). The concept is not merely thematic but structural, driving the conjurer's quest and the orchard's transformation. Closure reweights the loss as approachable limit rather than void, with cost (ambiguity remains).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently inventive" is stated in the opening and recurs in the final line ("gently inventive, ready to map the next unknown"). It colors the conjurer's approach (coaxing absence into measurable shapes, braiding fog) but functions more as voice texture than a constraint with visible tradeoff. The trait enables rather than costs; no on-page moment shows gentleness limiting force or invention risking failure. Lyric reprise reweights but mid-scene use is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Dovetail" appears twice—once as the master's note ("I have gone to dovetail with the dark") and once in the final reflection (master dovetails with renewed music). The action is metaphorical and off-page; it frames the master's absence but does not drive any on-page turn. The conjurer's ritual does not involve dovetailing; the term is thematic echo rather than causal engine. Late reprise reweights meaning but does not alter options. Easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mosaic stepping stone with turquoise spiral is introduced early, its chipped patterns noted, and the glass eyes are pressed and rotated against it until alignment triggers the stone's opening. The method is specific (convex curves riding ridges, pupils aligning with spiral's origin) and its mechanics matter; the missing shard causes the right eye to slip, creating friction. Present in setup and payoff; shapes the central attempt. Could score higher with middle-beat development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites is established in the opening, its silence creating the problem (orchard has withdrawn). The setting provides resources (calcite tree to climb, stalactite overhead to project onto) and pressures choice (where to place eyes, how to align projection). The orchard's transformation—resumed dripping, seedlings sprouting—is the closure effect. Environment is indispensable; stakes and tactics depend on its properties. Present across all beats with causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the orchard grows silent beneath the moon" anchors the opening and the moon recurs in imagery (glass eyes as twin moons, moonlight reflecting). However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the ritual unfolds at the conjurer's pace with no clock pressure. Dawn arrives at the end as scene marker, not constraint. Time is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup and closure participation but no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the mathematics of emotion" is signaled through the master's lesson ("solve for motion, not stillness") and embodied in the conjurer's actions (reciting primes, balancing the equation, aligning eyes). The ritual is dramatized, not told, and friction appears in the unresolved ambiguity (no body, no farewell vs. equation now possessing a limit). The final realization ("mathematics of emotion finally summing to motion") integrates motivation with closure. Cost is acceptance of uncertainty. Present across all beats with choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Buried optimism is coherent throughout—the conjurer's persistence despite loss, the orchard's potential ("withdrawn into itself, waiting"), the seedlings as tender cargo, the final step forward into the unsolved problem. Tone modulates with pressure (cold silence → warmth of astrolabe → resumed music) and charges the final image (master's laughter in the interval, desert as wide possibility). However, the tone is more stable mood than dynamic arc; no sharp turn or deflation tests it. Present in setup and ending with thematic weight.</comment>
