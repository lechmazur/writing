<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arin's motivation to preserve wonder is clear and sustained, and his shift from hoarding to sharing marks a clean arc. However, the interiority remains abstract—"insatiably creative mind saw the pattern" tells rather than dramatizes perception, and his peak choice to "fling the remaining droplets" lacks embodied hesitation or competing impulses. The final renunciation (wandering instead of tending) is legible but arrives without visible friction between want and cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a lyric-accumulative lens by midpoint and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration: Arin's realization that wonder must travel, not be hoarded, reconfigures his goal and forecloses the original plan. However, cost legibility is oblique—the loom collapses "its purpose fulfilled" without dramatized loss, and the shift from preservation to dispersal reads more as epiphany than a trade-off with on-page friction. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines, avoiding penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The verdant parapet, waterfall veil, and living-willow loom are vivid and sensory, filtering through Arin's pruner's attention. The loom itself constrains his method (weaving shoots, notching seeds) and charges the closure when it collapses after fulfilling purpose. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves. No occupational depth penalty applies at this length when the craft detail (pruning, grafting) is purposefully integrated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder's color before the orchard's final flowering—is signaled early and tightens when the weave begins pulling back, threatening to reclaim the droplets. Arin's decision to fling the droplets rather than hoard them narrows options (the loom collapses, ending his original plan). Yet the escalation reads more as realization than forced trade-off; the veil "widening into a door" and citizens "pausing mid-stride" feel serendipitous rather than driven by Arin's prior tactical cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—wonder as shared rather than hoarded—emerges organically from Arin's actions and the loom's function as shuttle, not cage. The heirloom sapling "whose fruit would be story" and the graft "rooting in the invisible" offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The final image of travelers feeling warmth before sunrise reweights the premise with quiet authority. Minor deduction for "the color of wonder" becoming a repeated label rather than evolving through fresh imagery at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with elevated diction ("succor," "verdant," "tentonic") that fits a fable register. However, perceptual signature is generic—"insatiably creative mind" and "understood then" are filter-heavy assertions rather than embodied noticing. Psychic distance remains stable with no head-hopping, and the closing shift to wanderer mode is clean. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though some stems recur ("he struck," "he touched," "he flung") in the climax without tonal payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative density is high throughout—"threads of liquid light weaving between worlds," "moss became emerald flame, stone sang bass notes of violet"—without pattern-teaching or payoff, edging toward purple in peak beats. Minor paraphrase loop: "the loom was not a cage but a shuttle" closely echoes "to preserve the color of wonder he must let it travel, not hoard it." Syntax varies and propulsion is mostly clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The loom as both artifact and realization device, the droplets of wonder as tangible essence, and the graft "rooting in the invisible" synthesize orchard-craft and metaphysics with specificity. The shift from hoarding to sharing transforms a familiar save-the-magic arc through Arin's pruner lens. Risk-taking in tone (lyric fable) and structure (accumulative with late turn) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Deduction for "the color of wonder" as a somewhat abstract premise that trends toward allegory despite grounded detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arin's choices—building the loom, singing to capture droplets, flinging them across the gorge, grafting a twig onto air—drive all major turns. His role as pruner shapes method (notching seeds, decisive clip) and the final wandering stance. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure with visible costs (loom collapse, shift from tending to wandering).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The heirloom seed appears in the opening (pressed to lips, tasting memory), is notched into the loom's heart where a droplet sinks in and "silver veins flar[e] like sunrise," and sprouts into the sapling at closure whose fruit "would be story." Three distinct beats with evolving function; removal would collapse the graft metaphor and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is both literal (the loom structure, waterfall veil as door) and stakes-defining: the weave "tugged back, hungry for borrowed brilliance," forcing Arin's choice to share rather than hoard. The veil opens to show the gray city, and Arin later "weaves between worlds with pruning shears." Shapes tactics and closure participation, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative" is asserted twice ("insatiably creative mind saw the pattern"; "he wanders, insatiably creative") but never dramatized as a constraint or tradeoff. The loom-building and essence-capture could plausibly arise from training alone. No visible cost tied to this trait; it functions as a label rather than a behavioral driver under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Succor (to aid, relieve) governs Arin's goal from the start: "He had come to succor the fading hue," and the final paragraph confirms "ready to succor any place whose colors have grown weary." The loom and droplet dispersal are both succor-actions. Major turns trace directly to this motive; swapping it for "restore" or "save" would blur the nuance of aid-without-possession that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Capturing essence is signaled early (tools "for capturing essence the way glass traps sound"), demonstrated step-by-step (striking tuning fork, singing lullabies, snipping air with obsidian shears, cupping droplets), and its success/failure shapes the middle crisis and resolution. The method's mechanics—sound, song, shears—constrain Arin's attempts and appear across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside the waterfall supplies the mist for the loom, positions Arin within reach of the veil, and provides the spatial divide (gorge, city across) that dramatizes the choice to share. The parapet anchors the sapling at closure, "roots half in soil, half in dream." Present in setup, middle, and ending; removal would collapse spatial logic and the bridge travelers' final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Upon the hush of budding hope" frames the opening and recurs in the closing ("Each year thereafter, upon the hush of budding hope"), marking the seasonal window when color first appears and when travelers feel warmth. The seven-morning rhythm (pruning, weaving, then "On the seventh morning" the droplets gather) adds urgency. Time pressure is legible but not acute; the frame is more seasonal cycle than countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Arin's desire to preserve wonder is established early ("to trap it once more in living grain before the last child forgot how to gasp at sunrise") and tested when the weave pulls back and he must choose between hoarding and sharing. The shift—"to preserve the color of wonder he must let it travel"—dramatizes friction between want (keep) and realized cost (must release). Closure hinges on this motivation's evolution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" governs tone from the opening ("hush of budding hope") through the climax ("radiant hush that stilled even the waterfall," "radiant hush deepened") to the ending ("forever radiant, forever hush"). The tone modulates—quiet attentiveness, gathering intensity, then shared laughter and quiet bells—while maintaining coherence. The final image of leaves "chiming like quiet bells" charges the tonality with sensory proof.</comment>
