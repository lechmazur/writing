<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The maker's grief is embodied through concrete craft actions (polishing, folding) and the micro-choice to pocket a tea leaf shows character-specific priorities. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic assertion rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—"luminous torment" and "fire she could not bear to hold alone" label more than dramatize internal conflict. The final renunciation (watching smoke rise "simply leaving") feels earned by the ritual sequence, but the emotional progression from kerosene-smell to tea-smell reads too cleanly resolved without visible struggle at the threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure (the ritual forces stance crystallization). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the maker transforms private grief into communal lanterns and her hands shift from kerosene to tea, a sensory repricing with felt cost (the daughter's dream is consumed, cranes disperse). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The escalation operates through ritual beats (descent-ascent, breathing the dream, folding cranes) that deepen rather than reverse, fitting the lens. One minor causality slip: the moonstone "cracked along its equator" without prior setup, introducing a state change that feels convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating stones, tea garden, and basilica are vivid and purposeful: hovering stones require the maker to "descend while ascending," tea leaves chime and exhale dream fragments, and the basilica's cold starlight charges the threshold crossing. The maker's craft knowledge (gem-polishing method, lantern-maker's knees) filters perception and constrains her ritual choices. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical and architectural transitions. The micro-setting of the moonstone and the maker's hands anchors the final image, where scent shifts from kerosene to tea, constraining and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming the daughter's final dream into goodbye—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual: each fold is "a day she arrived too late," each tuck "a promise that dissolved." The maker's agency is embodied in breathing the dream into her lungs and pinching it into paper, with visible cost: the moonstone crumbles, engines darken, and her own dream (where her daughter does not fall) is spent to light the stolen leaf. The descent-ascent paradox and the threshold crossing force renunciation with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the cranes become "living lanterns...for anyone who needed light shaped like goodbye," converting private grief into communal resource.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—grief as transformation and communal offering—emerges from the maker's craft particulars: she folds sorrow into light, her cranes become lanterns for strangers, and the final smoke rises "neither ascending nor descending, simply leaving." The closing image (hands smelling only of tea) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the maker's habit of pocketing the tea leaf ("a lantern maker never wastes fuel, and grief is only another kind of flame") and the cranes whispering "mama" in a voice of "wind chimes and heart monitors." Minor slip: "luminous torment" is stated rather than fully embodied, and the phrase recurs as a thematic echo rather than evolving through specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and compressed, with a distinct perceptual signature: the maker notices kerosene, gem-polishing strokes, and the basalt island through craft-trained eyes. POV distance is stable third-limited. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("paradox the floating islands demanded of every pilgrim," "luminous torment") that reads authorial rather than character-particular, especially under peak stress. The prose teaches its poetic compression early, but some figurative density ("galaxy of unfinished bedtime stories," "fire she could not bear to hold alone") abstracts rather than specifies the maker's grief. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines advance ritual action, world logic, or emotional state. Opening and closing images anchor voice and reweight prior material (kerosene→tea). However, several beats show figurative overload without clear payoff: "translucent ribs holding a galaxy of unfinished bedtime stories" and "each bead a syllable of her daughter's laugh caught in perpetual echo" pile metaphor without sharpening sense. Template cadence appears in the folding sequence: "each crease was a day...each tuck a promise" reads mechanical. Minor filter-verb stack: "she breathed...drew...began" in the ritual beat. These artifacts dull propulsion in high-pressure moments but do not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of craft (lantern-making), setting (floating basilica with oneiric engines), and grief ritual is specific and non-obvious: the maker's professional knowledge (gem-polishing as dream preparation, grief as fuel) grounds the fantastical architecture. The paradoxical stair and the cranes-as-lanterns payoff feel earned in hindsight. However, the "dream recording" premise and "transform grief into art" arc echo familiar templates; transformation occurs through the maker's craft specificity (seven strokes water, seven oil) and the communal turn (cranes light the garden for others), lifting the piece above generic execution. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and non-linear ritual escalation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The maker's craft choices drive escalation: she polishes the moonstone using lighthouse-lens technique, chooses the southern stair, breathes the dream into her lungs, folds it into cranes, and lights the stolen leaf with her own dream. Each decision alters tactics and forecloses options (the moonstone crumbles, engines darken, her personal dream is spent). Present in setup, middle ritual, and closure, with visible cost at each turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The basilica appears in setup (framing the maker's destination), is entered at the threshold beat (breathing cold starlight), houses the ritual (oneiric engines and moonstone), and darkens when the quota of sorrow is met. It constrains access (requires descent-ascent) and provides the engines that copy dreams. However, its glass/prism properties are described but not causally used; the maker does not interact with the prisms or use the basilica's specific materials in her transformation. Present across three beats, enables the ritual, but the unique "glass" and "cathedral of prisms" details remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dream recording shapes the maker's goal (she sold lamp chimneys to buy her daughter's dream ribbon), the basilica's function (oneiric engines copy visions onto living quartz), and the ritual stakes (the moonstone leaks the daughter's hospital-window dream, which the maker must fold). The concept drives the plot: without recorded dreams, there is no ribbon to retrieve, no moonstone to polish, no galaxy to fold. Present in setup, causally central in the ritual, and exhausted at closure when the ribbon empties and engines darken.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" is enacted on-page: the maker chooses the southern stair, which "spiraled downward through clouds yet arrived at a higher altitude," with visible cost ("each step erasing a day of sorrow from her face and adding a line of luminous torment to her eyes"). The paradox constrains her path and charges her transformation. At closure, she walks out backward, "descending the upward stair," reversing the motion and erasing the glass beads. The attribute enables the ritual and is paid off twice, with embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The transformation action is the story's engine: the maker breathes the leaking dream into her lungs, pinches it into paper, and folds forty-nine cranes. Each fold is narrated with specific cost ("a day she arrived too late," "a promise that dissolved"), and the cranes' emergence drives escalation (they orbit, whisper "mama," settle as living lanterns). The final transformation—lighting the stolen leaf with her own dream—completes the ritual and shifts her scent from kerosene to tea. The action is irreplaceable; remove it and the story collapses. Present in setup (intention stated), enacted beat-by-beat in the middle, and completed at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Gem-polishing is signaled early as the method: "seven strokes water, seven strokes oil, whisper the name, turn, repeat until the surface becomes a mirror that looks back with your own eyes." It primes the moonstone for the ritual and anchors the maker's craft identity. However, the polishing occurs off-page (past tense: "she had polished"), so the reader does not witness the method in action. The seven-stroke specificity matters thematically (ritual precision), but the mechanics do not constrain a present choice or enable a visible turn. Present in setup with thematic resonance, but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tea garden provides the levitating stones (which require descent-ascent), the chiming leaves that exhale dream fragments (one of which the maker pockets as fuel), and the final perch where she sits to light the stolen leaf. The cranes settle into the bushes, becoming living lanterns among the steaming leaves. The setting enables the ritual path, supplies a micro-resource (the leaf), and houses the closure image. It appears in setup, middle (leaf theft), and ending, with the garden's leaves directly altering the maker's final action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the shadow detached" frames the opening and recurs once ("since the shadow detached") near the end. It signals a prior severance and sets the emotional timeframe, but does not tighten decisions or track causally within the ritual. The maker's mourning is ongoing; no clock pressures her folding or forces tactical choices. The phrase adds atmospheric weight but remains thematic rather than causal. Present in setup and reprised at closure with slight reweighting (her hands no longer smell of kerosene), but does not constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation—fold grief into origami cranes—is stated early, dramatized through the ritual (each fold and tuck tied to guilt and loss), and tested by cost: the maker must breathe the dream into her ribs, the moonstone crumbles, the engines darken, and she spends her own dream (where her daughter does not fall) to complete the goodbye. The desire drives every choice from polishing to lighting the leaf. Visible friction between the want (preserve the daughter's dream) and the cost (consume it to create communal light) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" appears as phrase and texture: the maker gains "a line of luminous torment" with each step, cranes orbit in "luminous torment," and the final image holds both light (cranes as lanterns) and loss (the daughter's dream spent). Tone modulates from kerosene-scented determination through ritual intensity to tea-scented quiet. The oxymoron coheres across beats and charges the closure image, where light and grief fuse. However, the phrase itself is stated twice rather than fully embodied in every sensory or action beat, slightly diluting its impact.</comment>
