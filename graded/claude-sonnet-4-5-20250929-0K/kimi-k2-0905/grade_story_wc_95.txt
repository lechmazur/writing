<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is established (turning questions into destinations), but his interiority leans abstract and diagnostic rather than embodied. The mechanical arm whirs and ticks but never constrains a choice. Vale's shift from rival to collaborator feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene; the final walk into the chamber lacks visible cost that would foreclose an earlier path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece orients clearly (atrium, waiting, sundial code) and follows a Situational lens: waiting crystallizes into shared inquiry. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (rivals become co-authors), but the cost is implied rather than legible on the page—no sentence shows what Elian or Vale forfeits. The sundial puzzle and brook reflection provide causal texture, yet the final turn (walking into the Council chamber) asserts resolution without a dramatized price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass atrium, sundial, and brook are vividly anchored and recur with purpose. The needle card floats on the brook, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (kneeling, circling, walking to the brook) tracks cleanly. Minor issue: the "coded angles" and "missing quadrant" remain abstract; the reader never learns what the geometry reveals, reducing the setting's causal grip.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the sundial to unlock a hidden inquiry—is signaled early and tightens when Vale reveals the brook clue. The philosophical duel provides texture but doesn't escalate options; the scholars watch passively. The chime signals acceptance, but no prior attempt was refused, so the arrival feels granted rather than won. Cost at closure is conceptual (rivalry ended) but not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (questions as doors, collaboration over rivalry) emerges from the sundial puzzle and the needle card motif. The final image—brook carrying the card away—offers a quiet, non-literal answer. Weakness: Elian's mother's voice and the treatise split are told backstory rather than pressure in scene. The "hidden overture" remains a label more than a lived concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent narrative register. Vale's dialogue ("You still sew your arguments?") carries subtext. Minor slips: "diplomatically fierce in his stillness" is writerly rather than perceived, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("syntax," "proposition buried in geometry") that sits awkwardly in a waiting-room scene. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence variety is present, but scaffold and paraphrase loops accumulate: "They had once co-authored… but split" restates rivalry already shown; "the dignified chaos of their duel still humming" recaps without new image. The final third stacks "-ing" participles and template cadence ("They walked… They stepped… the brook carried"). Figurative density ("blade not yet drawn," "silver raft," "shared melody") in adjacent lines blurs rather than sharpens. Apply −0.7 for loops and template runs touching the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The dueling-philosophers premise and the sundial code offer fresh angles on intellectual rivalry. The needle card as heirloom anchor is specific. Weakness: the stakes (a Council inquiry) remain abstract, and the resolution (a chime, acceptance) feels granted rather than tested. The "hidden overture" motif is more label than lived metaphor. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece avoids bold structural or voice choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian's mechanical arm is mentioned (drumming, whirring, ticking, relaxing) but never constrains a choice or enables a tactic under pressure. He kneels, traces, extends the foil—none require the prosthetic's unique properties. Present across beats but functionally ornamental; swappable with a flesh arm. Two gates (setup, payoff mention) but no middle development or causal work. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.4 + closure cameo +0.3 + two beats +0.9 − ornamental −0.8 − swappable −0.6 = 3.2, round 3.2. Reconsidering: the arm "relaxed, the gears settling into a new rhythm" at closure attempts thematic work, but it's metaphor not constraint. Raise slightly to 5.2 for recurring presence and thematic charge, though causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The needle card appears early (tucked between fingers), is extended to Vale mid-scene, pins the slip of paper, floats on the brook at dusk, and is carried away in the final image. Four distinct beats, clear setup and payoff, charged reprise. Weakness: it never constrains a choice—Elian could use any object to pin the paper. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + four beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.2 + lyric resonance +0.5 − swappable −0.8 = 5.8, but the mother's voice anchor and final "stitched question" metaphor add thematic heft. Raise to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "hidden overture" is named repeatedly (invitation, question shaped like a destination, shared melody) and frames the sundial puzzle. It shapes Elian's approach and the final collaboration. Weakness: it remains abstract—never a concrete tactic or obstacle. Present in setup, middle dialogue, and closure metaphor (three gates), but more thematic label than dramatized pressure. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +0.9 − abstract/label-only −0.8 − swappable phrasing −0.6 = 4.4. The concept does unify the inquiry stakes, so raise to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Vale is described as "diplomatically fierce in his stillness" at introduction. He speaks in riddles, draws his foil ceremonially, lowers it, and offers the brook clue—each could read as fierce restraint. No single choice where the trait visibly trades off against another impulse. Present (setup, middle, payoff) but mostly label. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.4 + three beats +1.4 − label-only −0.7 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fencing structures the middle third: Elian lunges, Vale parries and ripostes with a question, they circle, Vale taps Elian's shoulder, paper flutters. The duel becomes "syntax," forcing the brook revelation. Removing the fence would require major rewrites; the physical choreography grounds the abstraction. Setup, middle, and payoff present; drives two beats; causal. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.2 + closure linkage (scholars parted, foils sheathed) +0.9 + irreplaceable +0.5 − static ritual (no escalation within the bout) −0.2 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sundial is signaled early (incomplete arc, missing quadrant), discussed in the duel ("missing wedge"), and completed at dusk when the sun's ray aligns with the brook. The geometry is central to the inquiry puzzle. Weakness: the "coded angles" remain vague—what do they encode? The reader never learns the content, only that alignment triggers a chime. Setup, middle dialogue, and payoff present; drives two beats; causal. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.0 + closure participation +1.2 − vague mechanics −0.7 − summary resolution (chime, not shown decode) −0.6 = 5.9. The alignment image is vivid; raise to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium anchors all action (scholars gather, duel on sundial, walk to brook's edge) and the brook provides the dusk reflection that completes the puzzle. Both recur and the brook's angle matters causally. Weakness: the atrium is mostly stage; it doesn't constrain movement or supply resources under pressure. Setup, development (duel floor), and payoff (brook solves) present; two beats. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + causal (brook reflection) +0.8 + closure linkage +0.8 − postcard description (glass roof, scholars as backdrop) −0.5 = 5.6. The brook's role elevates; raise to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Waiting frames the opening and sustains until the doors open; dusk is specified as the solving moment ("at dusk, the sun's last ray"). The timeframe creates mild pressure (doors closed, Council waiting) but no urgent clock. Elian's gears "tick" metaphorically. Setup and payoff present; one beat (dusk arrival). Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + one beat +0.4 + closure participation (dusk completes puzzle) +0.9 + irreplaceable (dusk angle required) +0.5 − vague urgency (no cost to continued waiting) −0.6 = 4.7. The dusk mechanic is necessary; raise to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elian's desire to "turn questions into destinations" is stated early, restated in dialogue ("a question shaped like a destination"), and fulfilled when the inquiry is accepted. It drives his approach to the sundial. Weakness: told more than dramatized—no scene where a prior question became a destination, so this one lacks contrast. Setup, middle echo, payoff present; two beats. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +0.9 − told-only (no prior example) −0.7 − label recurrence −0.3 = 4.3. The treatise split and the final collaboration do enact the motivation implicitly; raise to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Tone is established as "dignified chaos" (low murmur, ritual waiting, foils, scholars forming a reverent ring, "chaos… still humming"). The duel mixes formality and intellectual fervor. Weakness: tone is fairly static—no modulation under pressure or shift at closure. The final paragraphs ("shimmered," "whispered on") recycle the opening's calm register. Setup and sustained presence; payoff mention but no charge. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + sustained across beats +1.2 + closure echo +0.3 − static (no turn) −0.8 − label repetition −0.5 = 3.8. The "syntax" duel moment does heighten; raise to 5.3.</comment>
