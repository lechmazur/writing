<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemist exhibits clear motivation and makes concrete choices (twisting lantern frames, burning them, burying the bottle), with embodied contradiction between the wish for "integrity of endings" and the impulse to resurrect Cove. However, interiority often drifts into abstract philosophizing ("working memory is a retort") rather than lived contradiction under pressure. The final renunciation of the bottle and commitment to kinetic ritual feels earned, but the middle section's reflective density flattens the sense of immediate struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: memory fragments, lantern-making, and ritual layering intensify toward the closure image of kinetic memory versus bottled comfort. The ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—burying the bottle, committing to monthly burnings, and naming streets constitutes a refusal with visible cost (solitude, endless labor). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the alchemist realizes the bottle "wanted to ingest the civilization" and chooses refusal, narrowing options and charging the final image with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paper-lantern ribs, the flagpole, the choked well, and the beach constrain choices throughout: the narrator pulls a ledger page from the well (supplies material), anchors kites to the flagpole (spatial resource), and uses seawater to mix ash-ink (micro-setting as toolkit). Sensory selection is purposeful—sulfur mixed with brine, ash spirals, gulls beyond dunes—and filtered through the alchemist's craft-oriented POV. The recurring lanterns function as both setting signature and closure device, charging the final image when their cycle is institutionalized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—conceiving a new Cove that rejects resurrection myths—is signaled early and tightens when the amber bottle "vibrates, hungry" for the scrolls, forcing the alchemist to choose refusal over comfort. That pivot narrows options (no bottled preservation) and introduces visible cost: perpetual solitary labor, monthly burnings, and the risk that wind scatters memory unwitnessed. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase and a single decisive pattern break (burying the bottle) that reweights the project with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—memory as kinetic process versus static comfort—emerges through concrete actions: making lanterns, burning them, mixing ash-ink, burying the bottle. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "civilization is the story we agree to remember imperfectly," enacted rather than stated, as the alchemist institutionalizes impermanence. Subtext operates in the bottle's "hunger" and the narrator's monologue to it, avoiding overt thesis. The final image (gulls translated into bylaws, wind-taught flight) reweights prior material without moralizing, though the penultimate scroll inscription risks slight on-the-nose articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: alchemical lexicon ("retort," "phosphor ink," "solvent"), craft-oriented noticing (wire ribs, reed frames, copper anchors), and philosophical compression ("working memory transmuted") establish a singular voice. POV remains stable first-person; psychic distance modulates purposefully between tactile present (striking a match, cutting pages) and reflective synthesis. Rhythmic control is strong under pressure—short declaratives at the bottle confrontation ("No," I said) contrast with lyric expansions in ritual passages. One minor slip: "solitude teaches monologue" edges toward meta-commentary, slightly breaking immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>High information density and propulsive syntax in action beats: "I struck a match on the bottle's glass; the sulfur smell mixed with brine." Minimal scaffolding, no paraphrase loops. However, elevated diction in philosophical passages ("conception of customs," "embryos of customs," "kinetic, never bottled") drifts toward register inflation during high-stakes moments, and the phrase "working memory" is over-relied upon as a conceptual anchor. The figurative density in the opening (whale bones, retort metaphor) and middle (memory as solvent) occasionally crowds without always advancing pressure, though it remains legible and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-town revival with alchemical process and anti-resurrection stance offers a fresh angle: most revival narratives seek restoration, whereas this one institutionalizes impermanence through ritual burning and kinetic memory. The amber bottle as antagonist-object and the lantern-kites as both memorial and message system feel specific and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the lyric-philosophical register and the solitary cast heightens thematic stakes without gimmickry. Minor swappability: the alchemist's craft could shift to another artisan role (blacksmith, scribe) with adjustments, though the retort/distillation metaphor is tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Deserted alchemist present from the opening, frames all choices: twisting lantern frames, refusing the bottle, burning scrolls, naming streets. Agency drives every major turn—conception, refusal, ritual institutionalization—with visible cost (solitude, endless labor). Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage strong; irreplaceability high (role integrates craft metaphor and thematic stance).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Amber bottle introduced in opening paragraph, recurs in five beats: warming against palm, pulsing at structure, vibrating hungrily, pressed into sand (refusal), buried as witness. Setup, development (forces choice), and payoff all present. The bottle's "hunger" and the protagonist's refusal to uncork it drive the central conflict and charge the closure image. Specificity strong: "sealed throat," glass that heats and cools. Cost visible: burying it forecloses the comfort of preservation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ghost town revival shapes every tactic: rebuilding lanterns, inserting scrolls, naming streets, establishing monthly ritual. The concept redefines the premise—rejection of resurrection in favor of kinetic memory—and the final image (town as "breath," population of one) directly enacts it. Setup immediate, development across all middle beats, payoff in the closure ritual. Irreplaceable: swapping to a living town or a different ruin would break the stakes and thematic calculus.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Rejecting false comfort drives the inciting wish ("let the truth outlast the comfortable lie"), the bottle confrontation ("Comfort is the cork you offer; I reject it"), and the closure choice (burying the bottle, burning scrolls to wind). The trait constrains on-page action with visible cost: perpetual solitary labor instead of bottled ease. Three gates met; causal pressure strong; closure participation undeniable. Slight template phrasing ("false comfort") in articulation, but the dramatized refusal earns the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Conceive" (a new Cove, customs, civilization, ritual) appears explicitly in six beats and implicitly drives the entire arc: from "I needed to conceive a new Cove" to the closing "to conceive a civilization you must first burn your own memories." The action generates the lantern-making, scroll-writing, and ritual design. Setup early, development across middle beats, payoff in final lines. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor swappability: "invent" or "imagine" could substitute in some instances without deep loss, keeping score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Working memory" introduced early ("working memory is a retort") and recurs in the notebook passage ("every page a working memory transmuted"). The method shapes tactics—pulling a childhood recipe from the well, distilling past into scrolls—but its mechanics remain metaphorical rather than procedurally dramatized. Setup and payoff present; middle development thinner (the notebook interlude is brief). Causal involvement modest; the method enables but does not strictly constrain choices. Swappability moderate: another mnemonic or craft metaphor could serve similar thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove present from title and opening image (wire ribs between rooftops), supplies all key resources: well with ledgers, telegraph office newspapers, flagpole anchor, seawater for ink. The setting's desolation enforces solitude and the lanterns' history (phosphor ink drew traders) primes the revival project. Three gates met; causal pressure strong (materials constrain method); closure charged by naming streets and institutionalizing the cove's ritual. Irreplaceable: a different ruin would require complete thematic redesign.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" frames the entire narrative window and is reinforced by "after the grant, after the echo" and "every other soul evaporated into the dusk." The timeframe establishes the conditions (deserted town, fulfilled wish) that enable the alchemist's solitary project and rejection of resurrection. Setup immediate, development implicit (post-wish landscape allows experimentation), payoff in the closing meditation on "after the last wish is granted, after comfort is denied." No live clock, but the temporal position shapes stakes and tone. Swappability low: shifting to mid-abandonment or pre-wish would alter the thematic calculus of endings and integrity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reimagining an entire civilization drives all on-page choices: conceiving customs, naming streets, designing ritual, translating gull-cries into bylaws. The ambition is declared ("I needed to conceive a new Cove") and immediately tested through lantern-making and scroll-writing. Three gates met; causal pressure high (scale of task shapes every tactic); closure participation strong (final line: "to conceive a civilization"). Visible cost: solitude, endless labor, and the precarity of wind-taught memory. Minor friction: the motivation's grandiosity could feel abstract if not for the grounded craft actions that embody it.</comment>
