<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is richly textured and embodied ("the lagoon's dark water soaking the heat from her memories until they hissed into steam"), but her final stance—planting sand and promising saplings—feels less like a earned shift than a declared intention. The father remains a construction rather than a live presence; his burning days are summarized, not dramatized as a contradictory impulse acting in scene. Internal conflict is articulated rather than lived: the anger rises and is breathed down in a single line, without visible cost or tactical compromise on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece signals its lens—Accumulative/Textural—early and holds it through closure: the graft ritual gathers symbolic density and culminates in a final salute that reweights prior material. Orientation is clear by line three (Mara, lagoon, annual ritual). However, the closure lands as a stated promise ("next year I would bring saplings") rather than an on-page decisive change or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. The cost is asserted thematically but not felt in the final image; the piece stops at intention rather than transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, kelp-drift clouds, and salt pines are vividly anchored and filtered through Mara's professional and emotional lens. The lagoon water is poured into the trench, and the coin is tied to bark—both acts that constrain choice and charge the ending. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara kneels, pours, traces her scar, walks the dune ridge. The setting drives the ritual and shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early and remains coherent. The ritual tightens through layered steps (trench, sand, coin, water), and the ending reconfigures the stake by shifting from sand to saplings. However, the escalation is textural rather than agonistic: no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid that alters tactics. The father's arson and Mara's firefighting career apply thematic pressure but do not dramatize a choice under opposing forces on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the graft ritual, the father's lighter-shaped-like-a-dolphin detail, and the distinction between scream and song. The Icarus meditation and "Station Green 13" covert platoon deepen resonance without moralizing. The final image—coin glinting, clouds migrating—offers a non-literal answer to whether compassion can redeem shame, earning high marks. However, the phrase "unyielding compassion" appears twice in explicit thematic statement ("Mara believed, with unyielding compassion"), verging on prompt-echo (−0.3 in Q5).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "cloud shadows slid across the dunes like slow bruises," "stars pierced the cloud migration...counting them like sprinkler heads." The firefighter lens filters consistently. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the POV's plausible lexicon under stress: "unyielding compassion," "covert platoon," "kelp-drift peace" read more authorial than interior. The prose stays clean and rhythmically controlled, but voice-specificity wobbles at peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often vivid ("kelp in the sky," "charcoal vein," "cooled lava"), but several metaphors crowd single sentences without pattern-teaching: "clouds that drifted like kelp" immediately followed by "kelp-drift peace" creates synonym churn. The phrase "unyielding compassion" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence appears in mid-section: "She remembered...she had been...she was...she knelt" stacks similar stems. Paraphrase loop: "scars could sing" vs. "scars can sing rather than simply scream" restates without adding pressure. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The arsonist's-daughter-firefighter frame is familiar, but the volcanic sand graft and Cretan coin on red thread provide specific, non-generic particulars. The "Station Green 13" covert platoon and the shift from sand to saplings offer fresh inflections. However, the core emotional arc—reconciling a parent's crime through symbolic ritual—follows a widely used template without transforming it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived-world friction. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, earning mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; frames the ritual; shapes the stakes (reconciling firefighter identity with arsonist father). Decisions are declarative rather than agonistic: she chooses to plant, tie the coin, salute, promise saplings. These moves are causal but do not create reversals or force tradeoffs with visible cost. Two gates (setup, closure participation) met; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Band: functional across beats but replaceable with similar protagonist types.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("film canister of black sand from the volcanic beach where he first taught her to burn things"), handled in beats (poured into trench, mixed with dune earth, watered from canteen), and charged at closure ("letting the graft become forest"). The sand's volcanic origin and its association with the father's teaching constrain the ritual's meaning and enable the final promise to shift from sand to saplings. Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Irreplaceability: the volcanic/fire link is specific but not indispensable—could be ashes or charcoal with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Stated explicitly twice ("Mara believed, with unyielding compassion" and "her own unyielding compassion"), but not dramatized as a choice under friction. The ritual is an expression of the concept, not a test of it; no moment forces Mara to choose compassion over anger with visible cost. Present as theme but does not shape tactics or narrow options on the page. Missing middle development and closure causal work; setup is declarative.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mentioned once in the opening line ("gracefully alert") as a label. Does not constrain or enable any on-page action; no visible tradeoff tied to the trait. Could be removed without affecting the ritual or closure. Missing all three gates (no setup use, no middle constraint, no closure tie). Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The graft is the ritual's central action: Mara scoops a trench, pours black sand, mixes it with dune earth, ties the coin to the pine, waters the seam. The action structures the entire middle and final third, and the closing promise ("letting the graft become forest") reweights it. Three gates met; two distinct beats (preparation, execution); causal pressure high; closure linkage strong. Swappability: another planting metaphor could substitute, but the graft's scar-tissue resonance is well-integrated.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("a drachma her father had brought back from Crete before the burning days"), handled mid-ritual (tied around the smallest pine with red thread), and present at closure ("The foreign coin glinted beneath the pine"). The coin carries specific backstory weight (recruit graduation, father's pre-arson days) and its placement is the ritual's climax. Three gates met; two beats; closure linkage clear. Irreplaceability moderate: the coin's foreignness and Cretan origin are specific but not mechanically indispensable—another memorial object could function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is anchored early, provides water for the graft (a resource that alters the ritual), and recurs at closure ("trusting the obsidian lagoon to keep their secrets"). The lagoon's stillness and darkness shape the tone and supply the "kelp-drift peace" that settles in Mara's ribs. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate (water is functional); closure linkage strong. The setting constrains choice (she must kneel at its edge, use its water) and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Clouds migrate across opening, middle ("Cloud shadows slid"), and closing ("while the clouds kept migrating"). The migration creates atmosphere and a lyric frame but does not tighten decisions or tactics; no live clock pressures Mara's ritual. Time is vague (she stays "until stars pierced"). Present as motif but does not constrain the action. Two gates (setup, closure reprise); missing middle development. Cap at 4.6 for late closure participation without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to prove scars can sing is stated early, shapes the ritual's purpose, and is reweighted at closure ("letting the song grow louder than the crackle"). The motivation is coherent but told rather than tested: no moment forces Mara to choose between singing and screaming with visible cost. The ritual enacts the desire without friction. Three gates met (setup, middle ritual execution, closure promise); lyric reprise reweights the stake. Band: purposeful across beats but not dramatized under opposing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Kelp-drift peace is stated early, recurs mid-ritual ("the lagoon's quiet, kelp-drift peace seemed willing to listen"), and settles inside Mara at closure ("the lagoon's kelp-drift peace settle inside her ribs"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (flinch, anger rising, final calm), but the shift is incremental rather than charged. Three gates met; closure linkage clear. The tone supports the ending but does not transform prior material with new pressure. Lyric reprise without decisive tonal reversal.</comment>
