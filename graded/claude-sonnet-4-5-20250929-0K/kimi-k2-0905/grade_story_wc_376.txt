<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aurelia's loneliness and physical reaction to dishonesty provide clear motivation, and the cathedral discovery reshapes her isolation into connection with Corin. The interior texture is concrete ("throat tightened with a confession she had never mailed") and drives the night-long honesty vigil. However, several secondary figures (grocer, child) appear only as letter signatures without applying live pressure, and the final paragraph's quick leap to "postmaster of honesty" reads as unearned role transformation rather than embodied choice. Corin's sudden appearance and instant mutual understanding bypass the friction that would make their bond costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through map assembly, cathedral discovery, and culminates in shared truth-telling that lifts vines and reweights the city's false-breath economy. Orientation is clear by the greenhouse studio. The closure—staying until dawn to finish lost correspondence—reconfigures her role from solitary illuminator to honesty postmaster, a Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is present but diffuse: she risks curfew, confronts loneliness, yet no single path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The montage of opening letters and the dawn exit feel more like thematic summary than a tightening choice, weakening the felt stakes at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse setting with toxic sky, filtration veils, air-purifying vines, and pneumatic postal roots is vivid and specific. The Fern Cathedral's collapsed fronds and silver-barred moonlight charge the revelation scene, and the vines lifting at honesty directly constrains the conceptual stakes. Spatial choreography (studio → levels of bamboo/glow-moss → cathedral nave → altar) remains clear. The toxic sky and dry oasis frame urgency without becoming postcard; the environment's false-breath economy pressures every social interaction and pays off when vines respond to candor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding lost conversations and confronting loneliness—is signaled early and deepens when Aurelia discovers the unsent letters and admits "I am lonely beneath my gilt." The cathedral repository and Corin's appearance provide one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is gentle: no live option is foreclosed, no tactic forced to shift. The vines lifting and the decision to return nightly feel thematically resonant but lack a visible trade-off or price paid on the page. The resolution relies on mutual recognition rather than a choice under competing pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—candor irrigating a withered city—emerges through the map hunt, unsent letters, and the vines' response to truth without overt moralizing. The calfskin strip "never told a lie" and the final recognition that lies were never required are concrete anchors. The closing image of zinc fragments "like tiny bells announcing the new route of her ink" reweights the premise with fresh purpose. Minor slip: "candor in small moments can still irrigate a city" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward theme summary rather than letting the image do all the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds throughout; perceptual signature is strong ("gilded leaf…glinting beneath dim grow-lamps," "humid silence"). Diction stays consistent with Aurelia's artisan perspective. The line "proving that even after the oasis dries, candor in small moments can still irrigate a city" in the final paragraph shifts into essayistic register, briefly exiting her immediate perception. Corin's arrival is cleanly handled without head-hopping, and the shared reading avoids dialogue, sidestepping voice-convergence risk. Psychic distance remains stable, with purposeful compressions during the map assembly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Syntax varies and information density is high in the cathedral discovery beats. The opening "pressed her palm against the greenhouse glass" and recurring zinc-fragment imagery create textural cohesion. However, several sentences loop conceptually: "words could outlast water" and "ink began to feel like a lie" restate doubt without adding pressure; "honest sentence…about how terrified" and "vines did not wilt; instead, they lifted" repeat the honesty-response motif. The phrase "candor in small moments can still breathe" recurs verbatim from map to ending, and template cadence appears in the final paragraph ("She would return…proving that…"). These artifacts dull momentum but do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination of gilded-leaf calligraphy, pneumatic postal roots, zinc-etched fragments, and air-purifying vines sensitive to truth is specific and memorable. The treasure-map mechanic and the repository of unsent letters avoid stock post-apocalypse tropes. The final turn—vines respond to honesty, not lies—reframes the city's entire purification premise with fresh logic. Minor derivative note: the lonely artisan discovering hidden correspondence and a kindred archivist echoes familiar loner-finds-connection templates, though the greenhouse-city world and sensory calligraphy details lift it above generic execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aurelia's choices drive the map assembly, the curfew-breaking descent, placing her confession among the letters, and staying until dawn to open correspondence. Removing her would collapse the narrative spine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The zinc postal fragments appear under the floorboard, guide her through junctions (she touches them in her pocket), and Corin holds the matching gap piece that completes the map. The fragments are handled across at least three beats and their postmark ridges charge the closure image as "tiny bells announcing the new route of her ink." Swapping for generic map tokens would require rewriting the postal motif and the final sensory note.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Candor shapes the premise (vines wilt near lies), the map's invitation ("where candor…can still breathe"), Aurelia's confession, the shared honest sentences with Corin, and the realization that lies were never required. The vines lifting is the on-page demonstration that candor alters the city's system. The concept constrains social behavior throughout and is causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "wilts near dishonesty" trait applies to the vines (mentioned early, tested when vines lift at truth) and to Aurelia's skin blistering near false compliments and gilded letters curling near deceit. The blistering is stated but never dramatized as a visible cost in a key beat; the vines' response is shown. The trait influences her motivation and the final recognition but does not visibly constrain a middle choice with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reread" appears in the map assembly ("reread the fractured grid"), the cathedral moment ("reread the cathedral's air"), and implicitly in opening letters aloud. The action is repeated across at least two distinct beats and shapes the escalation from solitary decoding to shared truth-telling. Substituting a different verb (e.g., "decode" or "trace") would require only minor edits, so irreplaceability is moderate, but the lyric recurrence charges the theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The shredded map mechanic is introduced early (envelope under floorboard), its assembly process is dramatized ("piecing together…avenue to avenue"), the zinc fragments guide her descent, and Corin's matching fragment completes it. The method generates the red X over the Fern Cathedral and the invitation phrase, driving the entire middle arc. Removing the piecing-together method would eliminate the central investigative spine and the physical puzzle that bridges loneliness to connection.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse city with toxic sky, filtration veils, pneumatic postal roots, and air-purifying vines supplies the social pressure (careful half-truths required), the physical constraint (curfew, levels of bamboo/glow-moss to navigate), and the conceptual payoff (vines lift at candor). The setting is present by the second sentence, pressures the descent, and the vines' response at closure validates the entire ecosystem premise. The setting is indispensable to the stakes and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the oasis dries" frames the world's scarcity and emotional drought, mentioned in the opening and as the timeframe for lost conversations and vanished recipients. The timeframe motivates Aurelia's thirst for connection and the cathedral's archive of interrupted correspondence. It does not create a live ticking clock that alters tactics in the present action; the descent happens before curfew but no moment-to-moment urgency tightens choices. The past drying charges theme more than present pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The desire to find where lost conversations go is stated explicitly ("she hoped to find where lost conversations go") and dramatized through the map hunt, the cathedral discovery, and staying until dawn to finish those conversations aloud. The motivation generates friction when her own unsent confession surfaces ("I am lonely beneath my gilt") and drives the collaborative reading with Corin. Removing this motivation would hollow the quest and the thematic resolution.</comment>
