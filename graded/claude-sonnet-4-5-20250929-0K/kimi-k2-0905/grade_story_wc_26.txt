<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve hope is clear and her final choice to internalize the stone carries cost, but her interiority often reads as poetic declaration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "shadow unbound" functions more as atmospheric metaphor than as a credible internal force driving contradictory impulses in scene. Emotional progression is legible but lacks the messy irrationality—hypocrisy, self-deception—that would elevate this to high-band characterization. The mother exists only in projection and memory, not as an on-page pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric design. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Mira internalizes the stone and locks her heartbeat in the vault, forecloses her career, and becomes "the last dusk itself"—a reconfiguration with felt cost on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The escalation operates through symbolic accumulation and cadence shift rather than causal turns, appropriate to the lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone metamorphoses and Mira understands her mother's choice, then a second when she internalizes it. The lens holds and the closure image reweights prior material with visible cost (career ended, shadow/heartbeat locked away, self transformed into afterimage).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and atmospheric, with orchid-walls that exhale perfume and release archived dreams. The setting constrains choices minimally—Mira's actions could occur in any archive—but the glass balcony and the drowned world below establish spatial stakes. The river stone functions as micro-setting and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, constraining her final choice to internalize rather than drop it. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's dusk-noticer lens, though the "clouds" and "drowned world" remain abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving the unshareable shape of hope. The story signals this early and sustains pressure through symbolic accumulation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stone metamorphoses and Mira realizes her mother's choice, narrowing her options to either dropping it or internalizing it—she chooses the latter with visible cost (career ended, self transformed). Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the escalation reads as density increase and pattern break that reweights the stake. Agency is clear: Mira's choice to internalize the stone forecloses her path as a dusk noticer and transforms her into an afterimage. The cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—hope as something unshareable, resistant to commodification—emerges organically from the stone, the dream market, and Mira's final choice. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: by internalizing hope and becoming "the last dusk itself," Mira preserves what cannot be edited or sold, at the cost of her own vanishing. The final image reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the shadow unbound, the mother's choice, and the distinction between "optimism" (monetized) and "hope" (held in secret). No overt philosophizing or thematic echo in the final paragraph. The piece invites reflection on preservation, loss, and what resists commodification.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture: "bruise the horizon," "shadow unbound," "luminous regret." The perceptual signature is consistent—Mira notices dusks, light, and the stone's changes—and diction fits her role as a scholar-observer. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with embodied immediacy: phrases like "the metamorphosis began not in the sky but in the stone" read more writerly than character-bound. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (e.g., "softly, deliberately") are taught early and support the lyric mode. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied, with sentence openings shifting between subject, clause, and prepositional phrase. However, several beats suffer from overwriting and metaphor density that obscures rather than sharpens: "dreams like pollen that glowed with luminous regret," "oceans of gold hope turning slowly beneath her thumb," and "a violet afterimage that future dreamers would sometimes glimpse" stack figurative vehicles without clear payoff. Template cadence appears in the final third: multiple sentences begin with "She [verb]" or "Mira [verb]" across consecutive lines. Paraphrase loops occur: paragraphs 10 and 11 restate the shadow's return and the stone's internalization. The phrase "softly, deliberately" recurs without variation. Information density is high in the projection-comparison beat but thins in the closing sequence. Apply −0.8 for overwriting density in high-pressure beats, −0.4 for template cadence in the final third, and −0.3 for paraphrase loops; total artifacts touch closure, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—a woman cataloguing dusks in a world where dreams are shareable—offers a fresh synthesis of archive-keeper and speculative dream economy. The river stone as vessel for unshareable hope is specific and non-obvious. However, the dream-sharing world rule remains underexplored; we see only the effect (people stopped noticing endings) without stakes or pressure from the market itself. The emotional arc—preservation as daughter's promise, final internalization—feels earned in hindsight. Proximity check: "shadow unbound" and "luminous regret" echo familiar fantasy/literary diction without full transformation. The blooming library and drowned world are evocative but trend toward generic "lyric nowhere" settings. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lyric design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a +0.3 within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira, the sharp-eyed dusk noticer, is present throughout and her observation drives the plot: she compares footage, realizes her mother's choice, and decides to internalize the stone. However, "sharp-eyed" is asserted more than demonstrated—her noticing is described but rarely constrains a tactical choice on the page. Her final decision to internalize the stone and lock her heartbeat in the vault is a key turn with cost. Setup: present in paragraph 1. Development: her comparison of footage (middle beat) reveals the stone's metamorphosis. Payoff: she internalizes the stone and becomes "the last dusk itself," forecloses her career. Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); development is more thematic revelation than constrained choice. Causal pressure: her realization narrows options to drop or internalize. Closure linkage: strong. Irreplaceability: moderate—"sharp-eyed" could be replaced with another observer trait. Deduct −0.2 for late-middle development that is more revelation than constrained action, −0.3 for swappability of the "sharp-eyed" trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The river stone appears in paragraphs 3, 7, 9, 12, 17, 18, 22, and 27—handled across at least six distinct beats. It metamorphoses from matte gray to glimmering with starlight to a tiny planet, then is internalized. Setup: paragraph 3. Development: metamorphoses in paragraph 9, placed between projectors in paragraph 12, lifted in paragraph 17. Payoff: pressed to sternum in paragraph 19, inserted as heartbeat in paragraph 23. All three gates met. Causal pressure: the stone's warming and metamorphosis narrow Mira's options; its final internalization forecloses her path. Closure linkage: strong—she locks "her shadow inside with the stone." Irreplaceability: high—its properties (memory vessel, metamorphosing, from drowned world) are unique. Cost connection: visible. One small friction: the stone's mechanics (how it "holds memory") remain asserted rather than demonstrated. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 for three+ beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.5 closure linkage, +0.6 irreplaceability, +0.5 cost; subtract −0.4 for some ornamental description in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "shadow unbound" is introduced in paragraph 5, recurs in paragraphs 10, 15, 19, and 23, but functions more as atmospheric metaphor than as a force that changes options on the page. Setup: paragraph 5. Development: it "pressed against her ribs, whispering" in paragraph 10, but this is told rather than dramatized. Payoff: it slips from her chest in paragraph 15, dances between projectors, then flows back in paragraph 19 and is locked in the vault in paragraph 23. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is thin. The shadow does not constrain or enable a choice in a way that another metaphor could not. Swappability: moderate to high—"unbound presence" or "internal specter" could replace it. Late first appearance (second fifth of the story) and ornamental use in middle beats. Apply setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, subtract −0.4 late, −0.6 ornamental middle use, −0.8 swappability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears in paragraphs 4 ("rubbed it softly, deliberately"), 16 ("the softly deliberate choice her mother had made"), and 23 ("turned the key softly, deliberately"). Setup: paragraph 4. Development: paragraph 16 (mother's choice framed as "softly deliberate"). Payoff: paragraph 23 (Mira locks the vault "softly, deliberately"). Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle mention is thematic echo rather than constrained action. The trait describes manner but does not enable or constrain a choice with visible cost—Mira could act hastily or firmly with the same outcome. Label-only trait friction applies. Apply setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, subtract −0.5 ornamental, −0.6 label-only, −0.3 swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears in paragraphs 9 (stone metamorphosis begins), 12 (stone metamorphoses between projectors), and 17 (stone has become "a metamorphosed stone," a tiny planet). Setup: paragraph 9. Development: paragraph 12 (metamorphosis under dual projection). Payoff: paragraph 17 (stone is now "a tiny planet"). All three gates met. The metamorphosis reveals the stone's accumulated hope/regret and triggers Mira's realization of her mother's choice, which leads to her decision to internalize it. Causal pressure: the metamorphosis narrows options (drop or internalize the transformed object). Closure linkage: moderate—the metamorphosed state persists into the ending but does not itself appear in the final image. Irreplaceability: moderate—"transform" or "evolve" could replace it with minor edits. Apply setup +0.6, development +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure +0.8, subtract −0.5 swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method "comparing silent video footage from decades apart" is signaled in paragraph 6 ("memory vault where silent video footage from decades apart waited"), executed in paragraphs 7–8 (threading reels, splitting the screen, comparing frame by frame), and directly enables the discovery in paragraph 9 (stone's metamorphosis observed through comparison). Setup: paragraph 6. Development: paragraphs 7–8 (method executed). Payoff: paragraph 9 (comparison reveals the stone's change). All three gates met. Causal pressure: the comparison triggers Mira's realization and the stone's metamorphosis. Closure linkage: weak—the method is not revisited in the ending. Irreplaceability: moderate—"examining footage" could replace it. The mechanics are sketched but not deeply integrated (we don't see how the act of projection causes the stone to metamorphose, only that it does). Apply setup +0.6, development +0.4, causal pressure +0.9, subtract −0.8 weak closure linkage, −0.4 swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "blooming library above clouds" is introduced in paragraph 1, recurs in paragraphs 4, 13, 22, 26, but functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a setting that constrains choice. Setup: paragraph 1. Development: the library's orchids release dreams in paragraph 13, but this does not alter Mira's options. Payoff: paragraph 22 ("walked backward through the blooming library"), paragraph 26 ("the blooming library drifted on"). Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is decorative. The setting does not pressure choices—Mira's actions could occur in any archive. Micro-setting (the stone, projectors) does more causal work than the macro-setting. Apply setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, subtract −0.6 ornamental middle, −0.7 does not constrain choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After dreams became shareable" is mentioned in paragraph 2 as backstory context ("after dreams became shareable, people stopped noticing endings") but does not constrain or enable any on-page choice. Setup: paragraph 2. Development: absent—the dream economy never pressures Mira's tactics. Payoff: paragraph 16 references "the shared dream market" in contrast to the stone, but this is thematic commentary rather than a plot constraint. Only one gate met (setup). The timeframe is static context, not a live force. Swappability: high—"after the flood" or "after the silencing" could replace it. Apply setup +0.3, subtract −0.8 missing development, −0.7 missing closure participation (cap 2.8 per missing closure gate), −0.5 ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to preserve the shape of hope" is stated in paragraph 11 ("her lifelong motivation to preserve the shape of hope had been not a scholar's quest but a daughter's promise") and drives her final choices to internalize the stone and lock her heartbeat in the vault. Setup: implicit in paragraph 2 (forty years cataloguing), explicit in paragraph 11. Development: paragraph 16 (realizes her mother's choice to keep hope unshareable). Payoff: paragraphs 19–23 (internalizes stone, locks shadow/heartbeat, preserves hope by vanishing). Two gates met (setup late, payoff strong). Causal pressure: the motivation narrows her choice to internalize rather than drop. Closure linkage: strong. Friction: the motivation is told rather than dramatized in earlier beats—we see her cataloguing but not the friction between preservation and the dream market's pull. Apply setup +0.5 (late but explicit), closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.9, subtract −0.6 told-only in middle beats, −0.4 late explicit setup.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" appears in paragraphs 13 ("luminous regret"), 17 ("luminous regret"), 21 ("smiled with luminous regret"), and implicitly throughout (the mother's dream, Mira's final smile). Setup: paragraph 13. Development: paragraph 17 (stone's "oceans of gold hope" contrasted with "silver regret"). Payoff: paragraph 21 (Mira "smiled with luminous regret at how beautiful nothing could be"). All three gates met. The tone is coherent and charges the final image: Mira's smile and the library's drift carry both loss and lightness. The phrase recurs without variation, which is a small text-pattern friction. Tone modulates appropriately—wonder in the metamorphosis beat, quiet acceptance in the ending. Apply setup +0.7, closure linkage +1.4, coherence +0.8, subtract −0.3 for repeated exact phrase (text-pattern artifact).</comment>
