<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's grief-driven carving project shows embodied emotion and micro-choices (selecting the blank, beginning the cut, choosing what to carve), but the arc from grieving widow to someone able to "teach herself that memory can be both cage and key" feels more asserted than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The interiority leans heavily on lyric metaphor rather than character-particular thought patterns under pressure. The final stance—hanging the latch, accepting "rust-hued peace"—reads as Earned Stasis but the visible cost is more atmospheric than choice-driven, and no genuine flaws complicate the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece patterns grief through carving and accumulates meaning via recurring images (sawdust, rust, cage latch, the phrase "here and gone"), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara hangs the latch and accepts memory as "both cage and key." Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The closure reweights prior material with felt cost—she chooses to carve the lion's face next, eyes open—but the tightening is more cadence shift than causal narrowing, and the conceptual cost (accepting Emil's death as permanent) is legible but somewhat diffuse across the final paragraph rather than crystallized in one image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (sawdust, thunder, steam, wet asphalt), and the workbench, carving blank, and cage latch function as micro-setting that constrains Mara's choices—she must work with what's present. The kettle and skylight recur to frame the temporal window and charge the final image (her face reflected in rain-beaded glass). However, the loft itself remains somewhat static; it doesn't evolve causally or pressure a key turn, serving more as atmospheric container than active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: contain/express the memory of Emil's last performance with visible cost. The carving deepens Mara's engagement with grief, and the decision to carve the lion's face next (eyes open) forecloses avoidance, but the escalation is more textural accumulation than a tightening that narrows live options. The piece signals agency (she begins the cut, she will carve again), yet the turns are internal and gradual rather than pivotal choices under rising pressure. Cost is legible—she commits to facing the memory—but the price feels more thematic than tactically urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from carving, cage imagery, and the refrain "here and gone," exploring how memory functions as both preservation and loss. The final image—Mara reflected in rain-beaded glass beside the empty ring—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the three commands ("wait, watch, come") and the labeled jars of sawdust. The piece avoids thesis statements and earns its insights through concrete particulars (the stool, the miniature ring, the rust-hued peace), though the thematic echo in "memory can be both cage and key" skirts explicitness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric-textural voice ("sawdust and thunder, hauntingly practical"). Distance control is consistent, and perceptual signature reflects Mara's circus background (braided manes, safety ropes, tent stakes). However, the prose leans heavily on figurative density and elevated diction throughout, risking register drift from a grieving widow's immediate experience. Lines like "promising he would stay if she just kept the cage door closed" blur into metaphor that feels more authorial than character-bound. No dialogue present to assess, and no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistically rich, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating density that sometimes obscures propulsion. Mixed metaphors and strained vehicles appear: "storm clouds gathered" / "echo of his boots remained, caught in the warp of the floorboards" / "steam ghosting the loft like the breath of animals" / "she felt the room tilt into the past" stack without clear coherence. Paraphrase loops occur: "here and gone" recurs five times without evolving pressure; "rust-hued peace" appears twice in similar phrasing. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" across adjacent lines. These artifacts dull momentum in peak beats and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.8 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally per rule).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—widow carving miniature circus scenes to process grief—synthesizes familiar elements (artist-as-mourner, circus tragedy) through specific detail (cage latch, tent-stake chisel, labeled sawdust jars). The emotional arc feels authentic rather than novel, and the lyric frame is executed with care. However, the core setup (traumatic loss → art-making as container) follows a recognizable template without a bold structural or perspectival risk that transforms it. The jars labeled like spices and the decision to carve the lion's eyes open next offer fresh touches, but the piece stays within comfortable bounds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her choices drive every beat: selecting the blank, beginning the first cut, deciding what to carve, hanging the latch, committing to carve the lion's face next. Setup and development are clear; closure shows her stance crystallized ("teach herself that memory can be both cage and key"). The widow identity shapes perception and stakes, though the core engine is grief-driven art-making rather than occupation-specific pressure. Strong causal involvement, legible cost, present across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ash wood carving blank is introduced early, handled in multiple beats (traced, angled in rain-light, first cut, sanding, finished piece set on windowsill), and its transformation from blank to miniature scene embodies the story's thematic arc. It enables the core action (contain memory through carving) and charges the final image. The blank's grain and untouched face mirror Mara's project. Strong setup, development, and payoff; irreplaceable and causally central.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is seeded early ("Emil had laughed that morning... now only the echo of his boots remained"), recurs as a refrain, and appears in the final image ("here and gone in the same breath"). It names the central tension (impermanence vs. memory) and shapes Mara's motivation to carve—to hold what is slipping away. However, it functions more as thematic echo than a constraint that alters tactics on the page. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" is applied to the carving blank's scent in paragraph three ("smelled of sawdust and thunder, hauntingly practical, the way Emil's voice used to cut through sawdust and roar alike"). It characterizes tone and voice but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The attribute is descriptive rather than operative—removing it would not alter Mara's choices or the story's logic. Present, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Contain" is articulated early as Mara's need ("She needed to contain the memory of his last performance"), drives the carving action throughout, and reappears implicitly in the final decision to carve the lion's eyes open ("memory can be both cage and key"). The verb shapes her project and the story's structure—each beat is an act of containment through carving. Setup, development, and payoff are clear; the action is irreplaceable and causally central, though the thematic weight slightly exceeds on-page dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through crystallized time" appears once in mid-story ("Through crystallized time she saw Emil's gloved hand slip into hers after the funeral") as a portal into memory. It does not shape attempts or constrain choices; the carving itself is the primary means. The phrase functions as stylistic flourish rather than operative method. Present in development but swappable and not mechanically integral.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored early, recurs across beats (kettle, skylight, floorboards, windowsill, fire escape), and charges the final image (her face reflected in rain-beaded glass). It supplies resources (workbench, light, quiet) and frames the temporal window. However, the loft does not pressure a key choice or alter tactics—it functions more as atmospheric container than active constraint. Strong setup and closure linkage; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"While the kettle boils" appears in the opening line and recurs twice ("She worked while the kettle cools" and "When the next kettle boils she will carve again"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The clock is loose and decorative rather than a live constraint that alters moves. The carving could occur over any duration without changing the story's logic. Present as framing device but functionally inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is dramatized early ("She would harvest lessons from loss the way Emil taught her... move slow, speak softer, never blink first") and drives the carving project throughout. Mara's desire to learn from grief—rather than simply endure it—shapes her choice to carve the miniature scene and then commit to carving the lion's face next. The motivation shows friction (grief vs. mastery) and cost (facing the memory fully). Setup, development, and payoff are clear; the desire is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" appears twice (mid-story in "Each curl that fell carried rust-hued peace, the color of the sawdust that soaked up blood" and final line "let the rust-hued peace settle over her like a cloak"). The tone is melancholy and textured, coherent through turns, and charges the final image. However, the mood is relatively static—no modulation with pressure, just sustained lyric grieving. The phrase is evocative but does not constrain choice or evolve under stress. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but limited dramatic function.</comment>
