<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian's mute state is well-anchored in backstory (child drowning, scream submerged), and her final tears at seeing the child "floating safe inside a galaxy" deliver embodied emotion. However, the central choice—teaching darkness through light-weaving—lacks internal contradiction or genuine cost; she executes her ritual smoothly without visible struggle or renunciation. The protagonist reads more as a vessel for lyric atmosphere than a character tested by competing impulses. Interiority leans toward poetic summary ("she felt its attention settle") rather than contradictory thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The piece accumulates sensory and symbolic density—shutters, dental mirror, spiral reflection—toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: darkness "pulsed quietly with remembered starlight," reweighting the guardian's grief into a carried ember. Cost is felt (tears, the ghost of the drowned child), though the reconfiguration is primarily atmospheric rather than a decisive forfeiture of a live option. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-slicked planks, canal water, and salvaged cypress shutters anchor the scene with vivid, purposeful detail. The dental mirror and floating frame constrain the guardian's tactic (angling, bouncing light, weaving patterns). The setting participates in the closure: "the canal kept its new secret, rocking it beneath the pier" charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is consistent—sight and touch dominate, filtered through the guardian's silent, patient attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: teaching darkness its forgotten worth. The piece deepens once—shutters into water, mirror-angling, spiral brightening—and the darkness shifts from eraser to ember-carrier, a meaningful tightening. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than agonistic; no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The protagonist's agency is enactment without visible friction or cost that forecloses a path. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens but remains gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—silent empathy, grief transfigured into nurture—emerges through concrete action: the guardian's seven-year vigil, the drowned child's ghost, the final stitch of darkness to firmament. The spiral and ember images return with reweighted meaning (bargemen's underwater glow). No overt thesis; the final paragraph balances resonance with light philosophizing ("the throat of the dark, a hushed lullaby") that skirts sentimentality but avoids collapsing into moral summary. The ending offers a non-literal answer to whether sorrow can cradle wonder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person close. Perceptual signature is strong: the guardian's silent, attentive filtering dominates. However, diction in peak beats leans purple ("spiralingly calm," "half-spoken secret," "stillwater tension") and occasionally crosses into ornamental lyricism that slows momentum. Sentence stems vary, though constructions like "She [verb], [noun] [gerund]" recur. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt," "saw") are voice-motivated. The prose texture is consistent but risks overwriting under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "bruised sky," "coat spreading like a dark wing," "reflections nested like minnows," "darkness pooled, curious." While lyric coherence holds, the piece accumulates metaphor in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (mirror weaving, spiral brightening) without pattern-teaching or payoff that alters choice. Paraphrase loops appear: "She felt its attention… heavy as harbor fog" restates "darkness pooled, curious" without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]… she [verb]…" across multiple lines. Apply −0.5 for density + −0.2 for loops = −0.7 in Q7. Clarity remains legible; momentum drags slightly under ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The silent canal guardian and light-weaving ritual offer a fresh frame, and the image of darkness learning to carry starlight is memorable. However, the core arc—grief transfigured into teaching—follows familiar redemption-through-nurture templates. The dental mirror's specificity (reflective tool for angling light) is clever, yet the shutter mechanism and spiral pattern feel illustrative rather than inevitable. Emotional honesty is present (tears, ghost child), but the piece plays safely within lyric conventions without bold structural or perspectival risk. Transformation is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Silent canal guardian: introduced opening line, present in every beat, drives the weaving action, and walks the dock at closure. However, her choices are execution without friction—no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Observation and enactment dominate; agency is atmospheric. Two gates (setup, payoff) + beat involvement across the piece + closure presence, but no causal pressure that narrows options = mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dental mirror: introduced early ("held a dental mirror"), used in at least three distinct beats (catching star, bouncing lantern light, folding helix reflection, offering back to stars). Its reflective property constrains the tactic. Appears in the closure gesture ("raised the dental mirror to the sky, offering it back"). Three gates met + multiple beats + specificity. However, a plain mirror would function identically; "dental" adds flavor without necessity. Swappability cap 3.8 overridden by closure linkage and beat count, but irreplaceability is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silent empathy: introduced via backstory ("learned silent empathy"), named in climax ("the art of answering sorrow without sound"), and enacted in the weaving ritual. Shapes the protagonist's approach (no voice, gesture-only teaching). However, the concept is told more than tested; no scene pressure forces a trade-off between silence and speech. Present across setup, middle reflection, and closure thematically, but causal pressure is low. Lyric reprise (label recurs) without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Spiralingly calm: mentioned once in the opening ("her breath made no sound; even the air around her seemed to fold inward, spiralingly calm") and echoed in the final line ("spiralingly calm, cradling starlight"). Label-only; no on-page action constrained or enabled by this trait. Lyric reprise without causal work. Two gates (setup, closure mention) but ornamental. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; downward pressure from decorative use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Weave: signaled early ("she would weave starlight into darkness"), enacted mid-piece ("began to create patterns with shutters," "weaving light into shadow thread by thread"), and culminates in "One final reflection leapt from the mirror, a silver thread stitching darkness to firmament." Three gates + multiple beats + closure linkage. The weaving action structures the entire ritual and delivers the thematic payoff. However, a near-synonym ("stitch," "braid," "thread") could replace "weave" with minor edits; specificity is moderate. Strong integration, modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters: signaled early ("she would weave starlight into darkness itself"), mechanics detailed mid-piece ("thin slats of cypress," "floating frame," "slant calculated so that any passing glow would fracture into quiet constellations"), and the pattern's completion is the closure trigger ("the shutters drifted apart, their pattern complete"). Three gates + beat involvement + causal: the shutter lattice is the means by which light is woven. Specificity high (cypress, floating frame, tethered by fishing lines). Removing this method collapses the ritual's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cobalt dock after rain: introduced opening line, supplies wet planks for reflection, anchors spatial choreography (guardian kneels, steps onto lowest plank, walks away). The rain-soaked wood and canal water enable the light-weaving tactic (reflection surfaces). Present in final paragraph ("cobalt dock after rain, the planks still glint, waiting"). Three gates + constrains method. However, any reflective waterside setting (pier, quay, canal edge) would function similarly. Specificity ("cobalt," "rain") adds texture but not necessity. Solid integration, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Within the edge of a half-spoken secret: mentioned once in the opening ("Within the edge of a half-spoken secret, she waited for the darkness to thicken") and echoed in final paragraph ("the half-spoken secret stays half-spoken"). Poetic framing device without on-page clock or time pressure. No middle beat where this temporal frame alters tactics. Two gates (setup, closure mention) but ornamental; no tightening effect. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; decorative use lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To teach darkness the value of stars: named early ("Tonight she would weave starlight into darkness itself, not to banish it but to tutor it in its own forgotten worth"), dramatized in the weaving beats ("she offered the same to the dark, sensing its ache to be more than a mere eraser of day"), and delivered at closure ("darkness remained, but it pulsed quietly with remembered starlight"). Three gates + shapes the ritual's goal. However, the desire is enacted without friction—no competing want or visible cost forces a trade-off. Told and shown, but not conflicted in choices. Strong setup and payoff, weak pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stillwater tension: introduced early ("Stillwater tension held the moment—no wind, no creaking hulls"), sustained through sensory details (silence, breath, suspended attention), modulates at the climax ("A hush deeper than silence followed"), and charges the final image ("the canal holds its breath, spiralingly calm"). Coherent tone across turns; the atmosphere of held breath and patient waiting intensifies as the darkness leans in. Present in closure paragraph. Three gates + tonal modulation under pressure + closure linkage. Strong integration.</comment>
