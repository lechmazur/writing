<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Milo's interiority is present and his choices shape the ending, but his motivation to see color feels abstract rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Rosa's "innocently cunning" trait is labeled (line 14) rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. The final renunciation—Milo never painting again—lands with conceptual weight but lacks on-page friction between competing wants at the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Milo's renunciation of painting with felt cost ("never painted again, but his arrangements continued speaking"). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pattern-building through plant arrangements, the reed, and glass shards that converge at the spiral garden closure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the marble eye teaches Milo to "see through the cracks" (line 13), reweighting his quest. Minor orientation debt: "glassblower's courtyard" and "after phoenix rises" anchor setting and time early, but Rosa's workshop entrance (line 4) and the three-day sequence feel compressed without clear spatial or temporal markers between beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The courtyard anchors early and recurs as the site of plant arrangements and the final spiral garden, constraining Milo's communication method and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid ("fogged with steam," "ultraviolet," "copper and teal") but tilts heavily visual; other senses are underused. The glassblower's tools (kiln, furnace, welding mask) appear but do not constrain a choice until the collaborative glass-blowing scene, which itself is summarized rather than enacted with tactile pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Milo's search for a hue he's never seen—is signaled early and deepens when the marble eye reveals "the violence of color." One meaningful tightening occurs: the glass-smashing collaboration (line 15) forecloses perfection and commits both characters to brokenness as beauty. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens; cost is legible in the renunciation of painting and the deliberate destruction of their creations. No antagonist or second reversal is required at this length; the spiral garden closure reweights prior moves with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in brokenness—emerges organically from the marble eye's fractured vision, the smashed glass, and the planted reed. The final image (morning glories learning "notes of imperfection") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "we are most alive where we are broken" (line 16) edges toward thematic echo, though it's embedded in action (the spiral arrangement) rather than pure statement. The phoenix ash and travelers paragraph (lines 19-20) risks abstraction but the conceptual repricing—wounds taught new languages—remains grounded in the bartered reed and marble eye.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Milo; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: colorblindness shapes what he notices, and the marble eye's revelation charges his vision. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a colorblind painter's lexicon ("discordant notes," "innocently cunning," "courageous act of remaining broken"). Dialogue is minimal (one exchange, line 6-7) but functional; Rosa's "Trade you" carries subtext of shared failure-as-currency. The piece leans toward lyric compression; some elision (the three-day arrangement conversation, the evening collaboration) is purposeful but borders on summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is mostly clean with varied syntax and high information density. Figurative language pervades without pattern-teaching: "warped light into bruised rainbows," "colors that exist only in the cracks," "dying sang and the blind taught others to see." Several lines edge toward purple ("terrible beauty of things that survive transformation") and the final third accumulates abstract thematic statements. Minor paraphrase loop: lines 12-13 restate the marble eye's lesson ("see through the cracks rather than despite them" / "colors that exist only in the cracks"). No major scaffold or tense breaks, but the density of metaphor in peak beats (lines 12-16) risks obscuring causal linkage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—colorblind painter receiving vision through a flawed lens—is a fresh synthesis of disability, art, and transformation. "Bartered awakenings" as a custom and the plant-arrangement communication are specific inventions. Risk: the phoenix framing device and the "broken things sing louder" conclusion trend toward familiar metaphor territory. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode and the spiral garden closure feels earned in hindsight. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines detected, though the "beauty in brokenness" theme is well-worn and relies on specific execution to elevate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Milo is present throughout, makes the key choice to accept the marble eye, uses it to see color, guides Rosa's hands in glassblowing, and renounces painting in favor of arrangements. His colorblindness shapes the quest and the closure. Setup clear (line 2), development active (lines 8-15), payoff decisive (line 21). Causal pressure: the marble eye's fractured vision changes his understanding and tactics. Cost visible: he never paints again. Minor limiter: his interior choices in the three-day arrangement sequence are summarized rather than dramatized beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concertina reed appears in line 3 (Milo finds it), line 8 (Rosa wears it), line 11 (planted in burnt soil, now fractured), line 18 (pressed into Milo's palm with "rasping wheeze"), and line 19 (planted in the spiral garden center). Three distinct beats with evolving states: warped silver curl → veined with fractures → planted to grow morning glories. Causal work: it's the object of the initial barter, its fractured state mirrors the theme, and its final planting charges the closure garden. Cost connection: its song degrades ("rasping wheeze") but that degradation becomes the lesson. High irreplaceability; no near-synonym could replace its specific music-and-heat properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" is named as "the old custom" (line 7) and the marble-eye-for-reed trade enacts it. The concept shapes the inciting exchange and subtly informs the final paragraph's "we trade our wounds" (line 22). Setup present (line 7), closure echoed (line 22). Limiter: the concept is more thematic frame than tactical constraint—it does not narrow options in the middle beats. The three-day plant arrangement and glass-smashing collaboration do not explicitly invoke bartering mechanics. Modest causal role; the story would function with "artisan gift exchange" instead.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" is applied to Rosa once (line 14: "her innocently cunning smile hidden behind her welding mask as she realized the marble eye was teaching Milo"). Label-only mention; no prior or subsequent action demonstrates the trait's mechanics or cost. The marble eye's teaching is Milo's discovery, not Rosa's manipulation. Late arrival (60% mark), ornamental use, no causal pressure. Does not constrain Rosa's choices or enable a turn. Swappable with "knowing," "sly," or removal entirely.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Awaken" threads through: Milo's sight awakens (line 12), "shared awakening" (line 16), "we awaken to the colors" (line 22), travelers seek "a place where the dying sang and the blind taught others to see" (line 20). Setup implicit (phoenix at dawn), development enacted (marble eye use), payoff resonant (final paragraph). Causal role: the marble eye's gift is an awakening that changes Milo's vision and renounces painting. Limiter: the verb is more metaphorical summation than discrete action; the story would hold with "transformation," "revelation," or "learning to see." Modest irreplaceability; strong thematic charge but mid-band causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plant arrangements are Milo's method for three days (line 9): "wilted orchids, fractured cacti, glass-blown leaves...into patterns that spoke what his colorless world could not." Rosa responds (line 10): "snapped stem meant sorrow, three glass roses...meant patience, a circle of salt meant the story must end where it began." The method shapes two full beats and its vocabulary ("patterns," "conversation of thorns and petals") recurs in the spiral garden closure (line 16). Setup early (line 9), development clear (line 10-11), payoff integrated (spiral arrangement). Causal work: the method is how Milo and Rosa communicate their awakenings. Minor limiter: the mechanics are told in summary rather than enacted gesture-by-gesture with visible cost in real time.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glassblower's courtyard is named in line 1 (phoenix ash on tiles), recurs as the site of Milo's three-day arrangements (line 9), the evening glass-smashing (line 16), and the spiral garden (line 19). It anchors all action and supplies resources (ash, plants, glass shards). Setup immediate, development sustained, payoff decisive. Causal role: the courtyard is where bartering, arrangement-communication, and the final garden happen; the space constrains Milo's method to what's available (discarded plants, glass). Cost: the courtyard's materials (dying plants, broken glass) embody the theme. Minor limiter: the courtyard is more stage than active pressure—it does not block or enable a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rises" is the opening frame (line 1: "risen at dawn, its final ember cooling"). The timeframe is post-phoenix, and the ash recurs (line 2, line 12 "phoenix ash shimmered ultraviolet," line 17 "phoenix ash stirred"). Setup clear. Limiter: the phoenix event is backstory; its "after" status does not tighten decisions or create a ticking clock. The three-day sequence (line 9) and "years later" (line 20) are vague. No live urgency from the timeframe itself. The phoenix's symbolic charge is strong, but as a time constraint it's ornamental. Late closure participation (ash rises in line 17) but no tactical pressure from the when.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Milo's motivation—"desperate to capture a hue he had never seen" (line 2)—drives his acceptance of the marble eye and his three-day arrangement quest. The marble eye reveals "the violence of color" and "broken things sing louder" (line 13), redefining beauty-in-imperfection as the goal. Setup early, development active (lines 12-13 dramatize the shift), payoff decisive (renunciation of painting, arrangement-as-art). Friction: the marble eye's vision is "imperfect, fractured, each hue screaming against the next"—Milo must accept discord as beauty. Cost visible: he never paints again. Strong causal role; the motivation evolves and forecloses a path. Minor limiter: the interior conflict is compressed; we see the result more than the struggle.</comment>
