<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her journey from "forgiving skeptic" to someone who accepts breaks as constellations shows arc, but the changeling's presence introduces a second character whose interiority bleeds into the narration ("shrewdly innocent eyes, learning the shape of human love"). Internal conflict is mostly reflective rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to place the tooth and accept fractures as guidance is earned by prior reflection, though the embodied cost remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric structure; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara places the tooth into the constellation's jaw and the garden rewrites itself, reweighting her stance on mistakes. Orientation anchors (Elara, secret garden, morning after) arrive early. The cost—accepting fractures as permanent guides rather than erasable errors—is conceptual and felt in the final image of "heart a map of bright fractures." One meaningful deepening occurs when the changeling offers the map and Elara shifts from yearning to rewind to accepting the wounding angle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret garden, hedge maze, marble bench, white briar path, and vertebra sundial are vivid and purposeful; the garden "rewove itself into a clearer labyrinth" after Elara's choice, constraining her path and charging the closure. Sensory detail (bruised mint, iron, chalk and thunder, dew-drinking cloak) is selective and anchored in POV. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from bench to sundial to dawn exit. The micro-setting (the tooth, the vertebra dial) functions as constraint and closure charge, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—how to reconcile a diagnostic mistake that nonetheless nurtured the village—is signaled early and tightens when the changeling offers the constellation map as a path to "set" errors rather than erase them. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elara moves from paralyzed yearning ("rewind the reel") to active choice (placing the tooth). Agency is decision with visible cost: she accepts fractures as permanent guides, foreclosing the fantasy of correction. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the final act reweights her stance on mistakes with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (mistakes as constellations, breaks that strengthen) emerges organically from the bone-setting motif, the substitute body/winter pears, and the final tooth placement without overt statement. The ending's image—"heart a map of bright fractures guiding her like north stars"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of forgiveness versus erasure. Subtext operates in the changeling's "shrewdly innocent" voice and the garden's responsive rewiring. The epilogue ("years later children would play") risks thematic echo but stays within scene pressure by showing consequence rather than moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Elara's healer lens: "willow and bone-setting song," "itching with the memory of splints"). However, the changeling's interiority intrudes: "learning the shape of human love so precisely" exceeds what Elara could witness, a brief head-hop. Diction is elevated and consistent ("nostalgic innovation," "opalized, root curled like a fetus") though occasionally risks purple density. No dialogue present. Psychic distance holds except for that single changeling access point, which prevents higher band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("cleft in certainty," "hedge humming with nostalgic innovation," "damp hem drinking dew"). Two clarity issues: "nostalgic innovation" as applied to hedges is opaque, and the phrase "Tell me how to turn wrongs into constellations instead of scars" directly articulates the theme rather than trusting image. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 16–17 restate the question of forgiveness/lie deserving each other without added pressure. Information density is high and most sentences advance character or atmosphere; no severe template cadence or filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of changeling folklore, bone-setting as moral metaphor, and substitute-body mystery into a tale about diagnostic humility feels specific and non-obvious. The vertebra sundial, tooth-as-ransom/invitation, and winter pears fed by the yew log are fresh inflections that grow from the premise. Risk-taking in structure (lyric pacing, garden-as-respondent) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending's constellation-mapping avoids sentimentality by rooting the forgiveness arc in concrete consequences (the blacksmith's wife's "fierce kindness," the pear harvest). Transformation of the "wise healer" trope through acceptance of error rather than correction elevates originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout; her skepticism-to-acceptance arc creates the key turn when she places the tooth and accepts fractures as guidance. She drives the closure beat with a decision that forecloses the path of erasure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The baby tooth is handled in the opening beat (turned between fingers), offered by the changeling mid-story as "ransom" and "invitation," and placed into the constellation's jaw at closure, reweighting from evidence of error to seed of wisdom. Specific properties (opalized, root curled) matter. Present across three beats with causal role and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "cleft in certainty" is named early ("opened right through her chest"), dramatized when Elara's diagnostic confidence shatters, and reweighted at closure when the cleft "widen[s] into a door." It shapes her stake (how to live with irreconcilable truths) and the final image ("map of bright fractures"). Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is attributed to the changeling's eyes and smile, used twice to characterize its knowing-yet-tender fraud. It constrains Elara's ability to dismiss the deception as simple evil ("the fraud had been tender"), complicating her forgiveness calculus. However, it remains largely descriptive; no on-page action demonstrates the tradeoff between shrewdness and innocence with visible cost tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's yearning ("to rewind the reel of her choices") is the inciting pressure and recurs when she asks the garden how to turn wrongs into constellations. The turn occurs when she shifts from yearning-to-undo to accepting-the-angle. Yearning drives both the middle reflection and the closure choice; removing it would collapse the arc from paralysis to action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Bone-setting is signaled early (Elara identifies the corpse by "the crooked radius she herself had splinted"), shapes the central metaphor ("set them…not to erase the break, but to let the limb grow stronger at the angle"), and reappears in the closure image ("preparing splints for the season of falls"). Its mechanics—accepting the break and aligning growth—define the thematic resolution. Present across three beats with causal and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is the sole location, providing the marble bench, white briar path, vertebra sundial, and responsive rewiring at closure. It constrains Elara's path (she follows the revealed pavers) and charges the final image (the hedges "rewove…into a clearer labyrinth"). Present throughout with micro-setting (tooth, sundial) altering tactics. Strong closure linkage but not irreplaceable—another liminal space could serve similar symbolic function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("morning after the substitute body was found") anchors the opening and the epilogue notes "years later," but within the main scene time remains atmospheric rather than tracked. No clock tightens Elara's choices; the garden encounter feels timeless. Present as setup context but does not pressure decisions or escalate urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire to turn mistakes into constellations is voiced explicitly ("Tell me how to turn wrongs into constellations instead of scars") and dramatized when Elara places the tooth into the constellation map, accepting fractures as guides. Friction exists between her yearning to rewind and the changeling's offer to "set" errors with their costs intact. The motivation drives both middle and closure beats with visible opportunity cost (she forgoes erasure).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone blends wistfulness (marble bench, mint and iron, "nostalgic innovation") with the uncanny (changeling's flute-voice, garden reweaving itself). It modulates from reflective opening to charged exchange with the changeling to hopeful epilogue. The phrase "nostalgic innovation" directly names the tone but remains somewhat opaque. Coherent through turns and contributes to the final image's charge, though the epilogue's shift to communal legend risks flattening the personal cost.</comment>
