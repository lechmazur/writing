<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicler's interiority is selective and embodied—studying moonlight on stone, feeling the jade cicada's pulse—but key motivations remain abstract. The reconciliation desire is told more than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The daughter's arrival and silent gestures show embodied emotion, yet her internal contradiction is minimal; she functions primarily as recipient of the chronicler's observational wisdom. The final choice to restart conversation feels inevitable but lacks visible cost that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—tangential observation accumulating toward relational repair—and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure when both stand in the transition-period dawn. Causality is clean: the chronicler's flight to the grotto, the daughter's drawn arrival, the jade cicada exchange, and the resumed conversation form a coherent sequence. Cost is felt but oblique—the discomfort of the pause, the "half sob" laugh—yet the final image reweights the opening fracture with undeniable emotional pressure, satisfying the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly anchored—limestone ribs, phosphorescent glow, basalt ledge, dripping vault—and the tidal pool constrains the chronicler's method of observation. Sensory selection reflects urgency: salt on lips, chill of dawn, brittle star navigating sharp edges. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting, charging the final exchange and the closure walk. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting's texture (silt layering, stone changed by weight) directly supports the thematic reconfiguration at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciliation with the daughter—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once when the daughter arrives unbidden, then deepens when she takes the cicada with thumb-brushing contact. The brittle star becomes a living diagram of navigating pain, an on-page model that reweights tactics. Agency is present but muted: the chronicler's choice to shift the lantern and offer the cicada are gestures of invitation rather than high-cost decisions. The ending's resumed conversation and shared observation constitute Earned Stasis with felt cost (the awkwardness, the slow reweaving), meeting Accumulative escalation standards but lacking a sharper trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—transition periods, patience, and tangential repair—emerges from particulars: the cicada's seventeen-year sleep, the tide's reclaim-and-erase rhythm, the daughter's insight that time feels like silt layering. The final image (standing in the neither-night-nor-day threshold) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and shared observation. Minor slip: "Listen to the pool hold the ocean after the ocean has left" veers toward Thematic Echo, articulating the metaphor a bit too directly in the penultimate third, though it remains character-voiced and mother's "native tongue."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV held throughout; focalization is stable and the chronicler's perceptual signature—warmly observant, tangential—is consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with patterned phrasing ("texture of time," "memory-forward," "transition period made visible") that teaches its idiom early. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats (the daughter's shadow merging, the contact passing warmth). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from immediate perception into essayistic summary ("a quiet archive," "lesson inherited"), and the daughter's interior remains externally observed without distinct voice when she speaks her single line, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. The piece commits to its lyric register and sustains it without collapse. However, pervasive overwriting taxes clarity: nearly every sentence stacks metaphor or abstraction ("throat between worlds," "texture of time," "memory-forward," "grotesque," "native tongue," "cocoon," "tidal," "slippery yet luminous"). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph nine writes "texture" and then restates the concept, paragraph eighteen echoes "texture of time" again. Template cadence in early paragraphs ("She was warmly observant," "She set the jade cicada," "She dipped her finger") and synonym churn around "time" and "texture" add cumulative drag. Several beats describe rather than advance pressure, flattening momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler and tangential-observation method offer a fresh synthesis, and the jade cicada as inherited patience-token is specific. The grotto setting and brittle-star-as-diagram moment are vivid particulars. Yet the core emotional arc—estranged parent and child reconciling through shared observation—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it with non-obvious moral calculus or high-cost choice. The lyric register and nature-as-mirror design lean toward a recognizable literary aesthetic. The seventeen-year cicada detail and "memory-forward" coinage show ingenuity, lifting the score within band, but the resolution remains emotionally predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler is present throughout, and her occupation directly shapes her method (observing anemones, studying moonlight fractals, recording the pool). She makes two key choices: fleeing to the grotto (paragraph two) and offering the jade cicada (paragraph fourteen), the latter altering tactics and enabling the daughter's acceptance. However, "chronicler" as professional role is more atmospheric than constraining—she could be any observant figure. The role drives the tangential lens but does not impose a unique cost or capability that another archetype could not supply. Early signal, two-beat involvement, and closure linkage present; causal pressure moderate; swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The jade cicada appears in six distinct beats: paragraph six (set on ledge), paragraph seven (wife's reminder), paragraph fourteen (offered palm-up), paragraph fourteen (daughter takes it, thumb brushing wings), paragraph nineteen (pocketed, warmer), and paragraph twenty-four (pressed, feeling vibration). It shifts from memory anchor to apology object to shared heartbeat, reweighting meaning across the arc. The object enables the pivotal exchange and charges the final walk home. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and specificity (seventeen-year song, cool stone wings turning warm) all present. Cost tied to the object is implied (the contact passing warmth as "memory-forward" reconciliation) but not sharply foregrounded as a visible price paid.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Transition periods" is named in paragraph seven (cicadas sleep seventeen years), paragraph twenty-three (neither night nor day made visible), and paragraph twenty-five (every pause is a cocoon). It shapes the chronicler's interpretive lens and the story's temporal frame (the pause in the argument as a breathing creature). The concept constrains the mother's method—waiting, observing obliquely—and the daughter's closing insight ("time would feel sharp, but it's more like silt, layering") directly enacts it. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than tactical pressure; it does not narrow options in a high-stakes beat. Early signal, multi-beat thematic accent, closure participation as conceptual anchor; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is declared in paragraph three and demonstrated throughout (noting anemones folding, moonlight fracturing, the brittle star). It motivates the tangential method and the lantern-shift invitation in paragraph eleven. Yet the trait is more label than constraint—it enables observation but never costs the chronicler a missed opportunity or forces a tradeoff. The daughter's recognition of the "lesson inherited" (paragraph twenty-two) completes a thematic echo but does not dramatize a price paid for this mode of attention. Present across beats, functionally consistent, but no visible cost or tactical friction; trends functional-but-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Foresee" appears explicitly in paragraph four ("come to foresee whether reconciliation was possible") and paragraph fifteen ("the chronicler foresaw—not prophecy but memory-forward—tomorrow's breakfast"). The second usage redefines foresight as embodied intuition in the moment of contact, a key turn. However, the action itself is summarized rather than enacted—we do not see the chronicler perform a divinatory method or wrestle with conflicting visions. The "foresee" frame could be replaced with "hope" or "imagine" without structural loss. Early signal, one closure-adjacent beat, moderate causal pressure, high swappability; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Tangential approach" is named in paragraph five ("truth arrived sideways") and enacted across the arc: the chronicler studies moonlight instead of asking direct questions, offers the jade cicada as wordless apology, and invites shared observation rather than dialogue. The method shapes multiple tactics (the lantern shift in paragraph eleven, the silent pool-watching in paragraph twelve, the oblique metaphor in paragraph sixteen). The daughter's recognition that her mother speaks in "tangential, tidal" metaphor (paragraph seventeen) and her own shift to sideways seeing (paragraph twenty-two) complete the inheritance. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure participation as inherited stance; causal pressure moderate to strong; some irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient grotto supplies the tidal pool (resource for observation), the basalt ledge (platform for the cicada), the phosphorescent ribs (atmosphere), and the dripping vault (syllable-drops that teach rhythm). The setting pressures the chronicler's choice to flee there (paragraph two), enables the tangential method (paragraphs five and nine), and stages the daughter's arrival (paragraph ten). The grotto's threshold position ("throat between worlds," "transition period made visible") charges the final dawn moment when they stand at the rim. Spatial choreography is clean. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage strong, causal pressure moderate; the grotto is integral but not uniquely so—another liminal natural space could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—"across the pause in a difficult conversation"—is named in paragraph two and enacted as the structural spine: the chronicler flees during the pause, the daughter arrives mid-pause, and the conversation resumes in the final paragraphs. The pause itself is reified as "a creature, breathing" (paragraph eight), and the story closes with "conversation resumed" (paragraph twenty-three) and restarted (paragraph twenty-five). However, the pause does not impose urgency or narrow options—there is no ticking clock or escalating cost for delay. The timeframe is more conceptual container than tactical pressure. Early signal, closure participation as bookend, moderate thematic weight, low causal pressure; functional but not high-stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Texture of time" is named in paragraph two (seeking it in the hush between waves), paragraph nine (writing "texture" in sand, understanding time as disappearing touch), and paragraph eighteen (texture of time as grit and chill). The desire motivates the flight to the grotto and the observational method. Yet the motivation remains abstract and contemplative—it does not create friction, rival goals, or a visible cost. The chronicler's true operational desire is reconciliation; "texture of time" is the interpretive lens she applies, not a conflicted want. Told more than dramatized, no tactical tradeoff; present but ornamental to the relational stake.</comment>
