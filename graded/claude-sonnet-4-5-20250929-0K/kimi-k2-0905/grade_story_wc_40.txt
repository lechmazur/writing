<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's reticence is established but she remains more observer than agent through most beats. The choice to "testify" and speak memories aloud feels more performed than compelled by contradiction. The final departure ("She did not look back") gestures at renunciation but the cost—what path she forecloses—remains abstract. Embodied emotion is thin: "weathered innocence stirring" and "a small, sad movement" are labels rather than visceral states under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: sequences accumulate through the crystal, density increases with remembered voices, and the final image (crystal humming, last word "zygote") attempts a Conceptual Repricing. Orientation anchors (Elara, library, dawn, day after last dictionary) arrive early. However, the closure unit lacks legible cost: Elara leaves, others will continue—what has she lost or gained? The "pattern of growth" remains abstract, and the decisive change is asserted ("she had spoken for the silence") rather than felt on the page. Cost proof test fails; no sentence shows a visible price paid or path foreclosed at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library at dawn is vividly rendered ("spines of books that had grown brittle," "dust motes in a sunbeam," "slants through high windows") and the crystal as micro-setting object constrains Elara's testimony action. The falling book (*Botanical Studies*) and pressed snowdrop subtly charge the "growth" theme. However, the setting functions more as atmosphere than tactical constraint; Elara's choices are not altered by spatial limits or resource scarcity. The final beat (crystal on desk, dictionary open) reweights prior material enough to edge into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the pattern—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens should read as density increase or cadence shift; here the sequences accumulate (laughter, cough, memories) but remain passive observation until Elara speaks. No tightening forecloses an option or forces a trade-off; the library "answers" with a falling book, but this is coincidence, not protagonist agency. The resolution (she leaves, others will continue) lacks visible cost or tactical consequence. One meaningful pressure point is present but agency at closure is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of language's end, memory as repository, and cyclical growth emerges through particulars (last dictionary, "zygote," pressed snowdrop). The crystal's "testimony" avoids overt statement until "she had spoken for the silence," which edges toward thesis articulation. The ending offers a non-literal answer (beginning/zygote after ending/last dictionary) but it feels arranged rather than earned by Elara's struggle. Subtext operates in the pressed flower and the humming crystal; epiphany ("Growth was not always upward") is told rather than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and lyric ("suspended hush that clung to the air," "sonically reflective," "weathered innocence"). Perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices books, sounds, particulars of the library. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during testimony, pulled back at departure). Brief dialogue-like moments ("possible, possible"; internal "I remember" testimony) carry subtext. However, some diction ("sonically reflective," "fractured sequences") tilts toward abstract register, and the phrase "weathered innocence" risks preciousness. Rhythm control under pressure is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("rings in a tree," "sediment," "first thread in its new spine"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or concept. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "suspended hush" recurs without fresh meaning, "pattern of growth" is restated multiple times, and "testified/testimony" appears in four beats with diminishing return. Template cadence appears in the testimony section ("I remember... I remember"). Minor filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood") in mid-story beats dull immediacy. Figurative language is frequent but controlled; no mixed metaphors. The paraphrase-loop and template-cadence checks trigger modest deduction (−0.6 in Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—library as listener after language ends—is fresh and the image of a humming crystal catching voices is specific. However, the emotional arc (reticent scholar decodes pattern, speaks memories, leaves) follows a familiar contemplative template without bold risk. The "last dictionary" and "zygote" reversal is clever but anticipated. Transformation test: swap scholar for another introspective role and the plot holds unchanged. Proximity check passes; no famous echoes. The piece synthesizes archive-fiction and lyric meditation competently but the middle ground (no radical structural risk, no sharp character contradiction) keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and frames the story but her choices are limited: she waits, listens, writes in memory, speaks testimony, leaves. The testimony beat (speaking memories aloud) is one decision that alters the scene's emotional charge but does not narrow later options. Departure is renunciation but its consequence is deferred to others. Setup and payoff gates met; development (a choice that constrains tactics) is weak. Functional but replaceable; a generic scholar could perform the same actions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal appears in five distinct beats: pocketed after the storm, hums when page turns, placed on table, grows warmer and glows, left humming on desk. It enables the core action (catching/refracting sound sequences) and charges the final image. Setup, development (constrains Elara's method of testimony), and payoff (humming beside dictionary, others will find it) all met. Specificity high: "sonically reflective," pulsing, warm, glowing are unique properties. Cost connection present: the crystal's testimony outlasts Elara. Causal pressure strong; irreplaceable. Scores in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Suspended hush" is named in paragraph two, returns twice mid-story ("hush lifted"), and the library's silence-as-listening shapes Elara's decoding motive. The concept frames stakes (decode what hides in silence) but does not constrain tactics; Elara's method (listen, speak) could operate under any ambient condition. Setup and payoff met; development weak. The hush is atmospheric rather than causal. Functional accent that shapes one turn (the lifting hush) but is swappable with "quiet" or "stillness" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sonically reflective" is attributed to the crystal in paragraph five and enables its core function: catching whispers, refracting sound into sequences, humming. The trait constrains Elara's method (she must listen to the crystal's refraction) and is causally active in two beats (page turn, testimony session). Setup, development, payoff met. Specificity high; visible trade-off present (the crystal dictates the form of testimony). Cost connection modest; the trait is necessary but the story does not dramatize a price for relying on it. Scores in the shapes-one-key-turn band with strong development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Testify" appears as verb and noun six times: demanded by crystal, Elara testifies to sounds, speaks testimony, crystal's "quiet testimony," she "spoken for the silence." The action drives the middle third (Elara speaks memories aloud) and the thematic close (testimony continues). Setup and payoff met; development present (testimony alters the library's state from silent to voiced). However, the action could be swapped with "witness" or "record" with minor tonal edits; the mechanics are the same. Causal role in two beats but moderate irreplaceability. Mid-to-upper functional band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fractured sequences" is named in paragraph four, demonstrated through sensory fragments (laughter, cough, lullaby, debate), and returned in the final paragraph (others will hear sequences, add fragments). The method shapes Elara's testimony: she writes "each sound became a fragment," tracking a spiral pattern. Setup, development (method constrains how she decodes), and payoff met. Specificity modest; "fractured" could be "broken," "scattered," or "splintered" without loss. The method matters in two beats but is not irreplaceable. Functional with purposeful reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The library at dawn anchors the entire story: shadowed stacks, high windows, central table, upper gallery. Setting supplies the falling book (plot turn), the pressed snowdrop (thematic image), and the humming crystal's resting place (closure image). Elara's movements (biography section, philosophy stacks, central table, desk) are spatially coherent. Setup, development (book falls from gallery, altering Elara's understanding), and payoff (crystal on desk charges the end) all met. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices under pressure; she could testify anywhere. Causal role in one beat (falling book) and strong closure linkage. Essential-across-beats threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—"day after the last dictionary was printed"—is named early and charges the thematic stakes (language has ended). Elara works "through the morning" and leaves "as the sun fully rose," but this elapsed time does not tighten decisions. Setup met; development weak (time does not constrain tactics); payoff present (the ending looks forward to "years to come"). The timeframe is atmospheric rather than causal; swappable with "after the last library closed" or similar with minor edits. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Decode the pattern of growth" is stated in paragraph four and motivates Elara's attention to sequences. She realizes growth is "inward, a folding of time and memory" and the library "would grow, not in books but in voices." The motive drives her testimony action and frames the thematic close. Setup and payoff met; development modest (the motive is pursued but not conflicted with cost on the page). Desire is told more than dramatized; no visible friction between want and sacrifice. Functional with thematic reprise but low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Weathered innocence" is named once in paragraph five ("her weathered innocence stirring—she who had once believed all knowledge could be catalogued"). The tone—melancholy, elegiac, tinged with loss and wonder—coheres through Elara's quiet observations and the library's gentle answer. The final smile ("a small, sad movement") and the forward-looking coda sustain the tone. However, the phrase itself is label-heavy and the tone does not modulate sharply under pressure; it remains static across turns. Setup and payoff met; development weak. Coherent but single-register mood, mid-functional band.</comment>
