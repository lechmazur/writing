<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is concrete and purposeful: her tactile investigation of the catalogue's bruise patterns, her decision to extinguish the lantern, and her final choice to rewrite the index all follow motivated escalation. Internal contradiction appears when she both fears and pursues erasure, and the stamp's tranquil perception creates embodied pressure on her pulse. The ending choice to preserve truth feels earned by prior causality, though secondary characters are absent and relationships do not complicate her arc. Minor deduction for some abstract phrasing ("dappled resolve") that verges on label-speak without full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Mara, flooded library, blackout, indexing mission established within opening lines. Drive lens is Causal: blackout enables stamp use → glyph reveals city grid → Mara decides to rewrite index, each beat motivated by prior discovery. Closure is Decisive Change with cost: she rewrites the taxonomy to remember pre-submergence truth, accepts private burden of holding false history at bay, and surfaces with warm wrist mark as proof. One meaningful tightening when she extinguishes the lantern and reads by darkness. Cost is legible in her solitary burden and the Council's ongoing ignorance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flooded library constrains Mara's investigation: rising water forces touch-reading, darkness requires lantern extinction to see phosphorescence, bronze drawers and marble floors anchor spatial choreography. Micro-setting (the stamp pressed to water surface) charges the climactic revelation. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately—lantern light, cold seawater, fingertip braille—and the blackout's reclaimed stillness becomes tactile pressure. The glyph's street-grid revelation depends on the flooded environment and phosphorescent plankton, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: trace the catalogue's honest origins before digitization erases them. One meaningful tightening when Mara extinguishes the lantern and discovers the glyph mirrors the sunken city's original street grid, narrowing her options to either comply or resist. The final choice to rewrite the index with "Pre-Submergence Topography" forecloses the path of passive complicity with visible cost: she must carry private knowledge against civic myth. Agency is clear; coincidence (blackout, phosphorescence) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of erasure-as-origin emerges through concrete particulars: bruised card indentations, the stamp's negative-space logic, the city's forgotten dry past. The glyph's inverse reveals that knowledge institutions suppress truth to maintain control, and Mara's final ledger column offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The stamp's "tranquilly perceptive" tingle and the phrase "knowledge begins where silence is stamped back into speech" risk abstraction but remain anchored in her physical action of copying the glyph's inverse. Subtext operates in the catalogue "indexing her" and the city's pretense it "never fell."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Mara's perceptual signature favors tactile and archival detail (fingertips grazing indentations, tin box, bronze drawers). Voice modulates appropriately from investigative calm to discovery intensity. Some elevated diction ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive") feels ornamental rather than voice-motivated, and "reclaimed stillness" recurs as a phrase rather than varying its expression. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (she infers but does not claim omniscience). Filter verbs are minimal. Prose as character: syntax reflects her methodical cataloguer mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats (stamp application, card sorting, phosphorescent revelation). However, several ornamental phrases slow momentum: "slow applause," "dappled resolve—light and shadow alternating inside her like breathing," "tentatively perceptive" wrist mark repeated without added meaning. Minor paraphrase loop: "reclaimed stillness" appears three times with slight variation but no escalation. Stock metaphor "kelp forests and reading tables into coral reefs" is vivid but generic. No causality breaks; scaffold is minimal. Elevated diction in peak beats ("tranquilly perceptive") drifts from Mara's established voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—flooded archive + blackout reveals suppressed street grid via phosphorescent stamp—synthesizes archival mystery with literal submersion as metaphor for historical erasure. The glyph-as-negative-space and darkness-as-revelatory-tool are fresh angles. However, the underwater-library-as-lost-knowledge trope is familiar, and the story does not risk structural or perspectival boldness beyond its lyric compression. Emotional specificity in Mara's tactile investigation and the bruised-card constellation rescues the piece from template feel. Transformation test: changing names and setting would reduce impact but the stamp's mechanics and phosphorescent payoff feel integral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara appears early, drives middle investigation (sorting bruised cards, testing stamp), and at closure decides to rewrite the index with "Pre-Submergence Topography." Her choices create the key turn from passive indexing to active resistance. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is observational sorting rather than a forced choice. Causal pressure and closure linkage present; cost is her solitary burden.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Stamp introduced early (tin box, brass cube), used in two distinct beats (wrist imprint, water-surface phosphorescence), and its glyph revelation drives closure choice to copy the inverse. Charged reprise: wrist mark "fading yet warm" at ending. Irreplaceable: the glyph's street-grid mechanics and negative-space logic are unique. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" named three times: blackout ceases pumps, absolute black after lantern extinction, private pressure post-discovery. It shapes the tactic of extinguishing the lantern (middle choice) and reappears at closure as "inside her held, a private pressure." Two gates (middle, payoff); setup is implicit. Functions as atmosphere and internal state; constrains one choice. Lyric reprise reweights but does not create decisive cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears twice as label: stamp's imprint "listened to her pulse and found it wanting," wrist mark at ending "fading yet warm—tranquilly perceptive." No on-page action constrained or enabled by this trait; it describes the stamp's effect rather than Mara's capability. Ornamental use without pressure; swappable with "calmly observant." Missing middle development; closure mention is cameo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Readjust" signals Mara's job early, she performs it mid-story (placing cards with identical bruise patterns together), and at closure she "readjust[s]" by beginning a new taxonomy column. Two beats plus closure framing; the action redefines her task from compliance to resistance. Causal pressure: the blackout enables unapproved readjustment, and the final rewrite enacts her decision. Irreplaceable: swapping for "reorganize" would lose the institutional mandate vs. subversive reinterpretation tension.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" appears twice: glyph as map not word, stamp's imprint requires darkness. Both hypotheses are tested on the page (wrist imprint, lantern extinction), and the second drives the phosphorescent revelation. Signaled and mechanics matter; shapes middle attempt. Missing strong closure participation beyond enabling the climax. One distinct beat plus setup; causal but not charged at ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Library introduced in opening line, pressures every choice: flooded atrium limits movement, bronze drawers supply bruised cards, rising water forces touch-reading, darkness enables phosphorescent glyph. Micro-settings (water surface, marble floor) alter tactics. Setting enables the climactic discovery (phosphorescent plankton) and shapes closure image (ascending stairwell, surfacing). All three gates met; irreplaceable causal participation and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Blackout established in opening line, enables stamp use by scrambling the grid, tracked through "hours dripped past" and pump restart at closure. Tightens decisions: Mara must work in darkness, lantern dims forcing extinction choice. Time pressure is live but soft (no countdown urgency); blackout functions as enabler and atmosphere. Two gates (setup, closure) met; middle tracking present but not acute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Trace honest origins" voiced early, drives tactile investigation of bruised cards, sharpens when she sees indentations as "silent witness," and culminates in decision to copy the glyph's inverse ("honest origins traced in bruised paper"). Friction between wanting truth and the cost of defying the Council is implicit in her solitary work and "private pressure." Three gates met; causal across beats; closure participation strong. Cost is social risk rather than internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve—light and shadow alternating inside her like breathing"—names the tone once at closure decision. Tone modulates coherently from investigative calm to discovery intensity to quiet resistance, supporting pressure. However, the phrase itself is ornamental and appears only once, functioning as thematic label rather than recurring constraint. Lyric reprise attempted but not fully earned; closure linkage present. One gate (payoff); missing setup and middle development as active element.</comment>
