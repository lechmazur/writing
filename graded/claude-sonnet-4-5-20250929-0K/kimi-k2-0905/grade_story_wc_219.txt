<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—proving return is chemical reaction—is clear and consistent, and her final action (planting the empty amber) carries cost in that it abandons pursuit without resolution. Interiority is often concrete ("scent of stove gas, creak of a stair she never noticed she noticed"), but the vision sequence relies on abstract constructions ("not as it was, but as her body remembered it") that soften embodied stakes. The "luminous skeptic" label recurs without complication, and no contradictory impulse tests her hypothesis mid-climb; she observes more than she struggles.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (tower, spring, after first contact). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Mara follows sculpture-path footprints, climbs, activates the amber, inhales spores, experiences vision, descends as the tower collapses, plants the shard. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the amber becomes "a record" of decay rather than a map of return—with conceptual cost (abandoning the chase). One meaningful deepening occurs when the spores trigger the vision, reweighting her hypothesis. Minor causality question: the tower's collapse mechanism is unexplained and feels convenient rather than earned by her action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, moss-softened earth, wet lichen, and spring runoff provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through Mara's scientific lens. The amber shard constrains her path (she presses it to the seventh sculpture, it floats in the convergence chamber) and charges the final image (she plants it in soil). Spatial choreography is clean: base → sculpture path → spiral staircase → dome → descent. The sculpture path's "dusty footprints" and "overgrown" state matter thematically but don't alter her tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prove return is reaction, not reunion. Pressure accumulates through the amber's pulse, tower hum, and spore inhalation, culminating in the vision that tests her hypothesis. One meaningful tightening: the vision forces her to experience homecoming as chemistry, which she then acts on by planting the shard and walking away. The tower's collapse adds urgency but feels externally imposed rather than driven by her choice. Cost is conceptual (she stops chasing home) but the path literally erasing behind her reads slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—homecoming as chemical reaction versus myth—emerges organically from Mara's hypothesis, the offworlders' nostalgia, and the spore-triggered vision. The final image (planting the empty amber to fossilize again "as a record" not "a map") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "They wanted Earth to be what it never was" and the eroded sculpture faces. The "studying its decay" closing line risks stating theme but stays within Mara's scientific voice. One minor slip: "nostalgia's isotope" and "reaction, not a reunion" edge toward prompt-echo phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Mara; perceptual signature (scientific lens: "chemistry of homecoming," "cyanotype rinse," "isotope") is distinct and consistent. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Diction stays anchored in Mara's academic-rebellious register ("luminous skeptic," "failed catalyst"). Some filter verbs appear ("She saw," "She believed," "She had come to understand") but don't dull immediacy in peak beats. One rhythm slip: "She paused... She climbed... She stepped... She activated..." creates template cadence in the tower sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("cello made of bone," "time-lapse of extinction"). Information density is high; lines often do multiple jobs. Two distinct artifacts lower the score: repeated "She [verb]" stems in the tower climb (paras 9–13) create template cadence (−0.4), and the vision sequence recycles "She saw" three times in succession without variation (−0.3). The phrase "reaction, not a reunion" and "failed catalyst" risk thesaurus-itis but stay within voice. No paraphrase loops; propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The amber-as-map-of-returns premise and offworlder nostalgia offer a fresh synthesis of SF and phenomenology. Mara's scientific framing (chemistry of homecoming, nostalgia's isotope) personalizes the concept. The tower-as-failed-pilgrimage-node and sculpture path add specificity. Minor derivative notes: the mystical-object-in-ancient-tower and the collapsing-structure-as-she-leaves beats follow recognizable templates, and the vision sequence (childhood sensory memories, mother's hands) uses familiar emotional scaffolding. The "studying its decay" closing gesture transforms pursuit into acceptance but feels slightly predictable given the setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's choices (follow path, press amber to sculpture, climb, activate recorder, inhale spores, plant shard, walk on) drive all major beats. Early signal (opening line). Present in setup (skeptic rejecting offworlders' nostalgia), middle (activating recorder, declaring intent), and payoff (planting shard, walking on). Her decision to stop chasing and "study decay" closes the arc with conceptual cost. Label "luminous skeptic" recurs without complication, and no meaningful internal contradiction tests her. Mid-band: essential across beats, closure cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fly amber appears in four distinct beats: (1) opening description as "map" gift, (2) pressed to seventh sculpture triggering tower hum, (3) floating in convergence chamber where fly dissolves into spores, (4) planted empty in soil at end. Early signal (para 3). Development: enables tower activation and spore vision. Payoff: planted with reweighted meaning ("record" not "map"). Causal pressure: its dissolution triggers the vision that changes Mara's stance. Cost connection: she abandons the "map" premise. Strong integration; one step below indispensable because the vision content (childhood home) could theoretically occur through other means.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The artificial pilgrimage frames Mara's journey (following footprints left by believers, sculpture path calibrated for emotional resonance) and is declared in the opening. It shapes her tactical choice to follow the path and provides thematic contrast (she follows "not in faith, but in hypothesis"). Present in setup (para 2), development (sculpture path sequence), and payoff (path erased behind her). The concept charges the final image (walking on without path) but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost—she was always going to climb. Mid-band: one key turn plus thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Academically rebellious since her expulsion from the Orbital Chemistry Guild" is mentioned once (para 6) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. It explains why she pursues the hypothesis alone but remains a backstory label rather than a trait that creates friction in a present choice. Missing development and payoff gates. Functional context for her stance but replaceable with "independent researcher" or similar. Low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Converge" appears in the convergence chamber (para 12), where the amber floats and the spores trigger the vision. Early signal (chamber named for its function). Development: the chamber's dormant field draws the amber, enabling the spore release. Payoff: the vision itself is a convergence of past sensory memory and present chemistry. Causal role in the climactic beat. One step below essential: the vision could occur in a differently named space without breaking logic, though the Guild's "synchronize memory with orbital archives" detail adds resonance. Solid mid-to-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Dusty footprints on the overgrown sculpture path are mentioned twice (paras 8–9): left by believers, then Mara's own prints erased during descent. Early signal (para 8). The path provides a route she follows, but the mechanics (why dusty if overgrown? how do prints erase?) are not clarified and do not shape a tactical choice with cost. Payoff: her prints vanish as the path disappears, contributing to the closure image but not causally active. Lyric reprise lifts it into the 5s; lack of mechanical pressure holds it there.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower in spring is signaled in the opening line and present throughout: moss-softened earth at the base, wet lichen and spring runoff on the staircase, convergence chamber at the top. Setup, development (climb through slick stone, water drop from apex triggers fly's movement), and payoff (tower collapses as she descends). The spring rain provides the water drop that dissolves the fly into spores, a causal link. The tower's collapse adds urgency to her descent. Micro-setting (body in space) constrains movement. Strong integration; just shy of indispensable because the spore release mechanism feels slightly external.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After making first contact with the offworlders" anchors the story's premise (para 2) and explains the amber gift and Mara's multi-year decoding effort. Present in setup but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—the pilgrimage unfolds in story-present without a live clock. Missing development gate (no mid-scene pressure from elapsed time) and payoff gate (ending does not reference the timeframe). Functional context but replaceable; any post-contact window would serve. Low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To understand the chemistry of homecoming" is stated explicitly (para 7) and dramatized through Mara's actions: decoding the amber, climbing the tower, activating the recorder, declaring "return is a reaction, not a reunion," experiencing the spore vision. Early signal (para 7). Development: the vision forces her to experience homecoming as embodied chemistry. Payoff: planting the shard and "studying its decay" resolves the desire with conceptual cost (she stops seeking understanding of return and accepts study of its loss). One beat of friction: the vision complicates her thesis slightly (body remembers involuntarily) but she does not struggle on the page. Solid mid-to-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" is embodied in the eroded bronze sculptures (para 10: "palms open as if waiting for rain that never came," face "eroded smooth") and modulates subtly: opening contemplation, tower hum as "chord struck on a cello made of bone," vision intensity, quiet descent. Setup and payoff present (sculptures fall, Mara walks quietly on). The tone charges the final image ("walked on—no longer chasing home, but studying its decay") and remains coherent through turns. One friction: the spore vision and tower collapse introduce intensity that momentarily breaks the quiet, though the ending restores it. Mid-band: coherent with modulation, but the single static register (contemplative distance) holds it below 7.0.</comment>
