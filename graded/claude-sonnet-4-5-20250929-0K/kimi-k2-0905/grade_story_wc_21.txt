<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation is clear and body-bound ("throat full of salt," boots sinking), though the peak choice—broadcasting the diary—arrives quickly after discovery with limited dramatized internal conflict between preservation instinct and exposure risk. The embodied grief and professional identity coheres well. Minor slip: the moment of deciding to broadcast lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves from kneeling to action without visible hesitation or cost-weighing on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Mireya's broadcast is a Decisive Change with social and personal cost visible in "crown me or crucify me" and the act itself. Lens: Causal; the lagoon's retrocognitive cipher drives each beat, narrowing options until she trades her future for the past, then acts. Orientation anchors early (zeppelin, archivist, lagoon by ~80 words). One meaningful tightening when she offers her own death-date and the final page surfaces. Cost is legible in the irreversible broadcast and futures closing "like doors."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon constrains action (sand as shackles, water as cipher) and charges the ending image (speaking "above the obsidian lagoon that once swallowed light and now gave it back"). The debris-grammar system is vivid and purpose-driven. The floating library zeppelin anchors early but remains largely backdrop after the descent; it provides the loudhailer at closure but does not pressure mid-scene choices. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("hot glass-grain," "liquid night").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unearthing suppressed testimony—is signaled early and tightens when Mireya must trade her own future milestones for pages. The parley escalates through iterative offerings, each costing a personal tomorrow, culminating in the mother's confession and the broadcast choice. Agency is clear: she arranges the grammar, accepts encoded memory, and chooses to read aloud over the capital. The cost is visible ("years rearrange inside me, futures closing") and forecloses the path of silence. One causal reversal when the final page reveals betrayal, forcing the broadcast decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus erasure, the archive as witness—emerges through the cipher parley and the broadcast act, not statement. The obsidian lagoon shifts from trap to ally, and the debris-grammar becomes a negotiation of memory and futurity. The ending offers a resonant answer: speaking names "above the obsidian lagoon" makes them "unerasable," reweighting the opening silence. No overt moralizing; the final image of burnt-ink sunset and uncertain reception sustains ambiguity. The mother's betrayal complicates without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and dense: "liquid night under day," "throat full of salt," "kerosene onto a ready flame." Psychic distance is stable first-person, anchored in Mireya's perceptual signature (archival vocabulary, grief-soaked imagery). Diction remains elevated but character-consistent (civil-rights archivist, poetic register). No head-hopping. Elision is purposeful: the broadcast itself is compressed to preserve momentum and let the image land. Rhythm modulates with pressure; the final long sentence accelerates through the crowd's response without muddling clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance lagoon mechanics, memory discovery, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives at revelation, longer syntax during the parley). Minor scaffold: "I understood: the lagoon did not merely remember; it encrypted memory" is conceptually redundant with prior action. The metaphor "futures closing like doors" is apt but borders stock. No paraphrase loops or filter stacks in peak beats. Opening and closing lines anchor and recharge effectively. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The combination—retrocognitive lagoon + debris cipher + floating archive + broadcast confrontation—synthesizes fresh specifics. The debris-as-grammar system and trading future dates for past pages are non-obvious and earn the discovery. Risk is present: compressed exposition of the parley could flatten, but density sustains pressure. The mother's betrayal complicates the hero-archivist premise without retreating to safe middle ground. The floating library and loudhailer closure is bold and fits the zeppelin frame. Transformation test passes: changing names/places would break the archival identity and retrocognitive logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mireya's choices drive every key turn: she radios for isolation, arranges the debris grammar, trades her future milestones, accepts the mother's confession, and orders the broadcast. Setup: she is introduced as "solemn civil-rights archivist" in the opening line. Development: her parley with the lagoon occupies the middle third, each offering narrowing options. Closure: she commands the helmsman and reads aloud, making the broadcast the final decisive act. Causal pressure is undeniable; her decisions foreclose silence and expose her to political consequence. Irreplaceable: the archivist role and grief over her mother's betrayal are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in the opening third ("black mirror," "liquid night"), drives the parley beats (encrypts memory, projects pages), and returns in the final image ("above the obsidian lagoon that once swallowed light and now gave it back"). Setup, development, and closure all hinge on it. Causal: it traps Mireya, demands a grammar, releases the diary pages, and shifts from captor to witness. Specificity: its retrocognitive cipher and physical properties (sand shackles, water spelling) are unique. Cost: trading futures and accepting encoded memory. Irreplaceable; removing it breaks the entire premise and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: the encrypted diary fragment appears mid-story ("tin box…fifteen lines shaved by flame"). Development: the lagoon's cipher mechanic and Mireya's debris-grammar offerings are attempts to decrypt and complete the diary. Closure: "the decrypted diary" is what she reads aloud, making the discovery integral to the broadcast. Causal: the diary drives the parley and the final revelation of betrayal forces the broadcast choice. Cost: trading her future and accepting shame. Minor friction: the diary itself is not physically handled on-page beyond the fragment and final lashing; the discovery is more conceptual presence than tactile beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is signaled early ("the lagoon replayed any grief it had tasted") and constrains Mireya ("sand closed over my ankles like shackles"). Development: the trap mechanic forces the parley; she cannot leave until the cipher is satisfied. Closure: "the retrocognitive trap loosened" after she accepts the final page, enabling her choice to walk away or act. Cost: the trap extracts her future as payment. Moderate integration: the attribute enables the parley but is somewhat swappable with other magical-confinement mechanics. It shapes two beats (trap initiation, release) but is not load-bearing to the broadcast decision itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: "I would have to give it a new key" frames the parley as negotiation. Development: the parley dominates the middle third; each configuration she lays prompts a response, trading future milestones for diary pages. Closure: the parley's completion ("cipher satisfied") enables her choice and the broadcast. Causal: without the parley, no pages surface and no broadcast occurs. The action is distinct and irreplaceable; swapping it for generic "discovery" would collapse the story's mechanics. Cost: years rearrange inside her. Strong integration across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: "I arranged beach debris as messages, building a grammar of shells and drift-bone" is signaled in the middle third. Development: the method is demonstrated on-page ("scallop edges for vowels, black urchin spines for stops") and drives the lagoon's responses. Closure: the method's completion ("final page surfaced") unlocks the cipher and enables the broadcast. Causal: the grammar is the means of parley; without it, no pages. Specificity: the debris-grammar system is unique and tied to the beach setting. Minor friction: it appears somewhat late (past the first third) and is compressed into one extended beat rather than spaced across multiple distinct uses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "floating library Biblioteca Volante" is named in the opening line, and the zeppelin gondola anchors the descent. Development: the zeppelin waits off-stage during the parley; it provides the cable for ascent but does not pressure mid-scene choices. Closure: Mireya orders the helmsman and uses the gondola's loudhailer to broadcast, making the zeppelin setting essential to the final act. Integration: the zeppelin frames the story and enables closure but is largely passive during the lagoon parley. It supplies resources (cable, loudhailer) rather than constraining tactics. Solid but not indispensable; a ground-based archive with a different broadcast method could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "after the letters are found" is implicit in "yesterday in a tin-roof cellar." Development: "Hour after hour I parleyed" signals duration during the lagoon sequence, and "sunset turned every page" anchors the ending in real time. Closure: the broadcast occurs as celebratory cannons fire, placing it in a charged temporal window. Time is tracked loosely rather than tightening as a live clock. It frames the parley and ending but does not narrow tactics or force a deadline-driven choice. Moderate integration: time is present and consistent but not a constraint that alters decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: Mireya's role as "civil-rights archivist" and her mother's diary fragment establish the motivation in the opening third. Development: "to break its cipher I would have to give it a new key" and the iterative offerings ("date I would finally publish," "hour of my own death") dramatize the cost of uncovering truth. Closure: "I could have walked away…Instead I lashed the decrypted diary…and began to read" crystallizes the choice between silence and exposure. Friction: the internal conflict between preservation and shame is compressed; she accepts the mother's betrayal and broadcasts quickly. Cost is visible ("crown me or crucify me"), and the motivation drives every beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "searing reverie" is enacted early through dense, elevated diction ("obsidian lagoon," "liquid night") and grief-soaked imagery. Development: tone modulates with pressure—meditative during the parley, taut at the mother's confession, expansive during the broadcast. Closure: "my voice a searing reverie drifting down like kerosene onto a ready flame" makes the tone literal and charges the final image. Coherence: the tone is consistent and purposeful, balancing lyric density with forward momentum. It shapes the reader's experience and underscores the thematic weight. Strong integration; the tone is indispensable to the story's texture and the closure's emotional impact.</comment>
