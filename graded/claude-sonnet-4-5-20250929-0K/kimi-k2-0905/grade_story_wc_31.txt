<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Jin's motivation to discover the color of sound drives his descent, and embodied details appear (the brass key cold at his throat, boots on tilting deck). However, interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor rather than contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The ending grants him realization without visible renunciation or cost that forecloses a path; he returns to his job enriched but unchanged in circumstance or commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though the "meteor hush" remains abstract. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases underwater, the phonograph cylinder provides a tonal crescendo, and the final image (pier lights that "sang the harbor awake in colors they could almost hear") reweights Jin's quest. Cost is conceptual—he leaves the vows sealed—but the price remains oblique rather than legible as a forfeited option or relational shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The submerged galleon *Mercy's Log* provides vivid spatial detail (broken ribs, bolted books, iron safe) and air-pocket choreography that Jin navigates cautiously. The bioluminescent plankton and glass shell are tactile anchors. The drowned library constrains Jin's breathing and choice of route, and the final image ties plankton trail to altered lamplight, charging the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and guides Jin's dive. One tightening occurs when he must breathe air pockets cautiously to avoid collapsing the archive. The phonograph cylinder provides a crescendo that narrows his understanding, yet the resolution feels granted by discovery rather than forced choice with visible tradeoff. The captain's instruction to "guide the one who listens back" lands as thematic echo rather than a decision that alters Jin's tactics or forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the synesthetic marriage of sound and light, the survival of vows—emerges through the pressed lily, the color-coded phonograph voices, and the final pier-lamp transformation. The piece resists overt moralizing. However, the captain's closing sentence ("vows survive every sinking") borders on thematic echo, and Jin's realization that "sound…had waited to paint him into its spectrum" reads as epiphany conferred rather than earned through friction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable. Diction is lyric and consistent ("meteor hush," "hiding behind truth," "the color of sound"), though the register stays elevated throughout without modulation under stress. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("Jin believed," "Jin realized") are sparse. The perceptual signature is poetic but uniform; sentence rhythm and lexicon do not shift with pressure, and the voice reads as authorial rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high in nearly every sentence ("meteor hush," "copper echo," "paper lanterns…hiding behind truth," "velvet," "star-smoke," "comet tail"), creating a pattern-taught lyric mode. However, mixed vehicles appear: "hiding behind truth the way old letters hide between pages" conflates concealment with storage, and "the click that tasted of green" blurs synesthesia into free association. Template cadence runs in the underwater sequence ("Jin's boots found…he breathed…he opened…he wandered…he reached…Jin set…Jin sealed…Jin rose"). Paraphrase loops: "discover the color of sound" recurs without escalation across paragraphs. Apply −0.8 for density without coherence and template stems; artifacts do not touch the closure image directly but pervade the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synesthetic quest and submerged-library premise offer a fresh angle. The phonograph-cylinder payoff and bioluminescent color-mapping are specific. Yet the emotional arc—solitary seeker gains insight and returns transformed—follows a familiar template, and the woman in salt-stained uniform vanishes without causal reprise. The final image is resonant but hinges on lyric assertion rather than a turn arising from prior constraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Jin appears in every beat: he lights lamps, receives the key, dives, navigates the wreck, plays the cylinder, and returns to the pier. His choices (leaving the lamp-ladder, diving, sealing the safe) drive progression. However, the descent feels inevitable rather than conflicted; no competing option or visible cost attaches to his decision to dive or return.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hotel skeleton key tag is pressed into Jin's palm in paragraph four, tied around his neck in paragraph nine, unlocks the iron safe in paragraph fourteen ("The hotel skeleton key tag slid home with a click that tasted of green"), and is implicitly carried back to the surface. Three distinct beats: receipt, wearing, use. The key enables the phonograph discovery and thus shapes the closure, though it arrives as a gift rather than earned constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" frames the festival lanterns (paragraph three), names the phonograph cylinder (paragraph sixteen), and charges the ending when Jin "sealed the safe, leaving the luminous vows echoing inside" and lights his lamps "with a different tint." The concept shapes the dominant stake (vows that "stay luminous long after voices die") and the closure image (pier lights that "sang the harbor awake"). Cost is conceptual: Jin leaves the vows sealed rather than extracting them, and the final transformation is granted rather than chosen with tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" appears twice: in paragraph three ("their collective glow hiding behind truth") and paragraph eighteen ("hiding behind truth the revelation that every human sound is merely light"). The phrase remains metaphoric decoration; it does not constrain an action or force a choice. No visible tradeoff or cost ties to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Signify" appears in the opening (Jin's nightly ritual "to signify"), the captain's final instruction ("guide…back to the surface to signify that vows survive"), and the ending ("every wick he lit now burned with a different tint, and sailors swore the pier lights sang"). The action bookends the arc and reweights the lamplighting from routine to testimony. However, Jin's return does not hinge on a decision to signify; the transformation occurs as realization rather than contested choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is named in paragraph six ("began to wander purposefully along the tide line") and paragraph twelve ("He wandered purposefully deeper"). The method describes Jin's movement but does not constrain his attempts or create friction; replacing it with "searching" or "moving" would not alter story logic. Mid-band for two appearances without mechanical cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken ship *Mercy's Log* occupies paragraphs ten through twenty. Air pockets force cautious breathing (paragraph eleven), bolted books and the iron safe structure Jin's exploration (paragraphs twelve–fourteen), and the corroded player and bioluminescent plankton provide the closure payload (paragraphs sixteen–eighteen). The setting supplies resources (cylinder, safe) and constraints (air, tilt) that shape Jin's route and the phonograph discovery, and the plankton trail he brings to the surface charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The sky lantern release appears in paragraphs three, six, nine (lanterns' reflections guide Jin), twenty-one ("the last sky lantern drifted west"), and the ending (sailors' testimony). The timeframe is signaled and provides atmospheric continuity, but it does not tighten decisions or create a clock that alters Jin's tactics. Mid-band for presence across beats without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To discover the color of sound" is stated in paragraphs two and eight, dramatized when the pressed lily's sigh strikes Jin as "a soft vermilion flare" (paragraph thirteen), and the phonograph voices ignite the plankton spectrum (paragraph eighteen). The motivation drives Jin's dive and frames the closure realization ("he had not come to discover…the sound…had waited to paint him"). Friction is present in his childhood hunt and the need for "more chords to map the full spectrum," though the resolution grants discovery rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" bookends the story (paragraphs one, ten, twenty-two) and modulates underwater to "velvet" thickness (paragraph ten). The tone supports the lyric lens and charges the final inhale ("He broke the surface, inhaled the meteor hush"). However, the phrase remains abstract—no concrete anchor explains what "meteor hush" sounds or feels like—and the tone does not shift under pressure, maintaining uniform elevation throughout.</comment>
