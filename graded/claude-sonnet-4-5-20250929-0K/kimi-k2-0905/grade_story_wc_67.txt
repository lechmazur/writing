<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to memorialize her grandmother through art is clear and embodied through concrete actions (grinding porcelain, positioning the chair, scattering powder). The installation work provides physical anchor, but the character remains largely reflective rather than tested by meaningful choice under pressure. Internal contradiction exists in the tension between telling herself "it was just furniture" while knowing its emotional weight, yet no on-page decision forces her to confront competing impulses with visible cost. The grief is rendered through tactile detail (charcoal-stained fingers, mask edges pressing cheekbones) rather than diagnostic labels, which elevates the work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of spiraling, fragmented memory early and maintains it through the installation's physical spiral and the grandmother's incomplete stories. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena at the spiral's center, scattering powder while understanding that "safety is always a mirage we create from incomplete information"—a crystallization that reconfigures her relationship to her grandmother's withheld truths. The cost is legible: she continues scattering "smaller spirals...each grain a moment her grandmother had held back, each spiral a confession that arrives too late to change anything except the shape of absence itself." The single-scene continuous window with one transition (evening lighting shift) fits scope. Minor orientation delay (gallery context established gradually) does not obscure comprehension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vanishing point gallery functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: Elena positions herself at the convergence where "all stories converge and dissolve," making spatial geometry inseparable from thematic closure. The rocking chair's runners against hardwood, the track lighting creating halo effects on porcelain shards, and the powder catching light "like the mica in sidewalk concrete" are filtered through Elena's artist's eye. The automatic lighting shift at evening creates a temporal anchor and visual transformation that makes the spiral "appear to move." Setting details constrain Elena's careful angle calculations and sight-line measurements, demonstrating how space shapes her installation choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elena's need to tell/complete her grandmother's fragmented story through art installation. The story provides one meaningful deepening through accumulation—each act of positioning, scattering, adjusting the mask layers additional understanding onto "incomplete information" as method and theme. However, no reversal or choice-point forces Elena to relinquish a path or make a trade-off with felt consequence; the installation proceeds as planned without opposition or internal conflict testing her commitment. The cost arrives conceptually at closure ("arrives too late to change anything") but Elena's agency throughout is execution rather than decision under competing pressures. The steady accumulation fits Accumulative lens but lacks the tightening that would push into higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the spiral pattern, powdered porcelain, incomplete stories, and the vanishing point converge without thesis statement. The final image—Elena scattering powder in smaller orbits "like planets around a dying star"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how we memorialize what was never fully known. "Safety is always a mirage we create from incomplete information" and "love is the powder we scatter to mark the places where truth and fiction become indistinguishable" operate as insights earned through the physical acts of grinding, assembling, positioning, scattering rather than assertions. The mask shard that "had reflected her grandmother's face as she died, capturing that final moment when the rocking motion transformed from habit into memory" transforms recurrence into meaning. No moralizing; ambiguity preserved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and filters all perception through Elena's artist's sensibility: "charcoal-stained fingers," sight-line calculations, the way light catches porcelain "like the mica in sidewalk concrete, like the glitter her grandmother had once mixed into paste." Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("that safety is always a mirage...that love is the powder we scatter") that feels imposed rather than organically thought in the moment, particularly in the final paragraph where multiple abstract formulations cluster. The prose remains legible and voice-motivated overall, with strong rhythmic control in the opening's converging clauses and the final spiraling sentences that mirror content.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: the final paragraph stacks four figurative constructions without breathing room ("like the mica in sidewalk concrete, like the glitter...like the crystallized tears") and deploys three sequential abstractions beginning "that safety...that love...that a fleeting emotion." Template cadence appears in parallel "the way" constructions: "the way her grandmother's hands shook...the way her voice cracked...the way she always changed." The opening's "swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light" and the triple simile cluster constitute figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, triggering deduction. Propulsion is strong in physical action beats (positioning chair, scattering powder) but bogs in the reflective spirals. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected. Proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vanishing point as literal and metaphorical convergence offers a fresh frame, and the mask made from bathroom tiles transforms domestic detritus into art object with genuine specificity. The spiral installation as physical manifestation of incomplete stories shows synthesis. However, the core emotional arc—artist processes grief through installation about deceased grandmother's withheld secrets—follows a well-worn template. The piece transforms it through the particular geometry (vanishing point, spirals, calculated angles) and the porcelain's journey from medicine cabinet to ground powder, but the fundamental stance (elegy for incomplete knowledge) does not surprise. Risk-taking in the dense, spiraling prose style heightens coherence without obscuring clarity, meriting small positive adjustment within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena present throughout; grounds, positions, scatters, adjusts. Setup early (first paragraph). Development: positioning the chair at calculated angles shows decision-making that shapes the installation. Payoff: she stands at spiral's center scattering powder in the final image. However, her choices execute a plan rather than respond to pressure or reversal; no beat where competing impulses force a turn. Causal pressure modest: the decisions alter the installation's form but not Elena's understanding until the reflective closure. Closure linkage strong (she's the active figure). Swappability moderate—another memorial artist would function similarly. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, beat involvement (positioning, scattering) +0.9, limited causal pressure (execution not turn) +0.3, modest cost connection +0.2 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mask introduced early (first paragraph, "porcelain mask she'd spent three months assembling"). Development: "The mask went on last, its porcelain edges pressing against her cheekbones"; she adjusts it to align eyes with the largest shard. Payoff: "Elena stands...the mask becoming her face becoming the story." Three beats with escalating intimacy. The shard that reflected grandmother's dying face gives it irreplaceable specificity. Causal pressure: the mask mediates Elena's perception and literally frames her view through the reflective shard, constraining how she sees/completes the story. Closure linkage clear. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (frames perception) +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (dying-face shard) +0.7, cost (edges pressing, embodied grief) +0.4, minor swappability concern (another memorial object could serve) -0.4 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mirage of safety appears explicitly only in the final paragraph's abstraction: "that safety is always a mirage we create from incomplete information." Setup absent from first third; first mention is conceptual summary at closure. Development: the grandmother's withheld truths and changed names imply safety-seeking, but "safety" as lens or stake is not dramatized in Elena's choices. Payoff: stated theme but not enacted pressure. The concept shapes interpretation more than tactics. Late appearance (final third) -0.8, ornamental/thematic rather than operational -0.8, summary-only -0.6, no middle beat involvement -0.3 = cap at ~4.6 per late-intro rule, modest thematic resonance holds it near that ceiling at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" demonstrated in opening: "She'd woven the truth carefully for this moment: telling the gallery owner the chair was an art installation, telling herself it was just furniture, telling the porcelain fragments they were merely materials." Setup strong and early. Development: the attribute governs how Elena presents the installation and herself. Payoff: her scattering of powder and the spiral design embody careful arrangement of partial truth. The grandmother's same trait (weaving truth with gaps) mirrors and motivates Elena's method. Cost visible: the careful framing enables the installation but also perpetuates incompleteness. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (telling multiple versions) +0.4, causal pressure (enables installation, shapes communication) +1.0, closure linkage (spiral as woven truth) +1.2, mirrored trait adds specificity +0.6, cost (perpetuates gaps) +0.4, modest swappability (other deceptive traits could serve) -0.5, label-only in middle (not re-dramatized between setup and close) -0.3 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Scattering powder introduced early ("ground the remaining porcelain herself"), developed mid-story ("begins to scatter the powdered porcelain"), and dominates the ending ("Elena continues scattering powder in smaller spirals"). Three distinct beats. The action is irreplaceable: it literalizes dispersal of memory, enacts the ritual, and creates the spiral's physical form. Causal pressure high: without scattering, the installation and its meaning collapse. Closure linkage maximal—the final image is Elena scattering. Cost legible: "each grain a moment her grandmother had held back, each spiral a confession that arrives too late." Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, high causal pressure +1.4, closure dominance +1.8, irreplaceability +0.8, cost connection +0.6, no frictions detected = ~8.4 (rounding per nearest 0.1, strong integration shy of indispensable due to modest surprise factor).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Incomplete information" as method appears early in grandmother's "stories that grew more fragmented," reinforced by "her grandmother weaving truth...leaving gaps," and explicit at closure: "incomplete information" phrase used. Setup and payoff present. Development: Elena's interpretive work and the installation's gaps embody the method. However, mechanics remain conceptual rather than tactical—Elena doesn't make a choice where withholding/revealing information alters outcome. The method describes texture more than constrains action. Early mention (grandmother's stories) +0.6, closure phrase +0.8, thematic presence but limited operational pressure +0.4, no middle choice hinging on info control -0.3, swappable with "partial knowledge" -0.4, summary/thematic rather than enacted -0.5 = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vanishing point gallery introduced in opening line, its converging walls shape Elena's positioning of the chair "at the vanishing point," and the final image places her "at the spiral's center" where "all stories converge and dissolve." Three beats. The setting's geometry constrains Elena's installation choices: "weeks calculating the angle, measuring sight lines." Closure linkage strong—the spatial metaphor anchors the final reconfiguration. Specificity high (vanishing point is unique architectural feature). Cost connection modest—space enables rather than costs. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (angle calculations) +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (vanishing point) +0.7, cost weak (no forfeiture) +0.1, swappability moderate (another symbolic space could serve) -0.5 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Timeframe anchored in title phrase and opening beats: "its motion finally stilled after Elena had carried it," "The chair's runners whispered...as it settled," "As the old rocking chair finally slows to stop." The slowing/stopping marks the ritual's beginning and frames the entire installation sequence. Payoff: "The chair remains still, its work complete" in final paragraph. The cessation of rocking motion functions as temporal and thematic hinge—transformation from habit into memory. Two strong beats (opening cessation, final stillness confirmation). Causal pressure: the stopping enables/permits Elena's scattering ritual. Closure linkage clear. Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables ritual) +1.2, closure presence +1.4, specificity (rocking-to-still transition) +0.7, cost (grandmother's death/absence) +0.5, slight swappability (another temporal marker could work) -0.4 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated in final paragraph: "to crystallize a fleeting emotion" within the passage "a fleeting emotion can crystallize into something permanent if we rock long enough." Setup absent from first third. Development: Elena's assembly of mask, positioning of chair, and scattering of powder can be read as crystallization attempts, but the desire is not named or dramatized as stake until closure. Payoff theme-stated but not choice-tested. The motivation describes outcome more than drives friction. Late first appearance (final third) -0.9, thematic rather than operational -0.7, no middle beat where crystallization desire conflicts with cost -0.4, summary-only articulation -0.5, interpretive fit (the actions align retroactively) +0.6, closure linkage (phrase appears there) +0.8 = cap ~4.6 per late intro, thematic resonance lifts to ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Somber established immediately ("swallowed sound," "grief," funeral imagery) and sustained through mortuary details (grandmother's death, powder from remains, "dying star"). Marvel present in "halo effect," the porcelain catching light, spiral's visual movement, and "vanishing point" wonder. Tone modulates with lighting shift and accumulating spirals but remains coherent. The combination charges the final image: somber in "confession that arrives too late," marvel in the planetary orbit metaphor and the powder's glitter. Two-note tone maintained across all beats without flattening. Coherence +1.2, modulation (lighting, intensification) +0.9, closure charge (somber marvel in final image) +1.6, setup early +0.8, no static-mood penalty, sustained across pressure +0.7, minor ornamental risk (beautiful language could distract) -0.3 = ~7.9.</comment>
