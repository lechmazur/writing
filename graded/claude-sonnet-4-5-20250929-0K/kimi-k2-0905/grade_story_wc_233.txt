<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The queen's motivations are present but abstract—"mystery of recurring dreams" drives her, yet internal contradiction is minimal and micro-choices under pressure are largely absent. Interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("shared exhale between her present and future selves") rather than embodied emotion or concrete struggle. The final choice to step onto the dais and accept erasure arrives without visible wrestle between contradictory impulses acting in scene. Backstory floods the piece (dream prophecy, courtier behavior, mirror-blurring) without anchoring to present micro-decisions that tilt stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: bleeding starlight and ember imagery recur and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the queen becomes the loop's origin, fireflies signal continuity). Cost is conceptual—erasure and loop acceptance—but legibility at closure is diffuse; the final image ("hidden crown burned gently somewhere above clouds") names cost obliquely rather than showing a concrete before/after. Orientation anchors (who/where) arrive within ~120 words; one transition (climb to ridge crest) is clear. Causality relies on dream-memory rather than protagonist agency narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The grotto's physical details—basalt steps glowing with "residue of fallen constellations," black glass lined with ember stones, temperature inversion—are vivid and purposeful. The obsidian shard on the dais functions as a tool that reveals the loop, constraining the queen's final choice. Spatial choreography is coherent across the climb and grotto interior. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual and thermal (warmth/frost paradox), with less embodiment of sound or smell under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent kingdom from forgetting her name—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the climb and pooling starlight, but escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency under the inferred Accumulative lens. The queen's final choice (step onto dais, accept crown) is a renunciation with conceptual cost, yet the turn lacks a visible trade-off or live option foreclosed on the page. Coincidence (dream-loop mechanics) complicates but does not resolve, fitting Accumulative mode, though one meaningful deepening via protagonist decision is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—loop, memory, sacrifice to prevent catastrophe—emerges from recurring starlight and mirror imagery. The ending offers a non-literal answer: accepting the loop charges the crown and sustains the world. Subtext operates in the "shared exhale" and fireflies as witnesses, though the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("mystery unraveled not by answers but by accepting the loop"). Motifs (bleeding starlight, ember stones, mirrors cracking) recur with purpose, charging the closure image. Epiphany is asserted more than earned through specific struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Diction is lush and elevated ("lacy menace," "coppery air, tasting iron, tasting endings"), consistent throughout but occasionally slips into decorative phrasing that stalls momentum ("a lacy menace that wrapped her lungs with threads of ice"). Psychic distance remains close; narrative certainty matches the focalizer's knowledge. Perceptual signature is poetic but not sharply character-particular—similar phrasing could fit many fantasy protagonists. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across most sentences, creating texture but also momentum drag in high-pressure beats: "bleeding starlight pooled in her palms, warm as a child's fever" stacks metaphor atop image without propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "the ember grotto on the ridge" repeats three times; "bleeding starlight" appears five times with synonym drift ("sky-liquid," "memory escaping the world"). Template cadence in the final third ("The disenchanted queen smiled... Outside, fireflies drifted... And though no chronicle...") flattens rhythm. Register is consistently elevated but information density suffers under ornamental layering. Pronoun references are clear; no grammar breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The time-loop premise (future self warns past self) is familiar; transformation through bleeding starlight as memory-currency and the grotto as loop-anchor offers specificity. The climax—becoming the loop's origin—grows from prior imagery but feels conceptually inevitable rather than fresh. Emotional specificity is limited; the queen's internal experience reads poetic but generic. The fireflies and shared-exhale motif add lyric grace without sharp narrative ingenuity. Risk-taking in structure (heavy interiority, lyric closure) is present but does not overcome derivative loop mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen is the POV throughout and makes the final choice to step onto the dais, accepting the crown. Setup: present from the first line. Development: her climb and discovery of the shard constrain the final choice. Payoff: she steps onto the dais in the ending beat. However, the decision is more surrender to conceptual inevitability than a choice that alters tactics with visible cost—she "realized... stepped onto the dais, letting the bleeding starlight crown settle," passive construction that limits agency markers. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, passivity and late causal pressure −0.8, ornamental framing −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember grotto on the ridge appears in the opening dream command, frames the climb (halfway mark: "At the ridge crest the ember grotto yawned"), and houses the dais where the crown settles in the ending. Setup: signaled in paragraph one. Development: the grotto's interior (obsidian shard, ember stones, temperature paradox) constrains the queen's choice. Payoff: "The ember stones flared, the cobalt grotto above clouds sighed" in the final beat. The grotto's physical properties (black glass, pulsing coals, warmth/frost inversion) matter to the closure image. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.5, phrase repetition −0.4, swappability with "ancient cave" −1.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is introduced in paragraph one ("following the bleeding starlight that seeped from the sky"), appears repeatedly as memory escaping the world ("pooled in her palms, warm as a child's fever"), and coagulates into the crown at closure ("bleeding starlight thickened, coagulating into the shape of a crown"). Setup: paragraph one. Development: mid-climb realization that it is memory dripping away alters her urgency. Payoff: the crown settles onto her hair, "its weight both coronation and erasure." The concept shapes stakes (memory loss) and the ending's mechanics (crown as vessel). Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure +1.2, phrase repetition across five mentions −0.5, swappability with "fading memories" −1.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Softly commanding appears twice as a label for the dream voice: "a voice softly commanding her to find the ember grotto" (paragraph one) and "the softly commanding voice belonged to her own mouth ten years hence" (climax beat). Setup: paragraph one. Development: absent—no mid-scene action constrained or enabled by this attribute. Payoff: the phrase returns at the shard revelation and again in the penultimate paragraph ("becoming the softly commanding voice"). The attribute describes tone but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Score: early signal +0.4, closure echo +0.5, label-only with no action pressure −1.2, swappable with "urgent whisper" −0.7, summary-only −0.6, introduced after 40% cap waived (present in para 1), missing middle development cap 3.4 applied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Climb structures the entire narrative: the queen climbs the ridge following starlight, ascends basalt steps, reaches the crest, and the final choice occurs at the grotto summit. Setup: paragraph two ("she began to climb the basalt steps"). Development: "Halfway up, the bleeding starlight pooled in her palms" alters her understanding. Payoff: "To climb back down would seal the fate she foresaw; to stay would burn the last of her living memory into the crown"—the climb's completion enables the ending choice. The action is irreplaceable; the story's spatial and causal arc depends on ascent. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.8, cost connection +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>A shared exhale appears once in the climax: "With a shared exhale between her present and future selves, she stepped onto the dais." Spotting the first fireflies of summer occurs immediately after: "heard the first fireflies of summer flicker into existence outside." Setup: absent until the ending beat. Development: neither method is signaled or used mid-story. Payoff: both elements appear in the final action, charging the closure image. The exhale marks the loop-acceptance moment; fireflies witness and guide future climbers in the denouement. Score: closure linkage +1.2, two elements in ending beat +0.6, late first appearance (final third) −1.0, ornamental (not mechanics that shape attempts) −0.8, resolves without prior setup −0.9, introduced after 40% cap 4.6 applied, missing setup cap 4.6 applied, missing middle cap 3.4 applied (lowest cap wins: 3.4), lyric-resonance allowance +1.5 for fireflies' charged return in final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto above clouds is named in the opening line and returns at closure: "The ember stones flared, the cobalt grotto above clouds sighed." Setup: first line. Development: the grotto's interior features (dais, shard, ember stones, temperature inversion) pressure the queen's choice. Payoff: the grotto "sighs" as mirrors crack, a lyric image that reconfigures the space as living witness. The setting constrains by location (ridge isolation) and internal paradox (warmth/frost). Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.9, specificity +0.5, swappability with "hidden cave above the world" −1.2, postcard description bias −1.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>After the final warning anchors the inciting moment: the astronomer's cracked glass delivers the warning, prompting the climb. Setup: paragraph one. Development: "Each night for three moons the same dream" and "before the fireflies appeared" create urgency, but elapsed time during the climb is untracked. Payoff: fireflies appear at closure, fulfilling the deadline. The timeframe tightens the decision conceptually but does not alter tactics on the page (no clock pressure mid-climb). Score: early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, one beat (dream deadline) +0.4, vague tracking (no sense of hours passing during climb) −0.6, deadline pressure is told rather than felt −0.6, summary-only for "three moons" −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To unravel the mystery of recurring dreams is stated explicitly in paragraph two and drives the climb. Setup: paragraph two. Development: discovering the shard and loop-origin realization directly address the mystery. Payoff: the queen accepts the loop, becoming its source—she unravels and then perpetuates the mystery. The motivation is dramatized through the climb and choice, though internal friction (wanting to solve vs. fearing the answer) is minimal. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure +1.0, some friction (laughed at prophecy, then belief forced by mirror-blur) +0.4, told-only phrasing ("driven by the need to unravel") −0.6, label-speak −0.3, swappable with "understand the visions" −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lacy menace appears once: "The air thinned into lace, a lacy menace that wrapped her lungs with threads of ice." Setup: paragraph two, mid-climb. Development: the phrase does not recur, but the grotto's paradox (warmth cradling skin, frost on eyelashes, "paradox that felt like forgiveness wrapped inside betrayal") echoes menace-within-beauty. Payoff: the final image of the "hidden crown burned gently somewhere above clouds" softens menace into sustained sacrifice. Tone is coherent—lyric dread modulates to acceptance—but "lacy menace" as a phrase is ornamental and not load-bearing. Score: one beat +0.4, closure modulation +0.8, tone coherence +0.6, single static label −0.5, decorative mention −0.3, swappable with "delicate threat" −0.7, late first appearance (second third) −0.3.</comment>
