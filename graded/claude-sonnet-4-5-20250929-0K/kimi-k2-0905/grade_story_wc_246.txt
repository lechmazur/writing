<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (threshing meaning) is consistent and embodied through the pen-wielding action. Interior life shows genuine contradiction—"confidently uncertain"—and the final choice to plant new seeds is earned by the anomaly's resolution. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("filaments," "contingent relationships") rather than concrete bodily struggle, and the climactic "unbending" moment lacks visceral cost; we're told she "felt relationships shift" rather than shown a foreclosed path. The renunciation of certainty reads more as theme statement than lived consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the anomaly's pressure accumulates through image and metaphor until the final "unbending" action reweights prior material. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mira reframes her "wrong seeds" as "merely early" and plants new spiral-questions, with the anomaly's hum functioning as both apology and invitation. Cost is legible in the power drain, floating moment, and the commitment to remain "uncertain enough." Orientation anchors (Mira, Station Lagrange-9, viewport, three cycles ago) arrive within the opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pen's scratch alters filaments and the child's laughter shifts from mockery to companionship. Mild penalty: the causal chain from pen-scratch to filament-shift to timeline-revision is asserted more than dramatized, and the "pre-threshed" paradox in paragraph four introduces light causal fog that slightly undercuts traceability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Station Lagrange-9, the viewport, comm-garden, and gravitational anomaly provide concrete spatial anchors. The anomaly constrains choice by borrowing station power and slackening gravity during the edit, making the environment a live participant. The pen's meteoric iridium nib and the quantum-buffer log-scroll add tactile specificity. Sensory detail—recycled air, warm soles of boots, anomaly's silver flare—is selective and grounded in Mira's professional attention. Minor gap: the comm-garden as a literal object and the "log-scroll" mechanics remain slightly underspecified, relying on metaphor over clear spatial logic; we never see Mira move through the station or handle seeds beyond the opening mention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake (thresh meaning from garbled signals, repair the wrong-seed mistake) is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes the anomaly has scrambled causality ("effect sometimes arrived before cause"). One clear tightening: the child's laughter dated tomorrow forces immediate action. The unbending edit forecloses the path of passive interpretation—she commits to active history-editing with visible cost (power drain, floating, future loops). The piece leans Accumulative/Textural, so escalation reads as density increase and conceptual reweighting rather than causal narrowing. Mild penalty: the reversal from "wrong seeds" to "merely early" arrives more as realization than as a decision that closes off another live option; the anomaly's cooperation (easing "like a sigh") softens the struggle and reduces felt resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—uncertainty as compass, error as fertilizer, editing-through-relationship rather than fact—emerges from concrete action (pen scratch, filament naming, seed planting) and the mentor's gardening metaphor. The final image (Mira planting "questions shaped like spirals, ready to be misunderstood correctly") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The anomaly's lullaby and the station's warmth rising through her boots ground abstraction in sensation. Minor issue: "confidence required she remain uncertain enough" and "threshing meaning from the husk of error" verge on thematic echo, articulating the premise rather than letting it emerge fully from dramatized consequence. The piece resists tidy resolution and embraces productive ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focus on Mira's perception. Diction is elevated and lyric ("filaments," "contingency," "light-cones") but consistent with a signal interpreter's idiom; no mid-scene head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the pen-scratch edit, pulling back slightly for the mentor's memory and the anomaly's hum. Minor penalty: abstract register ("contingent relationships," "effect arrived pre-threshed") occasionally drifts into conceptual exposition that tells theme rather than filtering it through embodied perception. The gravitational anomaly "tugging at her bones like a polite but insistent child" is vivid and character-specific, anchoring the lyric mode. Elision is purposeful (no ink in the pen, "metaphor up here"), taught early, and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and supports the accumulative design. Information density is high; most lines layer image, action, and concept. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges "story still being written." Mild scaffold detected: "meaning threshed from experience" → "experience itself arrived pre-threshed" and "confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied" loop conceptually without advancing pressure. The phrase "confidently uncertain" recurs as label in multiple beats. Filter-verb stack in paragraph two ("she had planted," "made her confidently uncertain") slightly dulls immediacy. Mixed metaphor: "filaments that tied them together" then "shimmer like spider silk" works, but "unbent the event" + "easing its curvature" mixes geometric and tensile logics without full coherence. No major loops or template cadence, but the thematic vocabulary ("contingency," "thresh," "filament") recycles enough to nudge toward −0.6 in-band. Proofreading clean; no typos.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—signal interpreter + history-editor + gravitational anomaly scrambling causality—feels fresh and purposefully integrated. "Unbending" history through relational filaments rather than facts is a non-obvious angle on time-editing tropes. The pen's iridium nib responding to emotional charge and thirsting for metaphorical ink adds specificity. The child's laughter modulated over pulsar beats and dated tomorrow is a vivid, earned detail. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact choices. Minor proximity note: the "gardening" metaphor for interpretation echoes common writing-advice idiom but is personalized through Mira's mentor and the comm-garden literalization. The piece commits fully to its lyric-scientific premise and follows implications without retreat. Risk is present in the dense metaphorical layer and the quiet, reconfiguration-style closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (celestial signal interpreter) appears immediately and her professional role directly shapes the conflict: interpreting garbled signals, threshing meaning, and editing history via the pen. She makes two key decisions—unbending the "wrong seeds" event and planting new spiral-questions—that drive closure. Her choices alter tactics (naming filaments, easing curvature) and foreclose passive observation. Present in setup, middle edit action, and ending planting. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost: power drain, floating, commitment to future loops. Specificity: only a signal interpreter would frame the problem this way. Minor gap: her interpreter skills are asserted more than demonstrated in a technical beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dried-up fountain pen with meteoric iridium nib appears in paragraph three, returns in paragraph five ("vibrated"), is used in the unbending action (paragraphs seven, nine, ten: "poised the nib," "pen scratched," "etching absence that glowed," "tugged filaments"), and is capped and returned to her pocket in paragraph fourteen. The pen's emptiness ("ink was metaphor") and its emotional-charge responsiveness shape the editing method. It constrains the action (must etch without ink) and charges the closure (pen cooled, job done, future loops sensed). Three-gate pass: setup, middle use, closure presence. Strong beat involvement (four distinct beats), causal pressure, and specificity. Irreplaceable: only this pen's iridium flex and emptiness enable the history-edit. Cost: pen's vibration and cooling mark the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Editing history (core concept) is signaled in paragraph three ("stories could be unbent if you found the hinges between events") and directly shapes Mira's goal and method. It drives the middle action: she unbends the "Planting the Wrong Seeds" event by altering filaments, not facts (paragraphs eight–ten). The concept constrains tactics (must name filaments, ease curvature) and enables the reversal (child laughing with her instead of at her). It charges closure: "history would remember itself slightly differently" and the corridor walk as "a story still being written." Three-gate pass. Strong causal pressure and specificity. Minor gap: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; we don't see a second event edited to test the concept's limits. Cost is legible in power drain and future loop commitment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" appears as a descriptor in paragraph two and is echoed in paragraph eleven ("confidence flickered; uncertainty steadied") and paragraph nineteen ("confident in its gentle uncertainty"). It shapes Mira's stance at closure: she remains "uncertain enough to meet" future echoes. However, it functions more as thematic label than on-page constraint with visible tradeoff. We're told she is "confidently uncertain" but the quality doesn't force a specific choice where confidence would have led one way and uncertainty another; instead it describes her existing approach. Setup present, closure echo present, but middle development as active constraint is weak. Label-only trend: mentioned three times without dramatized friction. Cost is asserted, not shown in a fork.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unbend" (action) is seeded in paragraph three ("stories could be unbent") and executed in paragraph nine: Mira unbends the "Planting the Wrong Seeds" event by easing its curvature. This action is the story's hinge: it alters the child's laughter from mockery to companionship, revises the scroll, and enables the ending's spiral-question planting. The unbending drives closure and redefines options (seeds now "merely early"). Three-gate pass. Strong causal pressure, irreplaceability (no synonym fits the geometric-tensile metaphor), and closure linkage. Cost: power drain, gravity slackening, future loop propagation. Only minor gap: the physical mechanics of "unbending" remain metaphorical; we see pen-scratch and filament-tug but not a clear before/after state for the event itself beyond the revised scroll text.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through contingent relationships" (method) is signaled in paragraph three ("editing history must be done through contingent relationships, altering not facts but the filaments that tied them together") and demonstrated in paragraph eight: Mira names each filament (Mother's Promise, Comet Debt, First Betrayal, Seed of Silence) before unbending the event. The method shapes the middle action and differentiates this history-edit from a simple rewrite. It appears in closure when Mira logs her own contingent relationship: "Interpreter to Cosmos, Editor to Edited." Three-gate pass. Causal pressure moderate (the filament-naming enables the unbending but the specific names don't constrain further choices). Specificity high. Cost indirect (power drain tied to the edit, not the method itself). Slight swappability: "relationships" could be "connections" or "links" without major structural loss, though the thematic charge would weaken.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly (setting) appears in the opening line, flares silver in paragraph five, twists light-cones (paragraph four), borrows station power and slackens gravity during the edit (paragraph eleven), and eases "like a sigh" in paragraph thirteen, then hums a lullaby in paragraph sixteen. It constrains Mira's choice (the anomaly's scrambling of causality forces the edit) and supplies the pressure that makes history-editing necessary and possible. Three-gate pass. Strong beat involvement (five distinct beats), causal pressure, and closure charge (the anomaly's hum and invitation frame the ending). Irreplaceable: only a gravitational anomaly that twists light-cones would create this problem. Cost: power drain, floating. Specificity high. The anomaly functions as both antagonist and collaborator.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After planting the wrong seeds" (timeframe) is signaled in paragraph two ("three cycles ago") and anchors the story's causality: the wrong seeds sprouted into static, prompting the present crisis. The timeframe creates the problem Mira must solve and charges the ending when the seeds are reframed as "merely early." However, the three-cycle gap is static; no countdown or tightening deadline pressures Mira's choice in the middle. Setup and closure present; middle pressure weak. The child's laughter "dated tomorrow" (paragraph six) introduces a temporal urgency, but this is a separate element (the anomaly's effect) rather than the "after planting" timeframe itself. Lyric reprise: "wrong seeds" → "merely early" reweights the mistake. Cost indirect (the seeds' static created the garbled signals). Functional but not driving escalation beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to thresh meaning from experience—is stated in paragraph four and drives her job description and the story's central conflict. It shapes the unbending action (threshing requires her to sift signal from noise, and when experience arrives "pre-threshed and nonsensical," she must edit history to restore coherence). The motivation appears in closure when she logs "meaning threshed from the husk of error." Three-gate pass. Causal pressure moderate to strong (the threshing imperative explains why she acts rather than waits). Cost: power drain, future loop commitment, the acceptance of uncertainty. Friction: the anomaly's scrambling conflicts with her threshing goal, forcing the edit. Minor label tendency: "thresh meaning from experience" recurs almost verbatim, edging toward told-only in the final log entry. Specificity high (only a signal interpreter would frame desire this way).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" (tone) is seeded in paragraph eleven ("anchored only by the strange comfort of knowing uncertainty was the truest coordinate"), returns in paragraph seventeen ("strange comfort translated into bone"), and charges the ending: the anomaly's lullaby as "apology and invitation braided together" and Mira's smile in paragraph nineteen. The tone is coherent across beats—lyric unease layered with warmth—and modulates with pressure: eerie during the anomaly's flare, grounding during the mentor's memory, resonant at closure. The oxymoron (strange + comfort) mirrors the "confidently uncertain" attribute and supports the theme. Three-gate pass. Closure linkage strong. Specificity high (the tone arises from the exact image of gravitational anomaly as lullaby and warmth through boot-soles). Cost: the comfort is earned by Mira's acceptance of uncertainty and future loops, not given freely. Minor tonal drift: paragraph twelve's "recycled air and regret" leans melancholy without the comfort accent, though this may be purposeful modulation.</comment>
