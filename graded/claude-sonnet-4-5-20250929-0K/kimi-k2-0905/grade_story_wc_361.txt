<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias remains functional but largely abstract—his "jittery" nature is labeled repeatedly without embodied variation under stress. The pendant operates as a plot device more than an object that reveals character through handling choices. The woman at the ridgeway remains a cipher; her "centuries" claim and aurora-lit eyes are told, not dramatized through credible action. The final transformation ("part man, part story, part wonder") is asserted rather than earned through a micro-choice that forecloses a visible path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (aurora, pendant vibration, recurring "fade" and "germinate" motifs) and attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure: Elias becomes myth. However, the cost remains abstract—villagers "speak of" the transformation in summary, and no on-page action shows what he surrenders or loses. The orientation is clean (who/where/when by line three). The closure unit exists but the felt price is elided, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and recurrs across beats, shaping the final image when Elias "walks forward" into transformation. The pendant's dragonfly wings and the ridge's narrowing path offer spatial constraint. Sensory detail is strong (green/violet light, thick-as-honey air) and filtered through Elias's courier perspective. However, the physical mechanics of the transformation are vague—does he dissolve, ascend, or continue walking—capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a routine courier or step into legend—is signaled early. The pendant's intensifying vibration and the woman's arrival create one meaningful tightening. But the escalation is largely passive: Elias watches the pendant leap unbidden, hears exposition, then "walks forward" without a decision that visibly forecloses an option. The cost (becoming "more than memory could hold") is told in retrospect rather than dramatized in a present-tense choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (the fade from memory to myth, wonder coaxed from routine) is seeded early and recurs through "germinate," "sympathetic vibration," and the aurora imagery. The ending attempts a non-literal answer: Elias becomes the myth rather than merely carrying it. However, the final lines veer into thematic summary ("some encounters must remain brief to maintain their power") that replaces scene pressure, applying the −0.5 guidance for explicit moralizing in the closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent (jittery caution, wonder-seeking). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the woman's lines carry thematic weight without naturalistic subtext. However, register drifts in peak beats: "sympathetic vibration," "germinate myth from memory's seeds," and "fertile soil between what was and what might yet be" read as elevated authorial diction rather than Elias's working-courier lexicon, triggering the −0.3 to −0.6 register-drift penalty in this category.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence (dragonfly-wing filigree, sky dripping light, villages like barnacles, time thick as honey, reality's seam, wonder's fertile soil), creating density that obscures rather than sharpens peak beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "extending brief encounters" recurs verbatim three times without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The pendant" or "Elias" in close succession. Applying the overwriting density penalty (−0.3 to −0.7) and the paraphrase-loop/template-cadence pack (−0.6 to −1.0 combined), plus the artifact-in-final-third disqualification for 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The absent-mentor-as-preparation trope is familiar; the "courier must become the message" twist is well-worn in mythic-transformation tales. Specificity—dragonfly pendant, aurora ridgeway, relic delivery—adds texture but does not fundamentally transform the template. The story commits to its premise without retreat, and the sympathetic-vibration mechanism offers a fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc (passive apprentice receives exposition, then transcends) would work largely unchanged with different props, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his profession (courier) motivates the journey. However, his "jittery" nature is labeled rather than causally active; he makes no on-page decision that narrows options—he watches, listens, and "walks forward" when the pendant leaps unbidden. Setup: present early (+0.3). Development: observes but does not choose (−0.5). Closure: present but passive (ornamental, −0.5). Swappability: a "nervous apprentice" would function identically (−0.5). Band guidance suggests mid-4s; round to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pendant appears in beat one (Elias clutches it), beat two (vibration intensifies), beat three (leaps unbidden), and closure (dissolves into aurora). Setup (+0.3), development (+0.9 for multiple beats), closure linkage (+0.7). However, Elias never makes a choice *because of* the pendant's properties; it acts autonomously. The sympathetic vibration is described but does not constrain his tactics (−0.4). Specificity (dragonfly wings) adds texture (+0.3). Total adjustments yield mid-6s; round to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Master Corwin's absence is seeded early ("three years since Master Corwin vanished"), recurs in reflection ("remembering Corwin's final lesson"), and the woman's exposition reframes it ("Corwin knew the fade would claim him"). Setup (+0.3), closure linkage (+0.7 for the reframing). However, the absence does not constrain Elias's on-page choices—he delivers relics and walks forward as he would with or without Corwin (−0.6 swappability). The concept is told more than enacted, applying the summary-only friction (−0.4). Mid-5s; round to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" appears as a pendant effect (vibration "extending the brief encounter"), Elias's moment with the woman ("extending this moment into an eternity"), and the final thematic claim. Setup is implicit but not clear until second beat (−0.2 late signal). Development: the extension is asserted but does not constrain action—Elias does not struggle against or leverage the temporal dilation (−0.7 ornamental). Closure: the phrase recurs but as theme-label rather than enacted cost (−0.5). Swappability high (−0.6). Cap at 3.8 per the generic-equivalent rule.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Germinate" recurs as thematic verb (wonder germinates, myth germinates, legend germinates) but is never enacted as a physical action Elias performs. Setup: present by end of first third (+0.3). Development: the woman says "germinate myth from memory's seeds," but this is exposition, not a choice Elias makes (summary-only, −0.5). Closure: "a new legend germinated" is told in retrospect (−0.4). No causal pressure or cost tied to the act of germinating (−0.7). Late explicit appearance as action (second third, −0.3). Swappability (could be "cultivate" or "sow," −0.5). Cap at 4.6 per missing-setup rule (germinate as *action* rather than metaphor).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method appears early (pendant's "sympathetic vibration") and recurs three times. Setup (+0.3), beat involvement (+0.4 for one distinct causal beat when the pendant leaps). However, the mechanics remain opaque—what does "sympathetic" mean in-world, and how does Elias (or the pendant) initiate it? The vibration acts autonomously rather than as a tool Elias wields (−0.6 for lack of protagonist agency). Specificity is present but not leveraged for tactical constraint (−0.4). Mid-5s; round to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ridgeway is established in line one, recurs as the site of the encounter, and returns in the final image ("ridgeway continued its eternal dance"). Setup (+0.3), development (+0.4 for the narrowing path that spatially frames tension), closure (+1.0 for the "seam where reality grew thin" image that charges the transformation). Specificity: aurora-lit, trembling underfoot, a bridge across myth (+0.5). The setting constrains Elias's movement (he pauses where it narrows) and supplies the visual anchor for his becoming (+0.8 causal pressure). Two beats minimum (+0.9). Strong integration; 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fade from memory to myth" recurs as phrase and theme but does not function as a ticking clock or temporal constraint that alters Elias's tactics. Setup: the phrase appears in beat one reflection (+0.3). Development: the woman's line ("memory fades and myth germinates") is thematic echo, not a choice-forcing deadline (−0.5 ornamental). Closure: the fade is asserted as complete but the reader cannot track when or how it occurred (−0.6 vague time). No urgency or cost tied to the temporal frame (−0.5). Swappability: "journey from apprentice to legend" would function identically (−0.6). Cap at 4.6 per missing development; adjust to 4.1 for cumulative vagueness.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to coax wonder from the routine" is seeded in reflection ("coax wonder from routine hearts," "germinate wonder in hearts grown dull") and frames his three-year courier work. Setup (+0.3), closure linkage (+0.7 for the final claim that his transformation will "coax wonder for generations"). However, the desire is never shown in friction—Elias does not choose between wonder and survival, or wonder and safety (−0.7 lack of on-page conflict). The motivation is told in reflection rather than tested in a beat (summary-only, −0.4). Mid-5s; round to 5.7.</comment>
