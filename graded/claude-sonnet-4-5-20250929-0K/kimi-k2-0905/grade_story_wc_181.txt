<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is heavily abstract and ornamental ("existential steam," "philosophical breakthrough") rather than embodied and contradictory. The protagonist drifts through metaphysical states without grounded micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values—she experiences visions and realizations delivered to her rather than wrestling with competing impulses. The final merging with the page reads as passive absorption rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Label-heavy interior monologue ("simply complicated truth," "nonlinear inheritance") replaces concrete perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where within the opening lines, but the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—accumulative/textural motifs compete with causal-seeming events (envelope in stomach, mirror corridor) that don't link because/therefore. The closure unit ("The curator is the catalog") reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted thematically ("forfeit her sanity page by page," "every galaxy-fruit she plucked, a page vanished") rather than made undeniable in a final image. The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative pattern but the ending blurs into meta-commentary ("Knowledge is not forbidden; it is inherited backwards") rather than landing a charged final perception. No clear tightening narrows options under pressure; visions arrive rather than being pursued with escalating trade-offs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The astral orchard and titanium bathroom pod are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (starlight-laden petals that chime, phosphorescent moss). However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop for metaphysical events rather than constraining choices—Mara moves through spaces that transform around her without spatial logic or resource scarcity shaping tactics. The bathroom as "chrysalis" and the orchard's xylem plumbing are inventive micro-settings, but their mechanics don't visibly limit or enable a pivotal decision at closure. Setting remains ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("pursue forbidden knowledge or forfeit her sanity page by page") is declared early but remains abstract—no on-page scene tests what "forfeit" means in immediate terms. The reversals (mirror opens to corridor, bathroom is chrysalis, she merges with the page) read as revelations delivered rather than pressure points that force trade-offs. The "every fruit she plucks erases a kindness" mechanic arrives mid-story and is summarized rather than dramatized with a visible price that alters tactics. Agency is passive reception; Mara experiences transformation rather than choosing between competing goods with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme (nonlinear inheritance as "simply complicated love arriving early") emerges from the orchard motif and gains coherence, but the final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "Knowledge is not forbidden; it is inherited backwards by those who remember to forget." The Thematic Echo penalty applies (−0.6 in final lines). The pistachio shell and orchard-as-inheritance carry symbolic weight, yet the resolution tells rather than shows through charged image—"she had become the orchard's footnote" is meta-commentary rather than a scene-rooted answer to the central question. Subtext is thin; epiphanies are asserted rather than earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The prose establishes a distinct, lyric-philosophical register with purposeful compression ("between toothpaste globules and phosphorescent moss, she experienced the first philosophical breakthrough"). However, diction drifts into academic abstraction ("nonlinear inheritance," "existential steam," "cognitive smoothness") that clashes with the embodied curator POV under peak pressure. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but the narrator oscillates between Mara's immediate perception and omniscient meta-commentary ("The simply complicated truth dawned"). No dialogue appears. The voice is consistent but risks museum-tour poeticism rather than character-particular thought under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is densely figurative with inventive images ("galaxy-fruit," "time folded like origami"), but metaphoric density in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (mirror corridor, orchard transformation, merging with the page) triggers overwriting penalties (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "she had recorded every anomaly, yet none unsettled her" / "the cameo was not blank but waiting" restate without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("She pressed…She lifted…She stepped…She tucked") and synonym churn ("bewildered," "brightened disquiet," "existential steam") reduce momentum (−0.6 cumulative). Register drift into philosophical abstraction at closure beats ("the curator is the catalog," "the reader who realizes she authors herself") clashes with POV lexicon (−0.4). Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of nonlinear inheritance, sentient orchard, and bathroom-as-philosophical-space is inventive and specific. However, the meta-fictional turn ("she had become the orchard's footnote," "The curator is the catalog") risks clever abstraction over grounded human stakes. The pistachio shell cameo and orchard-as-memory-grove offer fresh angles, and the bathroom-chrysalis reversal is surprising. Yet the ending's nested recursion (new asteroid, next curator, drift-open bathroom door) reads as conceptual ornament rather than a choice earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is evident but closure leans toward surface novelty rather than emotional inevitability rooted in character flaw and prior cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout and her choices (whisper to cameo, press spiral to drain, step through Index door) are on the page. However, these actions are reactive responses to visions rather than decisions that narrow options with visible cost—she experiences revelations rather than wrestling with competing wants. Present across beats but trends toward observation and passive transformation. Two gates (setup, payoff) met but middle development is thin. Swappable protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo appears in the opening, is handled twice (pressed to lips, pressed to drain), and returns in the final image ("tucked…into the spine of the sky"). The spiral etching "that refused to stay in one rotation" and the shell as "grafting tool" constrain Mara's inquiry. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5. However, the final reprise is ornamental (germinating a new asteroid) rather than causally active at closure. All three gates met. Swappability moderate (any occult token could serve). Net: solid integration with lyric reprise but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is defined early, shapes the orchard's logic (memories bloom before roots exist), and drives the central stakes (forfeit sanity or pursue knowledge). The concept constrains Mara's choices: plucking galaxy-fruit erases past kindness, forcing a live trade-off. It appears in setup, middle (erasure mechanics), and closure ("inherited backwards by those who remember to forget"). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7. The concept is irreplaceable and charges the ending image. All gates met with strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears twice as a label ("The simply complicated truth dawned," "nonlinear inheritance is simply complicated love") but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It functions as thematic descriptor rather than a trait that enables or limits tactics. Introduced after the first third (−0.3). Setup gate missed; closure participation is label-only. Swappable with "paradoxical" or similar. Ornamental use −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Inquire" appears in setup ("tried to inquire of the orchard's sentient trees") and drives the two key turns: whispering the question to the cameo opens the mirror corridor, inscribing the second question opens the Index door. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.8. However, the action is summary-level—Mara asks questions that trigger visions rather than pursuing inquiry through embodied tactics with visible cost. All three gates met but swappable with "seek" or "ask" (−0.5). Net: functional across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bathroom pod appears early as the place where "the trees' telepathy dampened" and is revisited twice (first breakthrough, second breakthrough). The method is signaled and its mechanics (refuge, then chrysalis with plumbing as xylem) shape Mara's realizations. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage modest +0.4. However, breakthroughs are told rather than dramatized—Mara "experienced" and "realized" rather than wrestling with embodied choices in that space. Summary-only use −0.6. All gates met but swappable with any liminal space. Net: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The astral orchard is introduced in the opening line, supplies the sentient trees and galaxy-fruit that Mara interacts with across multiple beats, and returns in the final image as she becomes its footnote. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0 (orchard's rustling and fruit-plucking drive stakes), closure linkage +1.2. The orchard's xylem connection to the bathroom and its telepathy constrain Mara's choices. All gates met. Specificity high (lonely asteroid K-77, petals that chime). However, spatial choreography is loose—Mara teleports between orchard and bathroom without clear transitions. Net: essential across beats with strong closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" frames the opening and closing, establishing a meta-textual bracket. However, no on-page clock tightens decisions—time folds and Mara sees herself "as a child…then as an elder…then as an unborn infant" without temporal pressure altering tactics. Setup gate met, closure participation weak (thematic reprise only). Time is ornamental rather than a live constraint. Swappable with "across all moments" (−0.6). Lyric reprise without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The command to "pursue forbidden knowledge or forfeit her sanity page by page" is dramatized early (envelope in stomach, vomiting) and recurs as internal pressure ("Yet the command burned hotter"). The motivation drives Mara to pluck galaxy-fruit despite erasure cost and to inscribe questions despite consequences. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.6. However, the friction between want and cost is told more than shown—"she raced back" suggests urgency but the choice to merge with the page feels passive. All gates met but the final act lacks visible struggle. Net: shapes beats but resolution is asserted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Brightened disquiet" appears in the trees' rustling and modulates through Mara's escalating visions. Tone is coherent through turns—lyric anxiety threads the orchard, bathroom, and mirror-corridor beats. However, the tone label itself is used once and the affective texture is primarily metaphysical wonder rather than disquiet. The ending shifts to meta-commentary ("gentle warning printed in starlight") that softens rather than charges the disquiet. Setup gate met (trees' rustling), middle development present (escalating visions), closure participation weak (tone drifts to resolution rather than charged ambiguity). Swappable with "anxious wonder" (−0.4). Net: functional but not indispensable to the final image.</comment>
