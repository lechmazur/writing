<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's blind artisan identity is embodied through concrete sensory substitution (water-refracted spectra, thrum of dying engine, boiler metronome) and her motivation to "decode feedback into direction" drives micro-choices under pressure. The drone's jitter → terror translation and her teaching it to read chaos feels earned, though the final choice lacks visible internal contradiction—her calm is magnetic throughout without meaningful friction. Col remains functional but flat, applying pressure only as a timekeeper and spectrum-reader. The ending renunciation (opening the bay door) forecloses further repair work but the cost feels muted because success was never in doubt once she diagnosed the feedback loop.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph two). Drive lens reads Causal: boiler explosion backstory → blind repair method → fracture diagnosis → silica patch → feedback terror → water-barrel recalibration → launch. The closure is a Decisive Change (drone lifts and departs) with visible cost (Lira releases it into uncertainty, village depends on arrival). One meaningful tightening: the seven-minute countdown narrows options and forces the water-barrel innovation. Micro turn (jitter after initial patch) sets up the final solution without fragmenting pressure. Cost is present but could be sharper—success feels assured once she identifies the feedback problem, slightly dampening the closure's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot, suspended glass drippers, rain barrel, and boiler metronome create a vivid, tactile micro-setting filtered through Lira's non-visual senses. The water features and kiln constrain her repair method and the bay door frames the final release. Spatial choreography (toolbox, drone on table, rain barrel wheeled in) stays coherent. However, the depot's broader function—why a rail depot houses a lone blind artisan and hummingbird drones—remains vague, and the Aurora's harbor proximity isn't anchored until late, weakening the geography's grip on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (village antidotes depend on drone launch before Aurora departs) is signaled early and tightens through the seven-minute countdown. Escalation reads Causal: wing fracture → battery swell → successful patch → feedback jitter (reversal) → water-barrel recalibration → launch. Lira's agency drives each beat, and the water-barrel solution arises from her own trauma memory (infirmary bandages → teaching the drone to translate terror). Cost is visible in the final release and the village's dependency, though the protagonist's competence is so assured that genuine failure never feels plausible, slightly flattening peak tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—translating chaos into order, trauma into capability—emerges through concrete action (Lira's blindness → refraction method, drone's crash fear → flight recalibration) without overt statement. "Decode feedback into direction" operates as character motive and thematic spine, charging the water-barrel beat where ripples teach the drone to mirror calm. The final image (drone as "tiny artificial star") reprices the repair as creation, not mere patching. However, "magnetic calm" and "iron filings sliding into perfect order" risk symbolic convenience by appearing twice without evolving under pressure, and the ending's gratitude note ("wings humming a note like gratitude") edges toward anthropomorphic sentiment that slightly softens the conceptual charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all sensory detail through Lira's non-visual perception (spectra against fingertips, warm thrum, boiler pitch as metronome). Diction stays consistent—technical yet embodied—and psychic distance tightens under urgency without head-hopping. Col's dialogue ("Copper bleeding into violet," "More green now") is functional and distinct from Lira's steady commands. However, several lines drift into elevated register during peak beats: "a Morse of fear it had learned when it crashed," "torque," "translucent map of refractive grooves" feel slightly authorial rather than Lira's lived idiom, and the final "tiny artificial star racing to meet the Aurora" reads more lyric than her established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short commands during urgency, longer sensory description in diagnostic beats), and information density is high—most lines advance repair action, sensory feedback, or time pressure. Opening and closing images anchor well. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "decode feedback into direction" stated twice identically (motivation paragraph, then water-barrel beat); "magnetic calm" recurs without evolution. The final paragraph stacks filter verbs ("feeling sea breeze cut," "the drone shot") where stronger action could sharpen. Minor register drift ("lumen-veins," "magnetic calm," "Morse of fear") in peak beats slightly dulls immediacy, though clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blind artisan using light refraction to repair drones offers a fresh synthesis, and the water-barrel recalibration (teaching fear-memory to flight-memory) feels specific and non-obvious. The rail-depot steampunk setting with hummingbird courier drones reads original in detail. However, the core "skilled protagonist races clock to save distant village" template is familiar, and the resolution (competent artisan succeeds through ingenuity) lacks the friction of genuine doubt or moral calculus. The "iron filings / magnetic calm" metaphor, while apt, borders on stock physics imagery. Risk-taking in sensory substitution elevates the piece but doesn't fully transform the underlying stakes structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's choices drive all key turns: diagnosing the battery swell, patching with molten silica, recognizing feedback terror, deploying the water barrel, and releasing the drone. Setup early (paragraph two), development across repair beats, payoff in final release with visible cost (uncertainty of drone's arrival). Her artisan identity and blindness are causally essential to method and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The drone is handled in every beat: initial wing examination, silica patching, test pulse jitter, water-barrel immersion, final launch. Its broken state drives the plot; its feedback terror creates the middle reversal; its departure forms the closure image. Removing it would collapse all story logic. Early setup, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, high irreplaceability, and visible cost (village dependency) all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The repair-shop concept frames stakes (Lira is "the depot's only repair artisan") and shapes tactics (kiln for silica, rain barrel for recalibration, toolbox and bay door). Setup early, development through tool use, payoff in successful launch. However, the rail-depot setting could be swapped for another workshop type with minor edits—its courier and anchor-lift context matter less than the generic repair-space function. Functional but somewhat replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's blindness constrains every diagnostic and repair action: she reads via refraction spectra, uses Col's color reports, listens to boiler pitch as tempo, and feels the drone's thrum. Setup paragraph two, development across all beats, payoff in final release where she "open[s] the bay door, feeling sea breeze cut." The attribute is causally essential, though the piece could have sharpened the tradeoff by showing one moment where blindness costs her speed or certainty.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Patching occurs in three distinct beats: silica film on the wing fracture, test pulse revealing feedback jitter, final translucent groove layer. Each patch escalates the problem (physical → behavioral → calibration), and the closure depends on the completed repair. Early signal, multi-beat causal work, closure linkage. Swapping "patch" for "weld" or "seal" would require rewriting the silica/refraction method, so irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Examining light refraction through water features is signaled early (paragraph three: "suspended glass drippers that bent sunrise into singing spectra"), shapes diagnosis ("Tell me the hue at dripper three" → battery-swell confirmation), and culminates in the rain-barrel ripple recalibration. Mechanics matter across beats; the method is specific and irreplaceable. Setup, development, and payoff all present with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot supplies the kiln, rain barrel, bay door, and boiler metronome—each used tactically. Setup paragraph one, development via tool access, payoff when Lira opens the bay. However, the rail-depot identity (trains, anchors, courier runs) remains atmospheric rather than constraining—any workshop with water and a kiln would function similarly. The setting pressures choices through available tools but is somewhat swappable at the macro level.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The anchor-lift / Aurora maiden-voyage timeframe is signaled early ("horn sounded—low, oceanic"), tightens midway ("Anchor's up; ship casts off in seven minutes"), and drives the final urgency ("the drone shot toward the harbor…before its maiden voyage claimed the horizon"). The clock narrows Lira's options and forces the water-barrel shortcut. Setup, development, and payoff all present with visible cost (village waits "another season" if missed). Time alters tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lira's motivation "to decode feedback into direction" is dramatized in her diagnosis method (refraction spectra, boiler tempo) and the drone's feedback-terror solution. Setup early (paragraph seven), development in water-barrel beat ("teach the drone to translate its terror into torque"), payoff in successful launch. However, the motivation is stated twice identically without friction or cost—Lira never doubts her principle or sacrifices another want to pursue it. Functional dramatization but low conflict within the desire itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" is stated twice (urgency/skill paragraph, iron-filings simile) and modulates slightly under the seven-minute pressure, but the tone remains steady rather than charging through contradictory emotional textures. The final image ("tiny artificial star") carries wonder, yet the piece never destabilizes or reprices the calm—Lira's certainty is unshaken. Coherent and present across beats, but static rather than transformative at closure.</comment>
