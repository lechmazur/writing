<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's baseline trait ("realistically imaginative," "luminous skeptic") is established but her interior contradictions remain abstract. The memory encounters at each fountain provide discrete emotional beats (mother's broken promise, father's departure, her own abandonment), yet her shift from "not grief but liberation" to "not as a skeptic but as a daughter" lacks on-page micro-choices that embody the transition—she sits and speaks, memories dissolve, done. The final renunciation (leaving the empty box) reads as Earned Stasis with cost, but the stakes of letting go are told more than tested through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: breadcrumbs → fountain stations → memory releases build density toward the final image of steam rising and geese resuming flight. Orientation anchors (city, box, geese, Mara) arrive early. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara leaves the box, memories dissipate, "silence of things finally let go." Cost is legible (she relinquishes the container, accepts the weight), and the lens holds. However, the four-fountain structure creates identical beats—arrive, box warms/vibrates, memory surfaces, she moves on—without meaningful tightening or a causal turn that narrows options until the very end, limiting escalation under even an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains provides a charged micro-setting: dry basins, water turned to glass/mirrors, stone mouths whispering secrets. Each fountain (First Lies, Last Goodbyes, Unkept Promises, Forgiveness) is named and given distinct properties (coins, salt-and-iron kisses, faces of promise-breakers, mirrors of possibility) that reflect the memory type released. The geese paused mid-flight and the "defiant hush" recur to frame pressure. The final fountain's mirrors showing "not reflections but possibilities" directly enable the full opening of the box, and the setting's cumulative particulars (dry → glass → mirrors → steam) charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories from the stained glass box—is signaled early and pursued across four fountain beats. Yet each station replicates the same structure (breadcrumb → arrive → box reacts → memory appears → move on) without escalating pressure or forcing a trade-off until the fourth fountain, where Mara "opened the box fully." The memories "ask only to be seen," but no live option is foreclosed en route; Mara's agency is consistent pilgrimage rather than decision under competing costs. The ending delivers a visible price (empty box, dissolved memories, geese resume) that charges the final image, but the accumulative tightening is modest and late.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the constellation metaphor ("each shard a star in the galaxy of her family's abandonment") and the interplay of "sidereal patience" with human patterns of leaving. The memories are "not trapped—they were waiting" reframes the premise without preaching. The four fountains (Lies, Goodbyes, Unkept Promises, Forgiveness) build a non-obvious thematic ladder, and the final image—"silence of things finally let go"—offers a resonant answer to the central question of liberation versus acknowledgment. The piece resists tidy morals and lets the particulars (dry basins, paused geese, liquid light) carry the weight, though "defiant hush" is occasionally asserted rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("sidereal patience," "luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative") but occasionally tips into prompt-echo phrasing that feels imposed rather than voice-organic. Perceptual signature is present (Mara notices light, warmth, vibration in the box; memories as "liquid light") yet several lines read as external narration rather than filtered perception: "The geese above remained paused, their migration suspended by some cosmic hand" asserts cosmic causality unavailable to Mara's skeptic stance. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but psychic distance wavers when the prose declares thematic meaning ("a constellation of regrets") instead of showing Mara arriving at that realization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong images (geese frozen mid-flight, water turned to glass, memories as liquid light pooling at her feet) and purposeful rhythm in the opening and closing. However, the middle four-fountain sequence employs template cadence: "The [ordinal] breadcrumb led/pulsed at the Fountain of [Name], where [description]. Here/She [verb], and [memory]." This run spans eight paragraphs and flattens momentum. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("the box grew warm" / "the box vibrated violently" / "opened the box fully") without escalating the action each time. Stock metaphors ("tasted of salt and iron," "like perfume," "like steam") are competent but unearned. Figurative density is high but not taught as pattern, and the closure image remains clear, so artifact penalty is modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The combination of stained glass box, frozen geese, breadcrumbs of light, and named fountains offers a vivid lyric frame. The four-station pilgrimage and "sidereal patience" provide fresh vocabulary for processing familial abandonment. Yet the core emotional arc—estranged daughter confronts memories of parental leaving and her own departure—is familiar, and the transformation relies on the fantastical apparatus rather than unexpected character choice or moral calculus. The fountains' names and properties are specific, but their identical function (trigger memory, move on) limits ingenuity. The ending's resonance (geese resume, silence of release) is earned but not startling in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara ("luminous skeptic") is present throughout and makes the final choice to open the box fully and leave it at the fountain. Her skepticism is declared but not tested on the page in a causal turn; she follows breadcrumbs without resistance. The shift from "not as a skeptic but as a daughter" occurs in one beat ("began to speak to it") without prior friction, so agency is present but passive pilgrimage rather than decision-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in the opening line, recurs at each fountain (warms, vibrates, is opened fully), and is left empty at the end—early signal, multiple beats, closure participation all present. Its properties (hums with sidereal patience, spills light, dissolves shards) drive the structure. However, Mara's handling is mostly reactive (it warms, she observes; it vibrates, she sees) rather than forcing tactical choices, and the box's irreplaceability is conceptual (container of memories) more than mechanically unique.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sidereal patience" is named twice (opening, midpoint: "waiting, with sidereal patience") and frames the memories' long endurance, shaping the thematic stake. It does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options in a middle beat; Mara's approach (follow breadcrumbs, open box) remains unchanged by the concept. The ending ("finally let go") reweights it as the condition the memories needed, offering a lyric payoff but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginative" is declared in one line ("a woman who believed in the impossible only after she had tested its weight in her hands") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. Mara does not test anything; she follows breadcrumbs and opens the box. The trait is label-only and swappable with "pragmatic dreamer" or similar without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Unstick" appears in the opening ("to unstick the memories trapped") and is realized progressively as she releases memories at each fountain, culminating in the full opening and dissipation. The action shapes the entire structure (pilgrimage to free memories) and the closure (memories rise like steam, no longer stuck). It is present early, drives multiple beats, and is essential to the ending, though its execution is repetitive across stations.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Following breadcrumbs" is signaled early ("breadcrumbs of light that spilled from the box") and used four times to guide Mara to each fountain. The method is shown on the page and matters structurally (without breadcrumbs, no pilgrimage), but the mechanics are simple (breadcrumb appears, she follows) and do not impose a cost or choice—she never loses the trail or faces a false lead. The method enables beats but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains is named in the opening line, provides four distinct locations (First Lies, Last Goodbyes, Unkept Promises, Forgiveness) with unique properties (coins, salt kisses, glass water, mirrors of possibility), and directly enables the final turn (Forgiveness fountain's mirrors show possibilities, prompting full opening). The "defiant hush" and dry basins recur to pressure tone and theme. The setting is irreplaceable (these specific fountains unlock these specific memories) and charges the closure image (steam rising, geese resuming).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe ("from the pause of migrating geese") is established in the opening and closing (geese frozen, then resume flight), bracketing the pilgrimage. Time is not tracked beat-by-beat and does not tighten tactics (Mara is never hurried or delayed). The geese's resumption at the end signals temporal release but is consequence, not constraint. The element provides symbolic closure participation but minimal pressure shaping.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("to liberate trapped memories") is stated early and pursued across all four fountains, directly shaping the action (follow breadcrumbs, open box). Friction appears briefly when she realizes "the memories were not trapped—they were waiting" and shifts from "liberation" to "acknowledge their weight," reweighting the goal. The motivation drives the structure and closure (memories released, box left empty), though the internal conflict (liberation vs. acknowledgment) is more told than tested through competing on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Defiant hush" is named twice ("a defiant hush against the world's noise"; "The defiant hush remained") and evoked through "quiet," "dry," "paused." The tone is coherent through the pilgrimage and modulates slightly (hush of absence → hush of release). It charges the final image ("silence of things finally let go") with purpose. However, the tone is asserted in summary more than embodied in sentence rhythm or sensory selection during the fountain beats, limiting its charge under pressure.</comment>
