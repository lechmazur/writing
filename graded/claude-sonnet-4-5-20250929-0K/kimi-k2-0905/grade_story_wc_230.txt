<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal state is richly embodied through concrete sensory details (the truffle's scent forcing memory, the glass eye burning through wool). Emotional logic remains consistent—fear of silence drives choices throughout—and the final decision to "drink…not to erase, but to carry them more gently" is earned by the accumulating pressure of memories and the translucent congregation. Minor weakness: some interiority edges toward abstract phrasing ("cultivating psychological safety") that slightly distances us from the visceral experience, though this is largely mitigated by the concrete action framing it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered images (nooses, storms, truffles that remember) and the pattern of occlusion versus revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to Earned Stasis) when the protagonist drinks "not to erase, but to carry them more gently." Cost is legible: the choice to witness rather than silence forecloses the escape route. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (ravine, forager, basket). The escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake with undeniable pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard functions as more than backdrop: roots "like nooses" create threat, the oldest tree shelters the climactic choice, and the storm's pause after the protagonist drinks demonstrates environmental response to character action. The glass eye's physical properties (warmth, floating, settling where the scar was) constrain and enable the final transformation. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"fruits knocked together like teeth confessing"—and filtered through the forager's perception. The ravine's vertical space (rope ladder, descent, climb) structures the journey and charges the final ascent with earned weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding a cure versus bearing communal pain—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery of the glass eye, preparation of the mixture, and the voice's challenge. The spilled mixture forces escalation; the luminous film rising to "occlude nothing, revealing everything" crystallizes the choice. Agency is clear: the protagonist's decision to drink "to carry them more gently" forecloses the path of erasure with visible cost (accepting the congregation's presence). One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens; the textbook's warning about consent to be witnessed raises stakes before the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tension between silencing others' emotions and bearing them: the antique eye, truffles that "remember," and the distinction between muting and holding cohere without thesis statement. The final image—"the ravine was inside me, safely tethered by truthful silence"—offers a non-literal answer that reweights the entire journey. The piece resists binary resolution: psychological safety is redefined as witness rather than occlusion. Recurring motifs (storms, roots, the glass eye) gain charged meaning through action rather than symbolic convenience, and the closing lines about planting new truffles extend the thematic question without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (the forager filters everything through tactile and olfactory experience). Voice modulates effectively under pressure—syntax tightens during the mixture preparation and expands in the final reflection. The single line of dialogue ("Don't") reads purposefully sparse and sourceless, charging the moment. Minor issue: occasional register drift toward abstract diction ("cultivating psychological safety," "fractured grace" as narrator's phrase rather than character's) slightly strains the established voice, though the surrounding concrete imagery mostly anchors it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and most images are precise ("roots like nooses," "luminous film…like curious children"). Information density is high; lines typically advance multiple elements. However, several phrases repeat near-synonymous concepts within close proximity: "occluding nothing, revealing everything" immediately after the film "wrapped my ankles, climbing," and the final section contains minor loops (storms coming again, carrying orchard, reaching deeper/holding tighter). The figurative language occasionally stacks without clear progression—"fractured grace" appears twice in context that doesn't fully dramatize the grace aspect. No major opacity, but density could tighten in the last quarter.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—truffles that remember emotions in a post-empathy-virus world—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative and lyrical modes. The transformation of the cure quest (from erasure to witnessing) avoids the expected binary and follows from established character logic. Specific grounding details (waxed cloth, tin cup, rope ladder) anchor the fantastical elements. The glass eye as both relic and participatory organ feels organic rather than convenient. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the sourceless voice heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, though the "fractured grace" framing occasionally edges toward safety-hedged poeticism rather than full commitment to its harsher implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rational truffle forager frames the opening, drives the decision to prepare the mixture, and makes the final choice to drink and later plant new truffles. Present in setup, middle preparation, and closure. The rationality trait creates tension with the involuntary truths forced by the work. Solid causal role across beats, though the "rational" label does more work than dramatized rational behavior in peak moments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The antique glass eye appears early (wedged in trunk yesterday), is handled in the mixture preparation, grows hot to demand attention, floats to replace the protagonist's scarred eye, and accompanies the walk home as "warm companion." Drives the vision-doubling that enables the climactic choice and charges the final image ("open lids, letting the rain rinse fear"). Irreplaceable: its specific property (seeing souls) and physical integration (settling where the scar was) are essential to closure. Three distinct beats plus closure linkage with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sister Imelda's smuggled relic (the glass eye) from the outlawed monastery provides backstory that justifies the eye's properties. The smuggled status signals the post-virus world's restrictions and adds weight to possessing it. However, the "smuggled" aspect itself doesn't constrain on-page choices—the eye's function matters more than its provenance. Present in setup and resonates thematically, but the core concept could pivot to "lost relic" without major structural change. Functional but somewhat replaceable in its exact smuggled formulation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Involuntarily truthful operates twice with visible cost: the truffle's scent forces the protagonist to "taste my mother's last lie," and when holding the eye the protagonist states "I am afraid the quiet will be worse than the noise"—a confession that reframes the quest. The attribute constrains the option to continue self-deception and enables the final choice to witness rather than occlude. Present in setup (established via truffle reaction), middle (confession with eye), and implicit in closure (drinking to carry truthfully). Two distinct beats with clear tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Occlude appears in the protagonist's whisper to the truffle ("I will occlude you") and is inverted when the luminous film "occluding nothing, revealing everything" forces the turn. The action frames the central conflict (silence versus witness) and the reversal drives the climactic choice. However, the physical act of occlusion itself is more thematic than mechanical—the story could substitute "silence" or "hide" with minor adjustments to the film's negation phrase. Strong thematic integration and purposeful reprise, but not fully indispensable as an exact action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The discredited textbook with diagrams is introduced early (pages sewn inside coat), its recipe (truffle spores mixed with powdered glass eye) is followed on-page, and its warning ("the cure completes only if the patient consents to be witnessed") shapes the climactic decision. The method drives the middle beat (mixture preparation) and closure (drinking after consent). The textbook's discredited status adds tension. Present in setup, executed in middle, and its mechanics matter to outcome. Two beats plus closure linkage, though the "rumored cures" plural is less specific than the singular textbook's role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard in the ravine structures the entire journey: descent via rope ladder, trees whose roots threaten like nooses, the oldest tree sheltering the climactic choice, the orchard's exhale when the protagonist drinks, and the final climb out. Storms batter throughout, tightening pressure and pausing at resolution. The vertical space (ravine depth) makes the return ascent feel earned. Setting supplies the truffles, constrains movement, and responds to the protagonist's choice (roots relax, fruits still). Irreplaceable: remove the orchard and the entire causal and spatial logic collapses. Three or more beats, closure participation, strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>After the empathy virus provides the inciting condition (souls feel like bruises, communal echo) and justifies the forager's quest. The timeframe is signaled early and recurs (post-virus world, outlawed monastery, "first storm after the virus"). It shapes the problem and the discredited textbook's status. However, the empathy virus itself doesn't create a ticking clock or narrow tactical windows on the page—it's more a permanent condition than an escalating pressure. Setup and thematic presence are strong, but it doesn't dynamically constrain moment-to-moment choices the way the storm or the spilled mixture do. Solid context, moderate development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To cultivate psychological safety drives the protagonist's search for a cure, the whisper "I will occlude you," and reframes at closure when safety is redefined as bearing rather than silencing. The motivation is tested when the voice says "Don't" and the protagonist admits fear of quiet, then chooses to witness. Friction between the goal (safety through silence) and the cost (losing connection) creates the story's central tension. Present in setup (implied by the quest), middle (occlude statement), and transformed at closure (carrying gently). Two beats with clear want-versus-cost conflict that drives the ending choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fractured grace appears as descriptor ("stood in fractured grace," "survive the next fractured grace") and the tone—lyrical yet haunted, damaged yet reaching—remains coherent through storm imagery, root-nooses, and the congregation's quiet waiting. Tone modulates with pressure: denser and more ominous during the mixture preparation, then breathes into the final planting-promise. The phrase itself slightly over-signals, but the mood it names (brokenness held with dignity) charges the final image of walking home and planting seedlings. Coherent and purposeful, though "fractured grace" as explicit label reduces some organic emergence. Strong modulation and closure linkage keep it in mid-high band.</comment>
