<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lina's interiority is concrete and specific ("fingertips pressed to a foundation stone chip," "dual allegiance prickled"), with embodied contradictions driving her choices throughout. Her motivations are clear and intensify under pressure, from translating chaos to orchestrating overnight reorganization. The assembly's collective decision feels slightly underearned given the limited on-page deliberation, and some secondary characters (fire-eater, baker) remain gestural. The final choice to "invent tomorrow's graffiti" carries visible cost—postponement rather than resolution—earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—pressure accumulates through the Syndicate threat, midnight assembly, and overnight reorganization, crystallizing in Charged Poise at closure ("we are still becoming"). Orientation anchors quickly (perpetual carnival, Lina's role, Syndicate threat). The escalation from individual graffiti signal to collective reorganization to inspectors' retreat is causally clean, and the ending delivers Resonant Reconfiguration: the carnival rehearses "change as another act, not the closing curtain" with felt cost (privatization merely postponed). One meaningful tightening occurs when the assembly decides to reorganize overnight, narrowing options with visible tactical stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The raft city setting is vivid, specific, and constrains multiple choices: graffiti as resistance medium, overnight deck-swapping logistics, the foundation stone chip as anchor. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Lina's priorities (calliope music, popcorn smoke, corporate teal). Spatial choreography remains clear across locations (sundeck, midway, container alley, calliope assembly). The setting charges the final image—"bright, rickety, and unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved"—transforming postcard description into tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival vs. integrity) is signaled early and tightens through Syndicate arrival, graffiti signal, and midnight assembly decision. The overnight reorganization creates a meaningful reversal that narrows options with visible cost: prizes become poems on dissolving rice paper, investors retreat confused, but "capital would return with bigger barges." Agency is collective but earned through Lina's call and the assembly's embodied response. The piece delivers one solid tightening; the cost (postponement, not victory) is legible and scaled appropriately for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete actions: resistance as performance, survival through illegibility, change as rehearsal rather than surrender. The foundation stone chip recurs with shifting weight (anchor → debate signal → heartbeat bell), avoiding token symbolism. The final image—"we are still becoming"—offers a resonant answer to the central question (can identity survive commodification?) without moralizing. Dual allegiance shapes tactics throughout, and the ending embraces complexity: the carnival survives by becoming unreadable, accepting postponement as a form of continuity with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Lina with a consistent perceptual signature (tactile detail, color-snagging, dual-pull interiority). Diction is mostly controlled, though some lines edge toward elevated register ("投射的火花" is an untranslated artifact; "hopeful desperation flickering across their faces like [projected sparks]" reads as a generation seam). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at peak beats. Filter verbs ("felt," "looked") appear but remain voice-motivated. Brief dialogue ("We can refuse to sign...") carries subtext and advances plot. No head-hopping; the piece holds focalization cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Most lines do multiple jobs without padding ("the carnival's laughter began to sound like a countdown"). Minor loops appear: "orderly yet intuitive" is described twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure, and "still" recurs in the final two paragraphs ("still dinged," "still becoming," "Lina leaned"). The untranslated Chinese phrase "投射的火花" is a clear generation artifact that disrupts the final-third register. Information density is high overall, and the prose propels cleanly through transitions, but the artifact and mild paraphrase loops prevent entry to 8.0+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival premise is fresh and grounded in specific tactical detail (graffiti codes, deck-swapping, prizes as dissolving poems). The dual allegiance motif and "reorganize to survive" premise avoid template gentrification narratives through lived-in carnival culture and the legibility-as-resistance turn. Risk-taking is present: the piece commits to collective action and an open ending without hedging toward individual heroism or tidy resolution. The transformation test holds: plot and arc depend on this exact floating carnival, these codes, this form of resistance. One counter-pressure: the Syndicate remains abstract (linen suits, speedboat), limiting friction depth slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina (culture shock absorber) is present throughout and drives key turns: she paints the graffiti signal, convenes the assembly, holds up the foundation chip, and invents tomorrow's symbol. Her role as translator and resistance organizer shapes tactics at every beat and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in four beats: opening anchor (Lina strokes it), graffiti symbol (cracked stone in palms), midnight assembly (held up under gaslight), and closing image (dangles "like a bell"). It shifts from personal talisman to collective signal to embodied closure marker, reweighting meaning with each appearance and charging the final stance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dual allegiance ("part of her wanted the city to survive unchanged, part of her wanted it to survive at all") is stated early and shapes on-page choices: she paints the resistance signal while acknowledging privatization's inevitability, orchestrates reorganization while knowing it's only postponement. The friction drives tactics and charges the ending's ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Orderly yet intuitive" is described twice but demonstrated once: Lina walks the midway "counting her breaths in fours while letting her eyes snag on colors that felt wrong." The trait enables her to decode Syndicate branding and navigate the carnival's chaos, but lacks a second distinct beat where the duality constrains a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Reorganize" drives the major turn: the assembly decides to reorganize overnight, swapping decks and transforming corporate logos into grotesque masks. The action redefines options (from refusal to illegibility), enables the inspectors' retreat, and is irreplaceable—no synonym (rearrange, restructure) carries the same tactical and thematic weight. It appears in three beats (decision, execution, sunrise result) and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Graffiti messages are signaled early (harlequin face = midnight meeting, roulette wheel = bring tool) and Lina adds the cracked-stone symbol ("foundation questioned"). The method is specific, taught through concrete examples, and shapes the assembly's convening. It recurs at closure when Lina begins inventing tomorrow's graffiti, making the mechanics essential to resistance tactics and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival raft city supplies resources (shipping containers, calliope, decks to reorganize), pressures choices (threat of tugboats, need for illegibility), and charges every beat. Micro-setting details (pontoons, freight pallets, painted prows) ground the floating premise, and the setting enables the final tactic: becoming "unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved." Removal would collapse story logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Before privatization" tightens decisions throughout: the Syndicate sent negotiators last month, tonight Lina acts, midnight assembly decides, by sunrise inspectors retreat. The timeframe drives urgency ("laughter began to sound like a countdown") and shapes the ending's provisional quality ("privatization had merely been postponed"). The clock is tracked and alters tactics, though not as tightly as a single-night countdown would.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Navigating gentrification is dramatized through concrete choices: Lina translates chaos, debates signing vs. refusal, signals "foundation questioned," and orchestrates overnight reorganization. The friction between survival and integrity appears in every beat and drives the ending's ambiguity: the carnival survives by rehearsing illegibility, accepting postponement as cost. Want (preserve) and need (survive) collide on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is coherent and modulates with pressure: "hopeful desperation flickering" at the assembly, children's laughter as ballast, sunrise inspectors retreating while Lina knows capital will return. The tone charges the final image—"still becoming"—where hope and desperation coexist without resolution, making the oxymoron structural rather than decorative.</comment>
