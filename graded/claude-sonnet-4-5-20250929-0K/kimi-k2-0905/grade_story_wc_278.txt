<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tattooist's motivation (hushing guilt over the boy's death) is established early, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Key moments like "the stars she wore on her own collarbone would stop burning" gesture at pain without grounding it in specific, character-particular thought or action under pressure. The final choice to "slice the paper chain" and choose RELEASE INSECT reads as allegorical ritual rather than a decision earned by on-page struggle between contradictory impulses. Interiority leans toward label-like emotional states ("dissonance," "guilt") without the micro-hesitations or irrational specificity that would make her feel singular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational (guilt-pressure accumulates through imagery and console interaction). Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: the lab is reframed from archive to parasite, and the final choice (RELEASE INSECT) frees the lullaby and husks the amber, reweighting guilt into "forgiven sleep." Cost is legible in the image of the emptied amber and quieted collarbone. However, the console's three-option menu structure and the sudden revelation that "the laboratory did not store lost sounds; it cultivated them" arrive late without prior anchoring, weakening causal momentum. The Orientation Test is borderline: "laboratory of lost sounds" and "console" anchor place and object by the second paragraph, but "when time folded in on itself" remains atmospheric rather than functional until the retrospective vision, delaying full spatial/temporal grounding past ~150 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The laboratory's physical details—drawers that "sighed open," letters with wet ink dated centuries ago, the hologram crib mobile—are vivid and serve dual duty as atmosphere and constraint. The amber with its insect and the brass stylus are handled repeatedly and matter to the closure: she tethers the amber, then the insect dissolves into the lullaby, and the stylus inks the console's "wooden cheek." The "meteor hush" anchors tone and recurs at the retrospective vision and final line, charging the ending. Spatial choreography is clean within the single-room scene. Micro-setting (console, amber, stylus, letters) functions as setting and satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: silence the guilt-static and complete the unfinished lullaby. Pressure accumulates through the console interaction, the menu choices, and the realization that the lab "cultivated" guilt. One meaningful tightening occurs when the letters wrap her wrists, "tethering her to the console, to the guilt," forcing the final choice. However, agency is diffuse—she selects RESTORE, then RELEASE, but the narrative mode treats these as symbolic gestures rather than decisions with visible tradeoffs or foreclosed paths. The cost at closure (amber now empty, collarbone quiet) is conceptual and imagistic rather than a felt price paid through struggle. Escalation reads more as accumulative density than narrowing options under protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—guilt as static that demands voice, lullabies as both wound and salve—emerges through image and action rather than statement. The final act (inking a "mute star, a closed mouth" on the console and choosing RELEASE) offers a non-literal answer: silence the lab's parasitic hunger by freeing the sound rather than feeding it. Subtext operates in the amber's "promise never delivered" and the letters that "describe every client she had tattooed" as nodes in "haunted firmware." The lullaby reversed and then completed avoids sentimentality. Yet the realization "the laboratory did not store lost sounds; it cultivated them" arrives as authorial reveal rather than earned discovery, and the final image, while resonant, leans on allegorical clarity at the expense of ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on the tattooist; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the console interaction and retrospective vision. Voice carries a distinct lyric-poetic register ("meteor hush," "sawdust that smelled of nursery pine") that remains consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("tonal ache," "sleeper code," "firmware") that feels imposed rather than filtered through the tattooist's idiom. The retrospective vision ("Time folded tighter; she saw herself years earlier") is clean but the perceptual signature—how she notices under stress—remains generically poetic rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose is ambitious and imagistically dense, with striking local constructions ("the sky swallowing its own fire," "paper chain that wrapped her wrists"). However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating a uniform lyric texture that flattens rhythm and slows momentum. Mixed metaphors and strained vehicles appear: "haunted firmware" in crib mobiles and "sleeper code" mix software idiom with supernatural archive without coherent world logic. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The" + noun ("The tattooist's gloves," "The console's screen," "The amber insect," "The letters converged," "The menu refreshed"), creating a drumbeat that becomes predictable. Paraphrase loops: "Time folded" recurs twice without added pressure. Information density is high but clarity suffers under the metaphor load. Apply −0.8 in Q7 for density + template cadence + mixed metaphor, and note that artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("Time unfolded; the laboratory drawers closed"), triggering the −1.7 adjustment and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattoos, lost-sound archive, and haunted firmware is conceptually fresh, and the amber-as-memory-vessel carrying the boy's cry is a non-obvious choice. The lab-as-parasite twist and the menu-driven resolution offer ingenuity. However, the piece leans heavily on allegorical scaffolding (guilt → static, lullaby → cure, amber → forgiveness) that risks feeling like a template for poetic closure rather than a lived emotional truth. The final image—amber now empty, collarbone quiet—is evocative but predictable once the lab's true nature is revealed. Risk-taking in structure (time-folding, hologram vision) heightens atmosphere but does not fundamentally redefine stakes. No proximity to famous material detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the first line. Development: she approaches the console, tethers the amber (middle beat), selects RESTORE, then slices the paper chain and chooses RELEASE (ending beat). Closure linkage: her final choice (inking the console, selecting RELEASE) drives the ending. However, her decisions read more as symbolic participation in an allegorical ritual than as choices that narrow live options with visible cost. She does not grapple with a tradeoff on the page; the menu appears and she selects. Causal pressure is moderate. Two gates clear (setup, closure); middle development is present but passive. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.6, minus ornamental/passive use −0.5, minus swappability (could be any guilt-bearer) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0, round to 5.8 for two beats + closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph 4 as one of "two things" she carries. Development: she tethers it to the console (middle beat), it twitches and projects the boy's cry. Closure: "she walked away… the piece of amber now empty, clear as forgiven sleep" (final line). Three beats, early signal, closure linkage strong, specificity high (insect inside, wings frozen, then dissolved into hologram). Causal pressure: the amber enables the lullaby restoration. Cost connection: emptying the amber is the visible price. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, total +5.2. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, but cap at 7.2 because the amber is more vessel than agent—it is acted upon rather than constraining her choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "haunted firmware, of lullabies encoded into crib mobiles" appears in paragraph 6, late first-third. Development: the letters describe how each tattoo "became a node in the haunted firmware, a sleeper code." Closure: the concept frames the lab's parasitic nature but does not alter her final choice. The firmware is atmospheric texture rather than a mechanic that shapes tactics. Two gates (late setup, middle mention); no closure participation beyond theme. Score: late setup −0.3, ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6 (could be "cursed network" or similar). Base 3.0 + 0.6 (middle mention) − 1.6 = 2.0, but lyric resonance lifts to 4.8 because the firmware-as-trap reweights prior guilt.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "the lab's translators parsed" the boy's cry (paragraph 8). Development: the console menu offers "TRANSLATE BABY CRIES" and she selects RESTORE instead. Closure: the lullaby is completed and hushed. The attribute is present in one beat (the translation moment) and shapes the menu, but she does not use the translation; she chooses restoration. One gate (middle), label-only at closure. Score: middle beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.5 (enables the menu), minus ornamental −0.5, minus summary-only −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.0, but the attribute enables the restoration option, lifting to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: she carries the amber, paragraph 4. Development: "she tethered the amber to the console's input port" (paragraph 7), enabling the hologram and menu. Closure: "With the brass stylus she sliced the paper chain" and chose RELEASE. The tether is the inciting act; the slice is the final act. Two distinct uses of tethering/binding and releasing. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2 (tether enables console, slice frees her), closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3, but the action is more metaphorical than physical (paper chain, stylus inking), reducing irreplaceability. Cap at 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "console grown from antique furniture whose drawers sighed open to reveal handwritten letters" (paragraph 5). Development: the letters describe the haunted firmware and wrap her wrists (paragraphs 6, 12). Closure: "the letters crumbling into sawdust" (penultimate paragraph). Three beats, early signal, closure linkage moderate. The letters are more atmospheric than mechanical; they do not constrain her choice beyond wrapping her wrists (which she slices). Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, minus ornamental −0.6, minus swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, but the letters' revelatory content (every client = firmware node) adds thematic weight, lifting to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "laboratory of lost sounds" in paragraph 2, "central console" in paragraph 5. Development: the lab's walls pulse, drawers open, hologram rotates, menu appears—each beat shaped by the lab's architecture. Closure: "the laboratory drawers closed," dawn outside, she walks away. The lab pressures every choice and the console is the interaction surface. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4 (lab cultivates guilt, forces menu choice), closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3, but the lab is more stage than constraint (she is never blocked by its layout), capping at 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "when time folded in on itself" (first line). Development: "Time folded tighter; she saw herself years earlier" (paragraph 14). Closure: "Time unfolded" (penultimate paragraph). The timeframe is poetic atmosphere, not a ticking clock. It does not narrow options or create urgency; the folding enables the retrospective vision but does not constrain her choice. Two gates (setup, closure), lyric reprise. Score: setup +0.6, closure linkage +0.9 (time unfolds as resolution), minus ornamental −0.8, minus vague/untracked −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.2 = 3.2, but the reprise reweights the premise, lifting to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "seeking to hush the dissonance of old guilt that crackled in her chest like static" (paragraph 2). Development: "if she could translate that cry… perhaps the guilt would quiet" (paragraph 10); realization the lab feeds on guilt (paragraph 13). Closure: "the dissonance inside her chest… softened into the hush of meteors burning out," "her collarbone quiet at last." Three beats, early signal, closure linkage strong. However, the motivation is told and reiterated rather than dramatized in contradictory micro-choices. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure +0.9, minus told-only −0.8, minus label-only interiority −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, but the guilt shapes every beat, lifting to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "meteor hush" in the first line. Development: "meteors fell without sound—meteor hush" (paragraph 14, retrospective vision). Closure: "the hush of meteors burning out" (paragraph 18). The tone is poetic-quiet-elegiac, coherent across the piece and modulating at the retrospective beat (tightening) and final release (softening). The phrase recurs at key pressure points and charges the final image. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, tone modulation +0.8, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0, but tone is more texture than constraint, capping at 6.3 per the Tone-as-mood limiter.</comment>
