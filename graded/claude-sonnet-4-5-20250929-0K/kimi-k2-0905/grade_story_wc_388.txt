<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation is clear and her shift from debunker to truth-seeker provides consistent drive. Internal contradiction appears in her near-impulse to drop the diamond versus her determination to excavate truth, creating visible struggle. However, the final choice to hang the diamond feels more thematic than emotionally earned—her renunciation lacks the embodied cost and contradictory pull that would elevate it. The interiority occasionally slides into abstract phrasing ("the comfortable lies had grown teeth") rather than staying grounded in her particular perceptual register.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases through the letter-reassembly sequence, and the final image of broadcast lies and browning apples reweights the opening premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is swift (who, where, what by the second paragraph). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the diamond becomes a broadcast mechanism rather than a personal burden, shifting the orchard from preserved lie to accelerating rot. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marisol chooses to hang the diamond rather than carry it. The cost is conceptual and ecological rather than visceral, which fits the accumulative design but limits emotional charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is specific and purposeful: hexagonal scars on apples mirror the letter fragments, creating a micro-world that constrains Marisol's method of discovery. The stillpoint functions as both spatial constraint (temperature drop, Geiger silence) and tool that enables her hummed access. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"angry cicada" clicks, "ghost tides" of dust, temperature plunge—and the final image of browning fruit charges the closure. The environment doesn't just backdrop; it actively teaches the tessellation pattern that guides reassembly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—excavate truth from archived lies—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the reassembly sequence and peaks when the diamond's playback forces Marisol to inventory her own complicity. The tightening occurs when she nearly drops the stone but chooses instead to broadcast it, a renunciation of personal possession that forecloses the path of amnesia. The cost is legible (she gives up the comfort of forgetting) but remains conceptual; the final act feels more like thematic demonstration than a choice forced by contradictory wants under acute pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the diamond's playback and the orchard's dual nature (preserved by radiation, rotted by truth). The piece resists moralizing—Marisol's own voice is among the archived lies, complicating any simple hero arc. The final image of seeds "glinting like glass" and apples browning offers a resonant answer: truth accelerates decay faster than radiation preserves, a non-literal reckoning with the cost of memory. The hexagonal-scar motif earns its recurrence by constraining her method and charging the ending. Minor slip: "the comfortable lies had grown teeth" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Marisol notices hexagonal scars, temperature shifts, and tessellation patterns in a way that reflects her former analytical role. Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional phrases ("sharply observant eyes caught the pattern") filter unnecessarily and a few constructions ("impossibly glossy," "ghost tides") drift toward stock lyricism. The narrative voice modulates well under pressure, tightening during the reassembly and softening into the final broadcast moment. No head-hopping or POV leaks; distance stays consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—nearly every sentence advances setting, character choice, or thematic charge. However, several beats carry figurative density without clear payoff: "ghost tides," "chrome letters...half-melted into slag," "poisoned apples refusing to fall" cluster decoratively rather than charging a peak moment. Paraphrase loop: "reassemble the letters" / "piece by piece, sentences regrew" / "Another strip slotted home" restates the same action across three paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the opening third with repeated "she [verb]" constructions. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of ornamental metaphor and synonym churn pulls the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of archive-as-orchard and diamond-as-playback-device is specific and non-obvious; the hexagonal tessellation linking scars to letter fragments offers fresh material logic. The piece commits fully to its post-liquidation premise and follows the implications without retreat. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure and the conceptual rather than visceral cost at closure. However, the "cursed artifact records all lies" core and the wasteland-survivor frame echo familiar templates; transformation arises more from execution than premise novelty. The final image of truth-accelerated rot is memorable and feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Marisol's choices drive three key beats: kneeling at the stillpoint, humming the sign-off tone to open the ground, and hanging the diamond to broadcast rather than possess. Her shift from observation (noting scars) to action (reassembly, retrieval, broadcast) creates the arc. The final choice alters tactics from personal truth-seeking to ecological broadcast, a meaningful turn. Present across setup, middle, and ending; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The diamond is handled in three beats: retrieval from the root cavity, the immediate playback that forces Marisol to confront her complicity, and the final hanging that transforms it into a broadcast mechanism. Its flaw (question-mark spear) is specific and its property (recording lies) drives the closure choice. The object's meaning shifts from cursed burden to truth-tool, reweighting the premise. Closure linkage is strong; it shapes the final image directly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The stillpoint is established early (seventh row, Geiger drop, temperature plunge) and constrains access—Marisol must intuit its location and use resonance (the hummed tone) rather than force. It enables the middle beat (opening the ground) and widens at closure to "cocoon her in a hush." However, its conceptual role (eye of calm inside perpetual storm) is more atmospheric than causally necessary; the story could function with a simple hidden chamber. Present in setup and ending; middle beat is functional but the concept itself remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is demonstrated when Marisol notices the hexagonal-scar pattern matching the letter tessellation, a key insight that unlocks the reassembly method. However, the trait is mostly label-delivered ("sharply observant eyes") rather than shown through perceptual bias across multiple beats. It enables one turn but lacks visible tradeoff—hypervigilance does not cost her anything or shape her mistakes. Present and functional in one beat; no recurring constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears explicitly when Marisol must "intuit rather than see" the stillpoint door and later when she presses her palm and hums the resonance tone, an act of inference rather than force. The action is signaled early and shapes the access beat. However, the mechanics of intuition are vague—does she guess, remember a pattern, or respond to a physical cue? The action is present and functional but feels somewhat interchangeable with "deduce" or "sense." Two beats; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is signaled in the opening (satchel contents) and occupies the middle sequence in detail: grammar and paper grain guide her fingers, hexagonal tessellation teaches the pattern, sentences regrow piece by piece. The method is specific and its mechanics matter—she uses the orchard's scars as a template. However, the payoff is informational (learning the diamond's location and curse) rather than a tactical shift that alters the ending choice. Present across setup and middle; functional but does not directly shape closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard pressures every major choice: hexagonal scars teach the reassembly pattern, the stillpoint provides access, radioactive apples glow to light her work, and the final image of browning fruit crystallizes the cost of truth. The orchard is not backdrop but active constraint and tool. Marisol could not achieve her goal in a generic ruin. The setting is indispensable across setup, middle, and ending; causal pressure is high and specificity (Paradise gate, seventh row, sub-root chamber) is essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" is mentioned early and frames Marisol's shift from debunker to truth-hunter, but it does not create a live clock or tighten decisions. Time passes vaguely ("hours thinned") without consequence. The timeframe is functional setup but does not shape tactics or escalate pressure. Present in exposition; absent from middle and ending beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated early and dramatized when Marisol nearly drops the diamond but her "original motivation surged" to force her forward. The conflict between wanting to forget (like other scavengers) and needing to expose the lies creates one visible friction point. However, the final choice to broadcast the lies feels more like thematic fulfillment than a decision torn between wants and costs. Present across beats; moderate friction.</comment>
