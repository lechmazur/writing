<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's archivist identity is established through concrete actions—reading "what wasn't there," cataloging absences, braiding the rope into village structures—and her "warmly methodical" trait shows in her composed archive-filing thought at the end. Internal experience remains consistent: curious, task-focused, satisfied at closure. However, no meaningful internal conflict appears; she encounters zero genuine obstacles or contradictions, proceeding smoothly from discovery to execution without struggle or cost to her personally. The "adaptable" trait is asserted but never tested; she adapts to nothing because nothing resists her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (clock, rope, seal, village), building to a Conceptual Repricing where the village is "tucked into the space between ticks." Orientation anchors (Elara, tower, 3:17 a.m.) land early. Closure reconfigures the premise: absence is translated into circulating presence, and the clock resumes with the village now folded into time's fabric. Cost is conceptual but legible—the void is given form, history is reweighted. One pressure point: the frozen clock that "stopped only when the world forgot something it could not bear to remember." The escalation, however, is entirely external and atmospheric; Elara's actions face no resistance, and no choice forecloses a path or alters her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered—gears "taller than confessionals," "oak beams blackened by centuries of lamp smoke," air tasting of "rust and rain." Spatial choreography is clean: spiral stair, platform, cedar chest, pendulum above. The frozen clock hands and shivering gears respond to Elara's work, directly constraining and then releasing the action. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the archivist's lens (lantern catching glint, oxidized time flaking). The rope, seal, and chest function as micro-setting elements that charge the closure image when the rope becomes "warm as fresh bread" and the village is coiled back into the chest.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: translate the absent village into a form time can hold. The frozen clock signals urgency, and Elara's task—braiding wax-soaked cord into village structures—provides a clear goal. One tightening: "With each tug, the frozen clock gears above her shivered," showing responsive pressure. Closure delivers: the clock resumes, the village is folded into time. Yet no reversal or complication tests Elara's commitment; she executes the ritual without error, adaptation, or trade-off. The cost is borne by history (the erased village), not by the protagonist on the page. No live option is foreclosed for her, no want conflicts with fear, and coincidence (the convenient arrival of seal and rope) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: absences leave contours, silence between heartbeats holds meaning, the village exists "between seconds." The twin-swan seal and the treaty's collapse seed the conflict; the rope-as-village braiding enacts the thematic answer without stating it. The final catalog entry—"Item: absence, translated; location: between seconds; status: circulating"—offers a non-literal, resonant answer. Subtext operates in the image of graduates feeling "oddly full, as if they carried a village they had never visited." The piece resists moralizing and invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity (how does one "read what wasn't there?"). Minor slip: "to translate confusion into clarity" borders on prompt echo, though the execution through rope-braiding transforms it into specific action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is distinct: an archivist reading contours, composing catalog entries, thinking in cross-references ("F for fable, A for absence, V for Voss"). Diction is elevated but controlled, matching the archival idiom ("warmly methodical," "orderly cannibalism of seconds"). No dialogue to evaluate. Two slips touch high-band entry: (1) "the world forgot something it could not bear to remember" anthropomorphizes "the world" in a way that blurs focalization, and (2) narrative certainty about the graduates' future feelings ("every graduate would leave feeling oddly full") exceeds Elara's plausible knowledge in the moment, reading as authorial rather than character-bound inference.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("orderly cannibalism of seconds," "negative space in every ledger," "hollow tooth in the jaw of chronology"). Information density is high. Three penalties cluster in Q7: (1) Paraphrase loop: "Yet the absence persisted, a negative space in every ledger, a hollow tooth in the jaw of chronology"—two metaphors restating the same idea adjacently (−0.3). (2) Overwriting: metaphors appear in most sentences of the ritual sequence without pattern-teaching, occasionally muddling clarity ("bleeding wax into the hemp until crest and cord merged into a single crimson script" is vivid but borders on mixed vehicle when letters "rise" and "sink" into fiber immediately after) (−0.4). (3) Stock phrasing: "door that shouldn't exist" appears three times; "warmly methodical" twice; "the space between" recurs four times without reweighting (−0.3). Cumulative artifact load: −1.0, capping near 6.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of clock-tower ritual, diplomat's seal, and rope-braiding into a mechanism for restoring erased history is non-obvious and specific. The "fables of absence" frame transforms a familiar archival-magic premise through concrete detail: the twin-swan seal, the village braided into rope, the space between clock ticks. Elara's role as archivist who "learned to read what wasn't there" personalizes the lens. Risk is present in the lyric density and the conceptual Repricing closure. However, the ritual proceeds without complication or error, reducing dramatic ingenuity. The prompt elements (adaptable archivist, seal, rope, "fables of absence") are deployed transparently, and the piece leans heavily on atmospheric evocation rather than character-driven surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is introduced in the opening line, frames the task in paragraph 6 ("translate confusion into clarity"), executes the rope-braiding ritual across paragraphs 14–19, and completes the closure with the catalog entry and tower exit. She makes one key choice—to braid the rope—but it is uncomplicated and unopposed. The character enables the plot but does not drive reversals or face trade-offs; her adaptability is asserted but never tested. Two gates clear (setup, payoff); middle development is thin. Swappability: a generic "ritual practitioner" could replace her with minor edits. Causal work is present but minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seal appears in paragraph 5 (setup), is laid on the beam in paragraph 13, and merges with the rope in paragraph 15 ("bleeding wax into the hemp until crest and cord merged"). It returns in paragraph 28 as "empty now, but catching sunrise like a promise kept," reweighted from mystery to fulfilled task. Three gates clear. The seal's twin-swan crest seeds the backstory (paragraph 17) and its wax enables the braiding, constraining the method. Specificity is high: the two-swans-sharing-one-neck image is irreplaceable. Cost connection: the seal is consumed in the act, and its emptiness charges the final reprise. Slight friction: the seal's middle-beat mechanics (how wax "bled" into hemp) are asserted more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fables of absence" appears once as a cryptic instruction in paragraph 6 and is enacted through the rope-braiding ritual: the absent village is given form, "folded" into time. The concept shapes the dominant stake (translate the void) and is dramatized in the rope's sentence-spelling (paragraph 16) and the final catalog entry ("absence, translated"). Three gates clear. However, the phrase itself remains ornamental; the story would function identically if the instruction read "restore what was erased." The conceptual work is carried by "absence" alone; "fables" adds lyric color but no mechanical specificity. Causal role: moderate. Irreplaceability: medium-low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Warmly methodical" is applied to Elara twice: paragraph 7 ("thirty warmly methodical years") and paragraph 30 ("She smiled, warmly methodical"). It colors her voice in the catalog-entry thought (paragraph 31) and contrasts with the gothic atmosphere, but it never constrains a choice or imposes cost. The trait is label-only; no scene shows her warmth or method colliding with urgency or chaos. Two gates: setup and payoff. Middle development absent. Swappability: "patient" or "deliberate" would substitute cleanly. Decorative mention deduction: −0.3. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; round to 4.7 for lyric payoff presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Merge" drives the climax: paragraph 15 ("the seal grew soft, bleeding wax into the hemp until crest and cord merged"), paragraph 19 ("She braided the wax-soaked cord into the shape of the missing village"), and paragraph 20 (the clock resumes as time "folded, tucking the village into the space between ticks"). The action is seeded in paragraph 6's instruction and executed across the ritual sequence. Three gates clear. The merge is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the causal chain. Cost: the seal is consumed, the village enters a liminal state. Minor friction: the mechanics of merging (how sentences "rose on the rope's skin") are asserted more than shown, limiting full 8.5+ entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rope is introduced in paragraph 12 (setup), its ceremonial history noted in paragraph 13, and its braids are reconfigured in paragraph 14 ("loosening the left strand, crossing the right over absence itself"). The method is enacted in paragraph 19 ("each twist a syllable, each knot a citizen") and paragraph 22 (rope coiled "now warm as fresh bread"). Three gates clear. The braiding constrains the ritual's mechanics and is irreplaceable: no other method is suggested. Specificity is high (scarlet dye, left/right strands, village-structure knots). Cost: the rope is transformed and returned to the chest. Slight friction: the reader must infer the exact mechanics; the piece shows results (letters rising, gears shivering) more than process.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The clock tower mechanism room is established in paragraph 3 (setup), its frozen clock drives the task (paragraph 9), and the gears respond to Elara's work (paragraph 15: "shivered, shedding flakes of oxidized time"). The platform, chest, and pendulum supply resources (rope, seal access). Three gates clear. The setting constrains the action spatially (spiral stair, platform, gears above) and temporally (clock hands frozen at eleven-to). Specificity: "gears taller than confessionals," "oak beams blackened by lamp smoke." The setting's response (gears shivering, clock resuming) charges the climax. Irreplaceable: the mechanism room is integral to the clock-time closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When the door shouldn't exist" structures the threshold: paragraph 2 (the brass plate "should have been solid stone"), paragraph 26 (the door "remained open until she stepped through, then sealed itself"), and the motif recurs in paragraph 29 ("the clock struck four, though her watch insisted it was only three"). Two gates clear (setup, payoff). The impossible-door motif brackets the action and charges the ending's slippage, but it does not constrain choices during the ritual. Time pressure is declared (3:17 a.m., frozen hands) but not tracked or escalated. Swappability: "hidden door" would substitute with minor tonal loss. Lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph 13 ("to translate confusion into clarity by giving the void a voice") and enacted in the rope-braiding (paragraphs 19–20) and catalog entry (paragraph 31: "absence, translated"). Three gates clear. The desire shapes the dominant stake and is dramatized in action (braiding, coiling, filing). However, no internal friction appears—Elara never doubts, fears failure, or weighs competing desires. The motivation is clean and consistent but unopposed. Cost: conceptual (the village enters liminal space) rather than personal. Specificity: the phrasing "translate confusion into clarity" borders on prompt echo but is redeemed by the rope-as-syllable execution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Clear complexity" holds throughout: the prose is dense with layered imagery (clock, rope, seal, village, time) yet remains legible in causality and stakes. Tone modulates from gothic discovery (paragraphs 1–4: rust, rain, pendulum heartbeat) through archival focus (paragraphs 14–20: methodical braiding) to quiet satisfaction (paragraphs 30–32: sunrise, catalog entry). The tone charges the final image: "the tower ticked on, measuring time that now contained what history had tried to erase." Coherence is high; no tonal breaks. The complexity is conceptual (fables of absence, liminal village) rather than emotional (Elara faces no internal conflict), which limits the felt pressure but aligns with the accumulative lens.</comment>
