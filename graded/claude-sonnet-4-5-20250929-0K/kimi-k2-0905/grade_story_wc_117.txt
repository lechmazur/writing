<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her gift is dramatized through action, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract—embodied emotion is limited to the final moment when she presses the curl to her wrist. The children's responses feel more like symptoms than agency; they pause and widen eyes but make no choices that complicate or advance pressure. The therapy-speak label "softly adaptive" and the phrase "stitched the listener back together" hover near diagnostic shorthand without grounding in visceral consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative lens is taught early through the braided structure of preparation-ritual-effect and holds through closure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing): the final image of children laughing at stretched shadows reweights the opening premise—wonder is "handed onward" rather than restored—with the conceptual cost that her work is "never finished." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words. The descent functions as coda rather than a second decisive change, which fits the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridge setting is vivid and purposeful: silver sage, the Listening Stone with its ring of offerings, and the eclipse's sensory transformations (cooled air, twilight trills, ants freezing mid-trail) are filtered through Elara's perceptual priorities. The environment enables the ritual and charges the final image when "sage leaf flashed silver, every root beneath the ridge hummed." Micro-setting test passed: the baby curl on the stone constrains her ritual timing and anchors memory. Spatial choreography is clean throughout ascent, peak, and descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring wonder to the valley children—is signaled early and tightens through the eclipse ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the whistle "trembled, almost failing" and Elara steadies it by pressing the curl to her wrist, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. The children's responses (spoon, controller pulse, widening eyes) serve as signs of effect rather than agentic escalation, which limits felt cost. The ending lands with conceptual price ("never finished, only handed onward") visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: the baby curl as "anchor to first astonishment," the eclipse as shared disappearance, and the after-echo "like a pebble in a shoe" reweight wonder as ongoing friction rather than restored certainty. The final image—children laughing at stretched shadows—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. The story resists tidy resolution ("her work was never finished") and avoids prompt-label intrusion. Subtext operates cleanly in the dissolving note and the intentional fray.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and the perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices tempo, sonic linkage, and memory-texture in character-specific ways. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cautious exuberance," "irreversibly linked," "древloping") that strains the music therapist's lexicon under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("felt the ridge inhale," "felt their gazes climb") cluster in the eclipse beat without voice-motivation. No dialogue is present. The prose modulates with scene pressure but lacks the syntactic variety and rhythmic control expected at higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is generally high and the opening/closing anchors are strong. However, several prose artifacts weaken momentum: paraphrase loops ("the ordinary magic she guarded was fading" / "eyes had begun to glaze over screens, wonder traded for certainty" restates the same diagnostic), stock metaphors ("door had cracked open inside their ribs," "silk scarves in wind"), and filter-verb stacks in the eclipse beat ("felt the ridge inhale," "felt their gazes climb"). Template cadence in the children's beat ("a girl…heard," "a boy…felt") and the phrase "softly adaptive" repeated without evolution trigger minor penalties. The figurative density in high-pressure moments ("trembling rope," "warm handholds," "after-echo like a pebble") borders on overwriting without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The eclipse as ritual timing and the baby curl as memory anchor offer specific twists on familiar "restore wonder" premises, but the emotional arc (therapist performs healing ritual, children respond, work continues) follows a recognizable template. The children's awakening via synesthetic flashes (color streaming from fingertips) and the dissolution of the note into natural fray show fresh inflection. However, the "mellow therapist climbs mountain to perform magic at celestial event" frame and the tidy distributional ending (laughing voices, promising to return) trend toward median safety rather than bold synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's choices structure all major beats: she times the ascent to the eclipse (setup), places the curl on the stone and raises the whistle under pressure (development), presses the curl to her wrist when the note trembles (middle turn), and chooses to let the note dissolve naturally rather than sustain it (closure participation). Her agency drives escalation and the final stance. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The baby hair curl appears in four distinct beats: introduced in the satchel (setup), placed on the stone where it "glowed like a question mark of newborn light" (development), pressed against Elara's wrist to steady the melody when the whistle trembles (causal turn), and packed away "darkened a shade, absorbing new stories" (closure participation with reweighted meaning). Its specific property—anchoring first astonishment—constrains her ritual and charges the peak moment. High causal integration and charged reprise; only minor swappability (another keepsake could serve similar function with edits) prevents top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ordinary magic shapes stakes from the opening (fading in children, guarded by Elara) and drives tactics: her gift requires "true alignment—body, memory, and moment," which dictates the eclipse timing and the curl's use. At totality, the magic "flared visible" on the page—sage leaves flash silver, roots hum, children see color streaming—altering options and charging the closure image. The concept is not merely thematic; it changes what is possible and costs Elara ongoing work ("never finished").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is introduced early as Elara's gift (setup) and demonstrated when she plays "not a tune but a linking" that borrows moon and sun and braids them (development). The trait constrains her method—she must answer the secret tempo inside living things—but the cost is largely conceptual (ongoing, never-finished labor) rather than a visible tradeoff on the page. The phrase recurs in the final line without evolving meaning. Causal role present but swappability moderate (another adaptive descriptor could replace it).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The action "link" drives three major beats: Elara plays "a linking, a filament of sound that borrowed the moon's hush and the sun's blaze and braided them" (causal turn), the children feel linked responses (controller pulse, spoon note), and the ending declares "the world looked the same yet irreversibly linked" with the after-echo carried forward. The action redefines options (children regain access to wonder) and charges the closure image. Early signal, multi-beat causality, and closure participation all strong; only slight swappability (another binding/connection action could serve with edits) keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The solar eclipse is signaled early (Elara times her ascent "to arrive exactly as the moon's disc first kissed the sun"), shapes her ritual mechanics (the note borrows "moon's hush and sun's blaze"), and delivers the closure effect at totality when "ordinary magic flared visible" and children see wonder. The eclipse's specific properties—shadows soften, air cools, birds rehearse twilight—constrain her attempt and charge the final image. Removing this exact temporal event would break the story's logic and thematic resonance. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, closure participation, and high irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is introduced in the opening line (setup), supplies the Listening Stone and silver sage that anchor the ritual (development), and at closure "the ridge hummed" while Elara thanks it and promises return. The setting enables her work and charges the final image through its roots and offerings. However, the ridge itself does not constrain a choice under pressure—Elara's struggle is steadied by the curl, not the environment. The setting is essential to tone and thematic resonance but more facilitating than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears once as atmospheric setup but does not function as a tightening timeframe. The eclipse provides the live clock (totality arrives, daylight reasserts), not the "dreaming roots" phrase, which remains ornamental. The element is present in the opening sentence but does not constrain decisions or shape tactics; it could be removed without altering escalation or closure. Late development and closure participation are absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to nurture lifelong wonder" is dramatized early (children's eyes "had begun to glaze over screens, wonder traded for certainty") and drives all choices: climbing the ridge, timing the ritual, steadying the note, and letting it dissolve naturally so children "carry the after-echo like a pebble in a shoe." Friction between want and cost surfaces when the whistle trembles and when the ending declares her work "never finished." The motivation is tested and reweighed at closure with visible conceptual cost. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and closure participation all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance is signaled at the eclipse onset ("the air cooled into cautious exuberance: birds rehearsed twilight trills, ants froze mid-trail") and modulates through Elara's controlled ritual and the children's surprised laughter at the end. The tone coheres through turns and charges the final image of voices "laughing in surprise at their own shadows stretching twice as tall." However, the phrase appears only once and does not constrain a choice; the tone is consistent but not indispensable to the story's logic. Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage present.</comment>
