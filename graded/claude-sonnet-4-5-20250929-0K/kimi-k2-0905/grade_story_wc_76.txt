<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The clockmaker's goal (escaping prophecy) and decisions (yoyo manipulation, choosing neither future, cutting the string) are traceable. However, interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("bleak exhilaration," "accelerating dread") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal internal conflict under pressure. The final choice to cut the string feels mechanically driven by plot necessity rather than earned through prior characterization. Emotional states are asserted rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~200 words), triggering a −0.4 deduction and capping Q3 at 7.0. The piece follows a Causal lens: yoyo mechanics → time fold → string cut → workshop return. Closure lands with cost (loss of counterclockwise gift), but the cost is told rather than felt through prior particulars. The reversal (escaping fate by trading his gift) is legible but not deeply rooted in earlier choices; the hunger stone and yoyo mechanics feel introduced to solve the problem they didn't help create.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Basalt steps, tide-pools, murals, and gears provide vivid anchors, but orientation debt (applied in Q2) caps this category at 7.0. The lighthouse interior (rusted yoyo, hollow throat, levitating bricks) constrains one key choice (the yoyo throw) and charges the final image (empty lighthouse, swaying string). Sensory detail is often atmospheric rather than filtered through urgent POV priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the tower sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (escape prophecy) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the yoyo reaches cord's end and two futures appear, forcing a choice. However, escalation feels more additive (each yoyo trick loosens a brick) than narrowing; the protagonist's agency is mechanical execution rather than agonizing trade-offs. The cost (loss of gift) is legible but arrives as information rather than felt sacrifice. Coincidence (the yoyo being the exact missing piece) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—trading prophecy for possibility, singular gift for uncertain life—emerges from the yoyo reversal and the clockmaker's final smile. The cracked hunger stone and the "clock that told no time at all" offer resonant closure imagery. However, the final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("the promise that any hour could still be changed") and the hunger stone's thirst metaphor remains more decorative than earned through prior particulars. The piece resists false equivalence (the cost is real), but thematic statements ("latent radiance") are repeated without deepening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to the clockmaker. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register ("neatly inventive trap of centuries," "bleak exhilaration") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is weak; the narrator notices symbolically charged objects (hunger stone pulsing, murals appearing) without the selective bias of a craftsman under duress. Free indirect style is clean, but no dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The phrase "bleak exhilaration" recurs four times, becoming a tic rather than a rhythmic choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose carries figurative density ("tower's hollow throat exhaled dust," "lighthouse became an hourglass dripping in reverse") that often obscures rather than clarifies action in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "stepped beyond fate's design" recurs three times without added pressure; "slow exhale of low tide" appears identically twice. Template cadence: "he touched… he sat… he tied… he stepped" structures consecutive beats mechanically. The final third sustains clarity, but earlier beats suffer from synonym churn ("latent radiance" × 4) and mixed metaphors (hunger stone "pulse" vs. "ember eating the string"). Information density is moderate; several lines restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The counterclockwise clockmaker and reverse-engineered yoyo puzzle offer a fresh synthesis, and the hunger stone as anchor/fuel is specific. However, the lighthouse-as-time-machine and fate-escaping protagonist follow familiar template arcs. The emotional truth—losing a singular gift to gain an uncertain life—resonates, but the mechanics (yoyo tricks loosening bricks, opposed torques tearing time) read more like puzzle assembly than character-driven inevitability. The final image (clock telling no time) is purposeful but not surprising. Risk is present in the lyric compression, yet the piece hedges with explanatory asides.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The counterclockwise clockmaker is present throughout and drives multiple beats: touching the yoyo, winding the string, performing tricks, tying the hunger stone, initiating the throw, cutting the string, and greeting the judges. His choices create the major turn (cutting the string to fold time) and shape the closure (forging a timeless clock). Early signal is strong (title character, first sentence). However, his decisions feel plot-serving rather than character-inevitable; internal contradiction is minimal. The trait "counterclockwise" constrains tactics but is more label than lived particularity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hunger stone appears in five distinct beats: pocket (with exposition), tied to yoyo axle, growing heavier/ember, snapping free/ricocheting, and cracked/cold on the bench. It enables the key tactic (conducting latent radiance into the mechanism) and its spent state charges the closure (visible cost). Early signal is present (third paragraph). The stone's "thirst" metaphor recurs but remains more decorative than causally active. Swappability is low; its drought-era warning and radiance are specific. Cost connection is clear (it burns out so he can live).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Latent radiance is mentioned five times and shapes one key tactic: the hunger stone's radiance is conducted into the lighthouse mechanism to power the time fold. However, the concept is more thematic echo than on-page constraint; it does not narrow options or create visible trade-offs until the final spent state. Early signal is present (third paragraph: "latent radiance of all forgotten thirsts"). The radiance enabling the mechanism and its exhaustion at closure tie it to stakes, but the mechanics are told rather than dramatized through choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Neatly inventive" appears twice (lighthouse trap, forging final clock) but functions as label rather than constraint. The trait does not visibly shape on-page choices or create trade-offs; the clockmaker's inventiveness is asserted in description ("reverse-engineer the puzzle") rather than shown through failed attempts, tool choices, or visible problem-solving costs. The attribute is present and consistent but remains ornamental. Late payoff (final paragraph) without middle development or causal pressure caps integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears three times: initiating escape, initiating the throw, and implied in the judges' failed initiation. The yoyo throw is the major turn that folds time and creates the two-futures choice. Early signal is moderate (action named in paragraph six). However, the action is plot-mechanical rather than character-specific; any trigger could serve. The throw drives the peak beat and is necessary for closure, but the specificity of "initiate" as verb does not constrain tactics or add irreplaceable texture beyond "begin" or "start."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering the ancient yoyo is signaled early (paragraph six: "reverse-engineer the puzzle"), drives the middle sequence (tricks loosen bricks, reveal gears), and shapes the climactic throw. The method's mechanics matter: failed tricks have costs (bricks loosen), the string's copper threads conduct radiance, and the yoyo's opposed torque creates the time fold. The puzzle is present in three distinct beats and the closure depends on its mechanics. However, the reversal feels convenient (the yoyo happens to be the exact missing escapement) rather than discovered through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The mysterious lighthouse on a rocky island is present throughout: slick basalt steps, hollow throat, beam with yoyo, murals, chamber, gears, and final empty state. The setting supplies the key resource (the yoyo and gears) and the spatial constraint (bricks levitating, seawater seeping). The lighthouse as time-mechanism charges the closure (empty, gears silent, string swaying). Early signal is strong (first sentence). However, the "mysterious" quality is asserted more than earned through specifics; the lighthouse functions as puzzle-box rather than lived-in pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Under the slow exhale of low tide" appears three times (opening, middle, memory echo) but does not tighten on-page decisions. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical; no clock tracks urgency, and the protagonist's actions are paced by puzzle logic rather than tide pressure. The phrase charges tone and recurs with purpose, but the tide itself does not constrain choices or alter available moves. The "death at dawn" mentioned in paragraph two never creates urgency. Lyric reprise (first → memory) reweights slightly but lacks middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To step beyond fate's design" is stated early (paragraph two), repeated at midpoint (paragraph eleven: "stepping beyond fate's design"), and actualized at closure (protagonist escapes prophecy). The motivation drives the journey to the island, the yoyo experiment, and the final leap. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no friction between self-preservation and the cost of losing his gift appears until after the choice. The motivation is present and causal but lacks on-page struggle or contradictory impulses during peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" appears four times, anchoring tone at key beats: when he realizes the yoyo's role, during memory rewind, at the workshop return, and greeting the judges. The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (bleak during the sacrifice, exhilarating at the escape). However, the phrase becomes a repeated label rather than embodied through varied sensory or cognitive texture. The final image (cracked stone, uncertain life) sustains the tone. Tone charges closure but is over-articulated rather than shown through rhythm and image alone.</comment>
