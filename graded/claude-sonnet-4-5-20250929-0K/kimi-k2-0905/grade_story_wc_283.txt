<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hourglass turner remains more cipher than character—her motivations are asserted (choosing to "unscramble" a broken prophecy) but her interior life consists almost entirely of metaphoric perception without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The button-cataloging feels like symbolic labor rather than psychologically motivated choice; we never see her wrestle with competing impulses or pay a visible personal cost. The pocketed buttons at the end (walrus ivory, red Bakelite) are talismans, not decisions that foreclose paths. Interiority is consistently elevated and poetic but never particular enough to reveal a mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through cataloging, sensory layering, and pattern-making rather than causal because/therefore chains. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the prophecy's threat ("the world will narrow to a thread") is reweighted by the final image of buttons as "a garment we button together." However, cost remains abstract; the felt price of this realization is asserted through metaphor ("hourglass heart inverted") rather than demonstrated through a visible forfeiture or embodied consequence. The orientation is delayed—"hourglass turner" and "amber warehouse" are named early, but the inciting crack and the Abbott's declaration arrive only after scene-setting, creating mild disorientation in the first 15% that never fully pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is vividly rendered—"resinous beams filtered dusk into fossilized honey"—and the buttons themselves function as micro-setting, each one (horn toggles, jet beads, brass disc) carrying sensory and social texture. The spiral on the warehouse floor constrains the protagonist's final stance, literally placing her at its center for the climactic jar-opening. The cliffs frame both arrival and departure, and the monastery tower glints "like a needle," threading the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear and the setting actively charges the ending rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming a broken prophecy into possibility—is signaled but remains abstract throughout; the prophecy's threat is told, not dramatized, so its reweighting lacks concrete pressure. The cataloging montage (grouping buttons "by material, by century, by the pitch of the grief") operates as descriptive labor without on-page reversals or tightening choices that narrow options. Agency is minimal: the jar "quivers," the echo "rushes back inside willingly," and the villager "understood" without a word—outcomes arrive through atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist decision that forecloses a live path. No visible price is paid; the final image asserts hope but never tests it against a credible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly through the button motif: loss, shedding, refastening, and the collaborative construction of futures. The closing image—"the future is a garment we button together, one recovered scrap at a time"—reweights the prophecy's fatalism with a resonant counter-pattern grounded in the particulars of horn toggles and jet beads. However, the piece borders on over-articulation: "every ending is fabric awaiting reassembly" and "unscrambled futures" risk stating the thesis. The "quietly inspired" moment ("the way a librarian feels when an unmarked atlas falls open") offers earned emotional texture, but the final paragraph's warm silence and village understanding veer toward thematic summary rather than image-driven implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent lyric register—"every footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed"—but the narrative voice remains uniform across emotional beats, never modulating under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (buttons grouped "by the pitch of the grief that loosened them") yet the syntax and diction stay elevated throughout, limiting the sense of a mind degrading or sharpening under stress. The one line of indirect dialogue—"the future is a garment we button together"—reads as thematic pronouncement rather than goal-driven speech. Filter verbs ("she felt quietly inspired") are sparse but present at key moments, slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often striking ("sky was the color of old copper," "prophecy began to leak") but several images mix vehicles without coherence: "molten glass" clashes with "amber walls" physics, and "unearthed silence that settled over buttons like dust" asks silence to behave as particulate matter. Template cadence appears in the final third: "She walked on... She pocketed... She lifted... She sealed..." across four consecutive moves. Paraphrase loops emerge: "cataloging lost buttons" → "she found generations of them" → "she laid them out... grouping by material, by century." Information density is moderate; many lines perform double duty (sensory + thematic) but the closing two paragraphs summarize forward action rather than dramatizing the village encounter or the monastery arrival.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—repairing a cracked prophecy by cataloging buttons—offers a fresh synthesis of material culture and metaphysics, and the amber warehouse beneath cliffs supplies vivid specificity. However, the emotional and narrative arc (despair → cataloging → hope) follows a recognizable template, and the resolution relies on atmospheric assertion ("warm silence... they understood") rather than a non-obvious turn. The button motif is deployed skillfully but risks symbolic convenience: each button arrives pre-loaded with meaning (sailor's typhoon, widow's sobs, boy lost to cliffs) rather than earning associations through scene pressure. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode, yet the closure's hopefulness feels inevitable rather than hard-won or surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The hourglass turner is present throughout and makes the choice to leave the monastery, catalog buttons, uncork the jar, and restring the spiral. However, these are enacted decisions rather than dilemma-driven turns; no on-page moment forces a trade-off or alters her tactics under pressure. Setup is immediate, middle beats involve her labor, and she appears in the closure image ("hourglass heart inverted"), but her agency is more curator than catalyst—she arranges existing material rather than wrestling with a costly choice that transforms her stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar is handled in multiple beats: carried in (setup), quivers during cataloging (middle pressure), uncorked to release the echo, and refilled with "refined possibility" before being offered to the monks and cracked open for the villager. The echo's transformation from "raw noise" to "refined possibility" reweights its meaning across the arc. However, the jar's mechanics remain metaphoric; we never see a concrete cost tied to its use (e.g., a risk in opening it, a sacrifice to refill it). Strong integration but the specificity of the object's constraint is soft.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is announced early ("Shared wisdom rose not as revelation but as scent") and returns in the closure when the jar is opened for the villager and "without a word they understood." However, it functions primarily as theme rather than shaping on-page tactics or stakes; the protagonist does not wrestle with how to achieve shared wisdom or pay a price to unlock it. The concept frames the ending's emotional register but does not constrain middle choices or generate a reversal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" appears once in a single simile ("the way a librarian feels when an unmarked atlas falls open") and colors the protagonist's affective state but does not visibly enable or constrain an action. The attribute is told rather than shown through a micro-choice under pressure, and no trade-off or cost is linked to it. Present and voice-consistent, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unscramble" is invoked early ("she chose to unscramble it instead") and recurs in the closing image ("unscramble the end until it became an open collar"). The act of cataloging and restringing buttons enacts the unscrambling across the middle third. However, the verb is more metaphoric frame than specific dramatized action; the protagonist never faces a on-page test where unscrambling proves difficult or costly. The action shapes the premise and closure rhetoric but does not generate a pivotal turn or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is signaled immediately ("Her method was cataloging lost buttons, because buttons are witnesses") and occupies the story's middle: she lays them out, groups them "by material, by century, by the pitch of the grief," and restrings them into a spiral. The mechanics matter—grouping by material and emotion directly enables the echo's release and transformation. The method is essential to the middle beats and closure setup, though the final turn (jar refilled, offered to monks) moves beyond cataloging itself. Two gates clearly met; closure participation is indirect but present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is established in the opening line and provides the spatial container for the entire cataloging sequence. Its "resinous beams" and "fossilized honey" light charge the atmosphere, and the spiral on its floor positions the protagonist at the center for the jar-opening climax. The warehouse's "unearthed silence" and "glowing" presence return in the closing image as "a hearth for anyone whose story had come undone." Setup, middle presence, and closure callback are all clear; the setting subtly guides the protagonist's ritual without imposing hard constraints on her choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears as a section marker in the text ("As the truth unravels, dawn's first blade slid between cliff and horizon") but the timeframe is vague throughout—"three cycles" of turning the hourglass, "yesterday" the bulb cracked, "dusk" when she uncorks the jar, "dawn" when she finishes. Time does not tighten decisions or impose a countdown; the protagonist works "through the night" without urgency or constraint. Present in the text but not a live pressure on tactics or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to transform prophecy into possibility is declared early ("The Abbott declared the future broken; she chose to unscramble it instead") and restated at closure ("so the monks might hear how silence teaches"). However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting impulses or a scene where the protagonist must defend or risk this goal. The motivation frames her actions but does not generate friction, cost, or a pivotal choice where she sacrifices something else to pursue it. Setup and closure mention are strong; middle tension is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is introduced when the canyon echo spills out ("an unearthed silence that settled over buttons like dust") and recurs in the closure walk ("each footstep echoing the warehouse hush") and the warm silence shared with the villager. The tone is coherent and lyric throughout, modulating only slightly from contemplative arrival to charged ritual to serene departure. However, the tone remains elevated and consistent rather than shifting under pressure or crystallizing at the final image with new weight. Present across the arc and purposeful, but static in register.</comment>
