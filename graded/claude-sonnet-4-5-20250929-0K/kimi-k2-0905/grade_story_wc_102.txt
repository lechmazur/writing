<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pilgrim's motivation is anchored in the past-life memory and the search for unused love, but her agency consists largely of observation and facilitation rather than internal contradiction under pressure. The encounter with the man offers relational texture, yet their interaction unfolds through shared ritual rather than conflicting needs. Embodiment exists ("the hairline fracture running through her chest") but the final shift—fracture knitting, heart slowing to "a single sustained note"—reads more as declared epiphany than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The piece privileges atmospheric interiority over micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: wisteria scent, camera obscura projections, and breathing rhythms layer toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors are present early (viaduct, camera, jade tear). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist steps through the door into the orchard and returns to distribute love, yet the cost remains largely atmospheric—"the fracture in her chest knit"—rather than a legible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows options. The meandering final paragraph ("slipping droplets… until the twilight viaduct… glowed softly") dilutes the pressure established by the orchard moment, and the accumulative pattern does not tighten into a single decisive image with undeniable price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The viaduct's wisteria and fog supply vivid sensory anchors ("each breath she took tasted purple"), and the camera obscura functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains the interaction (projecting the inverted gorge, hosting the man's silhouette, revealing the wisteria door). Spatial choreography remains coherent through the ritual sequence. The orchard in the final third offers a purposeful shift in environment tied to the stakes, though its fruit-as-moment metaphor leans ornamental. The setting's return to the viaduct and the final image of the protagonist walking on, "no longer searching but distributing," charges the closing beat with the world's response to her action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored before it rots the heart—is signaled early and pursued through the camera ritual. The encounter with the man introduces modest pressure when his "rattled" breath matches her "quiver inside her ribcage," but the escalation is driven by shared ritual rather than protagonist agency or conflicting goals. The orchard passage offers a deepening (biting fruit releases "apologies never risked") yet reads as revelation rather than a choice that narrows options with felt cost. The final distribution of love and the parting "without names" lack the visible trade-off or forfeited path that would demonstrate cost scaled to the journey.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images: the jade tear, wisteria, breath as reciprocal duty, unused love as calcified posture. The orchard's fruit-as-withheld-kindness and the camera's disappearance after the ritual offer thematic weight, and the final line ("every breath she took now tasted less purple than transparent, a medium through which the world could finally see itself clearly enough to forgive its own unfinished hearts") attempts resonance. Yet the closing moral arrives stated rather than embodied in a concrete final image, and the scatter of abstract claims in the last three paragraphs ("storage is not a place but a posture," "the memory had completed its circle") undercuts the particulars that precede them.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with consistent focalization through the pilgrim. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("foggy lucidity," "petals clustering around his heart like moths") that feels purposeful and voice-motivated. The man's single line of dialogue ("I lost the address of the love I never gave; the map they issued burns if held too long") reads ornate and abstracted rather than natural speech, straining credibility. Psychic distance modulates intentionally during the breath-matching ritual, and the perceptual signature (spiritual curiosity filtering detail through scent and breath) remains character-specific. Minor filter-verb stacking in reflective passages ("she understood then," "she felt the fracture") slightly dulls immediacy without collapsing voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: petals as "slow fireworks," flowers as "tiny lanterns," wisteria scent "drinkable," breath tasting "purple, medicinal." In peak beats—camera projection, orchard passage—this density persists without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating a decorative haze that competes with momentum. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She unfolded… She loosened… She asked… She understood… She felt…" The final paragraph loops conceptually, restating the transformation in multiple abstract claims without a single sharp image. Clarity remains adequate, but propulsion suffers under ornamental load, and the lack of varied sentence openings flattens rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core synthesis—camera obscura as tool to project and heal unused love, breath as reciprocal medium—offers a specific angle. The jade tear tied to a past-life memory and the wisteria door woven from projected flowers provide fresh inflections on pilgrimage and healing narratives. Yet the orchard of withheld kindness and the final distribution of "droplets of returned love" lean toward symbolic convenience rather than lived particulars; removing them would not fundamentally alter the protagonist's arc. The piece commits to its lyric premise but resists bold structural risk, settling into a meditative register that privileges atmosphere over narrative surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The camera obscura artist is present early and handles the camera in two distinct beats (unfolding on the parapet, projecting the man's silhouette). The device enables the ritual and the appearance of the wisteria door, shaping the middle turn. However, the protagonist's decisions are largely observational and facilitative; the camera vanishes before the orchard passage, and the final distribution of love does not depend on the artist identity. The role is functional but does not drive the closure choice with irreplaceable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The jade tear appears early (tied to her wrist, linked to past-life memory) and recurs in three beats: she loosens it during the breath ritual, asks the man to breathe through it, and he presses it against her sternum. Its warming and the memory it unlocks provide causal texture. Yet the bead's specific properties—"porous," green warmth—remain decorative; a different token could perform the same narrative work with minor edits. The tear shapes the middle ritual but does not charge the final image or constrain the closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" is named in the opening and closing paragraphs but functions as thematic label rather than on-page pressure. The identity does not constrain tactics, alter options, or generate conflict; the protagonist's spiritual curiosity and camera work drive the action. The phrase recurs as ornament without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious since childhood" is mentioned in a single expository sentence mid-story, explaining her breath-observation practice. The trait enables the breathing-changes method but does not force a trade-off or cost. It remains background coloring rather than a constraint that shapes a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Heal" is the explicit goal and frames the quest ("find where unused love is stored before it rots the heart"). The camera ritual and orchard passage serve this action, and the protagonist's chest fracture "knits" on the page. The healing recurs in the final image when she and the man can "reheal" the fracture by meeting again. However, the healing itself is declared rather than dramatically earned through a choice with visible cost, and the resolution distributes healing as a passive state rather than a decisive act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Revealing through breathing changes" is introduced early ("breathing changes reveal what the eye edits out") and demonstrated when the protagonist watches petals shimmer with her inhale. The method shapes the ritual with the man (matching breath rhythms, exhaling onto the glass) and produces the wisteria door. It appears in three beats and drives the middle turn, but the mechanics remain impressionistic—how breath changes reveal the door is asserted rather than shown with specificity—and the method does not constrain the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom is anchored early and supplies the ritual stage: wisteria scent as "drinkable," the parapet for the camera, the arches as spatial anchors. The setting enables the encounter and the appearance of the wisteria door, shaping two key beats. The viaduct returns in the closing image, glowing "softly from the inside like a lantern somebody finally remembered to light," charging the ending. The setting provides atmosphere and ritual space but does not impose a physical constraint that alters tactics or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early ("After the past-life memory surfaced three nights ago") and motivates the quest. The protagonist's urgency—"she had woken knowing she must find"—sets the initial pressure. However, elapsed time on the viaduct is vague, and no live clock tightens decisions. The memory returns during the ritual, shaping the middle beat, but the timeframe does not constrain the ending or impose a visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"find where unused love is stored before it rots the heart"—is stated early and pursued throughout. The camera ritual, orchard passage, and final distribution all serve this desire. The protagonist's fracture embodies the cost of unused love, and the healing offers resolution. Yet the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicting choices; the protagonist does not face a trade-off between competing wants, and the orchard's "fruit flesh" metaphor delivers the answer without friction. The desire frames the arc but does not generate on-page conflict with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is established early ("the thick, foggy lucidity that always rose from the river") and sustained through the piece: the camera's inverted projections, the breath ritual's haze, the orchard as "foggy lucidity made fruit flesh." The tone modulates subtly during the ritual (scent thickening, condensation on the glass) and charges the final image when breath tastes "less purple than transparent." The tone coheres across beats and supports the lyric lens, though the density remains static rather than shifting with escalating pressure.</comment>
