<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is embodied through concrete sensory anchors (vinyl scent, kalimba weight) and her training manifests in micro-choices ("hearing is the last door to close"). The final bridge moment offers a credible internal shift—understanding reunification as carrying both pieces forward—with visible cost (she holds the jagged, unsealed record). Minor weakness: Calderon remains functionally passive throughout, a vessel for Mara's ritual rather than a character with contradictory impulses. The daughter's raw grief is label-only ("eyes raw") and her weeping is metaphor-wrapped rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara's realization on the skybridge—"reunify does not mean repair; it means carry both pieces forward"—reweights the vinyl motif and forecloses the fantasy of seamless restoration, with conceptual cost legible in the jagged line she accepts. Orientation is swift (hospice ward, Tuesday bloodwork, Room 914 by paragraph three). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through hymning layered sounds, then deepens via the vinyl fragment's journey from bedside to Mara's chest, culminating in the skybridge epiphany. One tightening (Calderon's death) and one deepening (Mara's self-application of the ritual) fit the 600–800 scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cloud-level hospice with glass floor, twinkling city lights, and drifting cumulus cities creates a vivid, uncanny micro-world. Sensory details are purposeful: bleach and resignation, petrichor, citrus sanitizer, the hum of wind on the skybridge. Spatial choreography is clean (room → corridor → skybridge). The skybridge's exact midpoint constrains Mara's final gesture, charging the closure image. However, the "radiant haven above the clouds" leans decorative; the clinical setting does not meaningfully limit her ritual choices or force workarounds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: executing "a flawless goodbye" for Calderon. One tightening occurs when the monitor flatlines, forcing Mara to shift from comforting the living patient to ritually honoring the dead and guiding the daughter. The vinyl shard recurs with reweighted meaning (wrist → chest → daughter's hands), accumulating pressure. The final skybridge choice—pressing the reunited disk to her sternum—forecloses the illusion of seamless repair with felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, this is sufficient escalation. No antagonist or reversal is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the broken record's jagged edge, the act of hymning mundane sounds, the daughter's drought-breaking tears. The skybridge epiphany—"reunify does not mean repair; it means carry both pieces forward"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The scent of hope (warm vinyl, distant rain) recurs to anchor emotional progression. Subtext operates in Calderon tracing braille-like grooves and Mara's decisively kind touch. Minor slip: "Until We Reunify" as song title borders on on-the-nose symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara's perceptual signature: she filters the ward through sound (squeak, rattle, hum) and scent (warm plastic, petrichor, citrus). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring causality ("borrowed time from the air," "shadows with it"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Calderon's "Thought vinyl was extinct" and Mara's "Only the intact ones" carry subtext about loss and fragmentation. Free indirect style is clean. Minor strain: "the chord she'd woven still vibrating in the air like an invisible thread" risks abstraction at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies appropriately; the prose hymns its own premise through layered sensory images. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes and closure. Figurative density is high throughout—"Tuesday the color of dishwater," "each beep a small stone dropped into deep water," "shadows with it"—and occasionally muddles clarity in peak beats: "darkness felt like velvet held underwater" is a mixed metaphor at the moment of death. Paraphrase loop: "hymning the mundane" is restated across two paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" openings in the second half. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise—music therapist performing end-of-life ritual via broken vinyl and sound translation—is specific and non-obvious. The "reunify does not mean repair" insight transforms familiar grief material through the jagged record image. Risk-taking in the cloud-level hospice and hymning-the-mundane method heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "Until We Reunify" song title and the therapist-as-spiritual-guide frame trend toward familiar templates; the piece does not fully escape the "meaningful death with symbolic object" archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (serene hospice music therapist) is present throughout, drives the dominant action (hymning sounds, placing the vinyl shard, guiding the daughter), and makes the closure choice on the skybridge. Her professional calm constrains her responses (decisively kind touch, controlled ritual) and her training ("hearing is the last door to close") informs tactics. The final epiphany—carry both pieces forward—traces to her role and the repeated vinyl handling. Two beats where her choices matter: placing the shard on Calderon's chest, and the skybridge reunification. Cost is conceptual (accepting incompleteness) but legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The broken vinyl shard appears in four distinct beats: Mara places it on the bedside table, Calderon traces its edge, Mara presses it to his wrist and then his chest, the daughter lifts it and reads the title, and Mara produces the twin piece on the skybridge to fit them together. The jagged line reweights meaning at closure ("reunify does not mean repair"), and the object's scent (warm plastic, distant rain) anchors hope throughout. Removal would collapse the closure logic. The shard is irreplaceable and causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"The scent of hope" is named explicitly in the opening (vinyl + rain) and recurs in the hymning paragraph ("petrichor") and the final line. It frames Mara's inheritance from her father and her gift to Calderon. However, it operates more as thematic refrain than as a stake-shaping force; Mara does not face a choice between hope and despair on the page, nor does the scent's presence alter her tactics. Lyric reprise without mid-scene causal work caps the score near 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is applied twice: Mara's answer to Calderon ("decisively kind") and her shoulder touch with the daughter ("decisively kind"). The trait is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible tradeoffs. It labels her professional demeanor but does not constrain a choice with cost—she never hesitates, doubts, or pays a price for kindness. Present in the closure corridor beat but not causal there. Functional but replaceable with "calm" or "compassionate."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Reunify" anchors the song title on the vinyl shard, drives Mara's final action (fitting the two fragments together on the skybridge), and supplies the thematic epiphany ("reunify does not mean repair; it means carry both pieces forward"). The action is signaled early via the shard, develops through Calderon's and the daughter's handling, and pays off at closure with conceptual cost. Removing "reunify" as the organizing verb would break the closure logic. The piece is built around this verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is named and demonstrated: Mara translates nurse shoes, meal carts, morphine bubbles, linen hush, IV clicks into kalimba notes. The method is signaled early, executed in two beats (first hymning, then the scent-based hymning), and its logic (ordinary sounds become lullaby) shapes her ritual tactics. It does not constrain or create friction—no failed attempt, no cost—but it defines her approach and recurs with purpose. Two-beat involvement and thematic payoff push it to low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" (cloud-level ward, glass floor, twinkling city lights, cumulus cities, skybridge) is vividly rendered and anchors the story's uncanny atmosphere. The skybridge's midpoint supplies the physical location for Mara's closure gesture. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; Mara's ritual could occur in a ground-level hospice with minor edits. Setup, middle presence, and closure participation are met, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the blood work comes back" frames the timeframe (Tuesday results, Wednesday evening ritual). The phrase anchors inevitability—Calderon is dying now—but does not impose a live clock that tightens decisions. Mara's ritual unfolds at its own pace; no countdown or urgency alters her tactics. The timeframe is present and coherent but functionally a backdrop rather than a constraint. Lyric design without ticking-clock pressure limits the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To execute a flawless goodbye" is Mara's stated motivation in paragraph three ("the only medicine she could still prescribe") and recurs when Calderon says, "I never learned to end things clean." The desire is dramatized through her ritual actions (hymning, shard placement, daughter guidance) and faces friction in the form of incompleteness (the record cannot be sealed). The skybridge epiphany reweights the goal: flawless does not mean seamless. Cost is conceptual but legible. Two-beat involvement and closure linkage push the score to low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is named once ("In that pulsing stillness she understood") and enacted throughout: the monitor's beeping ("each beep a small stone"), Calderon's slowing breath, the "quiet ocean" flatline, the skybridge beat traveling "through plastic into bone." The tone is coherent across turns, modulates from clinical calm to elegiac acceptance, and charges the final image. The phrase itself is evocative and consistent with the accumulative design. Strong tonal control without overt repetition of the label.</comment>
