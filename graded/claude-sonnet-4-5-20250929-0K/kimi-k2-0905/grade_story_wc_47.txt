<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is densely poetic but often abstracts emotion into metaphor rather than embodying it ("wound inside her had begun to taste like metal"). The "quietly proactive" trait appears as movement through space but never forces a difficult micro-choice with visible cost. The final act—burying the drive and pendant—reads as symbolic completion rather than a decision that forecloses a live option. Elias remains functional but one-note, present to witness rather than apply independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when by paragraph three (late but functional). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the burial and amber-shadow image crystallize the stakes of small survival after viral exposure, and the cost—leaving separately, no names exchanged—is felt. The lens holds through layered imagery and cadence shifts, though causality between beats relies more on thematic accumulation than because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moss-overtaken data center constrains movement and charges the final image: the upright server blade becomes the burial site, and the cracked skylight delivers the ant-shadow that closes the piece. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (spores clinging to skin, honeyed glow, dew-dark hoodie). Spatial choreography remains clear across aisles and racks. The micro-setting (pendant, server, soil) functions as setting at this length and directly shapes the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: grafting new meaning onto trauma after viral confession. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias offers the tablet, shifting Mira from passive witness to active creator of a second, quieter statement. The burial and separate departures foreclose the path of naming/connection, a visible cost. Pressure accumulates through imagery and cadence rather than reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Agency is renunciation (refusing labels, choosing anonymity), which fits Earned Stasis logic within the broader Charged Poise closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—small resilience after collapse—emerges from the ant-in-amber, moss reclaiming servers, and the drip cadence without direct statement. The final image (ant shadow on mound) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "protected vulnerability" and "honeyed hush" are named too often, occasionally tilting toward thematic echo. The piece resists moralizing and leaves ambiguity (the buried file, the未sprouted voices) intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is poetic and consistent: Mira notices spores, pendant swing, drip cadence. Distance is stable third-limited. The prose texture is distinct but occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("grafting new meaning," "peat," "digits of a signature"). Elias's brief actions carry subtext (muting the loop, copying to moss-covered USB) without dialogue. No head-hopping. Figurative density is high but mostly voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high, but figurative language clusters heavily in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear pattern-teaching: "honeyed hush," "seeds needing darkness," "wound...taste like metal," "circuits flowering with lichen," "dripping cadence." Two paraphrase loops: paragraphs 8 and 15 restate the healing-through-pattern idea. A few filter verbs ("she found," "he unfolded") are acceptable in voice, but "Understanding passed" is abstract summary. Template cadence in the final third: multiple "she [verb]" / "they [verb]" stems. Apply −0.6 for density and loops, −0.3 for minor template runs = −0.9 total within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frame—post-viral confession, abandoned data center as sanctuary—offers a fresh angle on trauma recovery. The amber pendant with trapped ant is specific and memorable. Risk: heavy figurative layering and non-standard emotional vocabulary (e.g., "vulnerably protected") create texture but occasionally obscure clarity. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode. Minor derivative echo: the "teach me patience" address to the ant reads close to familiar apostrophe templates. Overall, the synthesis is specific enough to avoid template, but the execution leans toward the safer middle of lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and observes carefully, but her decisions (entering the center, kneeling, recording, burying) are pre-determined by the frame rather than choices under pressure that narrow live options. The "watchful dreamer" trait shapes perception but not pivotal choice-making with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Amber pendant appears in paragraphs 4, 10, 17, and 22 (four beats). It is handled (swings, held before camera, rests on mound) and returns with reweighted meaning: from family relic to symbol of small survival. It participates in closure (ant shadow on mound) and carries thematic cost (leaving it behind). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage. Not indispensable—a different talisman could serve—but strongly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Honeyed hush" is named in paragraphs 1, 13, and 18. It frames atmosphere and recurs at closure, reweighting the stake (viral noise vs. garden quiet). It does not constrain tactical choices on the page but does accumulate meaning through repetition and cadence, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Lyric reprise (first line → late return) reweights the dominant stake. Mid-range: present across beats, charges ending, but does not drive action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quietly proactive" is demonstrated by movement (slipping through door, trailing fingers, kneeling, burying) but never forces a costly trade-off or enables a tactic under pressure. The label fits the action but does not constrain or complicate choice. Present, functional, swappable with "deliberate" or "purposeful" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Proffer" appears twice: Mira waiting "to proffer something the internet could not swallow" (par. 9), Elias proffering the tablet (par. 14). The tablet offer is the story's key turn, shifting Mira from witness to creator of the second recording. Early thematic signal, causal middle beat, and the burial (final proffer: pendant and drive to earth) charges closure. Essential to escalation and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Pattern left by drip of thawing icicles" appears in paragraphs 1, 8, 11, and 21. It provides cadence and metaphor (slow healing, Morse-like rhythm) and is pressed into soil "like a signature" at closure. Early signal, thematic recurrence, lyric payoff. Does not mechanically shape tactics but reweights the stake through repetition and closure image, fitting the Accumulative lens. Mid-range: lyric resonance without mechanical causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Abandoned data center/moss garden is present throughout, anchors all action, and supplies the upright server (burial site), skylight (light for ant shadow), and moss/lichen imagery that charges the closure. Spores, coolant pipes, skeletal racks constrain movement and provide tactile detail. The setting enables the burial (wet earth, server as marker) and shapes the tone (sanctuary after viral exposure). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"After the confession goes viral" is signaled in paragraph 5 (fifty-three million views, "today") and referenced in paragraphs 11 (Elias walked "all night") and 12 (confession on loop). Time pressure is implied (before sunrise, urgency to plant before the wound rusts) but not dramatized as a live countdown. The timeframe frames stakes and motivates the encounter but does not tighten tactics beat-by-beat. Present in setup and middle, contributes to closure framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated in paragraph 6 and demonstrated through the second recording (paragraph 17: choosing what grows inside you) and burial (pressing pattern into soil). The desire is dramatized in the recording and burial acts, not just told. Friction: the cost of leaving separately and refusing names is felt but not deeply conflicted within Mira's interiority. Present in setup, drives middle and ending, with modest cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named once (paragraph 13) and enacted throughout: Mira's exposure (viral confession, trembling voice) held within the garden's hush, Elias witnessing without speaking, the burial as both openness and concealment. Tone modulates from urgency (sirens, viral panic) to quiet ritual (burial, silence, separate exits) and charges the final image (ant shadow, promise of survival). Coherent through turns, reweights closure.</comment>
