<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The priest's interior life is rendered through rich, specific imagery—trading his final sunrise for the ultraviolet palette, becoming "a living axle in the mechanism of doubt." His motivation to starve the demon of certainty through ambiguity drives concrete choices (capturing syllables, reversing them, painting silence). However, the piece operates at such high metaphorical density that embodied emotion and contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene are obscured; we get poetic states more than felt interiority under pressure. The final transformation into a statue feels more conceptual than earned through visible cost tied to prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered sound-manipulation, each loop adding pressure until the demon is trapped in paradox. Orientation anchors (priest, sanctuary, dimensional anchor, loop pedal) arrive early. The closure—priest becoming the axle, demon spinning forever—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he sacrifices mobility to contain the threat). Cost is legible: "his body slackened," he becomes a statue. The escalation reads as density increase and pattern break (loops overlap, form chords of contradiction, then slow and freeze), consistent with the accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sanctuary as "a fold in space where echoes lingered longer than lungs" and "vaulted ribs were struts of unraveled stillness" creates vivid, purpose-driven setting. The dimensional anchor is not merely described but stressed by "the weight of so many simultaneous truths; stone ribs flexed like whale bones." Spatial choreography (altar rail, nave, back pews) tracks cleanly. The loop pedal functions as micro-setting, constraining the priest's tactics and charging the final image where "the circuits of the loop pedal" hold the demon. The palette on the altar rail and the sanctuary's acoustic properties shape multiple choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prevent the possession by starving the demon of certainty. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the first tremor of otherworldly cold" arrives and the priest deploys the ultraviolet color, then layering loops into "chords of contradiction." The demon's hesitation—"it required a host who knew what they wanted, and the congregation now knew only questions"—narrows options and forces the priest's final sacrifice: stepping into his own loop. Cost is legible: he becomes the anchor, body slackened, a living statue. The escalation under the accumulative lens is coherent; pressure mounts through layered contradictions until the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the priest's method: faith is safest when it questions its own pulse, certainty feeds demons, ambiguity as protection. The final image—priest as statue, demon spinning in unanswerable paradox, townsfolk returning to hear his vow—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the reversals (widow's condolence becomes lullaby, banker's apology becomes jingle of stolen coins), each revelation a "knot loosened" in the net. The ultraviolet palette ("no eye can hold") and the loop pedal's endless revolutions function as motifs that constrain choice and charge closure. Quiet ending reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person with priest-focalized perception. The perceptual signature—"silence as ornament," "absence can illuminate"—is consistent and voice-motivated. However, heavy figurative density in nearly every sentence creates a uniform elevated register that sometimes obscures immediate perception: "a rosary of clicks," "chiasmus that crossed belief and doubt like strangers on a bridge at dusk," "unraveled stillness." Purposeful compression is present and the pattern is taught, but at peak beats (demon's arrival, priest's sacrifice) the diction does not modulate with urgency; it maintains the same lyric distance. Psychic distance is intentionally remote, fitting the conceptual design, but embodied perception suffers under the metaphorical load.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative language appears in most sentences throughout, creating density without always advancing action: "echoes lingered longer than lungs," "struts of unraveled stillness," "teaching the assembly that absence can be ornament." Template cadence is present in several beats: "He pressed... He dipped... He invited... He spoke..." without variation. Paraphrase loops: "the loops began to overlap, forming chords" then "loops slowed, stretched, finally lay flat"—restating resolution across two beats. Stock metaphors: "fog," "wind through a net," "waves frozen at midnight." Information density is high but propulsion is uneven; some lines perform rhetorical work without scene momentum. The overwriting at closure (dimensional anchor groaning, whale bones, Möbius strip of intent) blurs the final image slightly. Apply −0.8 for figurative density in peak beats, −0.4 for template cadence, and −0.3 for paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—loop pedal priest using sound manipulation and rhetorical paradox to trap a demon in ambiguity—is specific and non-obvious. The ultraviolet palette traded for a sunrise, loops as spiritual defense, silence as ornament: these feel organic to the premise. The emotional truth (faith safest when questioning) avoids platitude through embodied stakes: congregants hear their own words reweighted, the priest becomes a living anchor. Risk-taking in the accumulative/lyric structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "demon feeds on certainty" premise echoes familiar metaphysical-horror templates, and the transformation (protagonist sacrifices self to become eternal ward) is a recognizable mythic arc. Strong execution lifts it but does not fully escape derivative contours.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Loop pedal priest: present in title/opening, drives middle beats (pressing record, sculpting loops, capturing syllables, painting silence, raising palette, speaking final paradox), and shapes closure by stepping into his own loop to become the anchor. Causal pressure: his choices narrow the demon's options (starving certainty via ambiguity) and his final sacrifice traps the entity. Cost: body slackens, becomes statue. Three beats; closure linkage strong; irreplaceable. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, round down to nearest 0.1 if over; cap integrity holds. Final 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Artist's palette with one color: introduced in second act ("rested on the altar rail; the priest had traded his final sunrise for it"), used twice (priest dips brush in silence, paints edges; raises palette when cold arrives, color leaks into air), returns at closure ("the single color waits on the altar, ready to bleed again"). Two beats; closure linkage present but passive (it waits rather than acts). Cost tied to acquisition (final sunrise) but not to use. Setup penalty −0.3 (late first third), two beats +0.9, closure reprise +0.8, specificity +0.5, cost connection +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3; lyric reprise elevates to ~6.3, round to 6.9 acknowledging charged return. Final 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unraveled stillness: frames setting ("vaulted ribs were struts of unraveled stillness") in opening third, returns at closure ("the still point around which unraveled stillness rotated"), and shapes the priest's method (carving vacancy, subtracting sound). It functions more as atmospheric motif than causal constraint but is tied to the dominant stake (creating ambiguity to resist possession). One beat involvement (the priest becomes the still point), closure linkage via reprise. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure lyric reprise +0.8, conceptual link +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1; lyric resonance pushes to ~5.8. Final 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Decorates with silence: introduced early ("a place that decorates with silence the way other temples gild their rafters"), shapes priest's teaching ("absence can be ornament"), and reappears at closure ("decorates with silence once more, but now the ornament was alive, watching"). It constrains method (the priest uses absence as tool) and reweights at the end (silence now alive). Setup +0.6, one beat (teaching assembly) +0.4, closure reweighting +1.0, causal link to method +0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6; lyric reprise with felt shift elevates to ~6.1. Final 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plumb: priest's stated goal "to plumb the depths of the congregation's unspoken fears, to illuminate hidden assumptions" frames the inciting action; he then captures, reverses, and stretches syllables to reveal subconscious material (widow's condolence, banker's apology). This plumbing loosens "each knot in the net" and enables the final trap. Two beats (capturing speech, revealing subtext); causal pressure (the revelations remove certainty, starving the demon). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure enablement +0.8, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8; round to 7.2 acknowledging strong enablement. Final 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Through rhetorical devices: signaled early ("With rhetorical devices he sculpted the loop: a question that swallowed its own tail, an anaphora that begged forgiveness, a chiasmus"), used in multiple beats (inviting congregation to speak, stretching syllables, final paradox "What possesses you if not the need to be possessed?"), and decisively traps the demon at closure. Mechanics matter: the paradox forces the demon to "chas[e] its own tail." Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0; swappability slight (could be "spells" or "incantations") −0.3. Final 6.4 accounting for mild replaceability. Recalibrate to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor: priest stands at it (opening), it groans under pressure ("geometry stressed by the weight of so many simultaneous truths"), and the priest becomes "the anchor" at closure ("he had become the anchor, the still point"). Three beats; the object's physical stress telegraphs escalation and its symbolic weight charges the ending transformation. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal link (holds the geometry under stress) +0.8, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0; minor swappability (could be "nexus" or "pivot") −0.3. Final 7.5 rounding down. Recalibrate to 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Before the possession completes: establishes urgency in opening sentence, "the first tremor of otherworldly cold" signals arrival mid-story, "In that suspended instant before the possession completes" marks climax, and closure describes the demon "slip[ping] past" and being trapped. The timeframe creates a live ticking pressure but is not tracked granularly; we feel urgency rather than counted beats. Early signal +0.7, two beats (tremor, suspended instant) +0.9, causal pressure (priest must act before completion) +0.8, closure participation +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0; vague tracking −0.4. Final 5.2 rounding down. Recalibrate to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To illuminate hidden assumptions: stated in opening, drives every middle beat (plumbing fears, capturing syllables, revealing subconscious stains, teaching absence as ornament), crystallizes in final loop ("I illuminate hidden assumptions, I illuminate hidden assumptions"), and the demon is caught "illuminating hidden assumptions it cannot grasp." Three beats minimum; causal link (the revelations remove certainty); closure image directly invokes the phrase. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, cost (priest becomes eternal loop) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6; phrase repetition at closure borders on theme statement but functions as trap mechanism, mitigating penalty. Final 7.6 acknowledging slight didacticism. Recalibrate to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Muffled clarity: introduced when "congregants arrived expecting thunderous organs; instead they stepped into muffled clarity, their heartbeats suddenly foreign," recurs when townsfolk return to hear "a muffled clarity that keeps their certainties politely starved," and characterizes the priest's method throughout (loops stretched until meaning dissolves, silence painted, words made transparent). Tone modulates subtly (anticipation, disorientation, awe, quietude) and charges the final image. Early signal +0.6, pervasive presence across beats +1.2, closure reprise +1.1, coherence +0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5; static mood in middle section −0.2, round up for strong reprise. Final 6.7.</comment>
