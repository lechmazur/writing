<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aurelia's motives—grief, guilt, alchemical redemption—are clear, but interiority operates at high register throughout without degradation under stress. The twin's death and the coin-mending ritual show embodied stakes, yet micro-choices feel pre-determined rather than pressured; she never hesitates or contradicts herself in scene. Emotional texture leans toward label-speak ("luminous regret," "factually mystical") instead of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final turn—joining the search to teach others—arrives as epiphany without visible internal cost or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers alchemical ritual, memory, and image toward a Conceptual Repricing where redemption is reweighted as calibration rather than erasure. Orientation anchors (foundry, Aurelia, post-search-party) land early. The closure unit—"names are not chains but counterweights"—reframes the premise, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized on the page; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift marks the before/after. The kintsugi mending proceeds without meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The foundry's gutters, anvil, charcoal heart, and rain-washed cobbles supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through alchemical perception. The portable alembic and zodiac coin constrain the ritual beats and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (door, anvil, scales, doorway), and sensory selection—hissing raindrops, iron smell, rose-gold vapor—supports the accumulative pressure without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—redeeming the brother's name through alchemical mending—is signaled early and pursued across the ritual. The four "limits" structure sequences beats, but they feel exploratory rather than escalating; each transmutation succeeds without friction or price that alters subsequent tactics. The final decision to join the search and "teach the others" reframes stakes conceptually, yet no on-page cost (lost material, failed attempt, renounced path) makes the shift legible as sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—redemption as calibration, brokenness inviting gold—emerges through kintsugi ritual and the coin's mended scar. The piece resists didactic summary until the penultimate paragraph, where "names are not chains but counterweights" states the thesis directly. The final image of glowing foundry cracks offers resonant particularity, yet the prompt-aligned language ("luminous regret," "factually mystical," "solve et coagula") frequently replaces scene pressure with thematic declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable; POV anchors in Aurelia's alchemical perception with consistent diction ("heart-balance," "alembic," "calcined"). Register remains elevated throughout, even in high-pressure beats, without modulation for urgency or degradation. Perceptual signature is character-specific (kintsugi metaphor, zodiac symbols), but syntactic uniformity—long, clause-heavy sentences with frequent semicolons—flattens rhythm across emotional peaks and valleys. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density crowds most sentences ("heart-balance tilted," "mercury pooling," "forgiving light," "luminous regret") without pattern-teaching or cumulative payoff; the accumulation obscures rather than charges the closure beat. Paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of a name equals the love left over when the sound fades" restates earlier coin-weighing without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the "limit" beats with parallel structure that dulls propulsion. Stock metaphors ("forgiving light," "silent syllabus") and therapy-speak ("luminous regret") in the final third trigger artifact penalties and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Kintsugi applied to alchemical grief offers a specific synthesis; the coin mending and four-limits frame provide structure. Execution leans on prompt vocabulary ("factually mystical," "solve et coagula," "luminous regret") that reads more like faithful template adherence than singular vision. The transformation test fails: swap alchemy for carpentry or ceramics and the emotional arc persists unchanged. The final move—teaching others to carry regret—adds a fresh inflection but arrives late without groundwork in prior beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aurelia decides to mend the coin, performs the ritual, speaks Caelum's name, and joins the search. These choices create beats but the outcome of each is certain; no reversal or altered tactic results from her agency. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure; causal linkage modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coin appears in pocket (setup), placed on scales (measure name weight), mended with gold (kintsugi ritual), anchors to sternum, and shapes the final teaching. Handled across four beats; its mended state charges closure. Irreplaceable within the kintsugi logic; visible cost (tears, gold seam) tied on-page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi frames the ritual's stakes (mending brokenness with gold), informs Aurelia's hands-on work with the coin, and recurs in the final foundry-cracks image. Shapes two beats and the ending reprise; causal pressure modest—she could achieve redemption through other alchemical means. Specificity strong but swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" labels the coin's behavior (warming when grief catalyzes, hovering, becoming articulate) but functions as descriptor rather than constraint. No on-page cost or trade-off tied to this trait; removing the phrase does not alter logic. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Redeeming the name drives the ritual beats and the final decision to teach others. Shapes setup, middle transmutations, and closure participation. Swappable with "honor" or "remember" without structural break; the kintsugi mechanics do most of the work. Causal role solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Exploring limits" titles the four ritual stages (name weight, regret calcination, memory boundary, redemption calibration). Method is signaled and structures beats, but the limits feel thematic rather than tactical—no attempt fails or forces revision. Present in middle development and resonates at closure; causal necessity modest.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Foundry supplies anvil (workspace), rain (hissing steam, reflective cobbles), charcoal heart (heating source), and etched wall (memory anchor). Rain-washed state creates sensory texture and the glowing cracks seed the final image. Micro-setting constrains ritual choreography and charges closure; irreplaceable within this accumulative design.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe anchors the opening (search party gone, Aurelia remains) and bookends closure (dawn, straggler returns). Does not tighten decisions or create countdown pressure; the ritual unfolds at leisure. Present in setup and ending but untracked in middle; swappable with "alone at night" without structural cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Understanding name-weight motivates the scales beat, the four limits, and the final teaching. Desire is told more than dramatized—no friction between competing wants on the page. Shapes two beats and informs closure; causal pressure modest; swappable with "honor" or "measure loss."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Luminous regret permeates diction (rose-gold vapor, forgiving light, glowing foundry cracks) and charges the final image. Tone coheres across beats without modulation for tactical pressure—mourning stays elevated and abstract. Present throughout and integral to closure; thematic rather than causal, but undeniably tied to the ending's resonance.</comment>
