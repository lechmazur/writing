<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nara's interior texture is concrete and character-specific—"accidentally telepathic with plants" manifests in lived action (moss blooming, speaking through chlorophyll), not label-only. The renunciation cost ("knees screaming," walking slower, hiding the embryo) is visible on the page and forecloses compliance. Minor slip: the guard's soporific nap and dreamy resolution feel slightly convenient, reducing earned struggle at that pivot. Embodied emotion and contradictory impulses (rebellion through nurture, risk despite age) register clearly throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (volcanic springs, reconstruction, Nara with amber) within the first paragraph. Drive lens reads Causal with Situational accent: the kite riddle → coordinates → grotto immersion sequence causally narrows options and the final vial-sealing forecloses the council's program with visible cost (altered DNA, concealed embryo). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Nara's act reweights "implanted destiny" with undeniable pressure, though the child's future remains open. No major causality breaks; the moss convenience noted in Q1 does not fracture the chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The volcanic grotto functions as micro-setting with pressure: fifty-two-degree threshold gates the embryo revival, mineral clouds enable epigenetic editing, and the steam/moss physically constrain the guard encounter. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("pumice," "basalt," "thermophilic moss"), avoiding postcard catalogs. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (descent, basin, hanging vine, exit). The setting charges the final image (wax seal from sacred torch, embryo tucked where heartbeat substitutes for ultrasound) without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scramble the council's genetic program to grow a curious, stubborn child) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful pressure point: the guard's arrival forces the moss-bloom tactic and accelerates the grafting sequence. Agency is clear (Nara's choice to alter the embryo, accept the risk) and the cost is on-page (physical pain, concealment, future vulnerability). The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; the moss pollen resolves the guard threat slightly too easily, capping the band at high-7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (evolving tradition before reconstruction fossilizes hierarchy) emerges through concrete particulars: amber contraband, cryptic kite, grafting knife, the child's first word "why" as conspiratorial answer. The final image—plants rustling with pride, Nara carrying mutation "beneath her ribs"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing palm to moss, nicking the embryo sac) and the volcanic "tremor" that "approved or warned" avoids overt allegory. No thematic echo in the last paragraph; complexity holds without forced balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Nara's perceptual signature clear (plant-gossip, bomb-crater orchids, cedars). Diction fits voice ("little peach," "genetic priests," "conspiratorial pride") and modulates under pressure without register drift. The guard's interior ("smiled dreamily") briefly leans toward head-hopping but reads as external observation. Dialogue is absent; all advancement runs through action and interiority. Psychic distance tightens cleanly during the grotto sequence. Minor: "accidentally telepathic" as a phrase borders on telling, though the ability is dramatized immediately after.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual momentum. Information density is high (every line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes). Two clusters reduce clarity: "Heat cracks the shell, water wakes the soul, read me backward as roots drink whole" reads slightly forced as in-world script, and "Implanted destiny—do not trust the council's breeders" compresses exposition. Figurative language ("galaxies," "rogue vines," "seedlings turning to sun") stays legible but occasionally stacks in single beats without payoff. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb runs; propulsion holds through the grotto sequence. Overall strong line work with minor density friction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis (plant telepathy + amber embryo + volcanic mineral editing + cryptic kite coordinates) feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "implanted destiny" through horticultural metaphor (grafting, splicing, vines) avoids template plotting. Risk-taking in the moss-bloom beat and the wax-sealed vial charges stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor: the kite delivery and riddle mechanism arrive conveniently rather than arising from prior constraint, capping band entry. Emotional specificity (grandmother insurgent, daughter's execution, orchids in craters) anchors universals without abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nara drives all key turns: decoding the kite, descending to the grotto, grafting the embryo, using moss to disable the guard, sealing and concealing the altered fetus. Her choices narrow options and charge the final image. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The embryo anchors setup (contraband in pocket), drives middle action (immersion in basin, membrane brightening, grafting), and charges closure (sealed vial tucked beneath ribs, future "why"). Handled across three distinct beats with reweighted meaning (compliant destiny → curious mutation). Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Implanted destiny" frames the stake early, motivates the descent and alteration, and recurs in the closing image ("destiny was still theirs to implant" irony). It constrains Nara's tactics (must scramble the program) and the final payoff (child's first word). Present across beats but slightly abstract; more concrete pressure would lift it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Plant telepathy enables two on-page actions: decoding the kite script via chlorophyll memory and blooming the moss to incapacitate the guard. Early signal, causal pressure in middle beat, indirect closure linkage (plants "rustle with conspiratorial pride"). Cost is present (risk of exposure) but modest. Specific but not indispensable to every beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unseal" defines the central action: unstoppering the amber, lowering the embryo into thermal water, nicking the sac. The act redefines options (council's program scrambled) and charges the final image (sealed vial). Present in setup rhetoric, executed in middle beats, referenced at closure. Swapping for "alter" would lose thematic resonance but not break structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The kite script mechanism is signaled early, decoded through plant telepathy in a dedicated beat, and yields coordinates that enable the grotto descent. It shapes one key turn (finding the basin) but does not recur at closure. Functional and purposeful but replaceable with another riddle delivery method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs supply multiple constraints: fifty-two-degree threshold for revival, mineral water for epigenetic editing, moss for defense, slick stairs and steam as physical obstacles. The setting drives tactics across beats and charges the final image (wax from sacred torch, volcanic approval/warning). Essential to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Reconstruction timeframe pressures the stake (council about to announce breeding lottery), frames urgency (labor crews knocking off at dusk), and creates the guard encounter. Present in setup and middle, implied at closure ("tomorrow the council would announce"). Tightens decisions but not irreplaceably; a static post-war setting would still function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "evolve tradition with intent" is dramatized through Nara's choices: returning not to soak but to act, grafting the embryo against the council's design, speaking the vow to plants. Friction appears between want (child's freedom) and cost (physical pain, concealment risk). Drives setup, middle grafting, and closure image. Clear and causally active.</comment>
