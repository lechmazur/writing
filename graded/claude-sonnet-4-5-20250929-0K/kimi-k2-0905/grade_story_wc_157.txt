<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlo's core motivation—protecting defiance against thought taxation—is stated early and drives his planting mission. However, interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("converging chaos," "spark of defiance") rather than embodied contradiction; his charm is told ("charming rogue scholar's smile") more than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. The greenhouse confrontation with Voss offers a moment of tactical evasion, but the sequence lacks genuine internal conflict or visible struggle that would earn the closing defiance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a situational/accumulative hybrid: Arlo plants one seed, evades Voss, escapes to continue his mission. Closure reads as Charged Poise—seven gardens will spell "Resist" by dawn, and citizens will "feel an untaxed thought unfurl"—but the cost remains abstract and future-facing rather than paid on the page. The warp mechanism and secret-language choreography are present but not causally tight; the pollen-cloud escape and sideways slip feel convenient rather than earned by prior constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly anchored with orchid bees, passionvine, and moonlit soil; sensory detail (nectar, pollen, Voss's badge "glinting like a beetle's shell") is specific and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clear through the planting beat and Voss's approach. The setting enables the pollen-cloud trick and the warp-seed planting, but the final escape via "warp residue" lacks concrete grounding in the established world rules, weakening the micro-setting's constraint role at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planting seven message-glyphs before dawn to wake defiance—is signaled early. Voss's arrival tightens pressure, and Arlo's evasion via Lucretius passphrase and pollen clouds creates a micro-reversal. However, escalation feels more additive than causal; the greenhouse sequence could be swapped with another garden without structural loss. The final image gestures toward systemic impact but the on-page cost (one seed planted, one inspector evaded) does not meaningfully narrow Arlo's options or test his commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—resistance to authoritarianism via secret language and living patterns—emerges from the thought-taxation conceit and the club's vegetal code. The gourd rattle seed and warp-glyphs function as subtext for defiance encoded in nature. However, the final paragraph ("charming rogue scholar's ransom for freedom") edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image resonate. The piece avoids overt moralizing elsewhere, but the closing sentence dilutes the vine's quiet power by explaining its gift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Arlo's perceptions ("tasting nectar and nerves," "thoughts rippled outward"). Diction is elevated and often metaphorical ("surveillance drones," "moonlight taxed itself") in ways that match the speculative premise but occasionally slip into generic lyricism ("converging chaos pressurized inside a jar"). Voss's dialogue ("Late for horticulture, Finch") carries dry menace, and Arlo's reply shows tactical misdirection. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's retrospective scope ("By sunrise, seven gardens would bloom") shifts to a future-omniscient register that weakens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries vivid figurative language ("orchid bees droned like tiny tax auditors," "lens swept like a scythe") but several beats loop conceptually: "candidly cryptic" appears three times without functional variation, and "converging chaos" is repeated near-identically. Template cadence is evident in the middle third ("He knelt… palming," "He exhaled… pressed," "Footsteps crunched… stepped"). The greenhouse's pollen-cloud trick and Arlo's sideways slip via "warp residue" lack concrete grounding, reducing clarity at the closure beat. Information density is moderate; several lines restate atmosphere without advancing action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The thought-taxation premise and secret vegetal language offer a fresh speculative synthesis, and the club's use of living patterns (beetle crawling clockwise, tendril question marks) is specific. However, the rogue-scholar-versus-surveillance-state frame is familiar, and Arlo's charming evasion follows expected beats without surprising turns. The gourd rattle seed's warp mechanic is introduced late and feels like a convenience; the final image of firefly-readable vines is evocative but not grounded in prior particulars that would make it inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arlo is present throughout and makes the choice to plant the seed and evade Voss. His decisions drive the planting beat and the escape, but the final paragraph shifts to retrospective summary, reducing his agency at closure. The charming-rogue trait is asserted more than dramatized; his scholar background shapes the Lucretius passphrase but does not constrain later choices. Present in setup and middle; causal role in one beat; closure participation is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gourd rattle seed is introduced early ("shook the gourd rattle seed he always carried"), used in the planting beat ("pressed the gourd rattle seed two knuckles deep"), and returns as "empty husk" when Voss questions Arlo. It enables the warp and signals club membership. However, its mechanics (single seed inside a dried shell) are not causally tight; the empty husk could be any spent token. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure beat; specific but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The secret language club shapes Arlo's mission (planting message-glyphs) and is demonstrated through vegetal code (snapped stems, wilted petals, beetle signals). The club's cartographer and communal planning inform the planting location. However, the club's full operations remain abstract; Arlo acts alone on-page, and the club's impact is deferred to the future ("seven gardens would bloom"). Present in setup and middle tactics; mentioned at closure but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Candidly cryptic" is used as a label three times (Voss's voice, the club's warning, the final word) but does not constrain Arlo's choices or tactics. It describes tone without altering action. The warp-glyphs are cryptic by design, but the attribute itself is ornamental. Label-only; no visible tradeoff or cost tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The warp action enables the seed to germinate overnight into the "Resist" vine and allows Arlo to slip sideways via "warp residue." It is introduced late (middle third) and its mechanics are vague; the first glyph opens "a curled green comma rewriting the sentence of reality," but the physics are unexplained. The warp is causally active in two beats (planting, escape) and shapes the closure image, but its convenience and late introduction lower irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Planting message-glyphs across community gardens is Arlo's stated method and frames the mission. The greenhouse is one garden; the piece gestures toward "the next garden, the next glyph" in the final third. However, only one planting is dramatized on-page; the seven-garden pattern is summary. Signaled early, executed once, mentioned at closure; functional but replaceable with any serial-target mission.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The entomologist's greenhouse supplies vivid detail (orchid bees, passionvine, fig, moonlit soil) and enables the club's vegetal code and pollen-cloud trick. The setting's ventilation system becomes a tactical resource ("hidden speakers among the orchids clicked"), and the greenhouse dome's shimmer bookends the piece. The micro-environment constrains Arlo's planting (precise location calculated) and provides cover. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure image; essential to tactics and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after thoughts become taxable") establishes the speculative premise and motivates the surveillance state. Tax forms (1099-IDEA) and the Revenue Bureau are mentioned, and "back-taxes on three unauthorized dreams" concretizes the cost. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions; the nightly satellite pass is mentioned but does not force urgency in the planting beat. Present as world-rule; no live clock that alters tactics. Setup only; no middle or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Guarding one's "spark of defiance" is Arlo's stated motivation and recurs in the final line ("Arlo's gift, the charming rogue scholar's ransom for freedom"). The thought-taxation premise creates friction between compliance and resistance. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized; Arlo faces no on-page choice that tests his commitment to this spark versus another value. Present in setup and closure; asserted rather than conflicted through choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Converging chaos" appears twice as a label and is embodied in the greenhouse's pressurized air, Voss's arrival, and the pollen-cloud escape. Tone modulates from scholarly charm to tactical evasion to lyric defiance in the closing image. However, the phrase itself is repeated without functional variation, and the tone's chaotic quality is more asserted than enacted through syntax or rhythm. Present across beats; modulates with pressure; charges the final image but relies on repetition.</comment>
