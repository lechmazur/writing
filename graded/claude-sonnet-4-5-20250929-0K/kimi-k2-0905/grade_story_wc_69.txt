<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation—to unlearn hatred and braid diverse voices—is consistent, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract ritual rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The method of "subtracting noise" and listening for frequencies is poetically embodied yet remains conceptually distant; we never see her wrestle with a concrete choice between competing goods or face a moment where her grief directly conflicts with her task. The final renunciation (never singing aloud again) arrives as a summary statement rather than a dramatized cost paid on the page, weakening the sense of visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when early enough (velvet library, autumn equinox, Mara the former choir teacher). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story builds through layered images—rosette, books exhaling scents, seventeen syllables, moonlight—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mara's silence becomes the root tone of the city. The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost (she never sings aloud again, the rosette crumbles), and the lens holds. However, the causality between collecting syllables, singing the scale, and the city's transformation is elided rather than dramatized, relying on metaphor over motivated linkage, which prevents entry into the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet library is vividly anchored with crimson drapes, cedar and candle smoke, mahogany table, and stained glass depicting clasped hands. The rosette—mulberry wood, lattice, soundhole—functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining Mara's ritual and charging the final image when it crumbles. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (saffron, iron, river water from book-spines; moonlight falling through glass), and the environment subtly guides her choices (placing the rosette beneath the beam, kneeling to listen). The library's physical logic remains stable, and spatial choreography is clear across all moves, earning solid high-7 placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlearning hatred to restore harmony—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence (rosette drinking lamplight, collecting syllables, singing the scale, hearing the city's heartbeat rearrange), but the escalation is textural rather than decisional; Mara does not face a live dilemma or trade-off that narrows her options on the page. The cost (her voice as sacrifice, the rosette crumbling, her lifelong silence) is legible in the final third, yet because no on-page choice forces her to weigh competing goods or endure visible friction, the tightening feels decorative rather than earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: vanishing arts wait inside negative space, harmony arises from subtraction, and the story's central question—how does one unlearn hatred—receives a resonant, non-literal answer through Mara's ritual and the city's quiet transformation. The rosette, the library's "unbinding of the ear," and the final image of untouched dust beneath moonlight all reweight prior material without stating a moral. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("the idea of enemy sounded, to every ear, like a note that simply did not belong"), slightly diluting the earned ambiguity with an overly tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and apt, with narrative certainty calibrated to Mara's knowledge and perceptual filter. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"traveled stillness," "velvet turned inside out," "a frequency she could now subtract"—that coheres with the ritual's contemplative mode. Diction is elevated but remains consistent; no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs. Distance modulates purposefully as Mara moves from action to reflection. Minor slip: the final paragraph shifts slightly toward omniscient summary ("neighbors would wake hearing an unfamiliar tenderness") without anchoring in Mara's present perception, though the effect supports closure rather than obscuring it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense, with many lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the rosette accepted the scale, then reflected it back diminished" conveys both action and acoustic transformation). Figurative language is purposeful and consistent with the musical-ritual frame. However, the piece exhibits patterned scaffold in several paragraphs: "She walked… touching spines," "She returned… placed her lips," "She understood then," "She lifted… walked… set… Kneeling, she pressed," and "She would leave… carrying nothing" stack nearly identical subject-verb stems across adjacent beats without variation, creating a template cadence that slightly dulls momentum. One paraphrase loop: "the rosette would crumble into sawdust, its job complete" is immediately restated as "she would leave… carrying nothing audible," rehashing the same content. Apply −0.8 for template-cadence runs and minor loop; no artifacts touch the closure image directly, so capping at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core premise—healing societal hatred through a musical ritual of subtraction—offers a fresh synthesis of music, silence, and reconciliation. The rosette as vessel for negative space, the library's "unbinding of the ear," and the city's heartbeat rearranging are specific, non-obvious images. However, the overall arc (wise elder performs mystical ceremony, city transforms) follows a familiar template, and the final transformation occurs largely off-page via summary rather than earned particulars. The emotional arc relies on assertion more than dramatized friction. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure and lyric mode, but the closure's tidiness and the protagonist's passive reception of wisdom prevent entry into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) and her choices—entering the library, performing the ritual, placing the rosette beneath moonlight—drive each phase. However, her decisions are more enactments of a predetermined method than live dilemmas that narrow options under pressure. She does not face a moment where two competing impulses force a trade-off with visible cost; the ritual unfolds as a sequence she executes rather than a crucible that tests her. Band: functional across beats but not indispensable to closure logic, as another character could perform the same ritual with minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure limited +0.4, cost connection +0.3, swappability −0.6, ornamental in middle section −0.3 → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rosette appears in setup (introduced in paragraph 3), middle (placed on table, drinks lamplight, collects syllables, accepts her song), and ending (crumbles into sawdust). It is handled across at least four distinct beats and its mechanics—"subtracting noise," reflecting sound "diminished," creating "a quiet so complete"—drive the ritual's escalation. The object's transformation (from grandmother's heirloom to vessel to dust) charges the final image with cost. Band: essential across beats and ending. Score: early signal +0.6, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5, late middle use −0.2 → 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vanishing arts concept frames Mara's motivation and stakes from paragraph 4 onward. It shapes her method (subtracting noise, braiding contradiction without breaking) and appears in the ending reflection ("vanishing arts do not disappear; they wait inside negative space"). However, the concept functions primarily as thematic backdrop rather than a tactical constraint that alters her on-page choices; she never faces a moment where preserving a vanishing art forces her to forfeit another goal. Band: shapes one key turn (the realization that absence is the vessel) and resonates at closure but does not drive two distinct beats. Score: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure limited +0.5, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, ornamental in middle −0.5, summary-only in final third −0.5 → 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is named twice (paragraph 5, paragraph 19) but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains action with visible cost. The phrase colors Mara's stance—she anticipates an outcome yet accepts its weight—but does not force her to choose one path over another on the page. The trait is not embodied in a micro-choice where resignation enables a tactic or expectation forecloses an option. Band: present in setup and ending reprise but ornamental. Score: setup +0.4, closure mention +0.4, causal pressure absent +0.0, cost connection absent +0.0, label-only −0.8, swappability −0.6 → cap at 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Denote" appears once in paragraph 3 ("She had come to denote what was missing, to measure silence") as a stated intention but is not dramatized as a distinct action that turns the plot. The ritual sequence—listening, collecting syllables, singing, kneeling—embodies the broader aim of measuring absence, but "denote" itself does not recur or drive a beat; it could be replaced with "measure" or "mark" without structural impact. Band: functional setup but not a causal pivot. Score: setup +0.4, one beat (implicit) +0.4, causal pressure weak +0.2, closure linkage weak +0.3, swappability −0.8, summary-only −0.5 → 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method "by subtracting noise" is signaled in paragraph 4 (grandmother's arts "by subtracting noise instead of adding it"), demonstrated in paragraph 8 (Mara lowers her voice until resonance vanishes, "subtracting the noise of her own grief"), and returns in the ending where her silence becomes the root tone. The mechanics matter: subtraction drives the ritual's escalation (collecting syllables, stripping vibrato, leaning into silence). However, the method is more thematic than tactical—it does not force Mara to navigate a trade-off or alter her approach mid-scene. Band: shapes two beats and ending but lacks friction. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, cost connection +0.4, ornamental in one beat −0.3 → 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet library is anchored early (paragraph 1) with vivid sensory detail (cedar, candle smoke, crimson drapes) and evolves across the ritual: books exhale scents, the mahogany table holds the rosette, moonlight falls through stained glass. The setting supplies resources (hymnals, languages without "enemy," the central nave) that guide Mara's moves and constrain her choices (she must stay until dawn, the equinox timing matters). The final image of untouched dust beneath the moonlit window charges the closure. Band: essential across beats and ending. Score: early signal +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, micro-setting function +0.5, static description in middle −0.4 → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "unlearning hatred" is stated in paragraph 6 ("across the hours between the last leaf falling and the first frost forming") and paragraph 19 ("She remained there until dawn"), but the passage of time is not tracked beat-by-beat or used to tighten decisions. Mara moves through the ritual without on-page pressure from a live clock; the equinox window functions as a ritual frame rather than a tactical constraint that alters her choices. Band: present but ornamental. Score: setup +0.4, closure mention +0.3, causal pressure weak +0.2, swappability −0.7, summary-only −0.6, late signal (paragraph 6) −0.3 → cap at 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is introduced in paragraph 4 and recurs in paragraph 11 (collecting syllables "to braid into one measure"), the final paragraph (children's voices "braided into one humming line"), and throughout the ritual. It shapes Mara's method and stakes, but the motivation is never tested by a conflicting want or fear on the page; she pursues the goal steadily without friction between desire and cost. Band: shapes one key turn (collecting syllables) and resonates at closure but lacks dramatized conflict. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure limited +0.5, closure linkage +1.1, specificity +0.5, cost connection +0.4, told-only friction −0.8, ornamental in one beat −0.3 → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone "traveled stillness" is named in paragraph 1, recurs in paragraphs 16 and 22, and permeates the prose with phrases like "quiet so complete it felt like velvet turned inside out," "hush of voices that had agreed to listen," and "a sound so transparent it revealed the listener to herself." The tone coheres through all turns, modulates subtly as pressure accumulates (from anticipation to ritual intensity to dawn resolution), and charges the final image (children listening, then humming). Band: indispensable across beats and ending. Score: early signal +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.8, specificity +0.8, cost connection +0.5, ornamental mention in one line −0.3 → 7.8.</comment>
