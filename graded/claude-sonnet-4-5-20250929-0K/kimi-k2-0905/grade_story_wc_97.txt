<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pianist's interiority is heavily weighted toward lyric abstraction—"letting it wander into minor modulations that tasted of steely longing"—rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her decision to climb the shaft and later to leave the loop is motivated, but the agency reads more as symbolic gesture than lived friction. The "strategically creative" projectionist and passengers "wearing her own face" supply conceptual texture without applying immediate relational pressure. The final choice to step offscreen and embrace "the next unplanned encore" foreclosed waiting as a tactic, meeting the cost threshold, but the path feels more allegorical than grounded in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the opening lines (station, pianist, broken clock), satisfying the test. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the tidal arbor, film-loop refuge, and layered imagery, culminating in the pianist's decision to leave the loop and sound the chime—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights waiting versus forward motion. Cost is legible in her stepping offscreen with the clock "ticking audibly…its hands still immobile but its chime now free," foreclosing the loop's safety. However, causality is loose: the projectionist's offer, the film's mechanics, and the arbor's descent are linked more by metaphor than because/therefore logic, and the middle section's transitions (shaft to greenhouse to film) lack clear spatial choreography, creating minor orientation drag even after the waiver for lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The station's marble floor, antique departure board, and fluorescent bars anchor the opening; the tidal arbor and film reel provide vivid lyric environments. The broken anniversary clock functions as micro-setting, handled twice (struck against the rail, ticking in her arms at closure) and charging the final image. Yet spatial choreography falters in the middle: the hatch behind plywood, the shaft widening into a greenhouse "between cumulus pillows," and the boundary between viewer and vista dissolve without clear cues for how the pianist moves or where she stands relative to the projectionist. The arbor's "cloud-roots tugging the greenhouse downward" and fog pouring through film perforations are evocative but do not constrain a tactical choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to continue waiting or move forward—is signaled early and tightens once when the pianist trades the clock's chime for entry into the loop, then again when she chooses to leave. The tidal arbor and film mechanics complicate the situation but do not escalate through protagonist agency; instead, the arbor "responds" and fog "dissolves the boundary" without clear causal linkage to her actions. The final departure forecloses the loop's safety with felt cost, meeting the Accumulative lens requirement for a meaningful deepening. However, coincidence (the hatch's discovery, the projectionist's offer) drives key turns more than the pianist's active choices under pressure, and the middle section's reversals feel more symbolic than tactically constrained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—moving from paralyzed waiting to active creation—emerges through the clock, compass imagery, and the unplanned encore motif. The final image (clock ticking but hands immobile, chime ringing, destination "Onward") offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the pianist's gesture of ending the unresolved chord and the projectionist's grafting metaphor. Yet the piece leans heavily on abstraction: "every regret is merely an undeveloped frame," passengers with "names she had almost chosen," and "steely longing" are asserted more than dramatized through concrete choice. The ending resists simplicity and invites reflection, but the conceptual apparatus (film loop, flickering compasses, tidal arbor) sometimes substitutes for earned particularity, and the prompt's core concept ("flickering compasses") appears more as theme echo than stakes-shaping force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable throughout, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"reluctant pigeons," "brass corpse," "celluloid-thin"—that reflects the pianist's wistful register. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "tidal arbor," "strategically creative fingers," "iron filings around an invisible magnet" read more authorial than character-voiced. The opening and closing images are strong, but mid-passage the voice loses specificity under metaphorical load. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains controlled, yet the prose occasionally sacrifices immediacy for ornament, dulling the sense of embodied urgency at the shaft climb and film-entry beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence of the middle section: "tidal arbor," "cumulus pillows," "sprocket holes rimmed with moonlight," "flag that has forgotten its country." Many are evocative but a few contradict (cloud-roots "tugging downward" while the arbor is already "above the clouds") or blur spatial logic. Template cadence appears in runs: "She understood then that…," "She realized she could…," "The last thing…was her silhouette…" Stack of -ing participles and passive constructions ("was not escape but rehearsal," "was editing") flatten propulsion in the middle third. Paraphrase loops: "the clock strapped to her back" / "the clock…now part of the scene's architecture" / "the clock ticking audibly in her arms" recycle the image without added pressure. Information density is uneven—some lines do double work, others repeat concepts. No major causality breaks, so artifacts remain in Q7, but they cluster enough to disallow 9+ globally and pull the score below 6.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The frame—station pianist entering a film loop via hidden hatch and tidal arbor—is inventive and the clock-as-soundtrack trade is a fresh inflection. The ending's resonance (stepping offscreen, clock ticking but hands frozen) grows from prior imagery. Yet the core emotional arc (artist frozen by loss, chooses forward motion) is familiar, and the lyric machinery (film reel, arbor, projectionist) functions more as ornamental apparatus than as a premise with unique implications. The piece takes structural risks with its nested metaphors and accumulative design, but swappability is moderate: the film could be a dream, a theater, a memory palace without major rewrite. Transformation is partial—enough to lift the score above generic mid-band but not enough to feel indispensable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The pianist drives the climb, the trade, and the final departure—three distinct choices across setup, middle, and closure. Her decisions alter tactics (entering the loop, leaving it) and the ending image shows her sounding the chime with the compass steadied. However, much of her arc is contemplative rather than decisional: she "understood," "realized," "saw her own edges," without friction-laden micro-choices in those beats. Early signal is strong, beat involvement spans the piece, and closure linkage is clear. Cost is felt (foreclosing the loop's safety) but not deeply embodied. Swappability is moderate—another waiting artist could fill the role with minor edits. The character shapes key turns but does not impose unique constraints that would break the story's logic if removed.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The clock appears in the opening (broken, reflecting ceiling), is strapped to the pianist's back during the climb, struck against the rail to trade its chime, ticks in sync with her heartbeat in the film, and is set on the bench at closure where its "first new chime" rings. Five touches across setup, middle, and ending; it enables the refuge-trade and charges the final image. Cost is tied to it (trading the frozen chime, reclaiming time's sound). Swappability is low—the anniversary context and chime-as-soundtrack are specific. The clock's mechanics (hands frozen, chime freed) reweight the waiting-versus-moving stake at closure, meeting causal pressure and irreplaceability thresholds for the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Flickering compasses appear twice: the departure board "like restless castanets" and later as "station clocks without hands…pointing…toward whatever tomorrow frightened her most." Both mentions are metaphorical rather than tactical—the compasses do not constrain a choice or enable an action. They echo the theme of indecision but do not shape stakes on the page. Setup is present, closure participation is weak (the compass "steadied" in the final paragraph is mentioned, not dramatized as affecting her move), and middle development is absent. Swappability is high—any symbol of uncertainty could replace them. Score reflects functional but replaceable presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is applied once to the projectionist's fingers, describing his splice-and-graft method. It does not constrain or enable the pianist's on-page actions, nor does it shape a trade-off or cost for her. The trait is label-only, not dramatized through a choice with visible consequence. Late first appearance (second third), ornamental use, and no closure linkage. The projectionist's role could be filled by any wise helper with minor rewording. Score reflects present-but-ornamental integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Refuge is the pianist's goal in the middle third: the projectionist offers it inside the film loop, she accepts by trading the chime, and the loop becomes the crucible where she rehearses possible futures before choosing to leave. The action drives two major beats (entry and exit) and directly shapes the ending (stepping offscreen, reclaiming time). Setup is clear by the second third, middle development is strong, and closure participation is direct. However, swappability is moderate—"sanctuary," "escape," or "haven" could replace "refuge" with minor edits. Causal pressure is solid, cost is legible, and closure linkage is undeniable, placing the score in the upper half of the 7.0–8.4 band, but the element's exact wording is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method (hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel) is introduced in the second third when the projectionist offers entry "inside a continuous loop he was editing" with "hidden sections." The pianist steps through, experiences the film, and steps offscreen at closure. The mechanics matter—she becomes part of the scene, sees sprocket holes and translucence—but the "hidden sections" detail is mentioned once and not leveraged as a unique constraint (any portal or threshold could serve). Early signal is weak (appears past the first third), beat involvement is moderate (entry and exit), and closure linkage is present but not mechanically specific. Swappability is moderate. The element shapes attempts but is not irreplaceable, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The tidal arbor appears in the middle third—bonsai pines, cumulus pillows, air roots, cloud-roots tugging downward—providing vivid atmosphere. It houses the projectionist and responds to the pianist's playing by descending and pouring fog. However, the arbor does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is more backdrop than pressure. Setup occurs in the second third (late), middle development is passive (the arbor "responds"), and closure participation is absent (the pianist emerges into the station, not the arbor). Swappability is high—any liminal space (tower, garden, attic) could replace it. Score reflects functional atmosphere without tactical integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe ("until the horizon invites night") is stated in the fourth paragraph and referenced at closure ("night had finally accepted the horizon's invitation"). It bookends the piece but does not tighten decisions on the page—no clock runs down, no missed train, no escalating cost tied to elapsed time. The pianist's climb, film-loop rehearsal, and return occur within the window, but duration is untracked and does not alter tactics. Setup is early, closure participation is present via callback, but middle development is absent and causal pressure is zero. The phrasing is poetic but replaceable ("by dawn," "before midnight"). Score reflects lyric reprise without mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to surprise fate with an unplanned encore") is articulated explicitly in the middle third and drives the pianist's final choice: she plays "the chord she had feared to resolve," ends it, and steps offscreen to "compose" the next encore. The desire is dramatized in the closure beat (sounding the chime, opening to "Onward") and friction is present (fear of resolving, safety of looping versus risk of forward motion). However, the motivation is told more than shown through prior conflicted micro-choices—"she understood," "she realized" summarize insight rather than enacting it under pressure. Early signal is weak (appears mid-piece), beat involvement is moderate, closure linkage is strong, and cost is felt. Swappability is moderate—"to create anew," "to move beyond waiting" could serve. Score reflects solid thematic work with partial dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Steely longing is woven throughout: the wistful opening, "minor modulations that tasted of steely longing," the frozen clock and waiting across seven moons, the final compass steadying but hands still immobile. Tone is consistent and modulates with pressure—lyric and mournful at the start, intensifying through the film-loop recursion, resolving to determined forward motion at closure. The adjective "steely" itself appears once, but the quality (hard-edged yearning, refusal to soften into despair) charges the final image of the chime ringing despite immobile hands. Coherence is strong, pressure linkage is clear, and the tone reweights the ending. However, the exact phrasing "steely longing" is somewhat replaceable—"aching resolve," "iron nostalgia"—and the tone is more established through imagery than through choices that test its limits. Score reflects strong tonal integration with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>
