<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is clear and embodied—her physical manipulation of equipment reflects urgency and her micro-choices under pressure (killing the sine generator, embracing chaos) reveal agency. Internal contradiction is present: she doesn't delude herself that harmony is won, yet still hopes interference might be love. The "cautiously hopeful" tag appears as voice texture rather than decision-shaping friction. Minor deduction: her plan unfolds with high competence and little genuine struggle or compounding mistake that tests her limits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Charged Poise—the town pauses, the tricksters fold "for this orbit," and Lyra's final gesture (hand on transmitter, walking home with charts) crystallizes options with felt cost: temporary reprieve, ongoing vigilance required. The story teaches its layered, dense voice early and maintains coherence. One meaningful tightening occurs at 02:17 when interference peaks and collapses into hush; cost is visible in the "cautiously hopeful" sign-off and the acknowledgment that power plays are "surely already congealing."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The radio station functions as micro-setting: burnt solder, vinyl dust, cinder-block texture anchor POV. The emergency generator and transmitter tower constrain Lyra's tactical choices (she must manually patch, time the photocell, trust the antique rig). The astronomical charts function as recurring object-as-setting that shapes decisions (she trusts ink over improvisation). The quad livestream and town loudspeakers extend spatial reach without losing coherence. The final dawn image—"old bone" light over the divided community—charges closure by contrasting the ethereal grit of her night's work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: beat the tricksters' subsonic pulse before 02:17 to prevent violence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tricksters adapt mid-attempt, forcing Lyra to abandon the sine generator for chaotic field-recording—agency-driven escalation. Cost is legible: she powers down knowing harmony is "merely paused," and the town's reprieve is temporary. The story does not require multiple reversals at this length. Minor cap: the adversaries' resolution (lowering signs, bewildered eye-contact) lands slightly soft on-page; we see effect more than visceral cost paid by Lyra herself in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: interference as an act of care, the ethics of counter-manipulation, and the fragility of civility under cosmic (and terrestrial) pressure. The astronomical charts seed the motif of trust in old knowledge; their return in the closing lines reweights them as "newspaper of possible futures." The final image—"interference, when practiced with humility, might yet be another word for love"—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (hand pressed to cooling transmitter) and image (ethereal grit made visible). No thematic echo; the line reads as earned reflection tied to on-page action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lyra; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct: "thumb tilting a balance scale," "chipped silver coin," "gritty lullaby that tasted of copper and thunderstorms." Perceptual signature is consistent—technical detail filtered through her expertise and exhaustion. Psychic distance tightens during peak pressure (02:17) without losing coherence. Minor deduction: a few phrases approach stock lyricism ("ethereal hush of predawn," "old bone") and the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sky-calm," "braided with moonlight") that, while voice-motivated, flirts with overwriting. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, character action, escalation). Rhythm varies and accelerates into the climax. Minor loop: "the charts showed a convergence" / "the charts indicated" / "astronomical charts promised" recurs across beats with slight synonym variation. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She [verb], [verb]-ing" structures cluster ("She wheeled… yanking," "She answered, feeding," "She killed, flipped"). Figurative density is high throughout ("velvet migraine," "ghost brawl riding the same air") without always earning the lyricism under accumulative pressure. These issues do not obscure causality but dull momentum slightly. No paraphrase loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic tricksters, subsonic warfare, and community division via a university DJ offers a fresh, non-obvious angle. The choice to use glacier calving as chaotic carrier is specific and memorable. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on Lyra's role and the radio-station setting. Risk-taking (accumulative voice, dense technical detail, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the "cosmic tricksters" trope leans on familiar SFF shorthand (modulated pulses, frequency-hopping, mocking laughter) without fully grounding their mechanics or motive in world logic unique to this story.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: Lyra arrives clutching charts, framing expectation. Development: she patches equipment, tunes to 37 Hz, reacts to trickster adaptation by switching to glacier recording—three distinct beats shaped by her technical decisions. Closure: she powers down, signs off with her tag, and walks home with charts "ready to plot tomorrow's sky"—her role charges the final image. Causal pressure is strong; her choices narrow options and drive the peak turn. Cost is visible: temporary reprieve, ongoing vigilance. The character is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: charts arrive in the opening line, "mapping the silence between stars." Development: they show the 02:17 convergence and promise a five-second window; Lyra trusts them over improvisation. Closure: she tucks them "beneath her arm like a newspaper of possible futures." Three touches across beats; the final reprise reweights them as both anchor and burden. Causal role is present but the charts do not constrain a middle choice as sharply as other elements; they guide rather than force. Solid integration but not indispensable—mission clock could function without the physical object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "power plays" appears in the opening paragraph (old families vs. new contracts). Development: the tricksters' manipulation is framed as "power plays" nudging argument into violence; Lyra's counter-move is a power play in reverse. Closure: she acknowledges "power plays surely already congealing beyond" the night's reprieve. The concept shapes stakes on the page and the final image recognizes their persistence. Swappability concern: "manipulation," "coercion," or "control" could replace "power plays" with minor edits. The term adds thematic texture but is not mechanically unique to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "cautiously hopeful" tags Lyra's plan in paragraph six. Development: the trait colors her decision to trust old charts and her acceptance of the "half-known." Closure: she uses the phrase in her sign-off and "let herself imagine" in the final paragraph. The trait is present as voice texture and frames her stance, but does not visibly constrain a choice with cost—she acts decisively throughout. The label recurs but functions more as mood than friction. Lyric reprise at closure lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: Lyra "had come to interfere" is stated early. Development: every major beat is interference—patching counter-wave, retuning against trickster adaptation, killing sine generator to "let irregular pops become the new carrier." Closure: the final reflection frames interference as "another word for love." Three or more beats trace directly to this action; removing it breaks the story's causal spine. The action is irreplaceable and charges the ending image. Strong integration; approaches indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: hydrogen line, subsonic probe, 37 Hz introduced in the first third. Development: Lyra tunes frequencies, feeds counter-wave, and the clash of subsonics creates the "feedback howl so low it registered in kneecaps"—mechanics shape her tactics and the peak turn. Closure: the planet's "subsonic frequency" is the "slow heartbeat… steady, unhacked" in the penultimate paragraph. The method is signaled, constrains attempts, and charges the final image. Specificity is high; swapping for another invisible influence would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: radio station anchored in paragraph three (cinder-block, burnt solder, vinyl dust). Development: the antique tower and emergency generator supply the means; Lyra's physical movement (wheeling, patching, keying photocell) is station-bound. Closure: she locks the door, presses palm to the transmitter, and walks across the quad. The setting provides resources and constraints that alter tactics; removing it would break the technical logic. Minor swappability: another broadcast facility could serve similar function with edits, but the university context and antique rig add specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "just after midnight" and the 02:17 convergence anchor time early. Development: the live clock tightens pressure—01:58 first probe, 02:17 target, 02:19 peak—and Lyra's choices respond to the countdown. Closure: "tonight the town slept" and dawn arrives. The timeframe is tracked clearly and shapes tactical moves (photocell keyed to moon meridian). Cost is legible: she works against a deadline with no margin. The clock is essential to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "to outwit cosmic tricksters" is stated explicitly in paragraph four and again when she recalls her mentor's maxim. Development: the tricksters adapt mid-attempt, "mocking her with dolphin-quick hops," and Lyra shifts tactics to "chaos meeting chaos on its own terms." Closure: "the charts indicated the tricksters' carrier had folded, at least for this orbit." The desire is dramatized through tactical friction and adaptation under pressure. Cost is visible: temporary victory, ongoing threat. Minor deduction: the tricksters remain abstract; their motive and nature are told more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "ethereal hush" and "gritty bass line" appear in the opening third; "ethereal grit made visible" at the climax. Development: tone oscillates between technical precision (SWR meter, sine-wave generator) and lyric imagery (sodium lights "the color of dried blood," moon as "chipped silver coin"). Closure: dawn "the color of old bone" and the final image of Lyra "smelling of engine oil and ozone" fuse the registers. The tone is coherent through turns, modulates with pressure, and charges the ending. Specificity and control are high; the pairing is indispensable to the story's voice.</comment>
