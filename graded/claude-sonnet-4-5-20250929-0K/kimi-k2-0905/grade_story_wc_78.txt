<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation is clear and consistent—converting obstacles into instruments—and his micro-choices (striking objects, rigging the crown) advance that goal. Interiority remains thin; we observe actions but rarely feel contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The final moment ("He heard the obstacle become instrument") lands as summative rather than a choice with visible cost. Children and crew are present but exert no relational pressure; the prophet operates in effective solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (orchard raft, prophet, blue hour) arrive promptly. The piece accumulates sonic/visual texture (resonance sketches, fractal echoes, cloud signatures) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the raft moves through sound, the obstacle becomes instrument, and the cost is the persistent work of layering and rigging under the Doldrum Wall's pressure. The escalation from passive recording to active dubbing to kinetic crown construction tightens options under the chosen lens. One minor ellipsis: the crown's assembly and immediate efficacy compress causality, but the pattern of sound-as-force has been taught throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating orchard, Doldrum Wall mirror, and blue hour are vivid and purposeful. The raft's planks, mast, barrels, and peach tree constrain the prophet's actions (he strikes them, rigs them) and charge the final image when the crown spins and children dance. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (he hears more than he sees). Spatial choreography is clean: prow, glade, rails, mast ladder. The setting functions as instrument and pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: move the raft through the Doldrum Wall using sound. The prophet's agency drives escalation: sketching resonance → dubbing loops → rigging the rotating crown. The Wall's stillness raises cost (engines fail, laughter falls flat), and the final turn—children dancing, cyclone eye opening—is earned by prior sonic layering. The tightening is meaningful but cost remains largely instrumental (effort, rigging) rather than a visible personal or relational price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: obstacles as untuned instruments, silence as groove, individual rhythms braiding into chorus. The prophet's conversion of calm into rhythm and the fractal spiral's micro-repetition in spray droplets ground the conceptual work. The ending reweights the premise without stating a moral: the orchard becomes orchestra through accumulated resonance. Petals sticking to wet ink form "accidental notations" that subtly tie chance and pattern. No overt thematic statement mars the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the prophet; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("alto cumuli sliding into bass stratus," "Sea's Locked Jaw") with purposeful register. Perceptual signature is sonic-first (he hears obstacles as instruments). The piece trends lyric and accumulative, which suits the lens, but lacks rhythmic modulation under peak pressure—syntax remains uniformly lush even when the raft is stalled. Children and crew speak no dialogue; their presence is gestural only.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("clouds moved in slow arpeggios," "fractal generating," "restless euphony") and occasionally muddles under its own weight: "fractal generating, each echo birthing a smaller echo" stacks abstraction without grounding the mechanic in observable detail. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("He looped the creak... the wet slap... the soft thud") and the final paragraph recycles "He heard..." three times in close succession. Information density is strong when concrete (mallet wrapped in drumfish skin, bamboo crown) but dips into repetition of the resonance/echo/loop concept. No paraphrase loops mar closure, but the accumulated figurative load across the piece prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of floating orchard, sonic propulsion, and fractal cloud-reading feels specific and non-obvious. The prophet's motive (obstacles as instruments) and method (dubbing, resonance sketching) cohere into a singular vision. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, lyric) and the absence of conventional antagonist elevate originality. However, the "sound-as-magic" premise leans on familiar genre templates (eco-fantasy, vibrational world-building) without deep transformation through lived consequence or moral calculus; the raft's movement feels abstractly earned rather than interrogated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present early (paragraph 2), the prophet climbs the mast, sketches resonance, descends to dub, strikes the peach tree, rigs the crown, and conducts the crew—six distinct beats. His choices drive all major turns. Closure depends on his agency: "He heard the obstacle become instrument." Cost is instrumental effort rather than personal sacrifice, preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 3 ("whale-bone... drumfish skin"), the mallet is used in four distinct beats: striking barrel/mast/buoys (para 4), striking the peach tree (para 13), swinging through empty space (para 18), striking the crown (para 22). Its specificity (whale-bone, drumfish wrap) matters; a generic stick would not carry the same charged resonance. The mallet shapes the prophet's method and appears at closure, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" is signaled early (para 4: "he sketched resonance... drew the ripples those sounds made on parchment") and recurs when petals stick to wet ink, forming "accidental notations" (para 14). The concept shapes the prophet's tactics (recording, layering, converting sound to motion) and is named at closure ("the orchard become orchestra"). It constrains method but does not impose a visible on-page cost distinct from the mallet's use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cloud-reading is present in paragraphs 5 ("he read them the way other men read ledgers"), 15 ("cloud lyre tilted"), and 20 ("clouds... shifted into a spiral"). The attribute enables the prophet to anticipate the Doldrum Wall and later recognize the nautilus pattern he must imitate. The trait constrains his rigging choice (rotating crown to match spiral) and participates in closure when the cyclonic eye opens. Cost is indirect (he must build the crown), preventing higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Dub" is introduced paragraph 9 ("began to dub: layering the day's recorded knocks and chimes") and recurs when he instructs the crew to "dub their own heartbeats" (para 19). The action drives the central turn from passive recording to active propulsion and is essential to the raft's movement. The closure image ("restless euphony," "orchard become orchestra") depends on the accumulated dubbing. Swapping for "mix" or "layer" would weaken specificity but not break logic, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fractal generating" appears paragraph 11 ("spilled outward, fractal generating, each echo birthing a smaller echo") and recurs paragraph 20 ("Fractal generating, the spiral repeated at smaller scales"). The method is signaled and shapes the prophet's sonic strategy (self-reinforcing loops), but its mechanics remain abstract—on-page we see loops and spirals, not the fractal mechanism itself. The concept participates in closure (spiral crown, micro-rhythms braiding) but does not impose a specific cost or constraint beyond the general dubbing effort.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard raft is introduced paragraph 1 and pressures every choice: the prophet climbs its mast, strikes its trees and barrels, rigs its bamboo crown, and its planks vibrate with looped sound. The Doldrum Wall (para 16) stalls the raft, raising stakes. Children sleep in the music glade (para 8), dance on deck (para 23), and the orchard's movement through sound is the story's closure unit. Removing this exact setting—floating, timber-and-tree hybrid—collapses the entire logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Blue hour" is named paragraphs 2, 24, and implied at dawn (para 16: "appeared at dawn"). The timeframe provides atmospheric tone but does not tighten decisions or create a clock. The prophet works across an untracked span (evening → dawn → unspecified forward motion) without urgency imposed by the hour itself. The element is present and tonally coherent but functionally replaceable with "dusk" or "twilight."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated paragraph 7 ("Obstacles... were only instruments not yet tuned") and demonstrated across beats: dubbing to convert calm (para 12), striking absence (para 18), rigging the crown (para 21). The prophet's every choice serves this desire, and closure ("obstacle become instrument") fulfills it. The friction is light—he encounters resistance (the Wall, stillness) but no on-page moment where turning the obstacle exacts a personal cost beyond effort. The motivation shapes all tactics and charges the final image, justifying mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" is named paragraphs 9 and 19, describing the layered sound and micro-rhythms. Tone is consistently textured, sonic, and urgent without panic—language remains lush under pressure ("cambium and salt-soaked root," "faint blue afterimage"). The tone modulates slightly (contemplative at blue hour, kinetic when the crown spins) and charges the final image ("silence become groove"). Coherent and purposeful, but does not escalate sharply enough at closure to reach high-8s.</comment>
