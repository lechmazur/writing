<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lark's monthly molt provides a vivid conceit, but his interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("blooming resistance," "lantern-bearer") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Marin remains functional but underdeveloped; her motivations (why risk her job?) are asserted, not dramatized through competing impulses. The final shift to "Co-conspirator of light" feels declared rather than earned by on-page choices that foreclose a visible path. Emotional states are often labeled ("the joke feels thin") instead of shown through action and perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece opens with orientation debt—who Lark is, why he's in a prison library, and the stakes of the molt take ~150 words to clarify, triggering a −0.3 penalty. The accumulative lens emerges: the spiral reading nest, paper cranes, and stove ritual build toward a thematic reconfiguration. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing—"the library grows too bright for iron walls to hold"—but the cost is largely projected ("will return," "will rebuild") rather than felt on the page in the present window. The Rourke confrontation resolves via convenient logic rather than earned causality, softening the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is vivid and purposeful, its buckled roof and punctured ceiling creating a sovereign gap that shapes the action. The coffee tin with false bottom and the potbellied stove are handled concretely across multiple beats, constraining choices (hiding the husks, burning the skins). Spatial choreography—warped shelves dragged into a spiral, cranes lodged in dictionaries—remains clear and tactile. The setting charges the final image: "too bright for iron walls to hold" ties environment to closure, meeting the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the library against bulldozing—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual of burning past selves and the shared rebuilding. The Rourke confrontation offers a pressure point, but it resolves via verbal maneuvering ("recommend preservation for educational credit") rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The accumulative lens supports thematic intensification, yet the final image projects future action ("will return," "will rebuild") rather than crystallizing present consequence. One meaningful deepening is present, but cost clarity at closure is diffuse.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the molt ritual, the library as sanctuary, and the collaborative resistance; "beauty from anarchy" grows from particulars rather than assertion. The recurring motifs—skins, ashes, wings—reweight across the arc, and the final image ("too bright for iron walls to hold") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, some phrasing edges toward prompt echo: "blooming resistance," "luminous fracture," and "Co-conspirator of light" feel more like thematic labels than lived realizations. The specificity of the paper cranes and stove ritual anchors the theme effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is present in Lark's attention to molting and poetic detail. Dialogue when it appears ("Can poems stop bulldozers?") carries subtext and advances the collaboration. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"jurisdiction-less," "sovereign gap," "lantern-bearer"—that feels imposed rather than voice-specific for a vagrant poet. Filter verbs ("feels," "remembers") cluster in reflective beats but do not severely dull immediacy. The final paragraph's prophetic future tense ("will return," "will stream out") shifts from present-scene focalization without clear signal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"skin splits," "flames bloom green," "voices braid," "wings where definitions nested"—creating lyric texture but occasionally obscuring causality (how exactly does the false bottom "click"? why do flames bloom green?). Paraphrase loops appear: "the library feels jurisdiction-less, a sovereign gap" restates the same idea. Template cadence emerges in the final third: "They seal… No bulldozer will arrive… Lark will return… Together they will rebuild…" runs four parallel future constructions. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering a −0.8 deduction and disqualifying 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is otherwise strong, with most lines advancing action or image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The monthly personality molt and the prison library as resistance crucible offer fresh angles on transformation and beauty-from-constraint themes. The coffee tin with false bottom, the stove ritual burning past selves, and the paper cranes in dictionaries are specific, non-generic choices that feel organic to character and setting. However, the core arc—found collaboration sparks hope and preserves a sanctuary—follows a familiar template, and the final projection ("the desert will remember") gestures toward symbolic closure without a sharp, earned surprise. The risk-taking in lyric density and metaphor is notable but does not fully transform the underlying structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lark is present throughout and drives the rebuilding action, but his key choices—showing Marin the tin, reciting fresh lines, naming himself "Co-conspirator of light"—are more declarative than pressure-tested. The molt itself is a vivid setup but does not constrain a pivotal choice with visible cost at closure; it functions more as atmospheric conceit than causal lever. Two gates (setup, development) are met; closure participation is thematic rather than decisively causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears in three beats: concealing the husks, revealing the false bottom to Marin, and sealing it at the end. It enables the stove ritual (feeding sheets into flames) and carries thematic weight as a vessel for recycling selves. The final seal ("click the false bottom shut") reweights prior vulnerability. All three gates met; the object constrains and enables choices, though the cost tied to it is conceptual rather than sharply physical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is named as Lark's mantra and thematically echoed in the molt, the spiral nest, and the final image. It shapes the dominant stake (preserving the library as an act of resistance) and informs tactics (ritual, collaboration, paper wings). However, it remains more label than enacted constraint; removing the phrase would not break the logic of rebuilding and preservation. Two gates (setup as mantra, payoff in final projection) met; middle development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The monthly molt is vividly described in the opening and frames Lark's self-conception ("birth, ache, reinvention"). The new skin "still trembles, half-formed" and the old self is burned, but the molt does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost—Lark acts the same whether molting or not. Setup strong; middle and closure participation are atmospheric rather than tactical. Cap at 4.6 for missing clear middle development and closure causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Rebuild" appears as a command on a fallen page, seeds the action, and drives the spiral reading nest construction and the entire collaboration with Marin. The Rourke confrontation hinges on showing "rebuilt shelves" and "impossible order." The final image projects rebuilding wider. Three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the action is indispensable to the narrative arc. Swapping "rebuild" for a near-synonym (e.g., "repair") would weaken specificity but not break the story, preventing a 9+ score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The friendship is seeded in the Neruda flashback ("fingers brushed," "tasting the bones, not the marrow"), enables the present collaboration (Marin's willingness to risk her job), and pays off in shared ritual and future projection. Setup and development are present; closure participation is collaborative rather than individually causal. The friendship constrains Lark's isolation and Marin's compliance, though the mechanics of their bond remain somewhat asserted rather than tested under competing pressure. Two strong gates plus thematic payoff place it in the 6.5–7.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted library shapes every beat: the buckled roof provides cover, the stove enables the burning ritual, the warped shelves are dragged into a spiral, the roof holes let moonlight and voices rise. Spatial constraints drive tactics (hiding the tin, lodging cranes in dictionaries) and the final image ("too bright for iron walls to hold"). All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure charge; the setting is indispensable. Minor swappability (another decaying building could serve) and the fact that some description is atmospheric rather than tactical prevent a 9+ score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The moon clearing the skyline frames the opening and returns at closure ("moon now high rinses the rusted beams silver"), creating a lyric bracket. The molt happens "every thirty nights" and "tonight" marks this cycle. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no visible clock pressures the Rourke confrontation or the ritual. Two gates (setup, payoff) met via resonance; middle development is absent. The reprise reweights the opening image but does not alter tactics, placing it in mid-5s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Beauty from anarchy" is Lark's stated mantra, dramatized through the stove ritual (burning failures to fuel creation) and the spiral nest. It drives the collaboration with Marin and the confrontation with Rourke (framing preservation as program value). The motivation shapes two beats and informs closure projection, but friction between want and cost is muted—Lark and Marin face little on-page trade-off for their defiance. Three gates met with moderate causal pressure; the motivation is functional but not sharply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" describes the green flames and operates as a tonal anchor—beauty emerging from brokenness, light through cracks. Tone modulates subtly: the opening molt is private and aching, the collaboration warms, the Rourke beat tenses, the ending opens into projection. The final image ("too bright for iron walls") charges the tone into transformation. Coherent through turns with closure linkage; the tone is purposeful and specific, though not indispensable—a similar arc could be told in a different register with minor edits.</comment>
