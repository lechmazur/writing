<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carpenter's interiority is grounded in concrete sensory memory (sandpaper rasp, brass warmth) and his central motivation—interpreting silence as possibility—shapes the search credibly. However, his character remains somewhat static; the discovery scene feels contemplative rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final walk away reads as symbolic closure but lacks a visible on-page choice that forecloses a prior path with felt cost, capping the score below high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory density and symbolic recurrence (carousel horses, halo fragment, silence-as-music) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration when the carpenter internalizes the fragment's promise and walks forward with "a new silence—full, round, and singing." Cost is legible but oblique: he leaves the train without looking back, embodying the shift from repair to interpretation. Orientation is delayed (no clear "who" anchor until paragraph 3), but the disorientation serves the lyric mood and does not obscure the closure image, so the Orientation Test penalty is waived.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and purposeful: the overturned car with vines, the shallow pool mirroring sky, and the rusted train carriages all charge the final image and constrain the carpenter's movement. The micro-setting (the pool as a stage for the halo fragment) directly enables the climactic moment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the circus-train environment recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate test partially but not fully—no single environmental constraint forces a tactical choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (the search for the halo fragment to "interpret silence as possibility") is signaled early and drives the middle section. The discovery tightens when his fingertips touch the fragment and it lifts, projecting the trapeze artist's shadow—one meaningful deepening that reweights his relationship to silence. However, the escalation lacks a second turn or visible trade-off; the carpenter's agency at closure is acceptance rather than decision, and no live option is foreclosed on the page with unmistakable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—silence as unopened possibility, not absence—emerges organically from the carousel work, the fragment's projection, and the carpenter's interior "singing" without voice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: his footfalls leave "carousel notes," reweighting prior material (the horses, the sandpaper rasp) without stating a moral. The final image of rails "stretching toward every town that had ever quieted itself for wonder" deepens the thematic question credibly, though the trapeze-artist shadow and the "whispering gleam" verge on overt symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a consistent perceptual signature: the carpenter notices "the memory of gears," "the ghost of his sanding hands," sensory anchors tied to his trade. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("rasp of sandpaper descending a flank"). However, elevated register in some beats ("the arc she had begun years ago, her landing as soft as the carpenter's first kiss on the cherry wood") pulls slightly away from the established idiom, and there is minor psychic-distance drift when describing the trapeze artist's experience without clear filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose density is high and figurative language is purposeful in most beats, but several lines exhibit overwriting: "the chime of wind bells, time itself seemed to pause, each metallic note a soft punctuation in the breath between seconds" stacks metaphors without clear payoff, and "a whispering gleam that could teach the mute to sing and the deaf to dream in color" mixes registers. Paraphrase loops appear ("the halo fragment dissolved into the final chord, a whispering gleam that sank into his chest, not as power but as promise" and the prior sentence both restate the fragment's internalization). Filter-verb stacks ("he heard them breathe") and template cadence in the final third ("He walked back… He kept walking… He did not look back") dull momentum. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: −0.6 for template cadence and filter stacks, −0.3 for figurative muddle in peak beats, total −0.9 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of circus-train decay, carousel craft, and silence-as-music feels specific and non-obvious, and the "wrong turn leads to hidden oasis" frame transforms a familiar motif through the carpenter's tactile memory. However, the halo fragment as mystical object and the trapeze artist's unfinished arc echo familiar templates (magical realism, redemptive relic). The piece commits fully to its premise and the final image (footfalls leaving carousel notes) is memorable, but the central conceit—"silence is not absence but an unopened mouth"—verges on abstract philosophizing rather than grounded transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The silent carousel carpenter is present throughout and his trade-specific memories (sandpaper, brass pole, carved manes) anchor multiple beats. His decision to search for the fragment drives the opening third, and his realization that "the halo did not grant voice, but revealed the melodies already nested in silence" reweights his understanding at closure. However, his choices remain largely passive observation; the fragment lifts "of its own accord," and his final action (walking forward without looking back) is symbolic rather than a tactical choice under pressure. Setup gate met, development present but light, payoff participation clear. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but causal pressure is modest +0.5, swappability moderate −0.4. Total: 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, round to 5.5. Adjusting for lyric-resonance payoff (the carpenter's internal arc completes the trapeze artist's arc) +0.7 within band. Final: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in setup (rumor paragraph 6), is discovered and handled in the pool scene (paragraphs 12–15), projects the trapeze artist (paragraph 15), and dissolves into the carpenter's chest (paragraph 21), shaping the ending. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (it reveals rather than grants voice) +0.8, closure linkage (dissolves into final chord) +1.2, specificity (moth-wing curve, comma shape) +0.5. Total: 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5. Swappability check: the fragment's unique properties (projection, dissolution) matter, but late-breaking rule (it can project and dissolve) introduced only when used, −0.3. Cameo in final paragraph (train glows "a halo of its own") adds lyric reprise +0.6 within band. Final: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Misting hush is present in the opening line ("a sky of misting hush"), recurs when the carpenter kneels (paragraph 13), and lifts "like a curtain after the last bow" (paragraph 22). Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, but causal pressure is low: the hush does not constrain tactics or choices, it provides atmosphere. Closure linkage moderate: the lifting of the hush signals completion but does not reweight stakes +0.6. Swappability high: "fog," "mist," "quiet" could replace with minor edits −0.6. Total: 3.0 + 1.4 = 4.4. Lyric-resonance allowance: the early-seed → final-reprise reweights the mood at closure +1.0 within band. Final: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Quietly persistent appears as descriptor (paragraph 4: "the quiet persistence of a man") and as label for the train's glow (paragraph 24: "quietly persistent"). The trait shapes the carpenter's decades of oiling horses that never galloped and drives his search despite disbelief, enabling the middle action. Setup +0.4, one beat (the search itself) +0.4, causal pressure modest (it explains motivation but does not constrain a choice under stress) +0.4, closure linkage (train glows "quietly persistent") +0.8, but label-only in final mention −0.3. Total: 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7. Lyric payoff (the trait transfers to the train) +1.3 within band. Final: 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sing appears as rumor (paragraph 6: "teach the mute to sing"), as realization (paragraph 16: "did not grant voice, but revealed the melodies"), and as the carpenter's memory-song (paragraph 17: "So he sang, not with mouth, but with memory"). Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure high (the act of singing-via-memory completes the trapeze artist's arc and enables the fragment's dissolution) +1.2, closure linkage strong (final silence is "full, round, and singing") +1.4. Specificity moderate: the memory-as-music method is particular +0.5. Total: 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0. Minor swappability (another creative act could serve similarly) −0.3. Cameo in final line adds lyric charge +0.4 within band. Final: 7.1, round to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>A wrong turn at the shattered mirror carriage (paragraph 9) leads to the hidden oasis (overturned car, paragraph 10). The method is signaled, executed once in middle, and echoed at closure (paragraph 24: "took a wrong turn on purpose"). Setup +0.5, two beats (mirror carriage, final purposeful turn) +0.9, causal pressure moderate (the wrong turn enables discovery but does not shape attempts or constrain later tactics) +0.6, closure linkage (he takes another wrong turn, reweighting the method as deliberate exploration) +1.0. Swappability moderate: the "wrong turn" could be replaced with "hidden passage" or "chance discovery" with minor edits −0.5. Total: 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5. Lyric-resonance payoff (purposeful turn at end) +0.9 within band. Final: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is present throughout, from opening line to final glow. Setup immediate +0.8, multiple beats (velvet curtain, mirror carriage, overturned car, wind bells, horses) +1.4, causal pressure high (the train's layout and the pool within the car enable the discovery and shape the carpenter's path) +1.3, closure linkage strong (train begins to glow, "waiting for the next singer") +1.5, specificity high (circus details: carousel horses, lion tamer's curtain, trapeze) +0.7. Total: 3.0 + 5.7 = 8.7. Minor swappability (another abandoned venue could serve) −0.3. Micro-setting (pool, vines) charges final image +0.5 within band. Final: 7.9, round to 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Inside the chime of wind bells (paragraph 2) frames time as suspended ("time itself seemed to pause"). Wind bells recur when the carpenter kneels (paragraph 13: "muffled… into a lullaby") and cease at closure (paragraph 22). Setup +0.4, two beats +0.9, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics; it provides lyric atmosphere without pressure +0.2. Closure linkage moderate (cessation signals completion) +0.6. Swappability high: "twilight," "suspended moment," "stillness" could replace −0.6. Total: 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5. Lyric reprise adds mood charge +0.3 within band. Final: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To interpret silence as possibility is stated (paragraph 8) and drives the carpenter's search despite disbelief ("He believed none of it, yet the need…"). The motivation is dramatized in the discovery beat when he realizes the halo reveals existing melodies (paragraph 16), and recurs at closure (paragraph 27: "interpreting the hush ahead as possibility"). Setup +0.6, two beats (search, realization) +0.9, causal pressure moderate (it explains the search but does not create friction between wants and costs on the page) +0.6, closure linkage strong (final line echoes the phrase) +1.2. Label-only in final mention −0.3. Total: 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0. Lyric payoff (the carpenter embodies the motivation at closure) +0.7 within band. Final: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Whispering gleam appears as descriptor for the halo fragment (paragraph 6), recurs when the fragment projects (paragraph 15), dissolves (paragraph 21: "whispering gleam that sank into his chest"), and charges the train's final glow (paragraph 24: "glowing faintly, a halo of its own"). Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, tone coherence high (the gleam modulates from rumor to internalization to external echo) +0.8, closure linkage (train glows, final silence is "singing") +1.0. Specificity moderate +0.4. Total: 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1. Label-only in some mentions (the phrase is repeated without fresh sensory detail) −0.3. Lyric reprise reweights tone at closure +0.5 within band, but decorative use in middle beats −0.3. Net: 7.1 − 0.6 + 0.5 = 7.0, but round to nearest 0.1: 6.3 after applying dominant limiter rule (decorative use is strongest friction). Final: 6.3.</comment>
