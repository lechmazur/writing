<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and sustained—collecting hush to counter a prophecy—but interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor ("terrestrially cosmic," "negative shore where sound had never landed") rather than embodied contradiction. The swallowing of the sphere offers a concrete choice with cost, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains abstract; we see no genuine struggle between competing impulses, only a series of ritual actions. Emotional states are described through cosmic imagery rather than visceral embodiment, and the final smile feels declarative rather than earned through prior friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the summoner maps silence, cranes multiply, and the sphere is swallowed, culminating in a world freed of encoded prophecy. Orientation is delayed—"who" anchors by line 6, "where" (brook) immediately, but "what is at stake" clarifies only around the prophecy mention (line 5). The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the summoner accepts the weight, villages wake free), but the cost is more asserted than dramatized: we are told he carries the sphere and walks on, yet no concrete price—lost ability, physical toll, or foreclosed path—is shown on the page. The causal link between swallowing the sphere and the prophecy's defeat is metaphorically rich but mechanically vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook is vividly rendered with selective detail—moonlight glazing water, cold gripping ankles, reeds and wind—and it constrains the summoner's ritual by providing the medium for the cranes. The micro-setting (water, paper, body) charges the final image when the crane lifts into dawn. Sensory selection reflects the summoner's priorities (silence, flow, reflections), and spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not guide a choice under pressure in the middle, but it anchors both the opening ritual and the closure reprise, pushing into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the cranes' multiplication and the prophecy's counter-drumbeat, and the summoner's swallowing of the sphere is an act of agency with stated cost. However, the escalation is more textural than causal: the drumbeat "arrives" and then "falters" without a clear because/therefore link to the summoner's specific actions. No live option is visibly foreclosed; the summoner completes the ritual and walks away, but we do not see what he sacrificed or lost beyond the abstract "weight" he accepts. One meaningful tightening (the drumbeat forcing the inverse word) is present, but the cost remains more told than shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—tranquility as mastery of fire, the cost of carrying silence—emerges from image and action rather than statement, and the final image (crane lifting into dawn, smile planted in morning) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The recurring motifs (cranes, hush, tranquil blaze, terrestrially cosmic) reweight across beats. However, "tranquil blaze" and "terrestrially cosmic" are repeated as phrases rather than concepts that deepen; they function more as atmospheric tags than particulars that constrain choice. The piece invites reflection but leans toward lyricism over the specific cost-laden particulars that would push theme into the 8s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature is consistent (cosmic metaphor, silence as substrate). However, the diction drifts into elevated register that sits oddly with the earthy ritual: "terrestrially cosmic," "murmuration of quiet," "tessellating into a single sphere of smoothed hush" read as authorial rather than character-bound. Under peak stress (swallowing the sphere), the prose maintains the same ornate texture instead of compressing or intensifying. The voice is distinctive but not character-particular; it feels like a narrator describing the summoner rather than the summoner's own mind. Psychic distance remains uniform, missing the modulation that would ground high emotion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically varied and imagistically dense, but overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence deploys figurative language ("galaxy made of absences," "mouth of anti-sound," "gate slamming on sentences that had never been born"), obscuring causal clarity. Mixed metaphors appear (cranes as galaxy, sphere as throat, prophecy as drumbeat/code/stone coated in honey) without coherent physical logic. Paraphrase loops are present: lines 5–6 restate the prophecy's danger, and the final paragraphs cycle through variations of "walked on" and "smiled." Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "He [verb]" in the closure section. These artifacts touch the ending, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is high, but clarity suffers under the metaphoric load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—a summoner who collects silence and folds it into cranes to counter a spoken prophecy—offers a fresh synthesis of folklore and metaphor. The specific inverse word (".") and the swallowing of the sphere are non-obvious turns. However, the emotional arc and plot structure (lone hero performs ritual, defeats abstract threat, walks away) follow a familiar template, and the cosmic diction risks slipping into generic mysticism. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids safety-middle hedging, but the transformation is more atmospheric than grounded in lived detail or surprising moral calculus. Within the 6-band, the boldness of the imagery and the lyric coherence justify the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The solitary summoner drives every beat: kneeling, unfolding the wing, mapping silence, stepping into the brook, speaking the inverse word, swallowing the sphere, and walking away. His choices—especially swallowing the sphere—are the causal spine. Setup is immediate (line 1), development spans the middle (mapping, speaking), and payoff anchors the closure (he accepts the weight and walks on). The character is present in three or more beats with visible cost (carrying the sphere). However, the final choice feels more ritual completion than a decision that forecloses a path, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The origami wing appears in beat one (unfolded, pulse matching the brook), beat two (pressed to sternum, set on water), and returns transformed (cranes multiply, tessellate into sphere). It enables the ritual and is swallowed, directly shaping the closure. Setup is early, development is active (the wing becomes vessel, then many cranes), and payoff is clear (sphere swallowed, final crane released). The wing's properties (paper, pulse, capacity to fold/unfold) matter and are irreplaceable. Two distinct beats plus closure participation and causal pressure push this into the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is named in line 1 and recurs as a motif (line 9 "collecting hush," line 24 "tessellating into a single sphere of smoothed hush," line 33 "every smoothed hush still murmurs"). It frames the summoner's goal and method, and the final payoff (villages wake to birdsong free of code) demonstrates that the hush succeeded. However, the concept is more thematic atmosphere than a tactic-shaping constraint; the summoner's actions are described in hush-related metaphor, but we do not see how "smoothed" differs from "rough" or what cost the smoothness imposes. Present in setup, middle echo, and closure, but ornamental rather than mechanically decisive. Lyric reprise justifies mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears in lines 2, 14, 34, and 42, always as a descriptor (moonlight, sigil, the summoner himself, the crane). It labels a duality but never constrains or enables an on-page action. The summoner is "both terrestrially grounded and cosmically adrift" (line 28), yet this state does not force a choice or impose a visible cost. The attribute is ornamental, repeated for atmospheric resonance without mechanical integration. Late arrivals (line 14 onward) and swappability (could be "earthly and celestial" with no plot change) cap the score under 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Flow" governs the entire piece: the brook's flow (line 1, "low flow" line 3), water flowing around the summoner (line 22), the summoner following the flow downhill (line 31, 36, 43), and the final image of the brook singing (line 44). Flow is both setting and method, shaping the ritual (set the wing on water, step into brook) and the closure (he follows downstream). Setup is immediate, development involves wading and following, payoff is clear (the flow maps silence better than any tongue). However, "flow" is fungible—another natural process (wind, growth, decay) could serve a similar structural role with minor edits. Two beats plus closure linkage justify mid-6s, but swappability and thematic rather than causal work prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is named in line 4 ("he must map silence itself") and enacted in lines 10–13 ("began mapping silence, starting with the space between heartbeats… charted the hush behind owl wings"). The method shapes the middle beats (the sigil forms from these coordinates) and is reprised in line 36 ("mapping silence with every footfall") and line 43 ("flow that maps silence better than any tongue"). However, the mechanics remain metaphorical; we do not see how mapping differs from simply collecting or why coordinates matter. Present in setup, development, and closure echo, but the method is more poetic texture than a tactic whose specifics alter outcome. Lyric development justifies mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook anchors every beat: the summoner kneels beside it (line 1), sets the wing on the water (line 9), steps into the brook (line 20), and the water carries syllables and polishes prophecy (lines 22, 37). The cold gripping his ankles is embodied (line 20), and the brook's flow provides the medium for the cranes to multiply and the ritual to complete. Setup is immediate, development involves physical engagement (wading, offering), and payoff is strong (the brook resumes its narrative, the summoner follows it downstream). The micro-setting (water, reeds, moonlight) constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Three or more beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" (line 4, "whispered secrets exchanged between reeds and wind"; line 43, "whispered secrets now harmless as dew") frames the story's opening and closure but does not function as a ticking clock. Time passes (night to sunrise to morning, lines 29–44), but the timeframe is atmospheric rather than a constraint that tightens decisions. The summoner has leisure to map, fold, wade, sit until sunrise, and walk without urgency. Setup and payoff are present (whispered secrets bookend the piece), but no middle pressure or tactical alteration. Functional but replaceable, ornamental bookend caps the score near 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to hush the prophecy is established early (lines 4–5, "hush a prophecy spoken in code" that "cracked his master's mind open") and drives every action: collecting hush (line 6), folding cranes (line 6), mapping silence (line 10), speaking the inverse word (line 24), swallowing the sphere (line 26). The prophecy fights back (line 18, drumbeat in cricket legs), creating friction, and the closure demonstrates success (villages wake free of code, line 38). Setup, development (multiple beats of active pursuit), and payoff all present. The desire is dramatized through choices and physical acts with visible cost (he carries the sphere inside, a private galaxy, line 39). Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity push this into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears in lines 5 ("burning villages in their tranquil blaze"), 19 ("turning tranquil blaze into menace"), 29 ("tranquil blaze of moonlight"), 40 ("tranquility is not the absence of fire but the mastery of its blaze"), and 42 ("turning tranquil blaze into birth of color"). The oxymoron anchors the piece's paradox (quiet danger, mastered intensity) and modulates with pressure: villages burn, menace rises, moonlight steams, mastery is articulated, birth concludes. The tone is consistent and charges the final image (crane in first light as tranquil blaze becomes color). Setup, development across multiple beats, and payoff all present. The phrase's recurrence reweights meaning from threat to mastery to birth, demonstrating purposeful tonal arc. Specificity and closure linkage justify mid-to-high 6s.</comment>
