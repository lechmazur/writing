<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guard's motivation is consistent—cultivating sparks in unlit corners—and his actions align with that charge. However, interiority remains abstract: "dreamless" functions as a label rather than dramatized constraint, and emotional states are described through metaphor ("pulse steady") rather than embodied contradiction. The transition from performing a ritual to stepping away reads more as completion of duty than a choice with visible internal cost. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, planting the clock) but lack competing impulses that would raise the stakes of renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (frozen clock, archive, wave functions) and pays it off through density increase and charged imagery at closure. Orientation anchors arrive by the opening line (guard, dune, post-forest timeframe). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the guard plants the clock, the sparks transfer to pollen children, and the final image reweights the archive motif with conceptual cost (lullabies persist, cargo travels by wave). One meaningful deepening occurs when the clock's hands split and the strongbox sheets fly out, narrowing the guard's task to a single ritual act. Cost is legible in the transfer of light and the guard's lighter coat, though the cost reads more conceptual (duty completed, sparks handed off) than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing dune supplies the closure arena: phosphorescent poppies, glassy sand, and buried rails anchor spatial logic. The chess clock strapped to the guard's heart and the strongbox half-buried in light constrain the ritual sequence. The final image—clock buried, poppies dimmed, light transferred—charges the ending. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (petals flickering like defective film frames, scorched lock as screaming mouth), filtered through the guard's professional lens. However, the guard's body and tactile interaction remain abstract; no sweat, breath, or physical strain accompanies the ritual, which at this length could deepen immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: cultivate the sparks so lost cargo (children's dreams/lullabies) can travel again. The stake is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pollen children breathe in the sparks and the guard recognizes his directive is complete. Agency reads as ritual execution rather than decision under competing pressure; the guard performs without hesitation or tradeoff. The cost—coat lighter, sparks transferred—is visible but muted; no live option is foreclosed, and the resolution feels predetermined by the guard's training rather than a choice that narrows his future. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through density and charged imagery, meeting the sufficient standard for this length, though higher bands require a felt price that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the archive/lullaby/wave-function motif: persistence of memory and song beyond destruction. The final image—lullaby traveling "occasionally everywhere, through wave functions and frozen midnights"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the guard's ritual silence, the children made of pollen, and the clock's divergent time. The closing line "what burns never truly sleeps, what sings never truly ends" risks thematic echo but stays within the established lyric register and reweights the opening's "divergent archive" with earned weight. The piece resists tidy resolution; the forest remains gone, the children spectral, yet the charge persists.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled throughout. Voice carries a distinct lyric-archival texture: "divergent archive of all the hours," "wave functions, probability clouds," "fractured lullaby." Perceptual signature is consistent—scientific metaphor layered over mourning ritual. Diction remains elevated and purposeful, matching the guard's trained detachment. No dialogue appears; internal access is sparse but coherent. Psychic distance stays consistent; the narrator knows only what the guard perceives and infers. Purposeful compression (elliptical phrasing, fragment-like clauses) is taught early and sustained, avoiding mid-beat opacity. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") appear but serve the meditative rhythm rather than dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but template cadence emerges in several beats: "The rails beneath... were memory only," "The hands pulled him upslope," "The guard understood," "He planted the clock there." Figurative density is high throughout (ember, phosphorescent poppies, wave functions, defective film frames, screaming mouth, paper lanterns) without clear escalation or pattern break; in high-pressure beats this risks ornamental accumulation rather than propulsion. Information density is strong—most lines advance atmosphere or concept—but some phrases loop conceptually: "dreams had burned" / "throats are gone" restates loss without added cost. Clarity remains high; no mixed metaphors or pronoun confusion. The final third sustains the lyric register without artifact intrusion, keeping closure legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of freight-guard duty, quantum mechanics metaphor (wave functions, probability clouds), and post-apocalyptic ritual is specific and non-obvious. The chess clock as a dual-time archive and the strongbox of unfinished lullabies offer fresh inflections on memory-preservation tropes. Emotional truth—mourning children, duty as grief ritual—grounds the speculative frame. However, the guard's passive execution and the predetermined success of the ritual limit bold risk; no moment threatens failure or forces an improvised choice. The piece commits fully to its lyric-archive premise and follows implications without retreat, earning solidity in the 7-band. Transformation test: swapping "freight guard" for "archivist" or "conductor" would require only minor edits, suggesting the occupational detail is illustrative rather than irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dreamless freight guard is present throughout and drives all beats: carrying the clock, listening for cargo, speaking names, being pulled upslope, planting the clock, walking downslope. Setup is immediate (opening line). Middle beats: he responds to the hands, opens the strongbox, sings the charm slower, lifts and plants the clock. Closure: he steps back, job finished, and walks away with lighter coat. His choices are ritual adherence rather than decisions under competing pressure; he does not hesitate or improvise. Cost is visible (lighter coat, sparks transferred) but the guard's training predetermines his actions, reducing causal agency. Two-gate (setup + closure) with strong beat involvement but limited decision friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chess clock appears in the opening line (frozen at midnight), is carried and wound daily (beat 1), strapped against the guard's heart (beat 2), trembles in resonance with the strongbox pages (beat 3), is pressed between strongbox and sand (beat 4), splits midnight into two living seconds (beat 5), is planted face-down (beat 6), and remains buried at the end, hands moving divergently (closure). Setup, development across multiple beats, and closure participation are all present. The clock's frozen/split state enables the final ritual and charges the ending image. Irreplaceability is high—no other timekeeping device carries the dual-face, frozen-at-midnight, divergent-time logic. Visible cost: the clock is buried, no longer carried. Strong integration across all three gates with clear causal and symbolic work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "divergent archive" is named in the opening (the clock as archive of lost hours) and returns when the strongbox is also labeled "divergent" (a parallel vault that slid sideways). The concept shapes the guard's understanding and frames the ritual: archives that preserve what was lost. It constrains the guard's tactic—he must unite the two archives (clock and strongbox) to release the sparks. Closure: the lullaby travels "by wave, by song, by fractured lullaby," fulfilling the archive's preservation function. Setup and closure are clear; middle development is present but the concept functions more as thematic frame than a mechanical constraint that alters tactics under pressure. Two strong gates plus thematic coherence, but the "divergent" property does not visibly narrow options or impose a felt cost distinct from the ritual itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere" appears three times: the guard feels phantom boxcars "occasionally everywhere along the vanished line" (beat 2), conductors feel a warm pulse "occasionally everywhere along the dead tracks" (penultimate paragraph), and the lullaby travels "occasionally everywhere" (final line). Setup is in the first third. The phrase reweights in closure, shifting from the guard's solitary sensation to a shared proof of cargo's continued travel. However, the attribute does not constrain an on-page choice or enable a specific tactic; it functions as atmospheric descriptor and thematic echo. Lyric reprise across early, middle, and final beats with clear thematic charge, but no visible cost or decision friction tied to the phrase itself. Three-touch presence with closure participation, but ornamental integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The charm—speaking the children's names as a fractured lullaby—appears in beat 2 ("Lina, Taro, Saa, Kiv"), is repeated slower in beat 4 ("this time singing the names through wave functions"), and the final directive is "cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" with the lullaby shown traveling at closure. Setup, middle repetition, and closure linkage are present. The charm enables the pollen children to brighten and breathe in the sparks, directly causing the resolution. However, the charm succeeds without friction or adaptation; the guard performs it as trained, and the second iteration (slower, sung through wave functions) is a refinement rather than a response to failure. Strong causal role across beats and indispensable to closure, but swappable in method (any repeated invocation could function similarly). Cost is implicit in the ritual's completion but not dramatized as a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through wave functions" is introduced in beat 3 ("names arrived through wave functions, probability clouds condensing into small warm hands") and returns in beat 4 ("singing the names through wave functions so the particles of ash still drifting could remember being leaves"). Setup occurs past the first third (near midpoint). The method enables the charm to work—particles collapse into pollen children—but the mechanics are not clearly signaled before use, and the guard does not choose this method over an alternative. At closure, the lullaby travels "through wave functions," confirming the method's persistence. Two beats plus closure mention, but the method arrives late, is not contrasted with other options, and does not visibly constrain or complicate the guard's actions. Functional presence with thematic coherence, but replaceable with similar metaphysical mechanisms.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glowing dune in bloom is established in the opening paragraph (phosphorescent poppies, glassy sand) and supplies the ritual arena throughout. The guard sets the clock down on the dune (beat 1), is pulled upslope where blooms grow brighter (beat 2), finds the strongbox half-buried in light (beat 3), kneels and presses the clock between strongbox and sand (beat 4), and the poppies dim as their light transfers at closure (beat 5). Setup, multiple middle beats, and closure participation are present. The dune's blooming state enables the pollen children to form and charges the final image. The glowing property is essential—static sand would not supply the light-transfer mechanic. Strong irreplaceability and closure linkage. Visible cost: the dune goes dark when the sparks are transferred.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last forest burns" is signaled in the opening ("the forest that had burned three nights ago," "since the final tree fell") and shapes the guard's entire mission: he carries the archive of lost hours and cultivates sparks to replace what burned. The post-fire condition constrains his work—no canopy, no throats, only ash and spectral children. Closure: the lullaby persists despite the burn, and the forest's time ticks backward while the children's ticks forward. Setup is immediate, and the timeframe's pressure is felt throughout (the guard works in a world already lost). However, the "three nights ago" anchor does not create a ticking-clock urgency or force time-constrained choices; the ritual proceeds at the guard's pace. Strong thematic integration and closure linkage, but the timeframe functions as backdrop rather than active constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" is stated explicitly near the end ("the final directive scrawled on every vanished manifest") and retrospectively explains all prior actions: carrying the clock, speaking names, planting the clock between strongbox and sand. Setup is late (final third), though the guard's actions implicitly pursue this goal from the start. The motivation drives the climactic beat (planting the clock, sparks flying out, children lighting up) and the resolution (guard steps back, job finished). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized as a conflicted choice; the guard never hesitates or weighs competing desires. No friction between want and cost; duty is seamless. Strong causal role and closure linkage, but late explicit signal and absence of internal conflict lower the score. Visible cost: the guard transfers the sparks and walks away lighter, but this reads as completion rather than sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone "fractured lullaby" is established in the opening paragraph ("winding it each dawn though the hands never moved") and reinforced through "fractured lullaby" as a phrase in beat 2, the strongbox of unfinished lullabies (beat 3), and the guard singing the charm (beat 4). Tone is consistently elegiac, meditative, and lyric-archival throughout. Modulation occurs subtly: the opening is mournful and static, middle beats intensify with the hands trembling and pages turning, and closure shifts to quiet persistence ("the lullaby kept traveling"). The final image charges the tone with earned weight: "what burns never truly sleeps, what sings never truly ends." Coherence is strong, and the tone supports pressure by layering mourning with ritual steadiness. Setup immediate, development across beats, closure participation clear. High tonal specificity and rhythmic control under the accumulative lens.</comment>
