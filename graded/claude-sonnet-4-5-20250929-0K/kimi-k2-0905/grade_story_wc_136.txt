<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alden's internal contradictions are present—precision vs. painting, mapping routes nobody rides to avoid hearing his own heart—and embodied through his obsessive redrawing. The confession sequence ("I left because I was afraid of color") dramatizes internal conflict under pressure. However, the pivot from analytic mapper to confessing artist feels rushed; the middle段 leans heavily on symbolic narration rather than micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority occasionally slips into label-speak ("trembling certainty," "analytically artistic mind") without always grounding emotion in specific sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (rail yard, 3:07 a.m., Alden's role). The piece accumulates pressure through recurring motifs—punch, arrows, starlit vault—that reweight at closure when the fortress becomes stacked journals and the punch dissolves into paint. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Alden draws "the first honest line," reweighting his obsessive mapping into arrival rather than escape. Cost is conceptual and felt (years of silence, canvases turned to wall) but the final image could make the price more visceral. One meaningful deepening present; causality is metaphoric but coherent under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rail yard, tunnel, and phantom punch anchor the single continuous scene. The punch functions as micro-setting: it constrains Alden's path (arrows glow, punch clacks, validating his movement) and charges the final image when it dissolves into ultramarine paint. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—cedar-smelling mist, wan gold cracks, observatory roof—filtered through Alden's artistic perception. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the tunnel journey. The environment subtly mirrors internal state (fortress of stacked journals, canvases turned to wall) without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Alden came "hoping to quit his obsessive redrawing" but instead confronts unspoken truths. The dare escalates through symbolic intensification—lies flutter out, larger silences appear, the fortress materializes—culminating in his choice to punch his own chest and speak. Agency is decision and renunciation: each confession lights a compartment and heals arrows, foreclosing his escape-route habit with visible cost (the fortress folds into a blank canvas, the tunnel seals). Accumulative pressure coheres; the tightening is one meaningful deepening that narrows his options to "Speak or be spoken for." Cost is legible in the final image: he walks home "carrying nothing but the trembling certainty."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of unspoken truths and the courage to voice them—emerges through particulars: phantom punch, stacked journals, canvases turned to wall, confession lighting compartments. The final image (dipping finger into ultramarine sigil, drawing "the first honest line") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the recurring motifs (punch as missing stylus, fortress as accumulated silence) that shift meaning at closure. No thematic echo; the piece resists platitudes. The transformation from "mapping escape routes" to "mapping arrival" is earned by prior accumulation and reweights the premise cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV maintained; narrative distance is stable third-limited with psychic closeness. Perceptual signature is present—Alden notices cracks, sigils, arrows—filtered through his "analytically artistic mind." Diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("starlit vault in mist," "fortress of unspoken truths") that tensions against the character's grounded profession but remains voice-motivated and legible under accumulative design. No dialogue on the page. Purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (starlit vault, cracks forming arrows) are taught early and pay off at closure. One slip: "analytically artistic" reads slightly diagnostic rather than embodied, and some figurative phrases recur without full reweighting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose carries vivid images ("cedar-smelling mist," "tickets only the dead still carried"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. However, several phrases recur with only slight variation—"starlit vault in mist," "cracks in pavement forming arrows," "phantom train ticket punch," "trembling certainty"—creating a template cadence across the piece. The repetition is pattern-taught and thematic but borders on loop in peak beats (midpoint confession sequence). Minor filter-verb stacks ("He saw," "He realized") dull immediacy in places. No causality break, so artifact penalty remains in Q7 only: −0.6 for template cadence and phrase recycling across multiple paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—phantom ticket punch guiding a mapper through a tunnel of unspoken truths—synthesizes familiar motifs (journey into self, symbolic objects) with specific grounding: route mapper, observatory roof, ultramarine paint. The transformation from precision tool to artistic medium is purposeful and earned in hindsight. The final image (drawing with the sigil on his chest) feels inevitable given prior accumulation. Risk is present in the heavily symbolic design and compression, which heightens stakes without obscuring clarity under the accumulative lens. One friction: the tunnel-of-truths conceit echoes common therapeutic-journey templates; the specific details (journals, canvases, voicemail boxes) elevate but don't fully transform the core frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alden is present throughout; his role as meticulous route mapper frames the opening and is reweighted at closure ("no longer mapping escape routes but mapping arrival"). His choices—lifting the punch, following arrows, confessing, drawing the first line—create key turns. Two frictions: his profession is established but never constrains a middle choice with visible cost (he follows symbols rather than using mapping skills), and the final turn feels more thematic than tactically grounded in his mapper identity. Swappability: another obsessive profession could serve similarly with minor edits. Early setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, but swappability −0.6 and no middle constraint tied to mapping skill −0.4. Start 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8, round down 5.8 → 5.7, but lyric reprising of "mapping" at closure adds resonance +0.5 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phantom train ticket punch appears early (bench beside charts), is handled and used across multiple beats (lifting it, following its pulse, each clack notching air and punching holes in memories, punching his own chest at climax), and dissolves into paint at closure with reweighted meaning (revealed as his missing stylus, the tool he lost choosing precision over painting). Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (four distinct) +1.4, causal pressure (guides path, releases confessions) +1.2, closure linkage (dissolves into paint that charges final image) +1.5, specificity (unique embossed sigil, warm pulse) +0.6. Start 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4, round down 8.4. No friction; the object is indispensable and its transformation is earned. Final 8.4, but strong irreplaceability nudge +0.4 (the exact sigil Alden sketched in dreams, the stylus he lost) brings 8.8, but ceiling for Q9B per rubric is ~8.5 unless fully load-bearing at closure; the punch's dissolution is pivotal but the final *action* is drawing with his finger, so cap conservatively at 7.8 given that last beat shifts agency slightly away from the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core concept "unraveling mysteries" is present thematically—Alden follows clues (glowing arrows, punch validating tickets, memories appearing) and discovers the fortress. However, the mystery-solving itself does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page; Alden is guided by symbols rather than deducing or choosing among investigative paths. The concept echoes as mood but does not shape stakes in the way "mapping" or "confession" do. Setup present +0.4, one beat (following clues) +0.4, but ornamental use (no decision tree or cost tied to mystery-solving method) −0.8, swappability (could be reframed as "confronting truths" without mystery frame) −0.5. Start 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.4 − 1.3 = 2.5, but the tunnel journey does have investigative texture so lift slightly to 4.1 for atmospheric contribution. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development as active constraint).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute "analytically artistic" appears twice as label ("analytically artistic mind," "analytically artistic weight") and is implied in the opening (meticulous mapper vs. unfinished art school, redrawing routes vs. painting). The duality shapes the final turn—Alden draws with paint rather than mapping—but the middle段 does not dramatize a tradeoff where analytic precision costs him artistic expression in a specific choice. Setup (implied in bio) +0.5, closure linkage (final line resolves duality) +1.0, but label-only mentions −0.6, no middle constraint with visible cost −0.5. Start 3.0 + 1.5 − 1.1 = 3.4, but thematic resonance at closure lifts slightly to 5.8. Missing middle development caps at 3.4 per rubric, but lyric reprising of the duality across opening and close qualifies under the allowance, so final 5.8 permitted.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "dare" is named explicitly ("the punch called to him like a dare") and frames the choice at the fortress: "The dare was clear—step aboard... and let the punch validate the final destination: Speak or be spoken for." The dare precipitates Alden's confession sequence and final drawing. Setup (early, second paragraph) +0.6, closure linkage (dare is answered by speaking and drawing) +1.2, causal pressure (the dare forces the choice to confess) +1.0, beat involvement (two: initial dare to lift punch, climactic dare to speak) +0.9. Start 3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7, but swappability friction: the dare could be replaced with "summons" or "challenge" with minor edits −0.3. Final 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method "cracks in pavement forming arrows" appears early (fourth paragraph: "cracks in pavement forming arrows beneath his boots, each fissure glowing"), guides Alden's path through the tunnel ("cracks... widened into glowing ties and rails"), and are healed at closure ("cracks... healed behind him," "cracks... had become mere sidewalk"). Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure (arrows direct his journey, enable confession by providing a path) +1.3, closure linkage (healing signifies transformation, final line notes they are now "mere sidewalk, leading wherever he chose") +1.3, specificity (glowing wan gold, widening into rails) +0.5. Start 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, but the method is more atmospheric guide than active constraint with cost −0.2; the arrows do not force a hard choice, they illuminate one. Final 8.0, but closure reweighting is strong so hold at 7.1 to reflect that the arrows are essential to movement but not to a decision node with felt tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The setting "starlit vault in mist" is named in the opening line and recurs three times, culminating in "the starlit vault in mist where constellations spelled schedules no human tongue could pronounce" and resolving to "the starlit vault in mist condensing into a ceiling he recognized: the observatory roof." The vault functions as both atmosphere and symbolic space that contains the journey and reweights at closure (condensing into the real place where Alden's silence began). Setup +0.7, closure linkage (condenses into observatory roof) +1.4, beat involvement (two: opening frame, tunnel transformation) +0.9, specificity (constellations, cedar mist, throat of mountain) +0.6. Start 3.0 + 3.6 = 6.6, but the vault does not supply a resource or constrain a middle choice with cost −0.3; it is primarily atmospheric container. Lyric reprise across opening and close adds resonance +0.6. Final 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "upon the hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is named twice: 3:07 a.m. at opening and 4:07 a.m. at closure, marking the span of the journey and transformation. The hour frames the before/after but does not tighten decisions on the page; no countdown or urgency derived from the clock itself. Setup +0.6, closure linkage (hour shift signals transformation) +0.9, but no middle pressure or tactic shaped by time −0.6, summary-only (time is told, not felt as constraint) −0.5. Start 3.0 + 0.4 = 3.4, but the symbolic hour-framing does charge the opening and close as a complete cycle +1.9. Final 5.3, capped at 4.6 (missing middle development as live constraint) per rubric; however, the lyric reprise qualifies under the allowance for purposeful early→final reweighting, so 5.3 is permissible.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the fortress of unspoken truths" is named explicitly and drives the journey: Alden's "throat trembled with certainty that the fortress... lay somewhere inside," the fortress materializes as stacked journals and turned canvases, and Alden confronts it by confessing. Setup +0.6, beat involvement (two: anticipation, confrontation) +0.9, causal pressure (desire to reach fortress propels tunnel journey) +1.1, closure linkage (fortress folds into blank canvas, desire resolved) +1.2. Start 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, but one friction: the desire is declared and pursued linearly without internal conflict or competing want −0.1 (no friction between the goal and a cost he resists paying until the dare forces it). Final 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone "trembling certainty" is named twice ("throat trembled with certainty," "Trembling certainty turned to trembling knees," "trembling certainty that every future ticket would be punched") and colors the narration throughout: Alden's dread mixed with resolve, the shaking climb toward revelation, the final acceptance. The tone modulates from initial tremor (dread) to knees-trembling (fear at confrontation) to final certainty (earned resolve). Setup +0.6, closure linkage (final line anchors tone shift) +1.1, beat involvement (three named moments) +1.4, coherence under pressure +0.7. Start 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, but label repetition without always embodying the tremor through syntax or breath −0.5. Final 6.3.</comment>
