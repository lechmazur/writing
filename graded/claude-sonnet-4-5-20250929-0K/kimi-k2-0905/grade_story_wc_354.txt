<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tutor's exile and internal conflict are established, but his interiority remains abstract and label-heavy ("vast, aching absence," "hopeful melancholy"). The worry stone gesture recurs but doesn't reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—it's a static meditation loop. The final choice to "teach the world" lacks on-page cost or concrete stakes; it reads as resolved epiphany rather than earned transformation through dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece oscillates between accumulative/textural (magnetic hum patterns, twilight imagery) and causal (exile → nexus → resolution to teach) without teaching a clear pattern by midpoint. Closure is asserted ("he would teach the world") but occurs off-page with no visible cost or decision that forecloses a path. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when clarify only gradually across the first third. The ending offers conceptual repricing in theme but no legible change in the tutor's options or situation on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vivid and purposeful (compass spin, iron in blood, electromagnetic hum), and the worry stone's dent provides tactile anchor. However, the nexus doesn't constrain a choice—it's backdrop for reflection rather than a pressure that alters tactics. The "three short hums, one long" pattern suggests specificity but leads nowhere causally. Twilight and "invisible geometries" remain atmospheric without shaping the tutor's final stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—correlating silence to find meaning after exile—is signaled early but never tightens into a live choice with trade-offs. No on-page reversal or escalation; the tutor stands, reflects, and resolves without cost. The "eclipsed covenant" backstory (Lord Ashford's political exposure) is told but never tests the tutor in present action. Agency is assertion ("he would teach") rather than decision or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Beauty in difficulty" recurs frequently but as stated theme rather than emerging from particulars—the tutor tells us he taught this lesson rather than enacting a fresh discovery on the page. The ending's "exquisite beauty in its most difficult position" is a thematic echo (−0.5) that replaces scene pressure with summary. The chess/politics metaphor is coherent but remains illustrative rather than resonant; the piece names its question instead of dramatizing a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and controlled, with a distinct elevated register ("liminal place," "transposition into a different phase"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("infinite variables of human consequence") that dilutes the tutor's specific perceptual signature. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he understood") are frequent but voice-motivated. The syntactic rhythm is purposeful, though paragraphs share similar reflective cadence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "silence" is restated across adjacent paragraphs without new pressure (lines 4, 5, 9, 15); "beauty in difficulty" recurs in lines 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 20 as synonym churn. Template cadence appears in stacked "he had" constructions (lines 6, 10, 19). Figurative density is high ("crystalline beauty," "invisible geometries," "seed of a new beginning") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Artifacts touch the final third: apply −1.2 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The exiled-tutor-at-liminal-threshold premise is familiar; the chess-as-metaphor-for-politics frame is well-executed but not freshly inflected. The "eclipsed covenant" backstory offers a specific political consequence, but the nexus visit and silence-correlation remain abstract rather than particular. The ending's promise to "teach the world" reads as generic resolve without a non-obvious synthesis. No bold structural risk; the piece follows a meditative template without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor is present throughout and his past teaching shapes backstory, but he makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or options. He walks to the nexus, reflects, and resolves to teach—all passive observation and internal summary. Setup present, middle development is reflection-only, closure is assertion without choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The worry stone dent appears in lines 2, 7, 10, 16, 18 (five beats), providing tactile anchor. However, its use is static: "fingers worried the stone's dent" recurs without evolving function or reweighted meaning. It constrains no choice and doesn't charge the final image—mentioned in line 18 but not causally active at closure. Setup, development present; closure participation is cameo only. Cap 4.6 for missing closure participation; small lyric reprise lifts to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant (duke's secret agreement) is explained in line 6 as backstory motivating the tutor's exile and mentioned again in line 13 as metaphor, but it never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. It's a told past event, not a present pressure. Setup in backstory only; no middle development or closure participation. Cap 2.8 for missing closure; ornamental use −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is stated in line 10 ("He had been thoughtfully precise in his exile, measuring each day...") but remains label-only. The tutor's precision is told, not shown through a constrained action with cost. No visible tradeoff tied to this trait on the page. Present but ornamental; cap 4.6 for missing setup (appears only at midpoint), then label-only −0.3 and swappable −0.4 yield 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Correlate" appears in lines 4, 5, 9, 15 as the tutor's action at the nexus—translating silence into patterns. However, the act of correlating doesn't drive a major turn; it's a repeated meditation that leads to off-page resolution. Setup present, development is reiteration, closure is thematic assertion rather than an on-page outcome of correlation. Swappable with "interpret" or "understand" −0.5; summary-only use −0.3 yield 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Translating silence" is signaled in line 5 and line 15, but its mechanics are vague—what does correlation yield? The method shapes the tutor's internal process but doesn't enable a concrete choice or outcome. Setup present, development is conceptual only, closure ties to it thematically but not causally. Cap 4.6 for missing setup (appears late first third); ornamental −0.4 and swappable −0.5 yield 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight is introduced in line 1, appears in lines 1, 4, 8, 11, 14, 16, and closes in line 18. The setting provides vivid atmosphere (compass spin, electromagnetic hum, purple sky) but doesn't constrain a choice—the tutor could reflect anywhere. Twilight deepens across the piece, marking time. Setup, development via ambiance, closure reprise; no tactical pressure from the setting itself. Lyric early-to-final reprise with time pressure lifts to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Before the next phase" is stated in lines 15, 18, 19, marking urgency, but the deadline isn't tracked or tested. The tutor walks away in line 18 "before the next phase" without on-page consequence of the clock. Setup in second third (line 15), development is assertion, closure mentions it but doesn't hinge on it. Late signal −0.3; ornamental −0.5 yield 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Discover beauty in the difficult" is stated explicitly in lines 7, 11, 12, 16, 17, 20. The motivation is told and reiterated but not dramatized through a conflicted choice with cost—no friction between the tutor's want and an on-page obstacle. Setup present, development is thematic assertion, closure echoes it. Told-only −0.6; label-only −0.3 yield 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hopeful melancholy" is named in line 16 and pervades the reflective register throughout (exile's "aching absence," "promise," "afterglow," "seed of a new beginning"). Tone is coherent across beats and modulates with twilight's progression. However, the label appears explicitly at line 16 rather than being embodied solely through image. Setup via mood, development consistent, closure charged by tone. Explicit label −0.3; single static mood across most beats −0.2 yield 5.9.</comment>
