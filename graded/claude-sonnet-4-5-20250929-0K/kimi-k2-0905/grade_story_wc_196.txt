<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowan's interiority is concrete and embodied throughout—"her heart stuttered," the button "centered beneath the gooseneck lamp," palm catching snow. The backward pull to her nine-year-old self and her great-uncle anchors motive in lived memory rather than exposition. The final renunciation (placing the button in Marcus's file, walking home lighter) feels earned by accumulated pressure. Minor slip: the "tactfully hopeful" dust and "breathing" provenance edge toward therapeutic diction in a few beats, lowering from high-8.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns → photograph → note → envelope → whispered name builds density and reweights "small kindness" into compass. Orientation anchors quickly (file room, Rowan, emancipation three years past). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final act (placing button, whispering Marcus) crystallizes options and charges the abyss-into-hallway metaphor with visible cost (her night's labor, emotional exposure). Cost is legible in "let the cold unfurl against her skin like a promise." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The file room (mildew, fluorescent hum, banker's boxes, gooseneck lamp) supplies tactile constraint and charges the ending. The button and dust function as micro-setting objects that enable Rowan's archival method and anchor the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (peppermint secretary, peeling label "like old scab"). Spatial choreography is clean. Does not quite reach 8+ because the environment enables rather than tightly constrains a pivotal choice; the room permits rather than forces the final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: magnify one small kindness to prove the past not waste. The tightening occurs when Rowan finds the button (stuttered heart), reads dust, links it to Marcus, and commits the artifact to his file—each beat narrows options and raises emotional cost. Agency is clear: her decision to photograph, catalog under "Unknown, but breathing," and insert the note with "pursue if inquiry ever made" forecloses passivity and charges the ending. The cost is visible (night's solitary labor, emotional exposure) but remains quiet; a sharper trade-off would lift to 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (small kindnesses as compass, unknown histories as futures) emerges from dust-reading, button-placement, and snow-catching without thesis statement. The final image—"whispered the name Marcus, letting the cold unfurl against her skin like a promise"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the past was waste. The "archives are futures disguised as pasts" line verges on meta-commentary but is saved by concrete enactment (the note, the sealed box). Subtext operates in silences (Marcus's blank discharge line) and objects (button's "marching orders").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Rowan; perceptual signature is consistent (archivist's tactile reading, dust as script, labels as scabs). Diction is controlled and lyric ("dark breathe," "gooseneck lamp," "peppermint"). The prose compresses time cleanly ("Tonight, alone...") and interiority stays specific ("she was waiting for one small kindness to magnify"). Minor slip: "tactfully hopeful" and "breathing" as database provenance edge toward precious register in two beats, and the "examined unknown now charged with marching orders" phrase momentarily abstracts. Distance modulates appropriately under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("She set the button," "First came a crescent," "She walked home lighter"). Information density is high: most sentences advance atmosphere, motive, or closure. Zero scaffolding loops. Two issues lower from 8+: (1) "tactfully hopeful" recurs as a phrase-loan from the attribute list, creating slight template cadence; (2) the dust-reading sequence ("First came...Next...Then") edges toward list structure, though it serves accumulative momentum. Figurative language is dense ("sunrise over a battlefield," "slow rain of forgotten skin") but controlled and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist-as-guardian, infantryman's button, dust-as-text, and foster-care histories is specific and non-obvious. The quiet ending (whispering a name into snow) avoids melodrama. Risk: the piece leans into lyric compression and metaphor density without obscuring causality. Constraint: the core frame (lonely archivist magnifying kindness through archival artifact) follows a recognizable redemptive template; the dust-reading method and the button's double ancestry (uncle, Marcus) provide fresh angles but do not fully escape the "small act redeems broken past" scaffold. Transformation is present but incremental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowan makes three key decisions: to examine the button closely, to photograph and catalog the dust patterns, and to place the button in Marcus's file with a note. Each choice alters tactics and charges the closure. Present throughout; drives setup, middle action, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The button appears in four distinct beats: discovery behind drawer, placement under lamp, linkage to great-uncle and Marcus, insertion into evidence envelope. Its dual provenance (uncle, potential Marcus connection) and physical state (eagle worn smooth) constrain Rowan's archival choice and charge the final image ("button's afterimage glowed"). Irreplaceable and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" shapes the dominant stake (magnify small kindness to prove past not waste) and Rowan's method (reading dust as script, archiving under "Unknown, but breathing"). It constrains her choice to place the button speculatively in Marcus's file. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure. Reaches mid-7s because it operates as frame and motive but does not create a hard decision fork on its own.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" appears twice as a descriptor (dust patterns, Rowan's return tomorrow) but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It colors tone and motive but remains label-adjacent. Introduced in the dust-reading beat (~40% mark), touches closure thematically but does not alter the mechanics of Rowan's choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unfurl" recurs in three pivotal images: light across the button's dents ("sunrise over a battlefield"), the cold against Rowan's palm ("like a promise"), and implicitly in the dark breathing at closure. Each instance reweights meaning—first discovery, then embodied hope. The action is not a plot hinge but charges the lyric closure and ties tactile perception to emotional shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dust-reading as method is signaled early (~30% in: "swept the dust sideways, reading the ridges the way sailors read wind") and demonstrated across three beats (crescent/cheek, gavel line, scatter of dots). It enables Rowan's photograph and database entry, shaping her archival tactic. Does not constrain a hard fork but provides the means by which she magnifies the small kindness. Present in setup, middle development, and implicit at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The file room supplies the button discovery (wedged behind drawer), the gooseneck lamp for examination, Box 1987-C, and the reading table for dust-reading. It also anchors Rowan's memory (intake office at nine). The space enables every key choice and charges the ending (locked door, corridor, snow outside as transition). Micro-setting qualifies: the table, lamp, and boxes are handled on the page and constrain archival method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"After emancipation" (three years past) frames Rowan's motive (waiting to prove past not waste) and explains her access to the archive. The timestamp "Tonight, alone" and "Tomorrow she would return" bookend the window. Time does not create urgency or a live clock but establishes the reflective distance that permits her archival stance. Present in setup and implicit at closure; shapes context rather than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rowan's desire to magnify one small kindness (the peppermint secretary's "You're safe now" at nine) drives every choice: examining the button, reading dust, inserting the note "pursue if inquiry ever made," whispering Marcus's name. The motive is dramatized through action and memory, with visible cost (night's solitary labor, emotional exposure). Friction between want (proof of redemption) and cost (uncertainty, Marcus's unknown fate) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" operates as tone throughout: the button "not catalogued, not bagged," dust revealing "spaces between wounds where light might enter," archives as "futures disguised as pasts," the ending's "unknown was no longer an abyss but a hallway." Tone modulates appropriately under pressure (heart stuttered → whispered promise) and charges the final image. Coherent and purposeful; does not quite reach 8+ because the examined quality occasionally edges toward exposition ("she knew archives are futures") rather than pure enactment.</comment>
