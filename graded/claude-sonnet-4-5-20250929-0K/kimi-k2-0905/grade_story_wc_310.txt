<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interior is highly stylized but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her choices follow a single path of mystical transcendence without visible internal friction or cost that would make the sacrifice legible as a character-driven decision. The "quietly enthusiastic despite the stellar doubt" is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion is largely absent; the piece substitutes elevated metaphor for physical sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric design. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to transformation) where Lira swallows the spiral and becomes a waveform. However, the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page—"sacrifice" is named but the before/after emotional or relational price is not dramatically visible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the coins cool and she realizes the distillate is sacrifice, but the final beat leans heavily on metaphor without grounding the forfeiture in a concrete, legible loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck constrains Lira's isolation and supplies the coins, spiral grooves, and chrysalis wrapping that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "burnt umber to molten gold," "cold brass rail," "frozen starlight." The contracted universe as setting pressure is consistent and shapes the stakes. Micro-setting (the body as antenna, the spiral on the deck) directly affects the climactic choice to swallow the coins.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—wavelength align with purpose—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coins cool and demand sacrifice, narrowing Lira's option to refusal or transcendence. However, agency is primarily passive absorption rather than decision under conflicting wants. The "stellar doubt" as internal friction is named but never forces a dramatized trade-off or visible cost on the page. Coincidence does not resolve, but the escalation is more textural accumulation than protagonist-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Theme of purpose, transcendence, and necessary doubt emerges through images (coins, spiral, waveform) rather than statement. The backwards prophecy and the coin-swallowing chrysalis offer a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the final paragraph over-articulates thematic resolution: "stellar doubt and quiet enthusiasm superposed, a quantum beacon" reads as thematic echo. The piece resists simplistic closure but the language becomes abstract and label-reliant in the ending beats, weakening the resonance earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close on Lira; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with high-register diction ("ambered," "wavelength align," "backwards prophecy"). Perceptual signature is consistent but not character-specific—the elevated syntax does not modulate under emotional pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") appear but fit the contemplative voice. The final third introduces abstract noun clusters ("quantum beacon," "necessary dissonance") that drift from Lira's embodied experience into authorial commentary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme and sustained without pattern-teaching or payoff: "starlight fossilized into golden panes," "stellar doubt gnawing her ribs," "backwards prophecy ripening toward revelation." Mixed metaphors proliferate: coins "grow warm" then "jealous of transcendence," the spiral both architectural and emotional. Template cadence appears in repeated participial openers and "she [verb]" stems across the middle third. Paraphrase loops: "understanding static bursts" is restated three times without added pressure. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("superposed, a quantum beacon"), triggering the disallow-9+ cap globally and −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of backwards prophecy, coin divination, and post-universal-contraction setting is conceptually ambitious and specific. However, the execution leans on stock mystical-transcendence tropes (sacrifice-as-transformation, becoming-one-with-cosmos) without transforming them through grounded choice or embodied cost. The emotional arc could transplant to any visionary-becomes-beacon frame with minimal edits. The lyric mode offers freshness in texture but not in the underlying structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lira as "cast lots decision maker" appears early and in the title role. She casts comet-bone stones once in a divination gesture, but the act does not create a turn—she was already moving toward transcendence. The key "decision" to swallow the spiral is framed as realization of necessity rather than a choice between competing options. Present in setup and closure, but mid-scene development is observation rather than decision-driven pressure. Functional but the lots-casting itself is not load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The foreign coins are handled in multiple beats: Lira studies them, records their static, recites a prophecy backwards, arranges them in the spiral, kisses them, and swallows them. They supply the backwards prophecies, grow warm as a signal, and become the material of her transformation. Early signal, beat involvement across setup and climax, and closure linkage (she becomes their orbital antenna). The swallowing beat is causal and irreplaceable. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy is signaled early, shapes Lira's method (reciting in reverse), and provides the Martian copper's key phrase. It appears in the ending as her waveform "still speaking itself into the dark." However, the prophecy does not constrain tactics or narrow options—it is primarily atmospheric texture. The concept is present in setup, one middle beat, and the final image, but its mechanics do not drive a turn. Lyric reprise with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" is asserted twice as a label and once in the ending ("quietly enthusiastic about the next expansion"). It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. Ornamental use without dramatic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Distill" appears as a conceptual goal ("close to the distill point," "the distillate was not knowledge but sacrifice") and structures the middle turn. Lira's realization that distillation requires sacrifice is the story's hinge. However, the action itself is metaphorical rather than physical—she does not perform a literal distillation. The term reweights her understanding but is easily swappable with "essence" or "truth." Present in setup, middle turn, and thematic closure, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Understanding static bursts is signaled early, recurs as her "only method of navigation," and evolves from auditory to full-body ("surfing those waves with her entire nervous system"). It shapes her attempts (recording on holo-slate, arranging coins to project sine waves) and is referenced in the ending as a skill to be taught again. The method is present across setup, development, and closure. Solid integration with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck frames the entire story, supplies the physical resources (coins, spiral grooves, panes that brighten and project waves), and becomes the chrysalis that wraps her at closure. It constrains her isolation and enables the final transformation. Early signal, beat involvement throughout, and indispensable to the ending image. The deck is the story's spatial anchor and participates in every major turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the universe contracted" establishes the post-apocalyptic isolation and the absence of a sky. The contraction is mirrored in Lira's chest and the inward spiral pattern. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—Lira's action unfolds at contemplative pace without urgency. Present in setup and thematically echoed at closure, but does not constrain tactics. Atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Wavelength align with purpose is Lira's stated goal, drives her coin arrangement and spiral alignment, and is achieved momentarily before the coins demand sacrifice. It recurs in the ending ("wavelength aligned with purpose that was simply to keep the story humming"). The motivation is present across setup, middle realization, and closure. However, it is told more than dramatized—there is no visible friction between this want and a competing cost until the coins cool, and even then the choice is framed as inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stellar doubt is named early ("stellar doubt gnawing her ribs"), modulates when wavelength alignment "erased stellar doubt," and returns in the ending as "a necessary dissonance to keep the note honest." The tone shifts with pressure and charges the final image. However, the doubt is asserted as a label rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Present in setup, middle turn, and closure, but the tone is more thematic claim than felt emotional texture.</comment>
