<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to "conquer the labyrinth of self" is declared but never dramatized through embodied contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The elder Kael encounter attempts internal conflict through the "minotaur" metaphor, but the revelation feels delivered rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("sequence of choices that led him here") rather than character-particular, concrete thought. The final choice to smash the tablet lacks visible cost that forecloses a path—what does Kael lose or renounce on the page?</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery and rune-pattern accumulate toward a final symbolic act. Orientation is delayed—who Kael is, where exactly he stands, and what timeline anchor exists remain unclear past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit (smashing the tablet, stepping into nothing) attempts Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted through metaphor ("offering his weight in exchange for a name") rather than made undeniable on the page. The "elder Kael dissolved" sequence gestures at consequence but reads more as special-effect than felt loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cobalt algae, copper-and-ozone air, rain falling sideways) that filters through Kael's perception under pressure. The viaduct constrains movement (seventeen arches, fractured paths) and charges the final image when Kael steps off it. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the sequence of moves. Minor slip: "temporal papercuts" and "yesterday puddle" are striking images but slightly ornamental—they describe rather than directly altering a tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when the elder Kael introduces the minotaur concept, narrowing Kael's options to "erase" the sequence of choices. The tablet-smashing act attempts escalation through symbolic agency, yet the stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally tested. No live trade-off or visible price (resource, relationship, bodily cost) dramatizes what Kael loses by destroying the tablet and stepping off the viaduct.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—identity across fractured selves, the cost of becoming—emerges through recurring imagery (tablets, arches, ghost-Kaels) rather than direct statement. The elder Kael's line "erase the minotaur at its heart" risks thematic echo but is embedded in scene. The final image (a boy waiting, clocks ticking backward) attempts resonant ambiguity but leans slightly toward symbolic convenience: the childhood bedroom and father's clocks are introduced late and feel summoned to close thematic resonance rather than earned by prior particulars. The ending offers a non-literal answer but the cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is ambitious and controlled: a distinct perceptual signature (gravity defier, rune-reader) with elevated, mythopoetic diction that remains consistent under pressure. Free indirect access to Kael's interior is clean; no head-hopping. The elder Kael's single line of dialogue carries weight and subtext. Minor register issue: phrases like "procedural generation" and "probability cloud" introduce computational idiom that slightly tensions the otherwise archaic-lyric texture but remains voice-plausible for a character who thinks algorithmically. Psychic distance is stable; elision (what the tablet truly does, why Kael wants this) is purposeful and charged at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances image or stakes. Figurative language is dense ("cathedral bones," "darkening brightness," "wound leak hours instead of blood") and mostly coherent, though occasional mixed metaphors emerge ("algae bred by neon rain" is vivid but the causal chain—neon breeding algae—strains plausibility). Minor template-cadence issue: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Kael [verb]," creating slight rhythmic monotony across the middle third. No paraphrase loops. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge the drop-ripple motif effectively. One clarity slip: "periodically eternal: every seventh minute it forgot its age" introduces a rule but never uses it on the page, functioning as ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity defiance, procedural generation, fractured timelines, and labyrinth-of-self offers a specific, non-obvious angle on identity-across-iterations. "Periodically eternal" and "darkening brightness" are fresh coinages that avoid cliché. The elder-self encounter and tablet-smashing climax feel inevitable in hindsight, rooted in the established logic. Risk: the mythopoetic density and computational idiom blend is bold and heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative note: the minotaur-labyrinth metaphor is a classical template, though it is transformed through the "sequence of choices" twist and integrated into the closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes the final choice to smash the tablet and step off the viaduct, which drives the closure. The character is signaled early (gravity defier, tablet thief) and involved in every beat. However, many actions (retracing steps, walking through the fracture, walking the center path) are reactive or procedural rather than decision-driven under competing pressures. The elder-Kael meeting is a key turn, but the choice to destroy the tablet feels symbolic rather than a trade-off with visible on-page cost. Two gates (setup, closure) are solid; middle development is weaker because Kael's agency is often descriptive movement rather than constrained choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tablet is introduced early (first paragraph, pressed against ribs), handled multiple times (palm pressed to compute path, runes rearrange into childhood room, lifted high and smashed at closure), and its destruction is the climactic act. The "periodically eternal" rule (every seventh/thirteenth minute) is announced but never dramatically used—it remains label-only texture. The tablet enables tactics (procedural path-generation) and directly shapes the ending, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. Causal pressure is moderate: the tablet is a tool more than a constraint with felt cost. High-band entry requires cost tied to the object; smashing it forecloses the labyrinth but the price (what Kael loses by destroying it) is asserted metaphorically rather than made undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are the story's central conceit: ghost-Kaels, vertical cracks, elder iteration, timelines collapsing. The concept is signaled early and shapes every beat—retracing via probability clouds, walking through fractures, encountering alternate selves. It constrains tactics (choosing which echo to follow) and is resolved at closure when timelines collapse. However, the mechanics remain abstract; the reader never sees a clear on-page cost of navigating fractures (does Kael age? lose memory? risk erasure?). The concept is present and causal but lacks the specific trade-off or visible price that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is defined in paragraph five (every seventh minute it forgets, every thirteenth it remembers) but never demonstrated on the page. No beat shows the tablet forgetting or remembering; the trait is ornamental exposition. It does not constrain or enable any action with cost. Missing all three gates: no setup use, no middle constraint, no closure payoff. The trait could be removed without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears explicitly in paragraph eight ("He retraced his steps not by memory… but by procedural generation") and implicitly throughout the viaduct journey—walking back through his own path, encountering past selves. It shapes one key turn (the procedural algorithm "hiccupped" and led through the fracture instead of around) and frames the labyrinth metaphor. However, retracing is more a narrative mode than a decisive action with cost; it could be replaced with "navigate" or "traverse" without major structural change. Present in setup and development but only weakly tied to closure (the final step is forward into the doorway, not backward). Mid-band: functional causal role but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Procedural generation" is named once (paragraph eight) as the method for retracing steps via the tablet's probability cloud. It enables one choice (the algorithm hiccup that routes Kael through the fracture) but the mechanics are vague—how does rune-computing differ from intuition or memory? The method is signaled but not developed or tested under pressure. Missing strong development and closure gates; it appears mid-story and does not shape the ending. Functional but largely ornamental: a label for what could be described as "tablet magic" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct is introduced in the opening line, detailed across multiple beats (cobalt algae, arches, glowing rail), and serves as the stage for all action. It constrains choices (seventeen arches, forking paths, the edge Kael steps off) and charges the final image when he steps into nothing and the viaduct "stood ordinary" after. The setting is causally active: the rail is where the tablet is smashed, the edge is the threshold of transformation. All three gates satisfied with strong specificity. High-band entry: environment shapes tactics and the final image meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" is introduced in paragraph two, repeated verbatim in paragraph twenty-two at the climax, and paid off in the final paragraphs when the drop touches and the ripple spreads. The timeframe is poetic rather than mechanical—it does not tighten decisions via a live clock but serves as a conceptual frame and charged reprise. Setup and payoff gates are solid; middle development is absent (the phrase disappears for eighteen paragraphs). Lyric resonance is strong but the timeframe does not constrain tactics under pressure. Mid-band: purposeful early–final reprise that reweights meaning but lacks beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to conquer the labyrinth of self" is stated in paragraph six and revisited when the elder Kael explains the minotaur metaphor. It frames the journey and the closure choice (smashing the tablet to "erase the minotaur"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through embodied conflict; Kael's want is declared but not shown in friction with a competing fear or cost on the page. Setup and closure gates met; middle friction weak. The motivation is causal but not charged with visible trade-off until the ending, where the cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" is introduced in paragraph eleven ("darkening brightness spread from the crack; the viaduct's glow dimmed while the sky above blazed white") and sustained throughout—cobalt glow, white sky, algae light, temporal wounds leaking hours. The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (light inverts, arches compress, elder Kael has "eyes two black moons absorbing light"). It charges the final image when "the glow faded, the viaduct stood ordinary" and contrasts the boy's room where "clocks tick backward." The tone is essential to atmosphere and contributes to closure resonance. All three gates met with strong specificity and thematic linkage.</comment>
