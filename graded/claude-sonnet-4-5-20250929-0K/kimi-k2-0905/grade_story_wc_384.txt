<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's arc from forger to penitent is signaled, but interiority reads diagnostic and abstract ("calibrated treason," "wisely enduring") rather than embodied. The final choice to leave the thorn and write in her own hand is telegraphed early and lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene. Emotional progression is summarized across seventeen years rather than dramatized under present pressure, flattening the cost of her transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pearl twilight motif, sanctuary setting, blood writing) but closure arrives as a declared epiphany ("I forgive the unfinished") rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The orientation test fails: who Mara is, why she's here tonight, and what immediate stakes exist remain unclear past the 120-word mark. The ending summarizes her transformation in abstract terms without an on-page decisive change or charged final image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary and aurora provide consistent atmosphere, and the heritage rose thorn is handled in multiple beats. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: the sanctuary's physical properties don't pressure Mara's choices, and the stalactite dripping serves as ornamental time-marker. The final blood-writing on marble offers mild textural charge but doesn't meaningfully alter tactics or options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's internal forgiveness—is announced but never tested by external pressure or a forced trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; she decides to stop forging and forgive herself without on-page cost or resistance. "Calibrated treason" is mentioned repeatedly but its mechanics and risks remain abstract, preventing escalation from operating under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness and unfinished stories emerges clearly, but the final blood-written confession ("I forgive the unfinished, for we are all incomplete stories") states the moral directly rather than arriving through image or action. Recurrent motifs (rose thorn, key, aurora) are declared symbolic but don't accrue new meaning through scene pressure. The ending moralizes instead of allowing earned resonance from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a woman under emotional duress ("wisely enduring," "unlink herself from the chain of vengeance," "calibrated strike against tyranny"). Perceptual signature is generic; Mara's way of noticing sanctuary details doesn't reflect her forger's eye or present emotional state. No dialogue present to assess voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 6/10, 14/15, and 21/22 restate the same content (her forgery work, her sister's death, her transformation) without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle third with repeated "The [noun] had/would" and "She [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors cluster: "chains of guilt," "prison she'd built around her own heart," "weight beginning to lift." Figurative density in non-peak beats slows momentum without pattern-teaching or payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—calligraphy forger using her sister's hand to topple a regime—offers a fresh synthesis, but execution relies on template emotional arc (vengeance → forgiveness) and stock symbols (key with no lock, blood writing, thorn as talisman). The final turn is signaled early and arrives without surprise or fresh inflection. Pearl twilight and aurora provide atmospheric specificity but the sanctuary setting and Mara's internal journey could transpose to other contexts with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout but her choices (writing in blood, leaving the thorn) are announced rather than dramatized with friction. The forgery work that defines her is summarized in backstory; no on-page forging decision shapes a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The heritage rose thorn appears in multiple beats (pressing palm, drawing blood, left on floor) and is seeded early. However, it functions as a static talisman rather than a tool that constrains choices or evolves in use; its final abandonment is declared symbolic rather than charged through action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Calibrated treason" is mentioned repeatedly but remains abstract theme-claim. The mechanics of her forgery work and how precision damages oppressors are told, not shown; no on-page treason decision alters tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" appears as a label in paragraphs 4 and 16 but never constrains an action or surfaces a visible tradeoff. It reads as thematic echo rather than an embodied trait that shapes her choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Unlink" appears late (paragraph 11) as metaphor for breaking vengeance chains and again (paragraph 24) for releasing guilt. The action is asserted rather than dramatized; no physical unlinking or clear before/after change in her tactical options stems from this verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The key with no apparent lock is introduced early (paragraph 7) and handled twice (removing it, understanding its meaning). Its mechanics—unlocking the prison around her heart—are declared metaphorically in paragraph 23 but never tested or used in a choice that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary anchors all action and is seeded with childhood memory and sister's death. It provides consistent atmosphere and the marble floor enables the blood-writing final beat. However, the space doesn't constrain movement or force a tactical choice; it functions more as resonant backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Stalactite dripping is mentioned in four paragraphs as a time marker but never tightens a decision or creates urgency. The aurora's shift from pearl twilight to dawn provides a loose clock but Mara's actions occur without time pressure altering her moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is seeded in the sister's final words (paragraph 5) and echoed in Mara's blood-written confession (paragraph 18). The desire is declared and summarized but not dramatized through conflicting impulses or a choice with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Pearl twilight" recurs across the opening, middle, and ending, maintaining consistent atmosphere. The tone modulates slightly as dawn approaches (paragraph 27) and the aurora fades, but the shift doesn't charge the final image with new pressure; it reads as parallel rather than causally integrated with Mara's transformation.</comment>
