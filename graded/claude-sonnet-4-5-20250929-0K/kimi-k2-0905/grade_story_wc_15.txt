<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Calyx's motivation is legible—he is driven by the canyon's call and a desire to "sew back open" broken precedents—but his interior remains abstract. The piece tells us he "understood" and "surrendered" without embodying contradictory impulses or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Key turns (pricking his palm, whispering the final line) are presented as ritual completions rather than decisions with visible cost or foreclosed options. Emotion is largely asserted through elevated diction ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace") rather than contradictory embodied states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens infers as Accumulative/Textural: the narrative accretes images (kelp threads, petroglyphs, loom, orchids) and the final bridge/tide return reweights the opening emptiness. Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words, though "when" remains vague ("every night since the harbor dried"). The closure—tide returning, loom sinking, bridge glowing—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse; no clear path is foreclosed, and Calyx "returned to the silent wharf... ready for the next night" suggests cyclical recurrence rather than a decisive alteration. The closing image recharges prior motifs (orchids, loom, footprints) yet the felt price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth, driftwood loom, and dry tide pools are vivid and particular, filtered through lyric perception ("cooling embers," "spilled milk"). The loom anchors the climactic weaving and the returning tide charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test (environment constrains choice and charges closure). Spatial choreography is coherent across the spiraling descent and ascent. Deduction: the labyrinth's mechanics (switchbacks, altars, ledge) are sketched rather than grounded in tactile, lived-in interaction; Calyx drifts through rather than navigating obstacles that test his body or knowledge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: restore the tide by weaving broken precedents into the loom. Pressure accumulates through the descent, the convergence of kelp/footprints/sleepwalking, and the climactic sewing. One meaningful deepening occurs when Calyx pricks his palm, adding his blood to the plate—a tightening that raises personal cost. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than agentic; the loom "began to turn of its own accord" and the canyon's "sigh" grants passages, suggesting external facilitation rather than protagonist-driven turns. The cost is legible (plate dissolves, loom sinks) but does not foreclose a live option—Calyx "returned... ready for the next night," implying cyclical recurrence rather than a trade-off with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—restoration through surrender, memory woven into future—emerges from the sewing, the orchids, and the returning tide rather than direct statement. The final image (orchids in every reflection) offers a resonant answer to the question of how "broken precedents" can heal, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the thematic language leans toward abstraction ("ruin to reverence," "what was unmade remember its name") and prompt-echo phrasing ("hauntingly optimistic," "overlapping sleepwalking paths") that feels imposed rather than earned from scene particulars. The story invites reflection but edges toward sermonizing in lines like "every unraveling is only the first half of a weave."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("poetic wharf weaver," "orchid solace," "muttering couplets that rhymed ruin with reverence") that feels voice-motivated and legible, though uniform across emotional peaks and valleys. Purposeful compression and fragment-like cadences ("sweet, funereal, promising renewal") are taught early and sustained. Deduction: the diction does not modulate under pressure; the climactic palm-pricking and final whispering maintain the same ornate lexicon as the opening, reducing the sense of urgency. Perceptual signature is consistent but not character-particular—descriptors like "moth-wing thin" and "luminous and impossible" could apply to any lyric narrator.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, multiple line-level artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("letting the dream take his legs" / "he drifted"), template cadence in the ascent sequence (repeated "past" / "until" constructions), and synonym churn ("drifted," "climbed," "descended" cycling without clear tactic shifts). Stock elevated diction appears in peak beats ("hauntingly optimistic red," "orchid solace") without grounding in concrete sensory detail. The closing third-person omniscient summary ("In overlapping dreams he saw future wanderers...") shifts into exposition that tells rather than dramatizes. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy and momentum, triggering −0.8 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—weaving a path to restore the tide via an illustration plate and loom—offers a fresh synthesis of craft, dream, and environmental restoration. The particulars (red canyon, kelp threads, driftwood loom, orchids blooming in salt) are specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution (surrender, weaving, return) follow a familiar template: mystic artisan completes ritual to heal wounded land. The lyric register and symbolic objects (plate, orchids, loom) read as carefully chosen but not transformed through character-specific struggle or non-obvious moral calculus; Calyx's role is more conduit than agent with contradictory impulses. The final image is beautiful but does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Calyx is present throughout and his actions (carrying the plate, sewing, pricking his palm, whispering the final line) drive the narrative arc. However, his choices are framed as surrenders and completions of a pattern the canyon itself initiates ("the canyon itself was stitching him forward"). The climactic decision to bleed onto the orchids narrows options slightly, but the text emphasizes that "his fingers knew the pattern before his mind did," reducing agency. He appears in the closure (returns to wharf, begins to hum) but the image focuses on the tide and orchids rather than a choice-driven turn. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but causal pressure is moderate (he executes rather than decides under friction) and specificity is mid-range (any mystic weaver could fill the role with minor edits). Swappability −0.5, passivity in key beats −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The illustration plate is introduced early (paragraph 3), handled across multiple beats (carried, sewn into the loom, pierced with needle, bled upon, dissolves), and its dissolution charges the closure ("ink becoming rainwater, porcelain becoming shell"). Each stitch releases a memory, and the plate's "broken precedents" directly enable the climax. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.9 (the sewing/bleeding with the plate is the pivot that releases the tide). Deduction: the plate's unique properties (illustration, orchids, precedents) are named but not shown constraining choices—Calyx does not, for example, struggle with how to interpret its design or choose which fragment to sew first. Swappability −0.4 (another symbolic map or heirloom could substitute with edits), cost connection is visible but diffuse −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" is named early ("broken precedents of tide and time were riddles he intended to sew back open") and the loom-fabric contains "fragments of sails, wedding veils, and fishermen's flags" that embody past promises. The concept shapes the dominant stake (restoration) and the climax (sewing the plate with its precedents into the loom releases the tide). However, "broken precedents" functions more as thematic label than on-page constraint; we do not see how specific precedents were broken, what trade-offs exist between honoring old rules versus new ones, or how Calyx navigates competing precedents under pressure. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, but causal pressure is low (the concept is invoked rather than dramatized as a source of friction) −0.7, and it reads swappable with "lost covenants" or "forgotten oaths" −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" appears as a label in the climax ("bleeding hauntingly optimistic red onto the orchids") and the closing lines ("hauntingly optimistic, ready for the next night"). It does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; rather, it describes Calyx's emotional stance. The trait is told rather than embodied in contradictory choices—e.g., we do not see him choose hope despite immediate loss, or pay a price for optimism that a more cautious weaver would avoid. Late explicit use (past midpoint) −0.4, label-only −0.6, no cost connection −0.5. Closure mention +0.4 (the final hum is coded as "hauntingly optimistic"), lifting the score slightly above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sewing/weaving is the central action: Calyx sews the plate into the loom, each stitch releases a memory, and the final weaving ("threads crawling up the walls like ivy of light") restores the passages and summons the tide. The action appears early (signaled in paragraph 4 "riddles he intended to sew back open"), is enacted across the climax (paragraphs 12–18), and directly shapes the closure (loom sinks, bridge unfolds, tide returns). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2 (the act of sewing with his blood is the pivot), closure linkage +1.5. Deduction: the sewing mechanics are abstract—"began to sew... muttering couplets"—rather than showing specific stitches, knots, or technical struggle, reducing irreplaceability. Swappability −0.6 (another ritual craft—painting, singing—could substitute with edits), but the lyric specificity of "silvered needle," "warp," "weft" argues for moderate uniqueness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Overlapping sleepwalking paths" is introduced early (paragraph 5: "footprints circling his cot in overlapping sleepwalking paths that matched the labyrinth's spirals") and returns in the climax ("feet moving in the same overlapping sleepwalking paths now glowing gold"). The method matters conceptually—it signals that the canyon is guiding him—and the glowing paths charge the ascent and closure. However, the mechanics are not tested under pressure; Calyx does not struggle to follow the paths, choose between diverging spirals, or pay a cost for sleepwalking versus waking navigation. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but causal pressure is low (the paths guide rather than constrain choice) −0.6, and the method is swappable with "guided by dream visions" or "following kelp threads" −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "centuries-old labyrinth carved into red canyon walls" is anchored early (paragraph 1–2) and provides the spatial frame for the entire narrative. The setting supplies resources (the driftwood loom, the cavern, the ledge) and the "seventh switchback" marks progression. The walls shift ("granting passages") at the climax and the canyon "sighed" in response to the weaving, directly affecting outcome. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7 (the ledge and returning tide are the final image). Deduction: the labyrinth functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint—Calyx does not navigate competing paths, face dead ends, or lose resources due to the maze's structure. Swappability −0.5 (another mythic ruin—temple, cavern network—could serve with edits), and the setting's mechanics (why seven switchbacks? what made the passages close?) remain unexplained, reducing specificity −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the tide pools emptied" anchors the premise and "every night since the harbor dried" establishes recurrence. "Tonight he surrendered early, letting the dream take his legs before midnight" sets a night-window frame. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—there is no countdown, no risk of dawn interrupting the weaving, no cost for taking too long. The climax unfolds without temporal pressure, and "when dawn blushed the walls rose-red once more, Calyx descended" marks closure but does not impose urgency. Early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.4, but no causal pressure from time (live clock that alters moves) −0.8, and the timeframe is swappable with "after the storm" or "in the dry season" −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To carve a path from ruin to reverence" is explicit in paragraph 24 ("arching from ruin to reverence") and implicit throughout (restore the tide, redeem stories, lead back to wonder). The desire is dramatized in the sewing action and the final whisper ("May what was unmade remember its name"). However, the motivation is told more than shown in conflict—we do not see Calyx tempted to abandon the task, forced to choose between reverence for the past versus a new future, or pay a personal cost (relationship, safety, certainty) to pursue this path. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, causal involvement in two beats +0.9, but low friction between wants and costs (the weaving proceeds without resistance or trade-off) −0.9, and the phrasing echoes prompt language −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" is named explicitly (paragraph 9: "The air smelled of orchid solace—sweet, funereal, promising renewal only after surrender") and the orchids recur throughout: flaking from the plate, blooming on the fabric, arriving with the tide, appearing in every reflection at closure. The tone—elegiac, sweet, quietly transformative—is coherent across turns and charges the final image. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.3 (orchids "at its center, proof that broken precedents... can still lead a world back to wonder"), causal pressure +0.5 (the orchids are the vehicle of renewal). Deduction: the tone is stable rather than modulating with pressure; the lyric register does not tighten or fracture during the palm-pricking or final weaving, reducing dynamic range −0.5. "Orchid solace" as a phrase reads as authorial label rather than embodied sensory detail −0.3.</comment>
