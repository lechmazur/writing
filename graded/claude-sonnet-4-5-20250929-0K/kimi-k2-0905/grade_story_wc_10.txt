<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and action-driven through most beats—striking tuning forks, reading thermal signatures, composing through the silence. The capsizing backstory anchors her drive effectively. However, the final third loses embodied choice in favor of lyric assertions ("proving that the world had never been silent"), and the motivation shift from grief-mapping to universal truth feels unearned by prior contradiction. The ending renunciation (walking away) lacks visible cost that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers thermal notation beats to reweight silence as expressive medium. Orientation anchors clearly (Mara, winterglass conservatory, post-Great Hush). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—silence redefined as thermal song—with conceptual cost legible in the scanner's death and Mara's departure. One weakness: the cost feels more asserted than dramatized; the fork-striking sequence accumulates density but the final image ("frost began to thaw in perfect fifths") lands as poetic declaration rather than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The conservatory's frosted dome, shattered glass, and thermal scanner constrain Mara's method throughout. Spatial choreography is clean (service door, center stage, benches). The heat-map's color palette and the melting frost charge the closure image directly. The "diamond dust of shattered glass" and "frost-laced dome" are vivid and purposeful. Minor slip: the city's snow and seeds waiting for spring feel ornamental rather than constraining a present choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating post-capsizing silence into legible expression—is clear early. The fork-striking sequence tightens as Mara builds notation (fear, grief, wonder), and the audience of thermal silhouettes responding is a meaningful deepening. However, the escalation remains internal and accumulative; no live obstacle forces a trade-off. The scanner's battery death arrives as coincidence rather than consequence of Mara's choice, weakening the sense of agency-driven cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—communication persists beyond sound, translated into heat and light—emerges organically from the tuning-fork notation and thermal mapping. The final image of frost thawing "in perfect fifths" and the child's treble-clef cloud offer resonant, non-literal answers without moralizing. Minor weakness: "proving that the world had never been silent" in paragraph 18 edges toward theme statement rather than dramatized realization, and the "seeds of thermal song" metaphor feels convenient rather than earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with Mara's perceptual filter mostly consistent (acoustic scientist vocabulary, tuning-fork precision). Diction is distinct and lyric-mode compression is purposeful in lines like "unshaken marvels of music, stripped of their noise." However, register drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure: "silently expressive" appears twice as phrase-tag, and "rectangle of thermal song" / "composing in the new language she had been born to translate" read as authorial assertion rather than Mara's exact idiom. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid ("silent clouds that hung like unplayed chords"). Information density is high in the fork-striking sequence. However, multiple paraphrase loops damage momentum: paragraphs 18–19 restate the theme of silence-as-expression without added pressure, and "silently expressive" recurs as template phrase. The phrase "the conservatory glowed like a sunrise trapped under ice" is strong, but the final third accumulates poetic assertion ("counting her footsteps as measures, her heartbeat as tempo") that substitutes lyricism for narrative advancement. Template cadence in "she struck another, then another" and synonym churn around "silent" / "silence" / "hushed" trigger line-level drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-acoustic world + thermal emotion mapping + musical notation is specific and non-obvious. The tuning-fork case as calibration tool repurposed for composition is a fresh inflection. The "Great Hush" premise and thermal-vision scanner avoid stock post-apocalypse tropes. However, the capsizing origin and lone-survivor frame are familiar, and the ending's poetic expansion ("seeds of thermal song," "soul dance") substitutes lyric reach for grounded specificity, diluting the conceptual precision established earlier.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara (capsize survivor) drives all beats: salvaging the scanner, opening the case, striking forks, building notation, playing sequences. Her survivor status primes the motivation (grief, wonder) and the tuning-fork case origin. Present in closure (walks away, composes with footsteps). However, the capsizing itself is backstory; the survivor attribute enables but does not constrain a pivotal choice with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tuning fork case appears in paragraphs 4 (capsizing floatation), 10 (opening on stage), 11–16 (striking sequence), 19 ("closed the empty case"). Used in three distinct beats: survival tool, notation instrument, compositional palette. Shapes the central action (rectifying heat-map) and is present at closure. Specific properties (twelve forks, whale-low to bat-high, labeled by emotion) matter causally. Does not resolve a problem it did not help create. Strong integration, but the case's closure moment (closing empty) is brief and does not reweight prior meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" appears once in paragraph 13 as descriptor: "The unshaken marvels of music, stripped of their noise, revealed themselves as pure thermal emotion." The phrase captures the premise (music persists without sound) but functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping constraint. The concept underlies Mara's project but is not dramatized as a choice-altering force. Present in middle, not in closure image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" appears twice: paragraph 15 ("silhouettes silently expressive in their own thermal signature") and paragraph 22 ("smiled, the expression silently expressive"). Used as descriptor, not constraint. The trait labels the post-Hush condition but does not enable or foreclose an on-page action with visible cost. Ornamental recurrence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Rectifying the heat-map's palette" (paragraph 14) is the pivotal action: Mara creates notation by matching forks to colors, temperature to pitch, hue to timbre. This choice drives paragraphs 11–16 and directly enables the closure effect (thermal symphony frozen in frost). Major turn traces to this action; the resolution (scanner dies, image remains) depends on the rectified map. Swapping "rectify" for "calibrate" would weaken specificity but not break structure. Strong integration with one small replaceability edge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions scanner salvaged from *Auralight* (paragraph 7), triggered on entry, projects colored auras (paragraph 8), guides Mara to center stage (paragraph 9), flares crimson when fork struck (paragraph 11), blooms into aurora of instruments (paragraph 12), records final sequences (paragraph 16), battery dies (paragraph 19). Present in setup, drives middle beats (fork-to-color correspondence), and participates in closure (image burned into frost). Mechanics matter: the scanner's palette determines Mara's notation system. Strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Winterglass conservatory is the sole location, anchored early (paragraph 1). Frosted panes, broken service door, diamond-dust glass, benches, center stage, frost-laced dome structure the action spatially. The dome's melting frost (paragraph 17) and final thaw "in perfect fifths" (paragraph 23) charge the closure image. The building's memory (concerts, thermal silhouettes) supplies the resource Mara rectifies. Setting constrains method (must work inside to access stage/dome) and provides the canvas (frost) that preserves her work. Indispensable to structure and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe "after noise becomes impossible" (the Great Hush, three months post-capsizing) is established in paragraphs 1–5 and sustained throughout. The post-acoustic condition shapes stakes (silence must be translated) and tactics (thermal mapping replaces sound). However, time does not tighten within the scene; the scanner's battery death is the only clock, and it arrives as coincidence. The "since that night" and "three months ago" anchors are functional but do not create live pressure or alter moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to translate silence into music" is dramatized through Mara's actions: salvaging the scanner, opening the case, striking forks in emotional sequences (fear, grief, wonder), and building notation. Paragraph 18 states it directly but the prior beats show the drive. Friction between personal grief (capsizing) and universal proof (paragraph 18) is present but brief. The motivation shapes all major turns and participates in closure (walking away composing). Strong integration with minor tell-over-show in the theme articulation.</comment>
