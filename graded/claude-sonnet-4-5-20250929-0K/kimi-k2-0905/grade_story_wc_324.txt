<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect vulnerable voices is clear and drives her investigation, though the stakes remain largely abstract until late. Her micro-choices—pocketing the photograph, lying to Hask, uploading evidence—show agency under pressure. Internal contradiction is present but muted: her defiance of Hask feels more procedural than deeply conflicted. The emotional arc compresses decades of backstory into urgency without fully embodying the cost of confrontation in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal lens: Mira hears Lila's pulse → finds the photograph → discovers the ledger → confronts Hask → uploads proof, with each beat motivated by the prior. Closure lands on-page with visible cost—Hask collapses, Mira triggers the alarm, and Lila's credit is restored—but the final cost to Mira (removing the hearing aid, sleeping dreamless) reads more as exhaustion than a path foreclosed. One meaningful tightening occurs when Hask corners her at the pond, forcing the bluff and upload.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail: vines mimicking heart valves, condensation recording heartbeats in rust, sodium-orange glow. The koi pond's low wall constrains Mira's choice during confrontation, and the hearing aid functions as micro-setting, shaping her access to the dead. Spatial choreography remains clear across the conservatory, archive, and atrium. Some descriptions (orchid rot, spectral ribbons) lean decorative without altering tactics, but the setting charges the final image of mist burning off at sunrise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting Lila's posthumous credit and shielding future volunteers—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when Mira discovers the ledger, then escalates when Hask intercepts her, forcing the upload gambit. The final reversal (Hask's collapse, alarm triggered, ledger handed to paramedics) is protagonist-driven with visible cost: Mira exposes herself to Ministry scrutiny and loses her tool (the hearing aid dies). One credible tightening that narrows options is present, meeting length requirements, though Hask's collapse from "gravity of voices" leans slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—incidental heroism overheard, pursued, and assured—emerges organically from Mira's nocturnal investigation and the recurring motif of stolen valor versus unsung credit. The hearing aid, photograph, and ledger function as charged objects that reweight prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in Hask's trembling fingers and the mist-shapes of donors; the final image (photograph pinned above desk, hearing aid battery dead) offers a resonant answer without thesis. Minor slip: "heroism is rarely chosen; it is overheard, pursued, and, on lucky twilights, assured" borders on theme summary, though it remains rooted in concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance tightens under pressure (archive break-in, confrontation) and breathes during transit. Perceptual signature is consistent: she filters the atrium through pulse-tracing idiom ("Morse without code," "fibrillation"). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Hask's "That photograph belongs to the Ministry" and Mira's calm lie carry subtext. Filter verbs ("feeling," "hearing") appear but remain voice-motivated. Diction stays within Mira's technical-yet-poetic register without drift, and the prose rhythm modulates with scene tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the archive break-in and slowing for the final dawn image. Minor overwriting clusters in figurative language: "swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light," "vines had learned to mimic heart valves," "reeling hush" all compress into early paragraphs without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("Tell him," "Show them," "Keep it"). No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, but the density of metaphor occasionally competes with propulsion in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of heart-tracing, ghost voices, and archival heroism offers a fresh angle on posthumous justice. The hearing aid as spectral interface and the Ministry's Heart-Trace program add specificity. Mira's nocturnal pursuit and the ledger heist feel particular to this voice and setting, avoiding template plot. Risk: the mist-shapes coalescing as donors and Hask's collapse from "gravity of voices" toe the line of convenient metaphysics but remain grounded in Mira's perceptual frame. The transformation test holds: swapping names would lose the occupational and atmospheric texture integral to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as contact tracer for hearts frames her access to the hearing aid, drives her investigation of Lila's pulse, motivates the ledger search, and underlies her final choice to protect vulnerable voices by uploading evidence. Setup (opening paragraph), development (archive infiltration, confrontation), and payoff (handing ledger to paramedics, explaining "irregularities") all hinge on her occupational identity. High causal pressure and closure linkage; her job is the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three beats: discovered beneath the bench, pocketed and used to recognize Hask's connection, then offered to Hask before being pinned above Mira's desk at closure. It reweights the 1973 blood-drive from Hask's pride to Lila's uncredited work, shifting the stakes and charging the final image. Setup (found face-down), development (matched to ledger), payoff (final relic). Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; the exact object drives the ledger search and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Incidental heroism shapes Mira's framing of Lila's uncredited 1973 coordination and her own nocturnal pursuit, which she sees as "overheard, pursued, and assured." It informs her motivation and the thematic question but does not constrain a discrete on-page choice beyond her general drive to protect. Setup (opening context), thematic payoff (final paragraph reflection), but middle development is implicit rather than dramatized as a trade-off. Moderate causal role; more thematic anchor than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" appears as a label ("Persistent curiosity kept her fingers on the volume dial") and drives her decision to follow the pulse, pry open the archive, and photograph every ledger page despite risk. Setup (opening paragraph), development (archive break-in as illicit thrill), payoff (final line: "at least one tracer remained persistently curious enough to listen"). The trait enables key actions with visible cost (alarm triggered, job jeopardized) but the phrasing leans descriptive rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assure" recurs as a verb in three pivotal beats: Mira's job to assure ghosts can speak without exploitation, her lie to Hask ("I found nothing"), and the thematic closure ("assured at last"). Setup (opening mission), development (lie that protects upload), payoff (Lila's voice protected, heroism assured). The action is not physically dramatic but redefines relational and moral stakes at each turn. Strong thematic and causal integration; swapping for a synonym would dilute the resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The decades-old hearing aid is Mira's tool for detecting Lila's pulse, guiding her across the atrium and through the archive, squealing approval when she photographs the ledger, quickening to steer her away from the pond, and finally dying once its duty is discharged. Setup (opening paragraph), development (multiple navigation beats, climax guidance), payoff (battery dies at closure). High specificity and irreplaceability; the exact object shapes tactics, escalation, and the final image. Strong causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors every beat: swallows sound, provides the bench where the photograph is found, the service corridor with rust-recorded heartbeats, the koi pond that forces Mira's choice, and the spectral ribbons at climax. Setup (opening line), development (spatial resources and obstacles), payoff (mist burns off at sunrise, reweighting the world as "slightly more honest"). The setting constrains movement, charges atmosphere, and shapes the final image. Strong integration across all three gates with high closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"When the dead call" frames the story's inciting moment (Lila's pulse tonight) and recurs in the closing line ("the dead kept calling"). Setup (title-like opening phrase, Lila's voice tonight), payoff (collective chorus at closure). Middle development is weaker: the timeframe compresses Mira's investigation into one twilight-to-dawn arc but does not impose a ticking-clock constraint that forces tactical choices. Moderate thematic and atmospheric charge; functional but not highly causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect vulnerable voices from insurance-firm exploitation is dramatized in her decision to follow the pulse, her archive infiltration, her lie to Hask, and her final upload that shields Lila and future volunteers. Setup (opening paragraph: "protect vulnerable voices"), development (ledger theft, confrontation bluff), payoff (Lila's credit restored, voices "protected at last"). The desire conflicts with job security and triggers visible costs (alarm, Hask's collapse). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage with embodied friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" as tone appears explicitly ("mist-clad atrium at twilight swallowed sound," "flash muted by reeling hush," "mist and the decades-old hearing aid now quiet") and modulates with pressure: thick silence during the hunt, squealing urgency at climax, and dreamless quiet at closure. Setup (opening atmosphere), development (tone tightens during confrontation, spectral gratitude), payoff (hearing aid dies, sunrise burns off mist). Coherent tonal arc that charges the final image, though the phrase itself is slightly abstract. Moderate closure linkage.</comment>
