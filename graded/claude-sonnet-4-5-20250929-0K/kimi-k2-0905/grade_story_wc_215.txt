<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alden's motivation to preserve unspoken words is established early and drives his ritual, but his interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("weight... more than stone," "pressure equal to the desert's heat") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to speak and seal the fracture shows agency with cost, but the decision feels more thematic declaration than earned struggle between contradictory impulses. The child ghost and head beekeeper remain atmospheric presences rather than sources of relational pressure. Micro-choices accumulate toward the ending, meeting baseline expectation but not exceeding it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Alden, abandoned beekeeping oasis, post-ghost world) arrive within the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through ritual repetition, the child's arrival, and the fracture's discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Alden's vow to hold the words and the sealing of the fracture reconfigures the covenant with visible cost—his broken silence and permanent binding to the oasis. The final image (gleaming box, sealed fracture, scent of clover) reweights prior desolation. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis is vividly rendered with sun-cracked frames, toppled apiaries, and scorched wasteland sensory anchors. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, constraining Alden's ritual and charging the final image when the fracture seals. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: ash spirals, soot motes, violet and emerald light refraction. The scent of blooming clover at the end directly contradicts and transforms the scorched desolation, meeting the constraint-and-charge test for 9+ eligibility. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the ghosts' unspoken words and prevent their dissolution. The child's arrival and the box's fracture tighten pressure in one meaningful beat, forcing Alden's choice between mending (risking final breaking) and abandonment (scattering the words). The dream sequence narrates rather than dramatizes the escalation of consequence. The final act—pressing the fracture and whispering—shows agency and forecloses the path of silence with visible cost (his vow broken, permanent station accepted), but the cost feels more stated than felt under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the covenant as comb, unspoken words as sweetness that turns bitter if abandoned, and the final image of clover blooming on scorched land. The story resists moralizing and invites ambiguity about whether Alden's binding is salvation or trap. The whispered promise—"I will hold you until the desert flowers"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without thesis statement. Minor slip: "mute eloquence" and "tranquilly perceptive" recur as labels more than as pressure points, but they do not undercut the thematic payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Alden; psychic distance modulates appropriately. Perceptual signature is present (contextual clues, attention to visual refraction, soot as sensory anchor) but the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register not fully voice-motivated: "tranquilly perceptive" and "mute eloquence" feel authorial rather than Alden's idiom under duress. Dialogue appears only in the final whisper, which breaks his silence purposefully. Filter verbs ("understood," "knew," "noticed") cluster in several lines without clear voice gain, reducing immediacy in peak beats. No head-hopping; tense and stance remain consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several paraphrase loops and template patterns reduce propulsion: "tranquilly perceptive" recurs four times as a tag without reweighting; "unspoken words" and variants cycle without fresh detail in adjacent lines. Mixed metaphor: "weight... more than stone" followed by "thickening the paper" creates competing physical logics. Figurative language is dense in nearly every sentence ("fossils," "spirals," "disappointed bees," "honeycomb," "comb"), approaching overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. The final image is vivid, but earlier beats carry scaffold redundancy that dulls momentum before closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of beekeeping imagery, ghost lore, and unspoken-word preservation is specific and non-obvious. The stained glass box as reliquary and the covenant-as-comb metaphor feel fresh. Alden's astonishment and tranquil perception establish a distinct stance, though "recluse preserving words for ghosts" edges toward familiar mystic-hermit territory. The child's invisible jar and the fracture's self-sealing avoid easy resolution, and the blooming clover reweights desolation without sentiment. Risk-taking in tone and structure is present but not bold enough to warrant high-band bonus; the piece executes its premise well within accumulative/lyric conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Alden (astonished recluse) is present throughout. Setup: opening paragraph. Development: performs ritual, receives child, interprets contextual clues. Payoff: kneels, accepts the jar's contents, presses the fracture, whispers the vow—decisive choices that alter his station. His astonishment is mentioned early ("astonished recluse") but not dramatized as a trait constraining later action; the label does minimal causal work. His reclusiveness shapes the setting and isolation but does not create friction in the peak choice. The final whisper and sealing are choices, not mere observation, lifting the score above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stained glass box: Setup (paragraph 4), Development (child approaches through warped lenses, colors splinter her face; Alden opens it to accept the jar's contents), Payoff (he notices the fracture, presses it with his finger, and the box gleams "like a lantern" in the final line with the fracture sealed). The box is handled across at least three distinct beats, its changing state (fracture appears, then seals) alters Alden's tactics, and it charges the final image. Removing the box would break the closure mechanism. Strong integration; just shy of indispensable because the unspoken-word motif could theoretically anchor elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Tangled covenant: Setup (paragraph 9, "older than the fire"), Development (paragraph 10 explains it demands a keeper; paragraph 22 reframes it as "not a chain but a comb"), Payoff (Alden's whispered vow enacts the covenant, and the ghosts' breath responds). The concept shapes his motivation and the stakes (prevent ghost dissolution), and the comb metaphor reweights it at closure. However, much of its presence is thematic articulation rather than on-page constraint of tactics. It enables the ending but does not narrow options mid-scene with visible cost until the very end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Tranquilly perceptive: appears four times as a descriptive tag ("tranquilly perceptive through the scorched wasteland," "tranquilly perceptive, that the covenant demanded," "tranquilly perceptive of the choice," "remained standing, tranquilly perceptive"). Setup: paragraph 2. Development and Payoff: recurs but functions as narrator label rather than trait constraining action. No scene demonstrates a cost or tradeoff of his tranquil perception versus urgency or emotion. Essentially ornamental; removing it would not alter any beat's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Gaze: Setup (paragraph 2, Alden "noting" through perception; paragraph 8, "the angle of a gaze" as contextual clue). Development: paragraph 12, he watches the child "through the warped lenses"; paragraph 13, "by the mute eloquence of her posture Alden knew." Payoff: paragraph 20, he "gazed through its colors at the assembled ghosts," and paragraph 21, "Their eyes reflected every promise." The act of gazing through contextual clues drives his understanding and acceptance of the child's offering. It is central to his method and recurs with purpose, but swapping "gaze" for "observe" would leave structure mostly intact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Through contextual clues: Setup (paragraph 8, Alden "studied the ghosts through contextual clues: the angle of a gaze, the tremor in a hand"). Development: paragraph 13, "by the mute eloquence of her posture Alden knew it brimmed with the words." Payoff: paragraph 22, "Understanding flooded him through contextual clues: the covenant was not a chain but a comb." The method is signaled early, used to interpret the child's need, and explicitly invoked at the thematic turn. It shapes his ability to act without speech. Just below essential because the mechanics (visual cues, gesture) are not tested under pressure or constrained by a credible failure mode.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned beekeeping oasis in scorched wasteland: Setup (paragraph 1). Development: apiaries, hives, ash, and toppled structures anchor every beat; the hive shell houses the box in the final act. Payoff: paragraph 24, "the wind carried the scent of blooming clover across the scorched wasteland," reversing desolation. The setting is inseparable from the ghost ecology, the box's discovery site, and the closure image. Removing it would collapse the story's spatial and thematic logic. Strong integration; the oasis and wasteland work as both literal and metaphoric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>After ghosts become visible: Setup (paragraph 3, "After ghosts became visible"). Development: ghosts appear (head beekeeper, child) and their visibility enables Alden's covenant work. Payoff: ghosts lean forward, breathe, and the scent of clover follows. The timeframe is a backdrop condition rather than a ticking clock or constraint that alters tactics. It establishes world rules but does not tighten pressure or create urgency within the single scene. Functional but largely static; no moment where time running out or the "after" condition's mechanics force a different choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To preserve the weight of unspoken words: Setup (paragraph 5, "the parchment... weighed more than stone"; paragraph 6, Alden's motivation began with the first ghost). Development: the child offers her jar of unsaid words; Alden accepts them, feeling increased pressure in his chest. Payoff: the whispered vow and sealed fracture enact the preservation, and the ghosts' response (light, breath, clover scent) confirms success. The motivation drives every beat and culminates in a choice with visible cost (broken silence, permanent binding). Strong causal role; just below indispensable because alternate phrasings of the same desire could serve.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mute eloquence: Setup (paragraph 3, "the world had learned to speak in mute eloquence"). Development: ghosts communicate through gesture and posture (paragraph 8, contextual clues; paragraph 13, "mute eloquence of her posture"). Payoff: the final image layers silence (sealed fracture, gleaming box) with sensory eloquence (clover scent, cool breath). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly—quiet ritual, dream urgency, crystallized vow. The oxymoron charges the thematic frame but does not constrain a tactical choice. Removing the phrase would not break causality, yet it colors every beat and reweights at closure, lifting it above mid-band.</comment>
