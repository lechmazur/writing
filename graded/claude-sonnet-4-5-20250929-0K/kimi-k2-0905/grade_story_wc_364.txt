<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Thistle remains a label rather than a person with contradictory impulses acting in scene. His "meek blacksmith" trait is asserted but never embodied in micro-choices; "quietly determined" appears repeatedly without dramatized internal conflict or cost. The villagers function as a distant chorus with no individuated pressure. Emotional progression is told through summary ("bartered awakening," "confusion rushed in") rather than shown through embodied perception degrading under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, waive penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure form: the arches descending and Thistle returning to forge new objects reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant). However, the cost is abstract—"bartered awakenings," "space between understanding and confusion"—and never lands as a legible forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The silk's mechanics (how it lowers arches, why it works in mine shafts) remain opaque, weakening causal motivation. One meaningful deepening occurs (ladder touches arch, arches descend), but the stakes remain metaphorical throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are vivid and consistent, with azure moonlight and star-fruit trees recurring across beats. Spatial choreography is coherent (mine shafts, forge, arches). The magician's silk touching stone at the arch charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test. Sensory detail leans heavily visual; other senses are absent. The silk's physical properties (how it "strengthens beams," lowers arches) are asserted without tactile or mechanical specificity, reducing plausibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the forge/find purpose, signaled early. One tightening: ladder touches arch, arches descend. Agency is present (Thistle builds, climbs, ties), but the silk's magic solves the problem without visible trade-off or constraint—he never runs out, fails, or sacrifices anything tangible on the page. The villagers' "confusion transforming into wonder" is told, not dramatized through their choices. Under Accumulative lens, the escalation is a single intensification (climbing, tying knot), which is minimal but acceptable; however, cost remains abstract and off-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of resilience/transformation emerges through concrete images (silk, arches, rubble, forge). The final image—arches grounded, Thistle forging silk-threaded bridges—offers a non-literal answer to "can brokenness be remade?" However, "bartered awakenings," "space between understanding and confusion," and "azure defiance" are repeated as prompt-label abstractions rather than earned insights from scene pressure. The ending avoids overt moralizing but the thematic vocabulary remains static and decorative across beats. No subtext operates in gesture or silence; every symbolic move is explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited on Thistle, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is generic: "quietly determined," "meek blacksmith" are repeated labels without character-specific filters shaping what he notices. Diction is uniform and elevated ("azure defiance," "bartered awakening") across all emotional states, showing no modulation under pressure. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Psychic distance remains fixed; no shifts to intensify peak beats. The prose reads as committee voice—polished but impersonal, with no syntactic signature tied to Thistle's mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "bartered awakening" appears six times, "azure defiance" four times, "quietly determined" three times, "space between understanding and confusion" twice—all without evolving meaning. Template cadence: "He [verb]" and "Thistle [verb]" stems dominate action sentences. Stock metaphors: "wounds in the orchard's skin," "sleeping giants waking." Figurative density in most sentences (silk "whispered," arches "sang," moonlight "painted") without pattern payoff. Mixed metaphor: silk as sky defiance, then structural reinforcement, then emotional state. Apply −1.4 for loops + cadence + stock strings; −0.3 additional for artifacts touching closure ("flags of victory over gravity"). Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise—meek artisan uses magic object to tame floating landmass—follows a familiar fantasy template without transformation. "Bartered awakening" and "azure defiance" function as prompt labels rather than specific, lived synthesis. The villagers' arc (confusion → wonder) is generic. The ending (Thistle forges bridges, planet sings new key) resolves into aspirational summary without concrete human cost or fresh moral calculus. No bold structural risk; the piece proceeds linearly with ornamental repetitions. Derivative Premise adjustment: −0.9 in Q8 for template reliance without transformation through detail or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Thistle is present throughout and his choices (enter shafts, weave silk, raise ladder, tie knot) drive beats. However, all key turns (silk arrives, shafts discovered, arches descend) occur off-page or via magic with no on-page cost tied to his decision-making. His "meek blacksmith" trait is asserted but never enables or constrains an action with visible trade-off. Setup clear, development present (building in shafts), closure present (climbs, arches descend). Functional but passive; the silk does the causal work. Cap at 3.8 for swappability (another character could perform these steps). Additive: early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7. Subtractive: summary-only key involvement −0.8, label-only trait −0.3, swappability −0.6. Final: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Magician's silk appears in five beats: arrival, touching/bartering, lining shafts, touching arch, final image as flags. It constrains (must be woven, must touch stone) and enables (lowers arches). Setup clear (paragraph 2), development (paragraphs 8, 10, 13, 17), closure (paragraph 24). However, its mechanics are opaque and it solves the problem without cost or scarcity. Not irreplaceable—any magic cloth could substitute. Additive: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4. Subtractive: swappability −0.8, ornamental final mention −0.3, resolves problem it didn't create −1.0. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" appears six times as a thematic label but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. Thistle does not barter anything concrete; the "exchange where understanding flowed out and confusion rushed in" is asserted in paragraph 3 without scene pressure or visible cost. The concept is ornamental mood rather than causal driver. Setup (paragraph 3), no development (never alters a choice), no closure participation (final paragraph mentions it as past summary). Cap at 2.8 for missing closure. Additive: none. Subtractive: late first use −0.2, ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3, summary-only −0.4. Final: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quietly determined" appears three times as a label (paragraphs 3, 9, 22) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It describes mood, not decision friction. No trade-off between determination and another impulse is dramatized. Setup (paragraph 3), development (paragraph 9: he works "with quietly determined precision"), closure (paragraph 22: he stands "quietly determined"). Present across beats but static. Cap at 3.8 for swappability (any resolve-label fits). Additive: early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9. Subtractive: label-only −0.8, swappability −0.6, ornamental −0.3. Final: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Deliberate" appears four times (paragraphs 5, 7, 16, 24) to describe Thistle's actions. It modifies steps, work, climbing, hammer strikes—mood rather than a unique action that defines turns. The major turn (ladder touches arch, arches descend) is not inherently deliberate; any method could be deliberate. Setup (paragraph 5), development (paragraphs 7, 16), closure (paragraph 24). Present but swappable. Cap at 4.6 for introduced after 40% (first functional use paragraph 7 ~28%). Additive: three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, early signal +0.4. Subtractive: swappability −0.8, ornamental −0.5, label-only −0.3. Final: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Abandoned mine shafts discovered (paragraph 4), used to line with silk and weave support (paragraphs 8, 10), and Thistle emerges from them with ladder (paragraph 12). The method shapes middle tactics (where he works) but the shafts' specific properties (depth, rubble, support beams) do not constrain or enable the outcome—he could have built the ladder elsewhere. Setup (paragraph 4 ~16%), development (paragraphs 8, 10), closure (paragraph 12 emergence, then shafts not mentioned in final image). Cap at 4.6 for late setup. Additive: two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6. Subtractive: late −0.4, swappability −0.6, ornamental −0.4. Final: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Orchard planet with floating arches anchors every beat: setting frames the premise, arches supply the obstacle and later the bridge, orchard provides social context (villagers watching). The arches' floating property is the central constraint and their descent the closure image. Setup (paragraph 1), development (arches hum paragraph 11, descend paragraphs 18–19), closure (paragraphs 20, 24: arches grounded, Thistle forging bridges). Irreplaceable. Additive: early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.8, specificity +0.7. Subtractive: postcard description in opening −0.5, spatial detail static mid-story −0.3. Final: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Between understanding and confusion" appears four times as thematic mood, never as a time constraint that tightens decisions. No clock, deadline, or urgency. Thistle works "at twilight" and "on the seventh night" but these markers do not alter tactics or pressure—he could work any night. Setup (paragraph 3), no development (time does not constrain middle choices), no closure participation (final paragraphs summarize aftermath with no time pressure). Cap at 2.8 for missing closure. Additive: early signal +0.3. Subtractive: ornamental −0.8, vague −0.5, label-only −0.3, summary-only −0.4. Final: 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To coax resilience from rubble" appears three times (paragraphs 10, 22, 26) as thematic label. Thistle's desire is told ("determined to forge something from ruin," paragraph 3) but never dramatized as conflicted choice with on-page cost. No friction between wanting resilience and another goal. Setup (paragraph 3 implied), development (paragraphs 10, 22 as description), closure (paragraph 26 summary). Cap at 4.6 for late functional development. Additive: early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7. Subtractive: told-only −0.8, label-only −0.3, swappability −0.6, ornamental −0.4. Final: 4.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Azure defiance" appears four times (paragraphs 2, 7, 11, 24) to describe silk, moonlight, and final mood. Tone is consistent (determined, wonder-tinged) and modulates slightly (meek opening → collective wonder → forging new things). The final image (silk fluttering, azure light painting orchard) charges tone with visual cohesion. Setup (paragraph 2), development (paragraphs 7, 11), closure (paragraph 24). However, "azure defiance" is prompt-label rather than earned mood shift, and emotional range remains narrow. Additive: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, cadence shift +0.5. Subtractive: static mood mid-story −0.5, label-only −0.3, ornamental mentions −0.4. Final: 5.3.</comment>
