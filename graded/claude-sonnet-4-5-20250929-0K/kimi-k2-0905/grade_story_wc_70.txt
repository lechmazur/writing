<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to preserve wonder is clearly articulated and her involuntary truthfulness creates constraint, but the boy vanishes without pressure and the final choice—speaking a lie to complete the riddle—feels more puzzle-mechanical than character-driven. The embodied detail is vivid (hair lifting, coins orbiting) yet the internal contradiction that should drive the lie remains abstract: she's told she must lie but we don't see her wrestle with the cost of abandoning her defining trait. The ending reconfigures her stance (gate open, toll waived) but the path from candid truth-teller to wonder-preserver lacks visible friction on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Mara, booth, tower, post-blackout) and the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: nectar-dusk imagery and wonder-versus-routine accumulate until the lightning strike reanimates the hive and Mara opens the gate. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the matchbox offering and open gate crystallize a new stance with cost (waived toll, abandoned protocol). The riddle mechanism ("speak the lie you never told") provides a clear tightening, and the coins etched with bees offer conceptual repricing. One minor slip: the boy's disappearance and the queen's agency are coincidental prompts rather than Mara-driven escalation, slightly diluting protagonist control at the inciting beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lightning tower, copper cones, glass booth, and melted wax frames are vivid and purpose-driven; the summit platform with "copper cones bristled like petrified sunflowers" charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy matches POV (ozone, cooling metal, sulfur) and the viewport glimpse of melted hexagons reweights Mara's resolve. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (booth → stairs → sealed hive chamber → summit → descent). The tower constrains her ascent (forbidden maintenance stairs) and the copper rods at the summit enable the final lightning strike, meeting the 9+ quick test for constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder against routine's erosion—is signaled early and the riddle mechanism provides one meaningful tightening that forces Mara to speak a lie, narrowing her options under the Accumulative lens. The lightning strike and coin transformation deliver a felt cost (she abandons her post, waives the toll, leaves the gate open) and reweight prior material. However, the boy's arrival and the riddle's origin (the queen) are coincidental gifts rather than protagonist-driven escalation; Mara reacts and completes a puzzle rather than forging the turn herself, which limits agency at the inciting and midpoint beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (wonder versus routine, truth versus necessary falsehood) emerges through concrete images—nectar dusk, melted wax, orbiting coins—rather than statement. The matchbox and riddle recur with reweighted meaning and the ending offers a non-literal answer: wonder is preserved not by literal truth but by the lie that keeps you honest, enacted through the open gate and waived toll. The final image (matchbox in ticket slot with a cryptic riddle promising "wonder preserved if you speak the lie that keeps you honest") risks thematic echo but the on-page cost (Mara's abandoned protocol, coins etched with bees) grounds it in particulars. No diagnostic label-speak touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: Mara notices ozone, brass heartbeats, nectar-dusk hues filtered through her eleven-year routine. Diction is controlled and distinctive ("fragile varnish over wonder," "involuntarily truthful stare," "proboscis") and the prose modulates from meditative opening to kinetic climax. One voice slip: "When nectar dusk hardens to night, seek the spark that never burned; open the sky where drones once yearned" reads more like authorial poetry than a riddle a tech would inscribe. The boy's single line of dialogue and Mara's response carry subtext (threshold-keeper, riddle-bearer) but brief duration limits full evaluation of dialogue naturalism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; figurative language ("sky bruise into nectar dusk," "copper bees") is vivid and voice-consistent. However, overwriting clusters in the opening third: "that slow pour of amber light that made even rust look sweet" and "the involuntarily truthful stare of someone who has seen systems fall" load elevated register without immediate pressure. Sentence stems vary but "the" and "she" openers recur across six consecutive paragraphs mid-piece, creating mild template cadence. No paraphrase loops and the climax propulsion is clean, keeping the score above 6.5, but the density and register wobbles prevent entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lightning harvesting, drone apiary, involuntary truthfulness, and riddle-as-threshold is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template fantasy or fable structures. The lie-to-preserve-honesty paradox transforms the truth-teller trope through grounded world logic (ionized air, engineered bees, toll-keeping routine) and the ending's open-gate gesture feels earned rather than convenient. Risk-taking is present (lyric compression, metaphor density, the vanishing boy) but the queen-as-offstage agent and the convenient riddle delivery keep the piece from full bold originality. Within band adjustment: +0.2 for the truthfulness constraint shaping the climax choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara appears in setup, chooses to ascend (middle beat), and opens the gate at closure. Her candid/truthful nature constrains the riddle solution and her toll-keeper role frames stakes. Two beats plus closure participation and specificity (involuntary truth, eleven-year routine) push above 6.0, but the boy's prompt and the queen's riddle drive turns more than Mara's internal conflict, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears early (boy offers it), is opened twice (first riddle, second riddle at summit), and snaps shut "of its own accord" before Mara places it on the turnstile as closure offering. Three beats, causal involvement (contains the riddles that drive action), and closure shaping. Specific properties (burnt-honey color, brass latch, matchbox inside) matter and the final placement reweights it as threshold gift. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The drone beehive failure is setup context (blackout killed the colony, hatch sealed), Mara passes the melted frames at midpoint (sharpens her purpose: "if the engineered bees could no longer bridge sky and hive, perhaps human curiosity could"), and the lightning reanimates wax into "glittering threads that hummed like tiny wings" at closure. Three gates met, concept shapes her motivation and the ending image, but the hive itself is passive backdrop—human action bridges the gap, not restored bee function. Lyric resonance and thematic weight lift it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's involuntary truthfulness is introduced early, constrains her response to the boy ("I keep nothing but the gate; take your riddle elsewhere"), and the riddle demands she "speak the lie you never told" at the climax, forcing a trade-off with visible cost. Two beats plus closure causal role. However, the trait is told more than shown—no scene demonstrates her inability to lie under pressure before the climax—and the final lie ("There is no wonder left") feels puzzle-answer rather than character-torn choice, limiting embodied friction. Setup, development, payoff present but specificity and cost legibility are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The reveal action is the riddle itself and its staged unveiling (matchbox painted with spiral, inner flap etching). First riddle propels Mara's ascent; second riddle at summit triggers the lie and lightning strike. Two beats, drives key turns, and the method is specific (matchbox → riddle → lie). However, the riddles are delivered rather than discovered through Mara's effort, and another puzzle or threshold test could substitute with moderate edits, capping irreplaceability below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The matchbox containing riddles is signaled early (boy opens lacquer box, strikes match, reveals first riddle), its mechanics matter (second riddle etched inside), and it shapes both the ascent decision and the climax lie. Three beats, causal pressure, and closure linkage. The warm-bread detail at the end recharges it. Specificity is high (spiral of bees, struck match, proboscis curl of paper) and the dual-riddle structure drives attempts. Strong integration; very close to 7.0+ but the coincidental delivery (boy vanishes, queen's gift) slightly lowers protagonist agency tied to the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower is setup anchor, frames all action, and its copper rods at summit enable the climax: Mara presses palms to copper, speaks the lie, and the sky answers with a bolt that cascades down. The maintenance stairs constrain her forbidden ascent, the sealed hive chamber reweights her purpose at midpoint, and the summit platform is the closure location. Three gates, strong causal role, and the tower's function (lightning harvest, ionized air causing truthfulness) is irreplaceable. Environment pressures every choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The blackout timeframe is setup context (tower dark, elevators dead, no visitors, drone colony collapsed) and creates the pressure-free window that allows Mara's forbidden ascent. It shapes her motivation (routine disrupted, wonder at risk) and the ending references "Dawn would bring engineers" as a clock edge. However, elapsed time during the ascent and climax is not tracked, and the blackout itself is passive backdrop rather than a ticking constraint. Setup and thematic weight present; moderate development and closure participation via the reboot threat, but no live countdown altering tactics. Mid-6s for coherent framing without acute time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's desire to preserve wonder is signaled early ("Routine, she believed, was a fragile varnish over wonder"), drives her ascent ("her motivation to preserve wonder in routine flared like the struck match"), and the ending enacts it (gate unlatched, toll waived, matchbox offering). Three beats, causal involvement, and closure shaping. The motivation is dramatized through her recalibration ritual, the ascent choice, and the final lie, with visible cost (abandoned protocol, waived toll). Friction between wonder-preservation and truth-constraint is present but could be sharper; the riddle solves the tension rather than Mara wrestling it on the page. Strong integration just above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nectar dusk is introduced early ("sky bruise into nectar dusk, that slow pour of amber light"), recurs as perceptual anchor (melted wax reflects "nectar dusk hues," Mara whispers "into the nectar dusk"), and the opening/closing frame ("nectar dusk" appears in final paragraph's riddle promise) creates lyric reprise. Tone is coherent—elegiac, liminal, charged with quiet magic—and modulates under pressure (meditative → kinetic ascent → charged climax → offering). The phrase functions as both setting detail and thematic motif, reweighting wonder-versus-routine. Four on-page uses across beats, charges the final image, and irreplaceable as the story's tonal signature. Strong integration across all gates.</comment>
