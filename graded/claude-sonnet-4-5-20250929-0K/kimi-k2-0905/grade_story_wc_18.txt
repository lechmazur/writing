<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker's interior life is grounded in craft-specific perception and embodied choices (pressing the sextant to her heart, slashing her palm). However, the emotional trajectory relies heavily on abstraction—"glass mountains of solitude," "aurora of childhood laughter"—rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation feels asserted by the world rather than earned through internal contradiction; she follows a ritual her mother taught without visible internal resistance or cost that forecloses a competing desire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page through a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dream is reintegrated, the orchard transforms, and the mirror maker's relationship to boundaries shifts from erasure to breathing them into new forms. The causal chain is legible—blood repairs the sextant, sextant tethers the dream, dream roots in the sapling—but the mechanics lean heavily on metaphor rather than choices under pressure. Cost is present (the bleeding palm, centuries of fog lifting) but feels more world-consequence than personal foreclosure of options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard, fog, and glass mountains establish a vivid, coherent dreamscape. The sextant's arc and the corridor of mirrors supply tactile anchors that constrain the protagonist's movements. However, the final sapling whose leaves are mirrors arrives late and resolves rather than complicates; the setting serves atmosphere more than it pressures tactics. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recapturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and drives the sequence. Escalation occurs through the breathing ritual and blood sacrifice, but the protagonist faces little opposition or narrowing dilemma; the dream "hesitates" and then folds inward without resistance. The cost (a slashed palm, three drops of blood) is visible but does not foreclose a live competing option or force a meaningful trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mechanics of breath, boundaries, and rootedness. The final image—"to erase boundaries does not mean to destroy them but to breathe them into new forms"—reconfigures the opening premise without overt moralizing. The sapling whose leaves hold the dream is a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor deduction for the penultimate paragraph's near-thesis statement, which edges toward thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV with stable third-limited focalization and a distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft (blowing glass from "sand and sighs," measuring altitude of dreams). Diction is elevated and lyric but consistent; the narrator's certainty matches the focalizer's knowledge. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor penalty for register density that occasionally slows comprehension ("cadence of frost forming on rusted gears") without dramatized pressure justifying the compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking ("aurora of childhood laughter," "silk collapsing into a needle's eye") but appears in nearly every sentence, creating textural overload in high-pressure beats. Several lines loop conceptually: "erase boundaries" is restated multiple times without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates purposefully. No major clarity breaks, but the density dulls propulsion in the corridor sequence where stakes are highest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror-making, breath synchronization, and dream-catching offers a fresh angle on reclaiming the self. The blood-soldering of the sextant and the sapling whose leaves are mirrors are specific, non-obvious images. However, the orchard-as-birthplace and mother-taught-ritual lean on familiar templates; the emotional arc (reclaiming a lost part of oneself) is executed with lyric confidence but does not transform the premise in a structurally surprising way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker's choices—pressing the sextant to her heart, beginning the breath cycle, slashing her palm—drive the sequence. She appears early and her decisions alter tactics (the breathing unlocks the corridor, the blood repairs the sextant). However, the final transformation largely happens to her; after the blood sacrifice, the dream "folded into her chest" and the orchard "exhaled" without further on-page decision. Two beats of clear agency (breath, blood) earn mid-6s; lack of a third decision at closure caps further rise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sextant appears in paragraph 3 (setup), is pressed to her heart to match her pulse (middle beat), slashed with blood to repair and tether the dream (climactic beat), then pocketed "cool and ordinary" at the end (closure reprise). It constrains her method (cannot measure dreams while broken) and enables the solution (glows with starlight, sights the dream). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceability is high (an astronomer's tool measuring dreams). Stops short of 8.5+ because the repair mechanism (blood-soldering) is asserted rather than foreshadowed.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries is named in paragraph 4, drives the mirror's failure (it "remained a dull slab, unable to silver the fog"), and is repriced at closure ("to erase boundaries does not mean to destroy them but to breathe them into new forms"). The concept shapes the stakes (she must redefine her approach to boundaries) but does not constrain tactics on the page; the protagonist follows a pre-taught ritual rather than discovering the distinction mid-scene. Lyric reprise reweights meaning, earning low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears in the opening phrase and is echoed in the closing image ("firmly grounded yet open to the shimmer"). It reads as tonal anchor and thematic bookend but does not constrain an on-page action. The protagonist's groundedness is not tested against a temptation to flee or dissolve; the trait is asserted rather than dramatized with cost. Lyric resonance without causal pressure trends mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Recreate" is named in the opening ("recreate the lost boundary") and invoked in the ritual clause ("What was lost, recreate"). The action drives the protagonist's goal, but the story's major turns trace to "recapture" and "reintegrate" rather than recreate per se; the dream already exists and must be caught, not rebuilt. The term charges the thematic resolution but is not irreplaceable; "reclaim" or "restore" would function similarly. Setup and closure presence with moderate causal pressure earn low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Synchronized breathing is introduced in paragraph 7 ("inhale for seven counts… exhale for five counts"), performed across paragraph 8 ("Each cycle stitched a filament"), and used again at closure ("she drew the dream closer—inhale to accept… exhale to anchor"). The method opens the corridor, tethers the dream, and is echoed in her final walk home ("seven-five rhythm"). Mechanics are signaled and shape multiple attempts. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; specificity (the exact counts, the mother's teaching) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard is the opening location, "birthplace of every mirror she had ever blown," and transforms at closure (trees straighten, fog retreats). It supplies emotional resonance and frames the ritual but does not pressure her choices; she could perform the same actions elsewhere. The fog complicates visibility but does not block her path or force a tactical adaptation. Setup and closure presence with thematic weight but minimal causal constraint earn mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Upon the shimmer of twilight frost" opens the story and is echoed at closure ("last twilight," "night closed its lid"). The timeframe establishes mood and marks the ritual's duration but does not tighten decisions; no clock pressure or deadline alters her tactics. The frost serves as a tactile anchor (forming on gears, melting into dew) but is ornamental rather than time-constraint. Lyric bookend without causal urgency trends low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Capturing the runaway dream is named in paragraph 4 ("recapture what was hers") and drives the entire sequence: returning to the orchard, performing the breath ritual, slashing her palm. The desire is dramatized through action and carries emotional cost (the dream tore free when she tried to trap it). However, no competing want creates friction; she pursues recapture without hesitation or ambivalence. One-track motivation with strong causal pressure but no internal conflict caps at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Glass mountains" appears three times: once as metaphor for solitude (paragraph 4), once as distant backdrop (paragraph 9), and once rooted in soil at closure (paragraph 20). The phrase supplies a tonal signature—brittle, transparent, remote—that modulates with the orchard's transformation. However, tone does not constrain choices or shift under pressure; the register remains consistently lyric and elevated. Purposeful reprise that reweights the image at closure earns mid-5s.</comment>
