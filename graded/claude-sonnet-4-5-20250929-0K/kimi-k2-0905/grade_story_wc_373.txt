<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is consistently filtered through a moonshine-runner legacy ("liquid night," "jars of white lightning") with embodied hesitation ("each stride dying halfway," "half-moons into my skin"). Internal contradiction surfaces when she wants her father to stop her yet proceeds with the trade—this proves she craves the rescue that would preserve trust. The closing realization ("a weight I had mistaken for love") lands as earned renunciation with visible cost: she walks away lighter but emptied. Minor: Jonah's lighthouse-eyes metaphor skirts decorative; his secondary presence could carry more immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accumulates through density increase (waiting hours, rehearsing betrayals, tide rising) and cadence shift at dawn ("a breath away"). Orientation anchors (pier market, narrator with fob, Jonah with phonograph) land clearly by line 7. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator forfeits the fob and the father-bond with it, foreclosing rescue and accepting the "silence no one could sell back." Cost is visible in the "small wet click" and the walk through daylight with gulls "screaming news of my betrayal." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the ending reweights trust as a burden she chose to shed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pier market is sensory-specific (barnacled pilings, lanterns on rusted chains, crates of contraband) and filtered through the narrator's criminal heritage. Micro-setting: the fob itself functions as charged object—its tail digs half-moons, its soundless ticking grows louder, and tide licking crates adds urgency. The phonograph horn "so close to my chest" constrains the recording and charges the final act. Minor: "comforting unease of the market" tells tone rather than showing through contradictory sensory cues. Spatial choreography remains clear across the wait and dawn handoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: trade the fob to record trust breaking before sunrise. One tightening: rehearsed rescues fail, tide rises, dawn arrives—each narrows the window for reversal. Agency is present: the narrator chooses to open her fist despite wanting the father to intervene, foreclosing the bond. Cost is legible in the "small wet click" and the gulls' broadcast, plus the felt emptiness. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through rising density and the cadence shift at first light. Minor: Jonah's passive role (he nods, waits, records) limits interpersonal friction; the father's off-stage absence is thematically apt but reduces on-page opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (trust as corrodible weight vs. preservable bond) emerges through the fob's shifting charge: heirloom → truce token → traded proof → absence that lightens. The ending offers non-literal answer: she mistakes possessive love for connection and sheds it by choice, the gulls' accusation registering as external judgment she now accepts. Subtext operates in Jonah's wordless nod, the rehearsed betrayals that reveal her wish for rescue, and the widow's tear-diamond callback. The final line ("listening for the sound of trust breaking again") implies she now owns the rupture and may repeat the pattern—complexity without neat resolution. No overt moralizing; the cylinder label "Trust of the Moonshine Runner's Daughter" functions as in-world artifact, not authorial thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: contraband imagery, maritime metaphors ("slipped," "liquid night," "fish gutted on deck"), and inherited criminal diction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the wait ("half-moons into my skin"), pulling back for the market overview. Rhythm tightens at dawn: "I opened my fist. The mermaid dropped…" No head-hopping; Jonah's calm is read externally. Minor: "comforting unease" and "curiosity steadfast" edge toward oxymoron decoration rather than embodied contradiction. Filter verbs ("I realized," "I felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or pressure) with strong figurative control: "slapped," "hummed," "bruised lavender," "fish gutted on deck." Sentence openings vary; paragraphs breathe with the waiting rhythm. Minor penalties: "curious steadfast" and "comforting unease" are oxymoron labels rather than dramatized sensations (−0.3). "Hours dilated like pupils" is vivid but the simile vehicle (pupils dilate in darkness, not time) strains coherence (−0.2). The widow anecdote mid-story adds texture but momentarily stalls forward momentum (−0.2). No loops or template cadence; pronoun references stay clear. The final image ("lighter, emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love") borders on summary but the prior "small wet click" anchors it in scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise (recording feelings on wax, trading a family heirloom to capture trust breaking) is specific and non-obvious. The widow's tear-diamond and Jonah's phonograph anchor fresh world logic. Risk: structuring around a wait with off-stage father could flatten, but the narrator's contradictory rehearsals and the accumulative tide create texture. Transformation test: swapping names/places would lose the moonshine legacy and pirate-market idiom. Minor: the father's total absence and Jonah's passive cooperation reduce friction; a small on-page complication (e.g., phonograph malfunction, market intrusion) could sharpen stakes. The final reweighting (love as mistaken weight) grows from prior particulars and avoids platitude.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: narrator introduced immediately as moonshine runner's daughter carrying the fob with intent to trade. Development: she rehearses betrayals, wants rescue, yet waits through the night. Closure: she opens her fist and drops the fob, the defining choice that breaks trust and forecloses the bond. Causal pressure across three beats; the choice is irreplaceable (removing her agency collapses the arc). Cost visible in the "small wet click" and aftermath walk.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: fob introduced paragraph 4 as "antique watch fob, a silver mermaid." Development: its tail digs half-moons into her palm during the wait (embodied pressure); it ticks louder despite having no gears (mounting anxiety). Closure: the mermaid drops "tail flicking once like a fish gutted on deck," the physical act that seals the trade. Three distinct beats with evolving sensory charge; irreplaceable (the story's hinge object). Cost tied directly to its surrender.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "truce of hush" explained paragraph 5 as mechanism (whoever holds fob can ask one unspoken favor, receive silence not betrayal). Development: the truce governs the wait—Jonah agrees without words, the market whispers. Closure: "The truce of hush dissolved with the night." Two-gate presence (setup, closure reprise) with thematic linkage but minimal mid-scene constraint. The concept frames stakes but doesn't narrow tactics; removing it and calling the fob a "deal token" would retain structure. Score reflects lyric resonance and thematic charge but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: Jonah described as "curiously steadfast smuggler who never left this pier" (paragraph 7). Development: his steadfastness enables the wait (he's always there, willing to record) but the trait doesn't constrain an on-page choice or reveal cost. Closure: he tucks the cylinder beside other bottles, consistent with the trait but passive. Label-only at setup; functional enabler in middle; no visible tradeoff. Swappable with "reliable" or "patient."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setup: narrator states "I rehearsed betrayals: Father arriving to thwart me" (paragraph 22). Development: the imagined thwarting never materializes; its absence (father doesn't arrive) deepens her realization that she wants rescue. Closure: the absence of thwarting allows the trade to proceed. The action shapes understanding via negation (its non-occurrence is the point) but doesn't create an on-page reversal. One-gate participation (middle reflection) with oblique causal role; removing "thwart" and substituting "stop" requires only synonym edit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "I stepped through false starts of courage, each stride dying halfway" (paragraph 13). Development: the false starts embody her hesitation and wish for rescue during the approach to Jonah. Closure: the final act (opening fist, dropping fob) succeeds after the waiting period, implying the false starts were preparation. Two-gate presence (setup, implied resolution) with embodied method mid-scene. Removing "false starts" and describing generic hesitation would lose the specific rhythm but not break structure. Lyric resonance lifts score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "pirate market…below deck. Lanterns swung from rusted chains, throwing gold across crates of contraband" (paragraphs 2–3). Development: the market's whispers create atmosphere; rising tide licking crates adds urgency and tracks time toward dawn. Closure: daylight spears through cracks, the market resumes shouting—environmental shift marks the truce's end. Three beats with causal and atmospheric pressure; the rotting-pier decay and hidden location anchor the illicit trade. Micro-setting (fob, phonograph) carries more immediate choice-pressure, but the market supplies essential context and time constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "I needed that silence to stretch until sunrise" (paragraph 6); "until sunrise the mermaid stayed against my palm" (paragraph 17). Development: "Hours dilated," tide rises, "still no sign of him," tracking the wait. Closure: "eastern sky bruised lavender…sunrise was a breath away. I opened my fist." The timeframe is live clock that tightens decisions (she must decide by dawn), tracked across multiple beats, and triggers the final act. Irreplaceable: removing the deadline removes the ticking urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "I wanted him to record the sound of trust breaking—my own trust in my father" (paragraph 10). Development: conflicted execution—she wants the recording yet wants father to stop her, revealing she's testing whether love will intervene. Closure: the trade proceeds, trust audibly breaks ("small wet click"), and she walks away with the captured sound. Three beats with visible friction between stated want (proof of corrosion) and hidden want (rescue). Cost legible in the aftermath emptiness. High causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "comforting unease of the market" (paragraph 14) labels the tone. Development: tone modulates—hope dying in "slow ticks," rehearsed betrayals, deepening unease as tide rises, then the dawn's "bruised lavender" quiet. Closure: voices "felt kinder" despite betrayal accusation, the contradiction sustaining the comforting-unease register in the ending image. Coherent across turns with cadence shift at dawn; the oxymoron is consistent but told more than shown through contradictory sensory cues. Charges final image without full embodiment.</comment>
