<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "steal back" unlearned lessons is declared but never internalized through embodied conflict or contradictory impulses. The time traveler remains a prop whose interiority is never dramatized; his "managed nod" and "gasping" are token gestures. The botanical diary's mechanics (ink-flowers opening to synonyms for regret, seeds falling through commas) function as magical solutions rather than choices that reveal character under pressure. The final choice—releasing absences into cities—carries no visible cost or forfeiture that closes a path; it reads as thematic assertion rather than earned agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed: who Elara is, where she begins, and what she seeks remain abstract until well past the opening third. The drive lens is ambiguous throughout—moments read causal (time traveler rescue), accumulative (seed metaphors), and situational (library cipher), but none coheres at closure. The ending offers no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; Elara "releases absences" and steps "into the next sentence" without foreclosing a path or paying a legible cost. The cipher resolution (hybrid bud exhales a word; Elara loses one year) is narrated in summary without dramatized stakes or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain setting provide vivid, specific imagery (obsidian shelf, root-walls spelling warnings, staircase disguised as glossary). However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or shaping tactics; Elara navigates via magical diary mechanics, not spatial pressure. The body is rarely grounded—Elara kneels, whispers, and climbs, but these actions do not engage the environment in tactile, lived-in ways. The final ridge scene offers no micro-setting constraint that charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieving unlearned lessons to prevent war—is declared but never tested by a meaningful tightening or trade-off. The cipher puzzle is solved via magical convenience (hybrid bud exhales the word) rather than protagonist agency or escalating pressure. The year Elara loses to unlock the door is narrated in one line without dramatized cost or altered tactics. No reversal or deepening forces a choice between competing goods; the time traveler's debt is "repaid" through summary without on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Theme is asserted through overt statements ("rescue missions never end; they merely change dialects") and prompt-echo labels ("library of unlearned lessons," "unheard symphony") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The botanical diary, ink-flowers, and seed metaphors are ornamental rather than causally integrated with character choice. The final image—historians avoiding errors due to a "faint cello chord"—states the theme without a resonant non-literal answer. Thematic echo penalty applies: the closing paragraph articulates the thesis in meta-commentary rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistently ornate and lyric, but perceptual signature remains generic across high and low pressure moments. Elara's diction never modulates with urgency; phrases like "carefully resourceful" and "a symphonic note" read as external labels rather than embodied perception. The time traveler's dialogue ("I can cut the sentence") and Elara's reply are exposition disguised as conversation, lacking subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance is stable but lacks character-particular texture; the prose reads as committee voice rather than a singular perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "carefully resourceful" appears twice as a label; "unheard symphony" is recycled in identical phrasing across four paragraphs. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("She carried…," "She descended…," "She filled…," "She turned…"). Stock metaphors cluster without pattern-teaching: "corridors spiraled like a staff line," "air tasted of unheard symphony," "ink-flowers that opened when Elara whispered." Filter-verb stacks ("she reminded herself," "she offered," "she proposed") dull immediacy in peak beats. The closure beat is obscured by summary ("released the absences, watching them drift") rather than concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—library of unlearned lessons accessed via botanical diary and linguistic puzzles—combines familiar fantasy tropes (magical library, sentient books, arcane keys) without fresh synthesis. The core conflict (unlock the door, retrieve mistakes) resolves via magical convenience (hybrid bud exhales the missing word) rather than character-driven ingenuity. Emotional beats follow template paths: the time traveler is rescued, the cipher is solved, the lessons are released, and Elara continues her mission. No bold risk or non-obvious angle transforms the material; the story reads as a competent execution of prompt elements without durable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes surface-level decisions (kneels, tears a page, crushes an illustration, whispers synonyms), but these actions do not create key turns or foreclose paths with cost. Her observation and narration dominate; agency is reactive rather than shaping. Present in all three gates but functional role is replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in multiple beats (night-blooming clematis points toward a gap, "Solanum for Silence" folded into a compass, "Verbena for Volition" crushed to free the time traveler, gaps researched to breed extinct pronouns). It constrains mid-story choices and participates in the cipher resolution. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized with cost, and its final appearance (open on a desk with clematis pointing) is static rather than reweighted. Strong beat involvement but closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Rescue missions frame the premise (Elara rescues the time traveler, retrieves unlearned lessons) but function as thematic echo rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is declared in summary ("Rescue missions, she reminded herself, begin by researching gaps") and restated at the end without altering options. Present in setup and closure framing but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" appears twice as a label ("carefully resourceful" in paragraph 6, "carefully resourceful again" in paragraph 18) but does not constrain or enable action with visible cost. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through trade-offs or tactical choices. Decorative mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Renegotiation appears twice: Elara offers to "cut the sentence" if the narrative demands renegotiation, and later proposes renegotiation to balance the time traveler's debt. The second instance shapes the cipher puzzle (crossbreeding extinct pronouns with seeds). However, the action is narrated in summary without dramatized stakes or visible cost. Present in middle and closure gates; causal role in one major beat but replaceable in execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is declared early ("rescue missions begin by researching gaps") and returns at the cipher puzzle ("worked by researching gaps in the botanical diary"). The method is asserted but its mechanics are not shown; the actual problem-solving is handled via magical convenience (hybrid bud exhales the word). Present in setup and middle but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying a mountain provides vivid setting across multiple beats (obsidian shelf, corridors spiraling like staff lines, staircase disguised as glossary, root-walls, windy ridge). However, the setting does not constrain tactics or supply resources that alter outcome; Elara navigates via diary mechanics rather than spatial pressure. Present in all three gates; postcard description with minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the time traveler arrives" is mentioned in the opening but does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. Time remains vague and untracked; no clock or urgency alters moves. The time traveler's chronometer "sparking with displaced seconds" is atmospheric detail without causal function. Present in setup only; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find the library of unlearned lessons is declared early ("her motivation sharpened: inside were the mistakes civilizations forgot") and frames the quest. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. The stakes (prevent war) remain abstract and untested. Present in setup and middle framing but label-only execution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears in multiple beats (air tasted of unheard symphony, symphony resolved into a cello note, symphony swelling into crescendo, symphony poised for another rescue) and modulates from faint to crescendo. However, the tone is static lyricism throughout; no coherent pressure shift or tonal reconfiguration charges the final image. Present in setup, middle, and closure but recycled phrasing without evolving charge.</comment>
