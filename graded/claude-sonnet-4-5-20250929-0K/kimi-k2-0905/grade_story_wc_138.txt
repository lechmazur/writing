<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vey's boredom and pursuit of "goodbye" provide motivation, and the choice to pass through the door is earned by the compulsion-transfer setup. However, interiority remains abstract ("iron boredom in his blood," "centuries cracking like ice") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The technicians appear only to facilitate plot rather than apply secondary pressure, and Vey's internal conflict is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive by the opening beat (who: Vey; where: prismatic escondite; when: during solar storm). The causal chain—fragment compels Vey → he finds technicians → amulet completes → door appears → Vey steps through—holds under a Causal lens. Closure lands on-page: Vey proceeds into darkness, choosing to relinquish memory, a Decisive Change with felt cost (loss of infinite time, unknown afterward). One persistent constraint (amulet's magnetic compulsion) shapes tactics throughout, and the cost is legible in "time peel away" and the woman's "restless pilgrimage."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The escondite's crystalline, folding corridors are vivid and contribute atmosphere. The solar storm provides urgency (anchors fail at predicted moment) and the storm's plasma painting walls vermilion adds sensory texture. The wooden door functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear through descent and the technicians' ring formation. However, setting detail occasionally leans decorative ("walls grew choral, colors singing") without constraining a tactical choice beyond the storm's anchor-failure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Vey's search for what lies after goodbye—is signaled early and tightens when the amulet reveals the door. The technicians' mutiny complicates but does not resolve; Vey's agency (passing the amulet, stepping through) drives the turn. One meaningful deepening occurs when Vey offers exile in exchange for help, narrowing options and forcing a trade-off. Cost is visible: Vey surrenders immortality's certainty, the woman inherits compelled wandering. Escalation is linear rather than multi-reversal, fitting the length, though the storm's anchor failure reads slightly coincidental in timing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—what happens after goodbye, the weight of infinite time versus unknown finality—emerges through the amulet's directional curse, Vey's choice to proceed rather than remember, and the woman's inherited pilgrimage. The wooden door and recurring "goodbye" reweight prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in Vey's soft address to the technicians and the darkness "soft as a lover's last breath." The final image (silence ringing like thunder, corridors pointing "toward elsewhere") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "unmarked, unmeasured, unruled" trends abstract when concrete particulars would sharpen the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Vey; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("dimensionally aware," "Möbius sigh," "magnetic moans") but occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction under pressure ("colors singing in hushed thunder"). The technicians' brief dialogue ("What happens after goodbye?") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is present (walls remember footsteps, futures reflected) but the register stays uniformly ornate rather than modulating with stress. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("felt," "sensed") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-motivated necessity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("bruise inside the sky," "magnetic moans," "Möbius sigh," "choral walls") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure; this triggers overwriting deductions. Paraphrase loop appears: "The hush between thunder and echo" opening is echoed by "hush thickened until footfalls sounded like distant thunder." Template cadence in the technicians' scene: "Their whispers braided… / They spoke of Vey…" Sentence openings vary, but information density is uneven—several lines (e.g., "sandals silent on glass that reflected futures") add texture without advancing plot or choice. No causality breaks, so artifacts remain in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of immortal ennui, cursed magnetic compulsion, and dimensional mutiny during a solar storm offers specificity. The amulet transferring compulsion to ensure the station "wander but never anchor under tyrants" is a non-obvious turn. However, the core emotional arc—weary immortal seeks escape—is familiar, and the resolution (stepping into unknown darkness) does not transform the template through unexpected moral calculus or lived detail that would make it irreplaceable. The technicians' mutiny subplot feels adjacent rather than integral. Risk-taking in tone and structure is present but does not fully elevate originality into high bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vey (bored immortal) is present throughout, makes the key choice to step through the door, and that decision alters the ending. Setup: established in opening. Development: follows the amulet's pull, negotiates with technicians. Payoff: steps through threshold, choosing "proceed." Causal pressure is moderate—boredom motivates pursuit, but internal conflict between memory and unknown is told more than enacted. Cost is tied to the character (relinquishing infinite time). Swappability is low; removing "immortal" would collapse the stake. Two-gate minimum met; all three gates present; causal linkage and closure participation earn mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cursed amulet fragment appears in three beats: tumbles and hooks Vey's blood (setup), merges with second shard showing the door vision (development), transferred to the woman binding her to pilgrimage (payoff). Each use advances plot and reweights meaning. Specificity: "polar hunger," magnetic compulsion, its curse is direction not death. Cost connection: Vey's compulsion transfers, ensuring station wanders. Irreplaceability high—removing it breaks the causal chain to the door. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and unique properties place it in upper-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny (the technicians' plan to redirect the station into a pocket universe) is signaled midpoint and complicates Vey's path but does not drive the ending. Setup: technicians whisper mutiny. Development: Vey overhears and offers a deal. Payoff: mutiny is abandoned; technicians help Vey instead. The concept shapes one middle beat (the negotiation) but is easily swappable—any shared goal requiring cooperation would serve. The station's dimensional instability is more active than the "mutiny" itself. Two gates met (development, minimal closure presence via station stabilizing afterward). Functional but replaceable; mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware: mentioned twice ("dimensionally aware enough to feel the word bend space"; Vey senses others ahead) but does not constrain an on-page action with cost. Setup: present early as label. Development: enables Vey to sense the technicians, a minor convenience. Payoff: absent from closure. The trait facilitates perception but never forces a trade-off or alters tactics. Swappability high—"magically sensitive" or "perceptive" would serve equally. One gate (setup) met; ornamental use. Low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Intrigue: Vey "felt the fragment's magnetic field hook… and tug" begins pursuit; he steps into the technicians' light, and the plot turns on his offer. Setup: fragment appearance triggers intrigue. Development: discovery of technicians and their plan. Payoff: intrigue leads to cooperation, enabling door access. The action is functional but could be reframed as "pursuit" or "negotiation" with minimal edits. Two gates met; causal role in one major beat (the offer). Shapes one key turn; mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Through magnetic fields: the amulet's "polar hunger" and "magnetic field hook" compel Vey; shards leap together "magnetized"; storm's "solar ions braided through the lattice"; "magnetic fields guiding their procession"; amulet transfers binding the woman. Setup: signaled early (fragment's magnetic pull). Development: two shards merge via magnetism, guiding the path. Payoff: amulet's magnetic curse transfers, shaping the woman's future. Mechanics matter and recur across beats. Specificity moderate—"magnetic" is literal and functional, not metaphoric. Three gates met; multi-beat involvement; closure linkage. Mid-to-upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite: corridors fold, walls remember footsteps, "choral" colors, dimensions swap at anchor failure. Setup: established in opening line. Development: corridors twist during storm, spatial instability enables the door's appearance. Payoff: "corridors settling into new angles" after Vey's departure. The setting pressures choices (anchor failure tightens timing) and supplies the door as resource. Specificity high (prismatic, folding, crystalline). Three gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present. Upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>During a solar storm: storm cracks radio bands at opening, plasma paints walls, "at the predicted moment, anchors failed," time constraint is signaled. Setup: present in opening. Development: storm's peak determines when anchors fail, tightening the window. Payoff: storm enables the dimensional swap that reveals the door. Time is tracked and matters, though the "predicted moment" reads slightly vague. Two gates clearly met (setup, development); payoff linkage moderate. Functional clock that alters one tactic. Low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To discover what happens after goodbye: Vey's search for "every possible afterward" is stated early; he asks the technicians for help to "discover"; at threshold he "chose proceed." Setup: motivation established in backstory (mortal lover's goodbye). Development: amulet reveals the door as the answer. Payoff: Vey steps through, enacting the desire. Friction is present (infinite time versus unknown) but mostly told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants in a scene. Three gates met; causal linkage clear; cost visible. Mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Hushed thunder: "hush between thunder and echo" opens; "low magnetic moans"; "walls grew choral… hushed thunder"; "footfalls sounded like distant thunder muffled under velvet"; "silence… rang like thunder." Tone recurs and modulates—quiet yet charged. Setup: established in opening. Development: tone intensifies as pressure builds ("hush thickened"). Payoff: final silence "rang like thunder," recharging the motif with cost (Vey's formerly infinite heart now hollow). Coherent through turns, charges the final image. Three gates met; strong closure linkage. Low-7s.</comment>
