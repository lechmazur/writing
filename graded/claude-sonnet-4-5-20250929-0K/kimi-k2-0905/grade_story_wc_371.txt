<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mila's occupation as "creeping normality noticer" is vivid, but her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to plant the bread is motivated by external instruction from the gardener rather than internal conflict, reducing agency. Emotional progression—tears at the reopened bakery—feels earnest but arrives without the layered irrationality or self-deception that would elevate it. The final stance (accepting tenuous absolution) is signaled but not earned through a visible on-page choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the bread-planting sequence builds density through repeated ritual acts, and the closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via the final image of Mila as gardener with "soil under nails now hers." However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single choice visibly forecloses a path or alters tactics. The Orientation Test is satisfied (Mila, Rue des Aubes, post-migration season anchored early). The middle deepening (guerrilla gardening across seven sites) adds texture but does not narrow options or create a live trade-off. The ending reconfigures Mila's identity but lacks the felt price required for high-band closure under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The palace courtyard and tea house supply vivid, specific anchors—cracked marble, paper lanterns, mosaic gods—that recur and charge the closure image. The bread itself functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and reweighted at the end. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (flour ghosts, tea-steam sighs). The courtyard constrains Mila's final choice to remain and cultivate, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting pressure on closure, though the choice itself feels more thematic acceptance than hard trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving city memory against erasure—is signaled early and remains coherent. The guerrilla gardening sequence provides one meaningful deepening (shops beginning to reveal older paint), but this happens passively rather than through a choice that narrows options. No reversal or trade-off appears; Mila's path widens rather than tightens. Agency is limited: the gardener instructs, Mila executes, and outcomes unfold without visible cost or sacrifice. The ending reconfigures meaning but does not test Mila's commitment under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (absolution as cultivation, sacred in ordinary) emerges through concrete particulars—bread as daily resurrection, shoots spelling shop names—without explicit moralizing. The final image (doorways as altars, commuters as potential gardeners) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor weakness: "heuristically gentle" and "tenuous absolution" appear as thematic labels rather than fully dramatized costs. The bread-crust motif constrains at least one choice (Mila's gentle handling) and recharges at closure, lifting thematic integration above the mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; Mila's perceptual signature (noticing drift, naming vanished streets) is distinct and consistent. Diction ("flour ghosts," "tea-steam sighs") is purposeful and voice-specific. However, elevated lyricism pervades nearly every sentence, creating a uniform textural density that flattens urgency—high-pressure beats (planting at night, pressing palm to mosaic) carry the same ornate cadence as reflective passages. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but the syntactic rhythm is too uniform to modulate with scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative language appears in most sentences without variation in density or payoff: "absolution felt tenuous," "uncloak," "yeast" metaphor, "name tags," "liturgy against forgetting"—each individually clear but stacked to the point of overwriting. Template cadence is minimal, but paraphrase loops appear: "heuristically gentle" recurs three times without added pressure. Sentence openings vary well ("One gray dawn," "At dawn," "Morning after morning"), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (setting and theme), but some beats rephrase prior content (e.g., absolution stays tenuous across multiple paragraphs).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—guerrilla gardening as memory preservation via literal bread-planting—is fresh and specific, not a template plot. The occupation (creeping normality noticer) and the gardener's instruction avoid stock roles. However, the emotional arc (loss → ritual → acceptance) is familiar, and the resolution (Mila becomes gardener, city begins to remember) does not surprise in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, lyric) is present but legible; no obscurity. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging, lifting it above mid-band despite the arc's predictability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mila's role as "creeping normality noticer" is established early and shapes her recognition of the bread as miracle, meeting the Setup gate. In the middle, her noticing (shops revealing older paint, shoots spelling names) drives observation but not decision—she does not alter tactics based on what she sees. At closure, her noticing persists ("every ordinary doorway possible altar") but remains observational rather than choice-driving. The character is present across beats but her decisions are externally prompted (gardener's instruction), limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bread appears early (gray dawn at vanished bakery), is handled gently and carried as evidence (middle beats), divided into seven pieces for planting (guerrilla gardening sequence), and returns at closure as "final crust" pocketed as reminder. It evolves from miracle object to agent of memory cultivation, its warmth and sanctity reweighted as "ordinary" by the end. Present in three distinct beats (discovery, planting, closure reprise) with clear causal role: the bread's existence prompts the gardener's instruction, its planting generates shoots, and the crust anchors Mila's final stance. High integration, though the cost tied specifically to the bread (rather than the general gardening effort) is less sharp.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named early ("city's absolution felt tenuous") and recurs thematically across beats: Mila fears eating the loaf "might seal the amnesia," the gardener describes "guilt rises like yeast," and the ending states "absolution stays tenuous only if left unleavened." It shapes Mila's tactic (plant rather than eat) and charges the closure image (needing continuous cultivation). However, the concept functions more as thematic overlay than as a constraint with visible cost—Mila does not sacrifice or forfeit something specific to pursue absolution, and the "tenuousness" is asserted rather than tested by a hard choice. Present across beats and linked to closure, but the pressure it exerts is conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" appears three times: Mila wraps the bread "heuristically gentle," they plant "heuristically gentle," and the ending repeats "heuristically gentle, knowing absolution stays tenuous." The trait is named but not dramatized as a trade-off—gentleness does not visibly cost Mila speed, safety, or another option. The adverb "heuristically" reads as elevated diction without adding specificity (what heuristic guides her gentleness?). The trait is present but functions as a label rather than a constraint that alters tactics with cost. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development (a choice forced by the need for gentleness) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears twice: herbs "spelling old shop names" as shops "uncloak" (revealing older paint), and palace stones "began to uncloak: mosaics brightened." The action is metaphorical rather than a physical deed Mila performs; the world uncloaks itself in response to her planting. It shapes the middle turn (shops revealing their history) and charges the closure image ("uncloak the world beneath the world"), but Mila does not execute "uncloaking" as a tactic—she plants, and uncloaking follows passively. The action is thematically central but not a lever Mila pulls with visible cost or agency. Present in middle and closure, but swappable with "reveal" or "restore" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is named explicitly in the middle ("The method she proposed was guerrilla gardening") and its mechanics matter: Mila and the gardener move by moonlight, dig thumb-sized holes, slip in dough, cover with seedlings, whisper erased street names. The method shapes multiple beats (planting at seven sites, shoots growing with breadcrust armor, benches appearing at gardens) and is causally necessary—without the specific act of burying bread at intersections, the memory restoration does not occur. Present in setup (gardener's proposal), development (repeated planting), and closure (Mila will scatter seed from sacred herbs). The method drives the story's pressure and is irreplaceable, though the cost specific to this method (risk of scrutiny, physical effort) is understated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "secret tea house in an overgrown palace courtyard" is discovered mid-story after Mila carries the bread through narrowing alleys. It supplies the gardener (who instructs Mila), provides a ritual space (tea, paper lanterns, cracked marble), and anchors the closure image (Mila will "brew tea among ruins that refuse to forget"). The courtyard recurs across beats and charges the final stance, but it does not pressure Mila's choices—she arrives, receives instruction, and returns; the space is sanctuary rather than constraint. Setup is delayed (appears after ~25%), development is present (gardener's instruction), and closure participation is strong (Mila's final identity as tea-brewer in courtyard). Integration is solid but the setting does not force a trade-off or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" frames the opening and closing ("In the hush after the birds fly south" / "When the birds fly back north"), establishing seasonal time. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—weeks pass without urgency, Mila plants at leisure, and the ending projects forward to spring ("when the birds return") without live pressure. The seasonal marker functions as lyric atmosphere rather than a clock that forces choices. Setup and closure participation are present via the frame, but middle development (a deadline or time-driven cost) is absent. The time element is purposeful for tone but replaceable with minimal structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the sacred in the ordinary" is dramatized through Mila's choice to plant bread rather than eat it, her recognition that "bread is daily resurrection," and her tears tasting "ordinary bread" at the reopened bakery. The desire is signaled early (Mila carries the loaf "like evidence") and tested in the middle (fears eating might "seal the amnesia" vs. planting to restore memory), though the conflict is brief and resolved by the gardener's instruction rather than Mila's internal friction. Closure crystallizes the motivation: "the sacred that was always ordinary, always enough." The motivation shapes beats and is present at closure, but the friction between wanting the sacred and accepting the ordinary is told more than enacted through competing choices with visible cost.</comment>
