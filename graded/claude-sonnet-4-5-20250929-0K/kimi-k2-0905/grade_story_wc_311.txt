<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The reaper's arc from ignorance to self-awareness is structurally present and the final renunciation (tearing the page, releasing paper souls) shows agency with cost. Interior contradictions exist—he carries ghosts yet never considered himself worthy of sacrifice—but the plague-cot memory feels inserted rather than earned through prior causality. Embodied emotion is present (warm streak "absurdly like a tear") yet much of the interiority leans toward abstract philosophical register ("humanity's terror had been feeding him") rather than character-particular perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by ~25% (observatory wakes, star-sentences form, atlas boat folds) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the reaper steps onto starlight "borrowed rather than stolen," a conceptual repricing with felt cost (the echo "no longer a weight but a pulse"). Orientation anchors arrive within the opening beat. One meaningful deepening occurs when the atlas boat capsizes and ink reveals "every soul he reaped had paid some fraction of their death to postpone his own," reweighting the dominant stake. The cost is legible in the final image and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The observatory supplies concrete anchors (quartz dust, rusted seams, cooling metal) and the atlas page constrains multiple choices (he spreads it, traces a tentacle leaving frost, tears it into paper souls). The copper pooling around boots and reflecting the brother's face charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy is present (dusk as liquid copper, starlight dripping) though some details veer toward decorative lyricism without adding spatial constraint. The micro-setting—atlas page as physical object—successfully charges the final image when torn and released.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (naming the nameless fear) is signaled in the opening paragraph. The deepening occurs when the atlas boat capsizes and reveals the reaper's unknowing complicity: souls paid fractions of their deaths to extend his existence. This reweights options and forces the protagonist to act (shattering cylinders, tearing the page, releasing souls). The final renunciation—stepping onto borrowed starlight—shows agency with visible cost (the observatory crumbles, the echo remains). One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient; the cost is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (sacrifice and its echo, the possibility of forgiveness for those who believed themselves unworthy) emerges from concrete particulars: the girl's unfinished name, the atlas monsters dissolving into initials and dates, paper souls rising on residual heat. The final image—"even a reaper can be named, and therefore forgiven"—reconfigures prior material without overt moralizing, though the phrasing skirts abstraction. The piece resists tidy binaries (the brother died anyway; the reaper cannot undo centuries of harvesting) and the conceptual cost is legible: he must live with the knowledge that his existence was built on unconsented sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; the reaper's perceptual signature is consistent (frost on fingertips, clicking jaw, hollow chest). Register occasionally drifts into elevated academic diction ("sacrifice crystallized," "cognitive smoothness") that feels more authorial than grounded in the reaper's interiority. The voice modulates with pressure (short syntax during the copper-mirror beat, longer lyricism at the end) but some metaphors stack densely without clear propulsion. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. One elision (the plague-cot memory) arrives late without prior cue, reducing earned weight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout (sea monsters, silver lice, spider's silk, chapel bells, tiny phonographs) with mixed coherence: "constellations crawled across the dome like silver lice" jars tonally, and "dusk pouring in as liquid copper" contradicts earlier quartz-dust grounding. Template cadence appears in the middle third ("The reaper traced… The reaper tried… The reaper stepped"). Paraphrase loops: "he had never considered himself worthy of sacrifice, only of endings" restates the opening arc without adding pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (atlas boat sailing and cutting star-sentences) but decorative lyricism occasionally stalls momentum. No major causality breaks; artifacts lower the score but do not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—reaper as unwitting beneficiary of human terror, atlas monsters as ledger of unconsented cost—feels specific and non-obvious. The wax-cylinder phonographs and paper-soul origami offer fresh tactile moves. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and conceptual framing elevates the piece, though the reaper-visits-old-place template is recognizable. Transformation is present: the sea-monster metaphor evolves from navigator's fear to accountant's record. The ending image (stepping onto borrowed starlight, proof that "even a reaper can be named") reweights prior material without retreating to safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The heartbroken reaper appears in the opening line, drives all beats (spreading the atlas, tracing the tentacle, shattering cylinders, tearing the page), and his final choice (stepping into starlight, accepting the echo as pulse) creates the closure turn. The character is causally active across setup, middle, and ending with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The atlas page is handled in four distinct beats: spread on the platform (paragraph 3), traced to trigger starlight (paragraph 5), folded into a paper boat that capsizes (paragraphs 9–11), and torn into paper souls that rise (paragraphs 20–21). Each use narrows options or reweights meaning. The page's transformation from navigator's fear-map to ledger of sacrifice to released souls is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the story's causal spine and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The echo of sacrifice is introduced early (paragraph 4: "Each monster was a sacrifice crystallized") and reappears as structural pressure: the girl's breath (paragraph 11), humanity's terror feeding the reaper (paragraph 13), and the final line ("the echo of sacrifice stayed inside his hollow chest… proof that even a reaper can be named"). It shapes the protagonist's realization and alters his stance from ignorance to acceptance. The concept participates in closure with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Echoes of forgotten phrases appear in paragraph 7 as star-sentences, return voiced in paragraph 18 when the shattered cylinders release them, and reappear transformed in paragraph 19 as initials and dates on the atlas page. The trait constrains the middle revelation (the reaper hears but "never understood") and enables the final act (releasing voices completes the ledger). Two beats with causal work and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Crystallize appears three times: sacrifices "crystallized" (paragraph 4), cylinder fragments "crystallize into a hail of tiny phonographs" (paragraph 17), and by implication in the paper souls. The middle-beat action (shattering cylinders to release voices) is causally linked to the ending, but the concept could be replaced with "release" or "transform" without major structural loss. One strong beat, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Scattered light appears in paragraph 6 ("Through scattered light the observatory woke") as the triggering method for the star-sentences. It is seeded early and shapes one key turn (enabling the reaper to read the constellations), but the mechanics are not invoked again at closure. Early signal and one beat of causal work; lyric reprise is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient observatory at dusk is anchored in the opening line and supplies concrete resources: quartz dust, the platform, the dome with rusted seams, the copper pooling, cooling metal. The setting pressures choices (the roof splits to pour in dusk, forcing the brother's reflection; the crumbling at the end underscores cost). Dusk as liquid copper charges the climax. The setting participates in three beats and the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after finding the old recordings") is signaled in the opening paragraph and the wax cylinders drive the middle beat (shattering them releases voices), but the "after" does not tighten decisions with a live clock. The element sets sequence and provides causal setup (he followed voices here) yet does not impose temporal pressure on tactics. Two gates with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to name nameless fears is stated in paragraph 2 and dramatized when the atlas boat forms the question "What was sacrificed for you?" (paragraph 9), forcing the reaper's realization. The desire conflicts with his self-image ("he had never considered himself worthy of sacrifice") and the friction generates the middle turn and final renunciation. Two beats with visible cost and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distant intimacy operates throughout: the reaper observes sailors' margin sketches and deathbed phrases with remove yet his interior is tender ("absurdly like a tear," "hollow chest… no longer a weight but a pulse"). The tone modulates under pressure (short syntax during revelation, lyrical expansion at closure) and charges the final image with earned warmth. Coherent through turns with purposeful shifts.</comment>
