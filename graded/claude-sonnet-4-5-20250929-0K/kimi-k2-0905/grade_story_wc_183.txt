<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The chimera twin character is defined primarily through ornamental metaphor rather than embodied choice under pressure. Internal contradiction exists (the "argument" of each stride, the sister's presence beneath skin) but remains abstract decoration rather than driving micro-decisions that narrow options. The final moment—breathing for two on the sinking carousel—gestures toward acceptance but arrives through accumulative description rather than a dramatized turn that costs something visible. Motivation remains opaque: we're told she seeks a name but the stakes of finding or losing it never materialize in concrete terms.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece operates in accumulative/textural mode but struggles to teach its pattern or demonstrate cost. Orientation is delayed well past 120 words (who is "chimera twin discoverer"? what does "fused to her spine" mean physically?) without payoff that charges closure, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The ending offers an image (emerald lily drifting north) but no legible before/after: the protagonist's options, knowledge, or stance show no decisive alteration. The sinking ship reads as atmospheric backdrop rather than consequence of prior choices. Causality is diffuse: events happen in thematic proximity rather than because/therefore linkage, and the closure unit lacks visible or felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposefully surreal (salt-streaked porthole, mildewed calliope, rotting plush) and the carnival ship's decay creates consistent atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a tactical choice or blocks a path; the protagonist moves through spaces that shift meaning poetically but don't alter her options. The emerald card "twitches" and she follows—the ship supplies mood but not mechanical pressure. The mirror-maze and tarot stall serve as symbolic waypoints rather than obstacles that force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recapturing the scattered syllables of a name—is declared but never tested with visible cost or narrowed options. The protagonist follows the emerald card, gathers "heat-spots," recites fragments, and the name appears in the sky without struggle or trade-off. No on-page reversal alters tactics; coincidence (the card pulsing, the maze revealing panes) drives progression rather than agency. The sister's sigh at the end is labeled "voluntary" but arrives without prior refusal or tension that would make the shift legible. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—identity as shared rather than separate, names as root of self—emerges clearly from the conceit and recurs in the emerald iris, the splitting spell, the garden metaphor. However, the ending states theme overtly ("stopped trying to be separate," "rooted in her mouth and would never be lost again") rather than letting the final image hold ambiguity. The phosphor vines writing the name and the dissolving card enact the theme but do so through assertion rather than dramatized cost. The piece gestures toward complexity (monster/miracle/mistake) but resolves into tidy affirmation without friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register throughout, with baroque diction ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant," "phosphor vines") that reads voice-motivated rather than POV-leaking. However, the perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-specific: the narrator notices in ornamental, uniform ways regardless of emotional pressure. Psychic distance remains stable but remote; we never feel the sister's pulse or the protagonist's contradiction in embodied terms. Free indirect style is absent; the narration operates in a decorative third that tells us "she understood" rather than showing the understanding arrive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Density and figurative saturation create significant drag. Nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated abstraction without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5 to −0.7). Paraphrase loops appear: "the twin placed the card against her chest where her sister's face bulged beneath the skin, and together they recited" closely echoes "she followed, knowing she must recapture," both restating intent without new pressure. Template cadence is pervasive in the long appositives and parallel "X became Y" constructions ("children ate cotton candy that became their own hair," "barkers cried prizes that exploded into pigeons"). Register drifts into academic abstraction ("tense—past imperfect, forever growing") that clashes with the fable frame. Clarity suffers: "trapped freedom surged through its hull" and "lions of light pacing behind bars of forgotten laughter" pile vehicles without coherent tenor. Artifacts touch the closure beat (the final emerald lily sentence), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The chimera twin, carnival ship, and garden-of-names conceit combine familiar fairy-tale and body-horror elements without a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The emotional arc—seeking a lost name, accepting fusion—follows a recognizable template (journey to mythic destination, symbolic object guides, self-acceptance finale). Specific details (emerald swatch card, narrative threads sewn into a coat) offer texture but remain decorative rather than transforming the core premise. The story commits fully to its lyric register but retreats from cost at closure, choosing affirmation over ambiguity. Transformation test: the plot and emotional resolution could transfer to other split-self myths with minor re-skinning.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The chimera twin discoverer is present throughout but makes few on-page choices that alter tactics or narrow options. She follows the emerald card, enters the maze, lifts the tarot card, recites fragments—each action is compliant rather than decisional. The final choice to "not flee" and open her coat occurs in the last paragraph without prior stakes that would make staying versus leaving a dilemma. The character's presence is ornamental to the accumulative design rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The emerald swatch card appears early (second paragraph), pulses to guide movement mid-story, and dissolves into green fire at closure—satisfying setup, development, and payoff. However, its function is passive waypoint rather than constraint: the protagonist follows it without cost or friction. The card's "heat-spots" are gathered but do not narrow options or enable a trade-off. It charges the final image (green fire writing the name) but mechanically rather than through earned causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Unkindled solace" appears twice as a descriptor (calliope's chord, sister's sigh) but never shapes stakes or alters tactics on the page. It functions as thematic label rather than live concept that constrains choice. The term is ornamental, swappable with any synonym for "incomplete comfort" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Blissfully aberrant" is applied once to the protagonist's stride, described as an argument between height-loving and depth-praying feet. The trait is metaphorical decoration rather than a constraint that enables or blocks an action. No on-page cost or trade-off tied to the aberration; the label does not recur or shape the closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Recapture" is the stated goal (recapturing scattered syllables of the name) and frames the quest structure. The protagonist gathers fragments and recites them at closure. However, the recapture is declarative rather than contested: no syllable is lost or withheld after being found, no attempt fails. The action could be replaced with "discover" or "remember" without altering beats. It drives the frame but not the turns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Narrative threads" appear in two beats: stories painted on glass in the mirror-maze and threads sewn into the protagonist's coat lining that "began to speak." The method shapes the middle (following glass stories) and briefly the ending (coat threads read by water, blooming into lilies). Setup and payoff are present but the mechanics remain vague metaphor rather than constraint. The method is functional but could be swapped for "memory shards" or "song fragments" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship is present throughout, supplies vivid atmospheric detail (porthole, roulette table, calliope, carousel, mirror-maze, tarot stall), and its sinking creates the final stage. The foggy bay frames the entire action. However, the setting never blocks a path or forces a tactical trade-off; the protagonist moves freely through spaces that shift meaning poetically. The sinking at closure is consequence-free (she remains buoyant). The ship constrains time loosely and charges the final image but does not alter choices mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As memories alter" frames the piece and the carnival rewinds in paragraph six (barkers, children, carousel horses moving backward). Time operates as atmospheric effect rather than tightening pressure. No deadline forces choices, no memory-alteration creates friction or cost. The timeframe is present as motif but does not shape tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Finding the garden of forgotten names is declared early and remains the goal throughout. The protagonist follows the emerald card toward it and reaches a version (garden as tense, not place) at closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants: no moment shows her weighing the cost of the search or fearing what the name might reveal. Friction between want and cost is absent; the quest proceeds without on-page doubt or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" is named once explicitly (paragraph twelve: "trapped freedom surged through its hull: all the carnival's imprisoned joys") and implied in the fusion-versus-separation conceit. Tone is consistently lyric-melancholic and surreal. However, the tone does not modulate with escalation or crystallize at closure; it remains static across beats. The final image (emerald lily drifting north) reprises mood without sharpening or charging it with new pressure.</comment>
