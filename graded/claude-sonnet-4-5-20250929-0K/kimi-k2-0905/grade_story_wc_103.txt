<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The designer's motivation is clear and embodied through tactile action (pressing palm to bark, feeling sap pulse), and her choices drive the narrative. Internal contradiction appears in her hesitation at the threshold—tasting future tears yet smiling at time's texture—which feels earned by the accumulative pressure. The final choice to seal the fragment and accept recurring loss shows genuine cost. Minor slip: the "retrocognitively trapped" attribute reads partly as label rather than fully dramatized constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through spatial descent (turnings smelling of memories), the halo fragment flares to reveal true anatomy, and the final act of sealing the hourglass reconfigures the protagonist's relationship to loss. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she accepts the garden's cycle with visible cost ("photographs once again fading," "dissolution now a comfort"). Orientation anchors early (designer, bridge garden, locket). One meaningful deepening occurs when she peels bark to see laminated moments, then tears a ring free, collapsing the maze and forcing her threshold choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is konkret and purposeful: the oldest arch pulses with sap, the hawthorn keystone pinches sap flow like an hourglass, moss underfoot. The hyperbolic maze layout directly constrains her descent into earlier hours, and the bridge's disintegration (planks curling like burning film) charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wet leaves, chalk smell, funeral lilies). The garden itself functions as both setting and antagonist, its geometry forcing the protagonist's final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to escape duration or become its keystone—is signaled early through the fading photographs and builds through the maze's tightening loops. One major tightening: when she tears the ring free, the bridge disintegrates and a door appears, forcing the threshold choice with explicit price (roots replacing veins). Her agency is renunciation with visible cost: she seals the fragment, accepts perpetual loss, and the corridor spirals back. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights her relationship to forgetting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete images: fading photographs, the hourglass trunk, sap as filtered tears, rings as laminated moments. The piece asks whether time's texture is observed or lived, and the ending answers non-literally—she becomes the garden's witness, trading escape for embodied accumulation. The final image ("quiet quaking reverie of time grinding itself sharp beneath her designs") reweights the opening's remembrance motive without stating a moral. Subtext operates in her smile at the threshold, signaling acceptance rather than defeat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: the designer notices sap pulse, emulsion surrender, bark softening "like photographic paper." Diction matches an artist's sensibility (Möbius ribbons, hyperbolic arrays, asymptotic hedges). Psychic distance tightens during the hawthorn encounter, where syntax compresses ("She tugged, and the ring ripped free; the garden shuddered"). Minor register drift: "retrocognitively trapped" and "helical well of causality" edge toward exposition rather than felt experience, though they remain within a designer's plausible lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with high information density: "roots threading backward through years, branches corkscrewing into futures not yet chosen" does dual work (image + causality). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent (sap as breath, bark as photographic paper, planks curling like burning film). Two slips: "periscope" then "helical well" stacks metaphors for the same function without added pressure, and "quaking reverie that rattled her teeth with centuries" mixes tactile and temporal vehicles. No paraphrase loops detected. Sentence openings vary; paragraph rhythm supports accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of temporal phenomenology, living architecture, and photographic metaphor feels specific and non-obvious. The hawthorn-as-hourglass and bark-as-celluloid are fresh inflections on memory-garden tropes. The protagonist's choice to become witness rather than escape transforms the "trapped in time" premise through embodied cost. Risk is present: the hyperbolic geometry and retrocognitive framing could alienate, but the piece commits fully and follows implications to a resonant ending. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hedge maze designer's choices create all major turns: she steps onto the bridge (initiating descent), peels the bark to reveal rings (discovery beat), tears a ring free (collapsing the maze), and seals the fragment in the hawthorn (closure choice). Early signal (press palm to arch), middle involvement (peeling bark, tearing ring), and closure participation (sealing fragment) all present. Her professional skill (planting yew and hornbeam in hyperbolic arrays) directly enables the narrative's central mechanism. Removing this exact character would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in at least four beats: warming at her sternum (setup), humming when time grows thin (first turning), flaring to project light revealing the garden's anatomy (middle escalation), and being sealed into the hawthorn wound (closure act). Its specific property (fragment of celestial circlet, hums when time grows thin) is irreplaceable—no generic artifact could substitute. It enables her to see the garden's true structure and becomes the price she pays to remain. Causally essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fading photographs anchor the opening conflict (each lost image a door slamming shut) and return at closure reweighted ("photographs once again fading in her pocket, their dissolution now a comfort rather than a terror"). They shape her initial motivation to walk the bridge and their reconstitution when she tears the ring creates a tactical choice point. Middle development: they disintegrate to white dust at the fourth turning, marking escalation. The concept drives one major turn (disintegration forcing her deeper into the maze) and reappears transformed at closure, but the maze geometry does more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is named in the fifth sentence and described (able to taste every yesterday, unable to change a single one), but its constraint on tactics is indirect. It motivates her descent into the maze and underlies her threshold choice, but most on-page pressure comes from the maze's geometry and the photographs' fading rather than this specific trait. The attribute appears in setup and informs closure (she accepts perpetual witnessing), meeting two gates, but the cost is more thematic than tactical. Swappable with "trapped in time's flow" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Disintegrate" is the story's central action: photographs disintegrate into white dust (escalation beat), the bark reveals disintegrating moments (discovery), the bridge begins to disintegrate when she tears the ring (climax turn forcing her choice), and the door dissolves at closure. The action cannot be swapped—"fade" or "decay" would lack the sudden, violent threshold quality that drives her choice. Early signal (photographs surrendering color), middle escalation (dust through fingers), climax participation (bridge curling away), and closure echo (door dissolved). Causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is named in the sixth paragraph ("planted yew and hornbeam in hyperbolic arrays, their growth vectors curved so sharply that walking the maze became a descent into earlier hours") and its mechanics directly enable her time-navigation. It shapes her tactic of walking deeper and reappears at closure when "hyperbolic geometry collapsed into Euclidean lines." The method is signaled early, matters during escalation (asymptotic hedges that never reach center), and participates in closure. However, the garden's living quality does equal causal work, making the geometry method replaceable with another spatial metaphor (labyrinth, spiral) with moderate edits. Strong setup and closure linkage lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is present in every beat: its oldest arch pulses with sap (opening), its paths shift as Möbius ribbons (constraint), its hawthorn keystone controls sap flow (central mechanism), and it reconstitutes at closure to hold vanishing moments. The garden's anatomy (roots threading backward, branches corkscrewing into futures) directly enables her discovery, and its disintegration forces her threshold choice. Removing this exact setting—living, breathing, architecturally active—would break all causal linkage. The garden is not backdrop but co-protagonist, shaping every tactic and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated early ("she needed that hum now" for discovery) and dramatized through her planting hyperbolic arrays and walking the maze. Her motivation conflicts with cost: discovery requires descent into loss (photographs disintegrating), and the final choice reframes discovery as lived embodiment rather than observation. The motivation drives her initial action (stepping onto the bridge) and her threshold hesitation ("tasting the salt of every future tear"). Closure participation: she smiles because "the texture of time was not to be observed but to be lived." The desire is tested and transformed with visible cost, meeting all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" establishes tone in the title phrase ("low quaking reverie that rattled her teeth with centuries") and modulates with pressure: slow sap pulse (opening calm), wet memories (nostalgic descent), kneeling as photographs disintegrate (intensification), the tree singing at climax (peak reverie), and the final image ("quiet quaking reverie of time grinding itself sharp"). The tone is coherent through turns—never breaking into urgency or panic—and charges the final image by echoing the hawthorn's song. The trembling, meditative quality is consistent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative lens without static repetition.</comment>
