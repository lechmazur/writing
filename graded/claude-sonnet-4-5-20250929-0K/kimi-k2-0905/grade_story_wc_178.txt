<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Naram-bel's motivation—to seal a covenant before the new regime—is clear and embodied through concrete actions (carrying the tile, entering the scriptorium, drawing schematics). His frugality is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction; the seven-year barley trade for the tile is told but not dramatized as a present trade-off. The sister's memory and "encrypted devotion" gesture toward internal depth, but remain label-only without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final oath and disappearance read as plot-driven rather than emerging from a visible inner struggle with cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening line; the two-shard structure (scriptorium → inner sanctum) is legible with a clean spatial transition. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the drawing ritual, the lattice projection, the door opening, and the covenant oath, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Naram-bel becomes "the silence between regimes." Cost is felt but oblique—he vanishes, forecloses teaching, guards the chamber—yet the final image of "dust that refused to settle" and footfalls heard "ever after" reweights the opening premise. One persistent issue: the magic square's mechanics (how it projects, unlocks, returns prophecy) are told rather than causally dramatized, weakening the because/therefore chain at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The palace setting is vivid and layered: cedar doors, glazed bricks murmuring cuneiform, cracked lapis lions, the copper door, the hollow cube with clerestory light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Naram-bel's astronomer's eye. The inner sanctum's "hollow cube of air where no dust dared drift" constrains the covenant ritual spatially, and the final dust that "refused to settle" charges the closure image. However, the scriptorium and courtyard remain interchangeable backdrop for much of the action; the gate/lock mechanism is asserted rather than tactilely explored, missing an opportunity to ground the magical turn in physical specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown before the new regime erases the old sky charts—is signaled early and frames Naram-bel's urgency. The tile's use (drawing, pressing against the door) provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options: he gains access to the sanctum and completes the schematic. Yet the escalation is told more than dramatized: the door opens "as if empirically ironic," the constellations project futures, the prophecy arrives without visible friction or cost-in-the-moment. The final oath forecloses teaching and binds him to silence, a credible cost, but the choice feels preordained by plot rather than forced by a dilemma with visible trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the magic square as pre-dynastic knowledge outlasting empire, numbers as covenant, the astronomer's devotion encrypted in marginalia returned as prophecy. "Empirically ironic" recurs with purpose—pure number, not ritual, unbars the holy dark; the covenant resists kingship and answers in questions. The final image of Naram-bel becoming "the silence between regimes" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of what survives imperial change. One slip: "encrypted devotion" and "dusky harmony" appear as thematic labels in the narration rather than arising solely from concrete scene work, edging toward authorial assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Naram-bel's perceptual signature: he notices "pale constellations" of dust, "glazed bricks murmuring equations," starlight filtering through ancient clerestory. Diction is elevated and consistent—archaic, lyric, astronomer-inflected. However, several lines drift into expository omniscience: "the tile said to predate the first dynasty" and "mechanisms older than language" read as narrator intrusion rather than Naram-bel's plausible knowledge or inference. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but "empirically ironic" appears twice as narrator commentary rather than character thought, weakening the POV modesty standard. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm is lyric and varied; opening lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Figurative language is dense—"time tasted of copper and ash," "numbers seemed to lift...into a lattice of light"—and mostly coherent, though "empirically ironic" strains as both adjective and thematic label. Two paraphrase loops: "the palace breathing...murmuring equations" restates palace-as-living-entity without added pressure; "the astronomer's motivation sharpened: he meant to seal a covenant" repeats the frame. Template cadence in mid-section: multiple sentences open with subject-verb-object parallelism ("Naram-bel carried," "He spread," "Naram-bel crossed"). Stock phrasing: "tears salted his lips," "heart beat with encrypted devotion." These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats but do not obscure the ending image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ancient Babylonian setting, magic square lore, and the astronomer's devotion as counter-regime resistance is specific and non-obvious. The framing—"between regimes"—offers a fresh angle on knowledge preservation, and the tile's dual role (mathematical talisman and literal key) integrates concept with plot. The transformation test: swapping Babylon for another ancient palace and the magic square for another relic would leave the emotional arc mostly intact, suggesting the particulars are vivid but not entirely indispensable. The covenant's terms—guard the chamber, teach no king, remain unknown—commit to the premise without retreat. Minor risk: the "disappeared astronomer as haunting presence" ending is familiar in speculative historical fiction, though executed with lyric specificity here.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Naram-bel appears throughout: opening with the tile, drawing schematics, crossing the courtyard, pressing the tile to the door, completing the ritual, swearing the oath. His frugality is mentioned (seven years of barley) but does not constrain an on-page choice; the astronomer identity colors perception (starlight, cuneiform, calculations) but does not drive a tactical decision with visible cost. The final oath—to guard, not teach, remain silent—is a character choice that narrows options, and the disappearance changes the story's outcome. Setup clear, beats involved (three: scriptorium, door, sanctum), closure participation present. Causal pressure moderate: most moves follow the tile's logic rather than Naram-bel's internal conflict. Cost visible in the oath and vanishing. Swappability low: remove the astronomer's lens and the tile's meaning shifts. Band guidance and two-gate model place this in the 5.5–6.3 range; the final oath and closure linkage elevate it toward 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magic square tile is handled in four beats: carried into the scriptorium (setup), drawn/projected as lattice, pressed against the door to unlock it, placed at the cube's center for the final diagonal. Early signal strong (first paragraph). Development: the tile enables the door opening and the covenant ritual—causal pressure clear. Closure: the tile appears in the sanctum and on the fresh clay tablet found by the herald, reweighted as both tool and legacy. Specificity high: "palm-sized square of lapis lazuli etched with a four-by-four grid...always summed to thirty-four" and the pre-dynastic legend make it irreplaceable. Cost connection: the seven-year barley trade is told but not dramatized, and the tile's use exacts no visible friction or sacrifice in the moment. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, minus ornamental-at-ritual (the schematic representation does more work than the tile itself in the sanctum) −0.4, minus told-trade −0.2 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" appears three times: as Naram-bel's "heart beat with encrypted devotion" (interior label), as "dusky harmony of encrypted devotion" in the final paragraph (thematic summary), and implicitly in the marginalia-returned-as-prophecy moment. Setup present by midpoint (label in paragraph nine). Development: the concept colors the lattice drawing and the prophecy recognition but does not constrain a tactical choice or force a trade-off. Closure: "encrypted devotion" recurs in the ending as thematic echo, reweighting the opening frame, but remains abstract—the reader infers connection rather than witnessing a visible stake or cost tied to the concept. The prophecy beat (his notes returned) dramatizes the concept obliquely but does not impose a decision. Band guidance: label-only use trends low, thematic reprise without causal pressure caps mid-band. Setup +0.4, closure echo +0.5, minus label-only −0.7, minus no causal constraint −0.4 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" appears twice: "fearful that empirical irony might mock his longing" (exposition, not action) and "as if empirically ironic that pure number, not ritual, should unbar the holy dark" (narrator commentary on the door opening). The attribute is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice with cost. Setup: mentioned in paragraph four but not as a trait that shapes behavior. Development: the door-opening moment gestures toward the concept (numbers work, ritual does not) but Naram-bel does not wrestle with irony on the page or adjust tactics because of it. Closure: absent. The trait is a thematic flourish rather than a constraint or enabler. Late first appearance (paragraph four, ~20% mark) −0.3, label-only −0.7, no causal work −0.8, no closure linkage −0.0 (already capped), swappable (could be "paradoxically effective" or "skeptically devoted") −0.5 = cap at 3.4 per missing-development gate, adjust down to 3.2 for purely decorative use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears once: "legend that claimed it could uncloak the invisible hinges of heaven." The tile's use does reveal hidden structure (the lattice, the door's location, the sanctum, the prophecy), so the action is fulfilled thematically and causally. Setup: the legend is seeded in paragraph three. Development: the lattice drawing and door opening enact uncloaking—Naram-bel discovers the door's location via the projected negative space and gains access to the sealed sanctum. Closure: the covenant oath and the fresh tablet left behind suggest knowledge uncloaked yet re-encrypted (silence replacing revelation). The action is embedded in plot turns rather than swappable. Causal pressure moderate: the tile's mechanics do the uncloaking; Naram-bel's agency is following the projection. Cost: access is gained but then guarded, a trade-off. Setup +0.5, two beats (lattice, door) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, minus told-legend rather than on-page discovery −0.4, minus low protagonist friction in the uncloaking moment −0.8 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Through schematic representations" is demonstrated: Naram-bel draws "schematic representations of the tile's internal symmetries—lines connecting numbers, diagonals that became shadowed corridors." The lattice lifts and rotates, revealing the door's shape. Later, he "traced its final diagonal with the reed, completing the schematic that translated devotion into dimension." Setup: the method is shown in paragraph seven (~35% mark). Development: the schematic guides the door discovery and the covenant ritual—two beats. Closure: the schematic's completion triggers the constellation projection and the prophecy, participating in the ending. Causal pressure clear: the method enables both the unlocking and the ritual's culmination. Specificity moderate: the lines/diagonals mechanic is shown but remains abstract (how does a drawing rotate into a projection?). Late first appearance (second third) −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, minus abstract mechanics −0.4, minus summary-of-effect ("the walls responded") rather than step-by-step dramatization −0.4 = ~5.8, round to 5.6 per accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient Babylonian palace is reimagined with specificity: cedar doors, glazed bricks murmuring cuneiform, cracked lapis lions, copper door, clerestory built "before the first brick was fired," hollow cube of air. Setup immediate (opening line). Development: the scriptorium provides the table and parchment for the schematic; the courtyard's lions and copper door supply the physical obstacle Naram-bel must overcome; the sanctum's architecture (clerestory, cube geometry) frames the covenant ritual. Closure: the palace becomes the site of Naram-bel's vanishing and the herald's discovery—"dust that refused to settle" and footfalls heard "ever after" charge the final image with the palace as living archive. Causal pressure strong: the setting's locked door is the central obstacle, and the sanctum's spatial properties (hollow cube, starlight) enable the ritual. Cost connection: the palace's imminent seizure by the new regime tightens the time pressure. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, irreplaceability +0.6, cost +0.5 = ~7.8 (allows high band per gate model: setup/development/closure all present, strong causal and closure linkage).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is the story's framing temporal anchor: the palace "lay emptied of courtiers yet not yet claimed by conquerors," and "the new king's heralds would arrive at sunrise." The timeframe is signaled immediately and creates urgency. Development: the approaching dawn drives Naram-bel's decision to act "tonight" rather than continue deferring the test of the tile. The final paragraph confirms the herald's arrival "when dawn's first herald crossed the threshold," closing the temporal window. Closure: the timeframe shapes the ending—Naram-bel completes the covenant and vanishes before the regime change, leaving only the tablet. The clock is live but not tightly tracked: night-to-dawn is asserted rather than felt through accumulating sensory cues (fading light, cooling air, distant sounds). Setup +0.7, two beats (decision to act, herald's arrival) +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection (foreclose teaching under new regime) +0.4, minus vague elapsed-time tracking (how long does the ritual take?) −0.5, minus static "dusk" throughout (no progression from dusk to deep night to pre-dawn) −0.7 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To seal a covenant with the unknown" is stated in paragraph five: "he meant to seal a covenant with the unknown before the coming monarch erased the old sky charts." The motivation is clear and frames Naram-bel's entire sequence of actions. Development: the drawing, door opening, and ritual all enact the covenant-sealing. Closure: the oath ("to guard this chamber, to teach no king, to let the unknown remain unknown yet loved") completes the motivation and forecloses a path (no teaching). The motivation is told more than dramatized—there is no on-page conflict between sealing the covenant and another want (e.g., sharing knowledge, escaping, preserving his own life). The final oath is a choice but lacks visible friction in the moment of decision. Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8 (motivation drives plot), closure linkage +1.3 (oath fulfills motivation), minus told-only without internal conflict −0.9, minus no competing want or fear to sharpen the choice −1.0 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears explicitly in the opening ("slanted dusk"), throughout ("dusky harmony of twilight," "in the hush between regimes, the dusky harmony of encrypted devotion"), and in the ending ("heard soft footfalls in the dusk"). The tone is consistent—quiet, reverent, liminal—and modulates subtly with pressure: the opening is contemplative, the ritual beats intensify with "drum"-like echoes and "tears salted his lips," the ending returns to soft, ghostly stillness. The tone supports the situational/accumulative design and charges the final image (dust, footfalls, lapis light). However, "dusky harmony" is stated as a label twice rather than arising solely from sensory and rhythmic choices, reducing organic integration. Setup immediate, tone coherent through beats, closure linkage strong (dusk returns in final paragraph). Setup +0.6, coherence across beats +0.8, closure charge +1.0, modulation with pressure +0.5, minus label-only phrase ("dusky harmony") −0.6, minus static mood descriptor rather than evolving texture −0.4 = ~5.9.</comment>
