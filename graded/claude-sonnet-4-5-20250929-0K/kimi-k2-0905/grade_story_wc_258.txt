<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's motivation to "reverse engineer culture" is established early and her actions consistently pursue this goal through concrete choices (measuring, mapping, footprints-as-data). Interior access shows specificity in her techniques and inherited responsibility, though the interiority sometimes drifts toward exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to seal the work and descend is earned but the emotional cost reads more conceptual than visceral—she leaves "steadily curious" rather than visibly altered. The crypto-crash backstory anchors motivation but remains summary; more present-scene friction would sharpen the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through measured grid-work, card assignments, and the fractal-debt discovery at the Ten of Swords / Four of Pentacles intersection—a meaningful deepening that reweights the premise. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of infinite regressing cartomancers and the tin-sealed protocol establishes cost (her prophecy unheard, her work a ghost protocol for an uncertain inheritor). One causal seam: the leap from "repeating sigil of leveraged debt" to "infinite regression of exits" compresses insight without showing the logical bridge on the page, risking a tell-not-show at the story's conceptual hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is established early and constrains action throughout: rain sounds "like a coin falling into an empty wallet," mist turns the loft into a camera obscura projecting streetlights onto cards, and the drying skylight at dawn marks closure. The measuring tape, floorboards, and ink-stained footprints function as micro-setting that drives the mapping method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the cartomancer's professional eye for geometry and atmosphere-as-barometrics). The crypto-crash backdrop and "scavenged marketplaces" ground the world economically without catalog exposition. One missed opportunity: the reclaimed-oak floor is named but never leveraged for a choice or sensory contrast under her bare feet beyond the foil-fleck data point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—mapping the cultural pattern of collapse before witnesses forget—is signaled in paragraph four and pursued through escalating technical moves: grid layout, vector assignment, barefoot data-printing, atmospheric adjustment, timeline multiplication. The discovery of the leveraged-debt fractal at the card intersection is a meaningful tightening that narrows her hypothesis and forces the final reconfiguration. However, the escalation reads more as methodical accumulation than rising pressure with tradeoffs; no live option is visibly foreclosed until the sealing of the tin, and the cost (her prophecy unheard, her role as ghost for the next inheritor) is conceptual rather than a felt forfeiture that alters her immediate condition. Under the Accumulative lens this is acceptable, but the stakes remain cerebral throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—cultural amnesia, the cyclical nature of collapse, and the futility/necessity of witnessing—emerges organically from the cartomancer's mapping project and the repeating sigil without overt thesis statements. The final image of infinite regressing lofts and the ghost protocol answers the thematic question with resonant ambiguity: her work may be unheard yet still necessary for the next witness. The measuring tape and footprints function as motifs that accumulate meaning and charge the closure (geometry as prophecy-substitute, ink prints as ledger). One thematic friction: "steadily curious about which cultural pattern would crash next" in the final line risks diluting the hard-won resignation with a note of detachment that undercuts the cost of her unheard prophecy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through the cartomancer's professional idiom: "secular relic promising dimension instead of destiny," "cultural barometrics," "ghost protocol." Perceptual signature is consistent (geometry, measurement, inherited responsibility). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Diction remains elevated and voice-specific throughout, though some constructions veer toward ornamental density ("leveraged hope," "fractal of leveraged hope") that prioritizes lyricism over clarity under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("I will multiply paths...") reads more as incantation than spoken goal-pursuit, which fits the ritualistic tone but offers no subtext or character distinction test. Psychic distance is controlled; no unjustified omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high (each paragraph advances mapping method or thematic reweighting). However, multiple sentences exhibit ornamental density that slows momentum without adding causal pressure: "Each droplet that struck the glass above her sounded like a coin falling into an empty wallet, a memory she could not shake" front-loads backstory as metaphor rather than present action. Paraphrase loop in paragraph three: "filled its silence" after "emptied the city's pockets" restates the absence without new detail. Template cadence in paragraph eight: "draw three, lay two reversed, rotate one ninety degrees" reads as procedure list rather than embodied action. Stock metaphor "smoke" for vanished tech-bros. The final third sustains lyric density without loops, but earlier artifacts and the occasional register drift into academic phrasing ("emergent map of collective memory") accumulate to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of tarot divination, post-crypto cultural archaeology, and geometric reverse-engineering offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The cartomancer's inherited wartime refugee-mapping responsibility personalizes the archetype. The "infinite regression of exits" closure and the ghost-protocol tin transform the initial concept with conceptual cost. However, the core frame—lone mystic mapping civilizational collapse through symbolic tools—echoes familiar post-apocalyptic witness tropes, and the piece does not dramatize a moral calculus or interpersonal friction that would test the protagonist's stance. The measuring tape and ink footprints are fresh particulars, but the emotional arc (curiosity sustained, prophecy sealed unheard) remains cerebral rather than viscerally transformed. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lyric mode) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity, earning modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The onyx-ink cartomancer's choices drive all key beats: spreading cards (setup), assigning vectors, walking the grid barefoot to create data points, adjusting for thunder, discovering the leveraged-debt sigil, sealing the work in the tin, and descending with the final stance. Her decision to "confide only to the rain" and her realization that "footprints alone could serve as currency" directly shape closure. Present across setup, middle escalation, and ending; her agency is observation-plus-decision with visible cost (unheard prophecy, ghost protocol for next inheritor). The character is indispensable to the story's logic and final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The measuring tape appears in paragraph five (setup), is used to rule the Cartesian grid (beat one), adjusted by atmospheric pressure (beat two), snapped closed "like a closing vault" at the moment of completed map (beat three), and sealed in the tin (closure participation). Its scarred condition ("bite marks from a decade of gallery installations") and descriptor as "secular relic promising dimension instead of destiny" charge it with specific history and thematic weight. The tape's retraction sound echoes the vault/ledger motif. Removing it would require rewriting the mapping method and the closure image. Strong integration across all three gates with causal and thematic linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reverse engineering" is announced in paragraph four as the cartomancer's explicit plan and governs her method: grid layout, vector assignment, path multiplication, and the search for repeating patterns. The discovery of the leveraged-debt fractal is the on-page result of reverse-engineering culture through cards. However, the concept is moreMethodLabel than constraint—she could "map" or "decode" culture with identical beats. The stakes (understanding collapse before witnesses forget) do not hinge on reverse-engineering as a unique tactic; it flavors her approach without forcing a trade-off or unique cost. Present across setup, development, and thematically at closure, but swappable with adjacent synonyms.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" is named twice: in paragraph three as "a steadily curious hunger... to understand what had really happened," and in the final line as "steadily curious about which cultural pattern would crash next." The trait motivates her ongoing project and her refusal to stop after this map is sealed. However, it does not constrain a specific choice or create visible cost on the page—curiosity enables rather than limits. The attribute is thematically consistent but functions more as label than lever. Present at setup and closure; no middle beat where curiosity forces a tradeoff or error. Mid-band for coherence and bookend placement, but replaceable with "driven" or "compelled" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Confide" appears explicitly in paragraph seven: "The cartomancer confided her plan only to the rain." This choice to speak aloud to no human witness establishes her isolation and the futility/necessity tension that charges the ending ("no human wanted to hear the prophecy anymore"). The act of confiding (ritualistic speech without interlocutor) recurs implicitly in her method of "whispering" and in the closure realization that her work is a message for an uncertain inheritor. The action is thematically essential and shapes the final image of unheard prophecy. Present at setup/development and directly informs closure stance. Strong integration, though a second distinct on-page confiding beat (e.g., a moment of doubt voiced mid-grid) would raise irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Multiplying paths" is defined in paragraph eleven: "draw three, lay two reversed, rotate one ninety degrees, and watch how alternate histories blossomed or withered." The method is signaled mid-story, executed in that beat, and thematically reprised at closure ("not one future but an infinite regression of exits"). It shapes her mapping tactic and the conceptual payoff. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what does it mean for alternate histories to "blossom or wither" on a tarot grid?—and the method does not create a visible constraint or error that she must work around. Present in development and thematic at closure, but the means could be "layering readings" or "permuting spreads" with minimal rewrite. Mid-high for thematic coherence; causal pressure is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is named in the opening line, anchors all action, and evolves across the piece: rain sounds like coins (economic motif), thunder prompts atmospheric adjustments, mist turns the loft into a camera obscura that projects streetlights onto cards (altering her data), and the drying skylight at dawn marks closure. The floorboards host the grid and capture ink footprints. The setting supplies resources (glass for observation, reclaimed oak for the grid), constrains method (she must work within this single room), and charges the final image (the ghost protocol left "beneath a skylight now drying"). Indispensable across setup, multiple beats, and ending. Strong causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the cryptocurrency crashes" is established in paragraph two as backstory that empties pockets and fills silence, motivating her shift from paid readings to cultural archaeology. The timeframe pressure—mapping "before the last witnesses forgot"—tightens urgency in paragraph four. However, the time constraint does not alter her tactics on the page; she works through one night without a ticking clock or deadline test. The crashes are past; the forgetting is future but untracked. Present at setup and motivates the dominant stake, but does not create a live timer or force a mid-scene adjustment. Functional context, but swappable with "after the collapse" or "after the downturn." Mid-band for clear causal seed, no development beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To map cultural patterns" is stated explicitly in paragraph four and pursued through every technical beat: grid, vectors, footprints, sigil discovery, and sealing the map. The motivation is dramatized in her inherited responsibility (grandmother's refugee routes), her loss of paying clients, and her final realization that the map is complete when it shows infinite regressing exits. Friction appears between her desire to chart escape routes and the futility of an unheard prophecy, creating visible cost at closure. The motivation shapes setup, drives all middle beats, and reconfigures at the ending. Strong integration with felt consequence, though the friction could be sharpened by an on-page moment of doubt or resistance during the mapping process.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Inherited mystery" as tone is established in paragraph twelve via the grandmother's wartime card-reading and the cartomancer's felt "responsibility to chart escape routes from a disaster no bomb had announced." The tone of ritualistic solemnity and cryptic transmission ("ghost protocol") is coherent throughout and charges the final image of the sealed tin and descending stairs. However, the tone remains static—atmospheric and meditative—without modulation under pressure. The cartomancer never doubts, fears, or urgently pivots; the mystery does not deepen or crack. Coherent and thematically apt, but a single register. Strong setup and closure participation; missing a middle beat where tone shifts with emotional cost or revelation.</comment>
