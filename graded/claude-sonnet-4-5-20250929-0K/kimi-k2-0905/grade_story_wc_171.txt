<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority is concrete and embodied—trembling hands, voice cracking under syllable weight—and his motivation (carrying twenty years of failed names) drives the ritual action. The piece maintains consistent character-particular perception filtered through a negotiator's lens. However, the final transformation ("not as a negotiator, but as a gardener of memory") arrives as assertion rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the protagonist's agency at closure is more symbolic witness than difficult choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraph. Pressure accumulates through ritual layering (offerings, name-speaking, collective cairn-building) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clipboard transforms from negotiation tool to cradle, shatters into distributed light, and Kaelen's burden becomes "shared strength"—a Charged Poise moment where the war is "transformed into something that could be carried, not conquered." Cost is conceptual and relational (the terrace crumbles, his role shifts), though the felt price at the peak beat could be sharper. One meaningful deepening through collective witness is sufficient for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace functions as active setting: obsidian drinking starlight, silver veins pulsing with Kaelen's heartbeat, reflecting the war below—environment charges the ritual and final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (warm altar stone, glowing lily petals) and filtered through Kaelen's priorities. Spatial choreography is clear as mourners climb steps and build the cairn. The terrace's crumbling at dawn constrains future action and completes the ritual arc, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting must charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchoring memory to enable peace-as-practice) is signaled early and escalates through the ritual sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelen realizes "the price of redemption was not forgetting, but remembering rightly," which shifts his intent from burning the clipboard to collective witness. The Skyborne and Deepkin gathering and contributing fragments provides external pressure, though their arrival feels more coincidental complication than protagonist-driven turn. Cost at closure is conceptual (distributed burden, role shift) but could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (peace as ongoing practice requiring shared memory of cost) emerges organically from the ritual particulars—clipboard-as-cradle, shattered light carrying names, cairn of grief fragments. The piece resists moralizing; the final image of the crumbling terrace and Kaelen as "gardener of memory" offers a resonant answer to how ideals anchor in practice without stating a thesis. Subtext operates through the white lily's "flawed beauty" and the mourners who "stand together...understanding that peace was not a destination but a practice." No thematic echo or summary mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kaelen with consistent perceptual signature (negotiator's lens cataloging names, recognizing ritual timing). Diction is elevated but consistent, matching the ritualized frame. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the ritual significance of place, of timing, of sacrifice") that reads more authorial than character-grounded. Free indirect style is generally clean, though some passages ("operatively gentle, a man whose voice could still a battlefield") lean expository. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled but the voice lacks sharp rhythmic modulation under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with purposeful imagery (obsidian veined with silver, blood-ink on lily petals). However, the piece suffers from pervasive overwriting: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats carries figurative or elevated language ("the terrace drinking in starlight," "echo them back until they became a chorus, a lament, a lullaby"), creating density without escalation. Runs of parallel construction ("not a negotiator, but a gardener"; "not symbols of victory, but of shared wounds"; "not forgetting, but remembering rightly") become template cadence. The paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph ("not ended the war; transformed it" / "not paid once, but daily") dulls momentum. These artifacts don't obscure causality but flatten propulsion across multiple beats, triggering accumulated line-level penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ritual-as-reconciliation frame is familiar territory, and the piece does not substantially transform the template: a solitary figure performs symbolic acts, witnesses arrive, collective healing begins. The clipboard-to-cradle transformation and the distributed-burden closure offer specific images, but the emotional arc (lone negotiator enables communal mourning through ritual) follows predictable stages. "Operatively gentle" and "gardener of memory" provide modest verbal freshness, yet the core premise—peace requires shared acknowledgment of cost—remains abstract and ungrounded in verifiable lived detail that would distinguish this war from any other. The transformation test suggests plot and arc would survive relabeling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen (forever war peace negotiator) is present throughout and his choices—arranging offerings, speaking names, lifting the clipboard—create the ritual sequence. Setup is immediate, he enables the middle gathering, and his role-shift at closure ("not as a negotiator, but as a gardener") participates in the ending. However, the character's professional identity functions more as framing label than constraint that narrows options under pressure; "negotiator" could swap for "mediator" or "peacekeeper" with minor edits. The trait enables the ritual but doesn't force a visible trade-off or cost tied specifically to negotiation skill. Two gates plus lyric closure reprise reaches mid-5s; swappability and lack of sharp causal pressure limit further climb.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in beat one (clutched like a shield), reappears when Kaelen opens it to reveal the blood-written treaty, transforms into a cradle, and is cast into the sky where it shatters into light. Four distinct beats with evolving use and charged reprise. Setup is early, it constrains the middle reveal (twenty years carried), and it anchors the closure image (distributed names/stories). The transformation and shattering provide specificity and irreplaceability. Cost connection is strong: the clipboard's destruction enacts the shift from individual burden to collective memory. Reaches high 7s on beat count, closure linkage, and reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core concept (the price of redemption) is named explicitly on-page and shapes Kaelen's realization mid-ritual: "the price of redemption was not forgetting, but remembering rightly." This realization alters his tactic from burning to collective witness. Setup occurs by midpoint when the concept is stated, it drives the pivot to shared cairn-building, and the ending demonstrates the price as ongoing practice ("not paid once, but daily"). However, the concept is delivered via summary thought rather than dramatized trade-off, and the phrasing is abstract enough to risk thematic echo. Two gates plus thematic charge at closure reach mid-6s; dramatization gap and slight label-feel prevent higher band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" appears once as label in the opening exposition ("a man whose voice could still a battlefield, whose hands had once cradled a dying child") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown through a present-scene choice under pressure. No setup beat demonstrates gentleness altering tactics; no middle friction tests it; the ending does not hinge on it. Ornamental use and label-only mention keep the score in low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kaelen comes to the terrace "to muster—not armies, but memory," and the action (gathering mourners, building the cairn) structures the middle and ending beats. Setup is explicit, the mustering occurs on-page as the Skyborne and Deepkin climb and contribute fragments, and the collective assembly shapes the closure transformation. However, "muster" as gathering-verb is somewhat generic; "summon," "convene," or "gather" could substitute without breaking logic. Two functional beats (arrival, cairn-building) and closure participation place it in mid-6s; swappability and lack of sharp specificity cap further climb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Ritual significance is taught early ("the terrace had been built by the First Accord...understood the ritual significance of place, of timing, of sacrifice") and the method governs all subsequent action: midsummer timing, three-moon alignment, altar offerings, name-speaking, collective cairn. Setup by first third, the ritual mechanics drive every middle beat (dipping lily in starlight, terrace echoing names, mourners adding fragments), and the closure hinges on ritual completion (clipboard transformation, terrace crumbling). The specificity (blood-ink on lily petals, star of redemption at zenith) and the constraint (the ritual "demanded more" than burning) make the method indispensable. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability push into high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient terrace at midsummer is introduced in the opening line and anchors every beat: its obsidian and silver respond to Kaelen's heartbeat, it reflects the war below, it draws mourners upward, and it crumbles at dawn after fulfilling its purpose. Setup is immediate, the terrace's properties enable the ritual (altar stone, pulsing veins), and the ending depends on the location's transformation. The midsummer timing tightens the window (three moons aligned, star at zenith). However, "ancient terrace" could arguably be another ritual site with similar symbolic properties; the specificity (obsidian/silver veins) provides some irreplaceability but not full uniqueness. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage reach low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe (during the slow dance of celestial bodies) is signaled in the opening and specified: midsummer, three-moon alignment, star of redemption at zenith. The timing constrains the ritual ("each midsummer...the terrace became a conduit") and the star reaching zenith triggers the clipboard's shattering. Setup is early, the celestial mechanics enable the middle transformation, and closure occurs at peak alignment ("as the star of redemption reached its zenith"). However, the time pressure is more symbolic than urgent—the ritual unfolds without a ticking-clock forcing trade-offs. The mourners arrive "drawn by rumor or hope" rather than racing a deadline. Two gates plus lyric timing at closure reach high-5s; lack of tactical urgency limits climb.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation (to anchor ideals in practice) is stated early ("Kaelen had studied the old texts...knew that to anchor ideals in practice, one must first pay the price of redemption") and his realization mid-ritual ("the price of redemption was not forgetting, but remembering rightly") pivots his approach from solitary burning to collective witness. Setup by first third, the desire drives the ritual sequence, and the ending demonstrates the motive's fulfillment (peace-as-practice, shared burden). However, the motivation is delivered via summary thought and abstract phrasing rather than embodied friction between want and cost in a pressured choice. One clear causal turn and closure link reach low-6s; told-only and lack of on-page conflict between desire and obstacle prevent higher band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Flawed beauty is woven throughout: the lily with "flawed beauty of a peace that could never be perfect, only possible," the ebony clipboard's rust-brown blood-ink, the mourners' broken fragments, and the final dawn where Kaelen walks "knowing that the price of redemption was not paid once, but daily, in the flawed beauty of trying again." Tone is coherent, modulates from solemnity (opening) through collective grief (middle) to quiet acceptance (ending), and charges the final image. The tone's consistent coloring of imperfect reconciliation supports theme without becoming static. Strong integration across beats and closure-charging effect reach low-7s.</comment>
