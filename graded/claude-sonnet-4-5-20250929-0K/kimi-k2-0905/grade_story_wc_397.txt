<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior motivation ("fold in patience") is poetically stated but never concretely dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The boy is sketch-level, characterized mainly through what he holds and says rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final "choice" to become a dispatcher is told in summary years later, undercutting the on-page cost requirement. Emotional progression relies heavily on abstraction ("grief, she had decided, was a cleaner teacher") rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with mosaic structure (multiple time-shards: night one, day three, boarding scene, years later, old age). The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the parasol-as-compass image and the cycle restarting, but cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on the page—no specific forfeiture or tactical narrowing is visible in the final beat. Orientation anchors slip: "the morning after waking up changed" never clarifies what changed or when, and the mercy ship's function oscillates between witnessing platform and active departure vessel without clear setup. One meaningful tightening occurs when the boy runs toward the horn, but the resolution (planting the parasol, years passing) tells rather than shows the reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vivid in scattered images (grinding floes, plates of sea groaning, crack of ice), and the parasol tip's physical interaction (tapped twice, planted upright) does constrain one choice—the boy's decision not to board. However, spatial choreography blurs: the listening post tent, the gangway queue, and the line of passengers are not stably mapped, and the story never clarifies whether the boy and Mara are standing on ice or dock when they "trawl the line." The harbor master and loudspeaker setup anchor early but fade without consequence. The environment charges the final image but does not systematically shape tactics across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning "the sound of approaching endings"—is announced but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option with visible cost. The boy's reversal (not boarding) is triggered by recognition of a hum rather than Mara's agency, and no trade-off is dramatized on the page. The elders' weather reports and recipes appear as atmosphere rather than escalation. The piece deepens thematically across time-shards, but pressure does not cohere or tighten under the accumulative lens; instead it diffuses into summary ("years later") without a single on-page narrowing that alters Mara's options or knowledge in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—patience as a hinge, staying versus leaving, the sound of endings—emerges organically from the parasol's recurring presence and the grinding-ice hymn without overt thesis statements. The final image (a new volunteer listening, the cycle restarting "softer each time") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the piece leans on decorative abstractions ("fold in patience," "windborne solace," "portable roofs against endings") that gesture at depth rather than earning it through embodied particulars. The boy's growth into a rescue-skiff captain and Mara's dispatcher role are told, not dramatized, softening thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct texture ("the fold in patience kept her fingers still," "a chime thinner than moonlight, a sound that tasted of salt and lullabies"). Psychic distance remains stable in third-limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that clashes with immediate scene pressure: "the exact sound of approaching endings: not a scream but a sigh that keeps going" reads as authorial summation rather than Mara's lived perception. The boy's dialogue is minimal but functional; no dialogue on the page tests subtext or goal-driven rhythm. Free indirect style is clean, though the mosaic structure and time-jumps occasionally obscure whose present moment anchors the narration (e.g., "Years later, when the boy grew").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically varied and often imagistic, but figurative density saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating opacity rather than propulsion: "a fold in patience," "reality gripped loosely," "grief was a cleaner teacher," "the air folded like linen," "voices braided into windborne solace," "a private longitude," "patience properly folded is just another word for staying usable." Mixed metaphors abound (patience as fold/hinge, solace as windborne lift, parasol as compass/tuning fork). Paraphrase loops recur: the "sound of approaching endings" is restated at least four times without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the mosaic time-jumps ("Years later… On quiet nights… She smiles…"), and the final third remains abstract rather than concrete. Information density is low; many lines perform thematic work twice without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—euthanasia tourism, a fold in patience, a parasol as heirloom compass—offers a fresh synthesis, and the drift-ice setting is specific. However, the emotional arc (witness to volunteer to dispatcher) follows a template path of learned empathy without non-obvious moral calculus. The "fold" conceit and "windborne solace" tone risk quirky ornament rather than inevitability; removing the parasol and substituting another object would require only surface edits. The mosaic structure and lyric register signal ambition, but the piece does not fully commit to the implications of its own rules (what does "grips reality loosely" cost the harbor master on the page?). The ending's cycle-restart image is evocative but borders on fable convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present and her arc (tourist → volunteer → dispatcher) is signaled, but her choices are largely passive or told in summary. She decides to volunteer (off-page), lets the boy hold the parasol, taps it twice (the sole on-page choice that alters the boy's tactic), and years later becomes a dispatcher (told). The tap is functional but not irreplaceable; a verbal cue could substitute. She observes the elders but does not make a turn that redefines her own options. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The parasol appears in the opening image, is held by the boy (who traces the chip), tapped twice to produce the chime that stops him from boarding, planted in the ice as a final marker, and reprised in the last paragraph ("a frozen compass"). It constrains one key choice (the boy's reversal) and charges the closure image. However, its specific properties (ivory, lace, the chip) are described but not causally active; the tap could be performed by any resonant object. Three beats (hold, tap, plant) and closure linkage lift the score, but swappability and ornamental description (the chip is "worried" but never used) cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named in paragraph two, repeated as metaphor throughout, and restated in the resolution ("the fold in patience opens once more"). It functions as thematic label rather than tactical constraint; Mara's "fold" does not narrow her options on the page or create a visible trade-off. The concept is present and contributes to tone, but it remains abstract and swappable with "hesitation," "pause," or "grace." No middle beat dramatizes the fold forcing a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The harbor master "grips reality loosely after thirty winters," and Mara learns to do the same by the end ("grips reality loosely enough to feel it breathing"). The trait is mentioned but never enables or constrains an on-page action with cost. It reads as atmospheric descriptor rather than functional attribute. Ornamental use and no middle development keep the score low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Trawl" appears twice: Mara trawls the docks for belongings (setup), then she and the boy "trawled the line of passengers" offering tea (key beat). The tea-offering is the story's central cooperative act and enables the elders' voices to braid into solace, which in turn charges the parasol-planting closure. However, the physical trawling (searching spilled belongings) is mentioned once and never used; the second "trawl" is metaphorical (moving along a queue). The action shapes one beat and connects to closure, but its mechanics are vague and the first instance is dropped, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled when Mara volunteers and is assigned to the listening post. The listening-post job (recording final words) sets up her decision not to record, which feeds the theme. However, the mechanics of disaster relief are never shown—she does not actually trawl belongings on the page, and the tea-offering is a spontaneous act rather than structured relief work. The method is present in setup and contributes to Mara's stance, but it does not constrain middle choices or shape the closure beat, remaining largely background.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is anchored early (dock, floes, listening post, gangway) and pressure-tested: the boy's village is "erased by grinding ice," the ice groans under their weight, Mara and the boy plant the parasol "in a crack of ice," and at dawn "the floes shifted and the marina began to sing." The grinding-ice hymn becomes the story's central sonic image and directly charges the closure. The setting supplies the parasol's resting place and the recurring sound motif, driving two beats and shaping the ending. Spatial choreography occasionally blurs (tent/gangway/line positions), and the setting does not constrain a middle tactical choice, capping the score below 7.0 but placing it solidly in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" anchors the opening timeframe, and the piece tracks "the morning after," "the third day," "that night," "years later," and "old now." However, the nature of the change is never specified, the time markers are loose, and no clock tightens a decision—Mara's key choice (not to record) is ongoing stance rather than deadline-driven. The timeframe orients but does not pressure tactics. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated in paragraph five and reprised in the resolution ("the sound she learned is the hush between heartbeats"). It drives her decision not to record and to stay through dawn, and it shapes her later role as dispatcher. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page friction between this desire and a competing cost (she simply chooses not to record without visible sacrifice). Setup, one middle beat (staying to listen), and closure participation are present, lifting the score to mid-band, but lack of embodied conflict and cost caps it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" appears as a phrase in the key beat when the elders' voices braid and lift the parasol, and it is reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("a windborne solace carrying her gift back"). The tone is lyric, melancholic, and consistent, modulating from observer calm to cooperative grace to reflective closure. It charges the final image (the wind lifting the note, the cycle restarting "softer") and coheres across the mosaic structure. However, the tone occasionally flattens into abstraction ("solace," "hymn," "hush") rather than sensory embodiment, and it does not shift under peak pressure (the boarding-scene beat maintains the same register as the opening). Present across beats, contributes to closure, but lacks dynamic range.</comment>
