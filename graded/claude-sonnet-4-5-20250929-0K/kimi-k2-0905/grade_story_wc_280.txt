<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation is clear (needs an encore to stitch memory together) and embodied through the coin-pressing gesture. However, the protagonist makes no meaningful choice under pressure; he follows a nightly ritual, encounters Lila who delivers the solution, and simply performs the prescribed action. Internal contradiction is absent—his longing is stated but never conflicts with a competing impulse or cost. The change at the end (outline sharpening into the young actor) feels granted rather than earned by a difficult decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors are delayed (stage ghost, closed theater, hedge maze) but comprehensible by ~15% without penalty. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the ghost receives the applause he sought and his form sharpens, carrying an "endless encore" forward. Cost is implied (Lila vanishes, orchard dims) but not felt as a trade-off or foreclosure—he gains satisfaction without visible sacrifice. One meaningful deepening occurs (coin-threading ritual → blooming backward → applause from leaves), but the protagonist's agency is minimal; Lila provides the method and the garden responds mechanically. Under an Accumulative lens, the density increase and cadence shift at the orchard stage are present, but the cost legibility is weak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and layered (velvet curtain, hedge maze, quince/pear orchard, cracked marble stage, night-blooming nicotia). The orchard's sensory details (perfume as violins, fruit glowing like footlights) are filtered through the ghost's synesthetic perception and serve the closure image. The maze "rearranges itself" and the orchard "existed only because enough mourners had remembered it" are purposeful world rules that frame the ghost's access to the past. The tarot coin (micro-setting object) constrains the ritual and charges the final image when pocketed warm. Spatial choreography is clean across alley, maze, and stage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ghost needs an encore to preserve memory) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the coin-threading ritual and Lila's instruction produce the applause. However, escalation is minimal—the ghost follows the same nightly path, then executes Lila's guidance without obstacle or trade-off. No reversal tests his commitment; luck (the orchard's response, Lila's appearance) resolves the need rather than protagonist choice. The cost (Lila gone, orchard dimmed) is atmospheric, not a foreclosed option. Under the Accumulative lens, the ritual's intensification is present but the protagonist's agency in driving it is low.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of memory, performance, and time's fluidity emerges through image (fractured minutes as colored ribbons, timeline folding, applause from leaves). The orchard as "hidden wing of the theater" and the coin warming "as a living palm" offer non-literal answers to the ghost's longing without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in Lila's question ("Still craving applause, Casper?") and the backward-blooming quince. However, the final image (invisible yet satisfied, carrying an endless encore) leans toward consolation without complication—the ghost gets what he wanted with no visible renunciation or ambiguity. The thematic resonance is present but tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to the ghost, with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: synesthetic coloring (citrine applause, indigo silence, rose regret; echoes as scents; voice as gold spirals; words tasting of iron). Dialogue (Lila's two lines) is brief, natural, and goal-driven. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("forbidden flavor," "chords of perfume," "narrative clock") that edges past the ghost's established idiom. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. The final paragraph maintains texture ("translucent ribs") without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; sensory layering is vivid ("buttered popcorn, rosin, moth-eaten brocade"). However, persistent overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "minutes fracture into colored ribbons—citrine applause, indigo silence, rose regret" and "echoes that were also scents" stack figurative language without advancing pressure. Two paraphrase loops: "the coin still hummed with that forbidden flavor" after describing the seamstress's synesthetic experience, and "the fractured timeline sealed into a continuous present where every performance was happening at once" restates the earlier folding metaphor. Template cadence appears in the orchard sequence: "He mounted... He flipped... The threads lifted... She raised... He caught... He tied... He began..." The closure image is clear, but figurative density in the ritual (18–22) obscures causal linkage. Deductions: −0.6 for overwriting density, −0.4 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence = baseline ~7.7, adjusted to 6.3 with cumulative artifact impact on momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of theater ghost, synesthetic coin, hedge maze, and time-folding orchard is specific and layered. The "seamstress who tasted starlight while painting" and "applause from leaves" are fresh details. However, the core arc—lonely ghost seeks closure, encounters helpful spirit, performs ritual, gains peace—is a familiar template. Transformation is partial: the synesthetic mechanics and orchard's conditional existence add texture, but the emotional resolution (invisible yet satisfied) does not subvert the comfort trajectory. The piece commits fully to its premise but plays the notes as written. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative ritual, lyric density) is present but does not heighten stakes; the ghost's path is unobstructed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ghost is present throughout and his longing drives the sequence. Setup: clear by paragraph one. Development: he carries the coin nightly and presses it to his chest, but makes no contested choice—he follows ritual and Lila's instruction. Payoff: he bows and pockets the thimble, satisfied. The ghost observes, longs, and receives; he does not decide under pressure. Two beats (coin-pressing, stage ritual) show involvement, but causal pressure is low—the orchard and Lila do the work. Closure linkage is strong (he walks away satisfied), but swappability is moderate (any longing spirit could fill the role with minor edits). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, low causal pressure −0.8, moderate swappability −0.6, summary at the end (invisible yet satisfied) −0.4 = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tarot coin appears in four beats: described with synesthetic history (paragraph 4), pressed to the ghost's chest (5), flipped on stage to ring echoes (8–9), and tied to the quince tree to produce the ritual's effect (16). Setup: early (paragraph 3–4). Development: the coin's "forbidden flavor" hum and echo-ringing enable the ghost's entry into fractured time and the ritual's mechanics. Payoff: the coin is pocketed "warm as a living palm" (23), reweighted from cold relic to living presence. Causal pressure is strong—the coin's unique properties (synesthetic paint, echo-production) are irreplaceable for the ritual. Cost connection is indirect (Lila's disappearance, orchard dimming) but the coin's transformation charges the closure. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, indirect cost −0.3 = ~7.8 (rounded down from 8.0 per rounding rule).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fractured timeline is introduced early ("feeling minutes fracture into colored ribbons," paragraph 5) and shapes the ghost's access to the past. Setup: clear by paragraph 5. Development: the timeline "folded so that 1923 and tonight touched at the fingertips" (11), enabling Lila's appearance and the ritual. Payoff: "the fractured timeline sealed into a continuous present where every performance was happening at once" (21), producing the applause. The concept constrains the ghost's need (he cannot access the past without the coin and orchard) and the ritual's mechanics depend on time-folding. However, the ghost does not struggle against the fracture or make a choice about which timeline to inhabit—the orchard and coin do the work. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, moderate causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, low protagonist agency −0.8, ornamental phrasing (colored ribbons description) −0.4 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The synesthetic blessing is attributed to Lila (she "tasted starlight while dabbing silver paint," paragraph 4) and the coin "still hummed with that forbidden flavor." Setup: present by paragraph 4. The ghost perceives synesthetically (citrine applause, voice as gold spirals, words tasting of iron), but this is presented as his nature, not a constraint or cost. The trait does not enable a choice or create a trade-off—it colors description without altering tactics. Development and payoff: the synesthetic echoes (scents, chords) are part of the ritual's texture, but the ghost could perform the same actions without this specific trait. One beat (coin's hum), ornamental use (no on-page action pressure) −0.7, late clarification (synesthesia as inherited from Lila, not the ghost's own struggle) −0.4, swappability (the ritual could use non-synesthetic mechanics) −0.6 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Intertwining is the central action of the ritual: the ghost ties the coin to the quince tree with invisible thread and walks the stage, letting "the coin's echoes intertwine with the orchard's floral chords" (16). Setup: the word "intertwine" appears in paragraph 9 ("each echo a thread he could intertwine with the present"). Development: the act of threading and walking produces "echoes that layered like harmonies" (17) and "intertwined echoes condensed into a single, audible heartbeat" (20). Payoff: the intertwined echoes seal the fractured timeline and produce the applause (21). The action is irreplaceable—without the intertwining, the ritual fails. However, the ghost executes Lila's instruction without obstacle; the action is not tested or contested. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, strong causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, low protagonist struggle −0.7 = ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Producing echoes is the method for the ritual. Setup: "echoes that were also scents" (paragraph 9). Development: the coin "ringing out echoes" (9), and the ghost's stage walk produces "echoes that layered like harmonies" (17). Payoff: "the intertwined echoes condensed into a single, audible heartbeat" (20), sealing the timeline. The mechanics are signaled and matter—the echoes are the threads that intertwine past and present. However, the method is automatic once the ghost follows Lila's instruction; no iteration or failure tests the mechanics. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, moderate causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.3, low protagonist struggle −0.6, ornamental phrasing (echoes as scents) −0.3 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mystic orchard garden is the ritual's stage and the source of the applause. Setup: "the mystic orchard garden concealed at its center" (paragraph 6). Development: the orchard's "night-blooming nicotia released chords of perfume that sounded, to him, like distant violins" (7), and the "fruit glowing like miniature footlights" (18) create the environment for the ritual. Payoff: "Applause burst from the leaves" (21), and the orchard "dimmed but did not vanish" (24), waiting to "raise its ghost-light again." The setting pressures the ghost's access (he must enter the maze nightly) and supplies the resources (the stage, the quince tree, the leaves) that produce the closure. Spatial choreography is clean (alley → maze → orchard → stage). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, strong causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection (orchard dims) +0.4 = ~7.6 (rounded down from 8.2 per dominant limiter: the orchard's mechanics are clear but the ghost's struggle with access is minimal, −0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the business closes" is established early (paragraph 1) and frames the ghost's nightly ritual. Setup: clear. Development: "Tonight, like every night after the business closed" (3) signals the repeated access window, and "as dawn crept over the hedges" (24) marks the endpoint. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—the ghost has the entire night, and no clock pressures his choices. The ritual unfolds without time constraint or urgency. Payoff: "just as the janitor unlocked the lobby" (25) provides a boundary but does not alter the ghost's satisfaction. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, low causal pressure (no ticking clock) −0.5, closure mention +0.4, vague tracking (no sense of minutes or hours) −0.4 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to lure possibility from the brink of despair" is voiced by the ghost ("I need possibility," paragraph 13) and echoed by Lila ("lure it from the brink of despair," 14). Setup: the ghost's need for an encore (paragraph 2) primes this, but the specific phrasing arrives late (second half). Development: the motivation drives the ritual, but the ghost's despair is stated, not embodied in a contested choice. Payoff: the ghost achieves satisfaction, carrying "an endless encore beneath his translucent ribs" (25). The desire is clear but not conflicted—no want-versus-fear tension or visible trade-off. Two beats +0.9, moderate causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, late first phrasing (second half) −0.4, told-only despair −0.6, low friction between want and cost −0.5 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rising nostalgia is the dominant tone, established through "empty seats only sighed with dust" (2), "fractured timeline" imagery (5), and "rising nostalgia thicken into almost-solid ground" (18). Setup: early. Development: the tone intensifies as the ritual progresses—"Applause burst from the leaves, soft as rainfall but steady" (21) crescendos the nostalgic longing. Payoff: "invisible yet satisfied, carrying an endless encore" (25) resolves the nostalgic ache into fulfillment. The tone is coherent through all beats and modulates purposefully (longing → ritual → satisfaction). However, the tone is unidirectional—no irony, bitterness, or complication tensions the nostalgia. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, strong coherence +1.2, closure charge +1.4, specificity +0.5, static (no tonal conflict) −0.4 = ~7.4.</comment>
