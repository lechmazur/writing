<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Quince's interior life operates through metaphor (borrowing personalities "like printers borrow type") rather than embodied contradiction. The widow's grief and astronomer's logic are told as abstractions—"eigenvalues of sorrow, vectors of longing"—without showing distinct impulses competing in a single choice. The final choice to reverse the press feels unmotivated by prior causality; we never see what Quince wants versus what he fears. Diagnostic label-speak ("lucid turbulence," "common denominator of longing") replaces scene pressure at peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately (topaz workshop, starlight, letterpress operator). Closure reads as a Decisive Change—Quince prints himself back, releasing borrowed souls—but the cost is abstract: his heart becomes "blank as unprinted paper" without showing what he's lost in lived terms. The drive lens wavers between Causal (personalities → halo fragment → child of light → reversal) and Accumulative/Textural (layered metaphors), settling into Hybrid by the end. Causality holds through most beats, but the halo fragment's mechanics arrive unexpectedly and resolve the problem it did not help create.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is visually distinct (translucent dome, flywheel, cedar drawer of names), and the halo fragment constrains the climax choice by forcing Quince to reverse the press. Spatial choreography remains clear (balcony, platen, cliff path). However, sensory detail skews heavily visual and metaphorical rather than tactile; we never feel the press's weight or ink texture under stress. The setting charges the final image (restored sky) but does not meaningfully alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding emotion's mathematics versus feeling others—is signaled early but remains thematic rather than tactical. Escalation occurs (widow's grief → astronomer's logic → child of light → reversal), yet the reversal choice lacks visible cost because we don't know what Quince loses by becoming "blank." No on-page foreclosed path or trade-off is dramatized; the stars return, the halo cracks, and the ending declares weightlessness without showing what he wanted to keep. Agency is present but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as subtraction, the mathematics of emotion ending in release—emerges from the press's mechanics and borrowed personalities. The final image (stars spelling emotions) offers a resonant answer without a stated moral. However, the piece leans heavily on direct thematic statements: "transposed empathy was not transmission but subtraction," "to shine is to be alone together." The halo fragment and child of light function as transparent allegory rather than grounded particulars, and the closing paragraph moralizes ("that to feel is to let others go").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Quince; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries a consistent poetic register ("moon-silver," "gutter of the page," "eigenvalues of sorrow") that fits the character's metaphor-making mind. However, diction often drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("lucid turbulence," "common denominator of longing") rather than compressing into sharper specificity. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but leans toward metaphor over lived sensory bias. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without reprieve: "calculus across his own tongue," "lattice of his own," "condensed into this single radiant variable." Mixed metaphors appear (grief "clung like wet newsprint" but also operates as "waveforms intersecting"). Template cadence runs ("He lifted… he placed… he turned…" in the climax). Paraphrase loops: "vanishing stars" recurs six times, "borrowed personalities" three times in adjacent paragraphs. Density is high but clarity suffers; the closure image ("blank as unprinted paper") is vivid yet the preceding lines loop through synonym churn ("radiant variable," "glowing child," "weightlessness").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The letterpress-as-empathy-engine premise is inventive and the topaz workshop setting is specific. However, the core conflict—borrowed personalities eroding the self—echoes familiar identity-loss templates without transforming them through lived occupational or social detail. The reversal (turning the flywheel backward to release souls) feels more like a narrative convenience than an earned synthesis. The final image of constellations spelling emotions is striking but leans toward allegorical convenience. Emotional specificity (widow's grief, astronomer's calculus) is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Quince chooses to reverse the press at the climax, but his decisions prior to that moment are largely reactive (lifting a sheet, opening a drawer, addressing the sky). The reversal alters the ending but lacks visible cost in lived terms—we don't see what he loses or gains in tactical choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in three beats: laid on the broadsheet, glowing brighter as personalities superpose, and cracking into seven rays at the end. It enables the child of light and shapes the reversal choice. However, it arrives late (second beat) and its mechanics are not established before it resolves the problem, capping at mid-6s despite closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named explicitly ("transposed empathy was not transmission but subtraction") and drives the thematic arc, but its mechanics remain abstract. We see Quince borrow personalities and feel their effects, yet the concept does not constrain a single tactical choice—no on-page moment where he must choose between empathy and self-preservation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The habit of borrowing personalities is demonstrated in two beats (widow's grief, astronomer's calculus) and the reversal pays off the trait by releasing all borrowed souls. However, the trait is told ("Quince habitually borrows personalities") rather than shown through a visible micro-choice, and the cost (eroded lattice of self) is asserted in summary rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Disorientation is named ("The words disoriented him," "disorientation peaked") and the double-vision workshop appears, but the action does not drive a major turn. The superposed visions are described but do not force a tactical choice that alters the ending; the reversal choice occurs after disorientation subsides, not because of it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is present in the press's "half-truths in Morse he almost knew" and the superposed visions, but the method does not shape attempts or constrain choices. It functions as atmospheric texture rather than a causal mechanism; the reversal is a straightforward action without ambiguity in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is visually distinct and houses the press, balcony, and cedar drawer. The translucent dome admits starlight and the vanishing stars provide the timeframe. The setting enables the reversal (platen, flywheel) and the final image (restored sky), meeting two gates. However, it does not pressure choices—no spatial or resource constraint alters tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "between vanishing stars" bookends the piece and signals urgency, but the vanishing is not tracked as a live clock. Stars disappear and reappear without showing how much time remains or forcing a faster choice. The frame is poetic but does not tighten decisions in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to understand emotion's mathematics is stated in the opening ("chasing the mathematics of emotion") and articulated by Quince ("If feeling equals forgetting the self, what remains to do the arithmetic?"). The final choice—reversing the press—resolves the question by releasing borrowed souls, but the motivation is told rather than shown through conflicted micro-choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone coheres as lyric and metaphor-dense throughout, matching "lucid turbulence" with phrases like "moon-silver," "spectral tears," and "radiant variable." The tone modulates slightly at the reversal (shorter syntax: "he placed… closed… turned") and charges the final image (stars burning steadily, cracked halo in pocket). However, the tone remains uniformly elevated without significant pressure-driven shift, trending mid-band.</comment>
