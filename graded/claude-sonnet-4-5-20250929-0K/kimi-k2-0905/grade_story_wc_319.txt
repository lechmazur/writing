<comment>The guardian's interiority is richly textured through embodied metaphor (frost as marginalia, paw prints as turning pages), and the core contradiction—cataloguer turned feral, caught between states—is sustained throughout. However, motivation remains abstract: the nightly ritual of offering and withdrawing the pendant never crystallizes into a concrete choice with visible tradeoff. The final turn ("stepped toward the boundary without stepping through") registers as renunciation, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt, and the agency reads passive—she turns back because crossing would violate the friendship with uncertainty, not because she sacrifices a legible want.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors who (feral guardian), where (frozen garden), and what (nightly approach to a boundary) within the first two paragraphs, establishing the lens as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The closure unit is Earned Stasis: she refuses passage and returns without the pendant, a renunciation that forecloses reunion with her former self. Cost is visible in the image of the pendant left behind and the "expanded boundary of light she now wore like a second fur," reweighting her relationship to uncertainty from stranger to companion. The lens holds, but escalation is thin—each paragraph deepens texture without narrowing options until the final turn, which arrives more as thematic capstone than causal tightening.</comment>

<comment>The frozen garden operates as micro-setting throughout: rosemary brittle as parchment, ice reflecting the moon as illuminated initial, the boundary breathing with tidal light. These details are filtered through the guardian's bibliographic lens and constrain her approach—she must wait for the veil to thin rather than force entry. The pendant's temperature shifts (warm, then cooling to "acceptance") function as environmental feedback that guides her final choice to leave it behind. Spatial choreography remains clean across the approach, the threshold negotiation, and the return with mist filling her tracks.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—whether to cross the boundary into the un-frozen garden—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure accumulates through poetic restatement rather than tightening. The guardian's nightly ritual (offering the pendant, taking it back) is described as ongoing practice without a catalyst that forces tonight to differ from prior nights. The final choice to leave the pendant and turn back reads as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (foregoing passage, accepting companionship with uncertainty), yet the decision feels contemplative rather than forced by escalating pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boundary "parted just enough to reveal another garden," but this revelation does not narrow her options—she was already committed to non-crossing.</comment>

<comment>Theme—friendship with uncertainty as acceptance of liminality—emerges organically from the guardian's embodied ritual and the garden's suspended state. The final image (placing the pendant, retracing steps, carrying "the expanded boundary of light… like a second fur") offers a resonant answer without moralizing: knowledge and identity remain unfixed, and the guardian's transformation is to internalize that ambiguity. The pendant's Morse translation ("All knowledge is frozen garden, all gardens are questions wearing evergreen") risks thematic echo but is framed as the object's voice rather than authorial thesis. Minor penalty for the line "to make friends with uncertainty is to admit you might be the story someone else is dreaming"—a near-stated moral that borders on abstracting the scene's concrete work.</comment>

<comment>Voice is lush and distinctive, with a bookish-feral perceptual signature: breath as "suspended commas," fur as "forgotten marginalia," paw prints as "turning pages." Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and the guardian's way of noticing is consistently filtered through bibliographic metaphor. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the POV's embodied present ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity," "negative space between breaths")—these phrases read more authorial than feral-cataloguer. The prose modulates with pressure (shorter clauses as she approaches the boundary, longer cumulative sentences during reflection), but the uniformly metaphorical texture flattens some peaks where sharper immediacy would serve.</comment>

<comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent (frost-as-text motif sustained), but several beats stack metaphors without clear propulsion: "a labyrinth whose walls were made of foggy lucidity, that state where shapes almost declare themselves" layers abstraction on abstraction. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines—"She did not cross" followed by "Instead she placed the pendant" restates the same refusal. Template cadence is avoided, and sentence rhythm varies purposefully, but information density sags in the middle third where waiting is re-described without advancing situation. The final paragraph risks summary ("carrying neither pendant nor answer, only the expanded boundary") but recovers with the concrete image of uncertainty's footfalls. No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative filter-verb reliance ("she thought," "she remembered," "she had come to befriend") dulls immediacy in reflective beats.</comment>

<comment>The synthesis of feral-guardian-as-cataloguer, frozen-garden-as-library, and friendship-with-uncertainty as refusal-to-resolve is specific and non-obvious, with the bibliographic lens transforming familiar liminal-threshold material. The nightly ritual and the pendant's role as negotiation token add fresh angles. However, the emotional stakes (longing for a former self, dimensionally homesick) echo well-worn exile/nostalgia templates, and the resolution—turning back from the threshold to accept in-between-ness—follows a predictable arc for this subgenre. The prose's lyric ambition and thematic commitment elevate, but the lack of a causal catalyst or unexpected turn keeps the piece from full originality.</comment>

<comment>The feral library guardian is present throughout and makes the key choice to turn back from the boundary, leaving the pendant behind. Setup is immediate (first line), development occurs in the repeated approach-and-retreat ritual, and payoff is the final renunciation. However, her agency is largely contemplative—she waits, observes, and finally chooses non-crossing—without a mid-scene decision that alters tactics or narrows options. The character is indispensable to voice and world but functions more as lens than driver of escalation.</comment>

<comment>The cultist's pendant appears early (paragraph 5), is carried throughout, and is left behind at closure as the visible token of renunciation. It is handled in multiple beats: carried in her jaw, offered and withdrawn nightly, grows warm then cools, and is finally placed on the ice. The pendant's "copper eye" and temperature shifts provide feedback that guides the guardian's stance. However, its causal pressure is mild—it does not enable or constrain a choice so much as symbolize the choice already made. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement lift the score, but swappability (another token object could serve) and the lack of a mid-scene tactic forced by the pendant's properties prevent higher bands.</comment>

<comment>The boundaries of light are introduced early ("boundaries of light became negotiable currency") and recur throughout: the boundary "breathing with slow tidal light," the moment it parts to reveal the un-frozen garden, and the final image of the guardian carrying "the expanded boundary of light… like a second fur." Setup and payoff are strong, but the concept does not constrain a choice in development—the guardian was always going to wait and refuse crossing. The boundary functions more as thematic frame than active shaper of tactics. Lyric reprise across first and final thirds reweights the stake (from external threshold to internalized state), which justifies mid-band placement.</comment>

<comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is named explicitly twice (paragraphs 4 and 14) and informs the guardian's backward gaze toward her cataloguer past, but it does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The trait colors her perception (remembering photons, thinking of libraries shelving into her absence) yet remains label-level interiority. No beat shows her sacrificing a present option because of this homesickness or leveraging it to cross the boundary. The trait supports motivation but does not shape a turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Waiting is the guardian's explicit method, signaled early ("she had stopped him by waiting") and reiterated throughout: "Each night she practiced," "Waiting was her method now," "she let the foggy lucidity settle." The final choice—"stepped toward the boundary without stepping through"—is the culmination of waiting as refusal to force. This action drives the closure unit (Earned Stasis) and is irreplaceable; urgency or forcing would break the logic. Waiting shapes two major beats (the nightly ritual, the threshold moment) and is causally tied to the friendship with uncertainty. The action is essential, though its repetitive invocation across many lines risks redundancy.</comment>

<comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is stated once (paragraph 13: "She interiorized exteriors: the crunch of her own paw prints became the sound of turning pages; the moon's reflection in ice became a illuminated initial") and echoed in the cultist's earlier claim ("books were merely exteriorized souls that needed interiorizing exteriors"). The method is illustrated in that single beat but does not recur or enable a later tactic. It clarifies the guardian's bibliographic lens and supports theme, yet it does not constrain a choice or shape the closure. Late explicit naming (past midpoint) and ornamental single use prevent higher bands.</comment>

<comment>The frozen garden in mist is established immediately and sustained as the sole setting. It pressures the guardian's approach by rearranging into corridors, releasing scent of unread stories, and requiring her to wait for the veil to thin. The brittleness of rosemary and the ice's reflective surface provide sensory anchors that filter through her bibliographic perception. The garden's state (frozen vs. un-frozen on the far side of the boundary) directly informs her final choice to turn back. Setup, development (the garden's nightly reconfiguration), and closure participation (the mist filling her tracks as she retreats) are all present, with the setting shaping tactics rather than serving as backdrop.</comment>

<comment>"Through the veil of sleep" and "veil of sleep" appear in paragraphs 4, 17, and 23, framing the guardian's liminal state. However, the timeframe remains abstract—no urgency or clock tightens decisions, and "each night" suggests repetition without a deadline. The guardian waits "tonight" as she has on prior nights, with no signal that this instance differs temporally. The phrase colors tone (foggy, suspended) but does not constrain a choice or create pressure. Ornamental recurrence without causal function keeps the score low.</comment>

<comment>"To make friends with uncertainty" is named explicitly (paragraph 11) and dramatized through the nightly ritual of offering and withdrawing the pendant. The motivation drives the closure choice—she turns back to preserve the friendship rather than resolve it by crossing. Friction between the want (passage to the un-frozen garden, reunion with her cataloguer self) and the cost (ending the friendship, losing liminality) is visible in the final image. Setup is clear, development occurs in the repeated practice, and payoff lands when uncertainty becomes "companion" in the last line. However, the motivation is more contemplated than tested by conflicting pressure; no mid-scene beat forces her to choose between friendship and another want.</comment>

<comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named once (paragraph 8) and sustained throughout via diction (mist, crystallizing breath, suspended commas, shapes that "almost declare themselves"). Tone modulates subtly: suspended and cumulative in reflective beats, tightening as she approaches the boundary, then softening again as she retreats. The oxymoronic pairing (fog + lucidity) charges the final image of uncertainty walking beside her—ambiguity accepted without confusion. Tone coherence is strong, and the effect supports both the accumulative lens and the theme. The tone is indispensable to the piece's identity and shapes the reader's entry into the closure moment.</comment>
