<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rowan's motivation is clear and specific (learning repair rhythm tied to his mentor's death), and interiority is concrete with embodied details like "coat crackling with rime" and the "irregular" tick of his own heart. The protagonist's choices drive the key turn when he understands the mirrors store better versions and heals the eclipse-key. However, the final workshop scene drifts into abstract epiphany ("to mend the world you must first forgive the gear that slipped") that borders on label-speak, and the mentor relationship lacks on-page friction—it anchors motivation but never complicates a present choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (density increases until the hall-of-mirrors realization reweights the dominant stake). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the transition from corridor to workshop is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when Rowan realizes the mirrors store "better versions," enabling the key repair and door unlock—this narrows options and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the workshop scene crystallizes his acceptance and new role). The closure lands with conceptual cost (the doorway vanishes, sealing his transition from apprentice to custodian). Minor causal slip: the mentor's "disastrous dawn" and the sheared key are told in backstory without prior setup, so the healing feels less earned than designed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library, auroras through vaulted glass, crystal floors, and undulating mirrored panels create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that supports the liminal tone. The hall of mirrors directly constrains Rowan's choice: he must align the flawed key with its reflection to heal it, making setting a tactical necessity. The final workshop—filled with "driftwood nostalgia," cedar shards, moon-dials—charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Rowan's locksmith focus (frost beading on pins, the "low tidal note" hum). No spatial incoherence or token catalogs.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (learning the rhythm of repair to mend his own irregular heart) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One on-page tightening: Rowan's doubt ("if no gear fit, the rhythm of repair would stay a stranger") is answered when he notices the mirror-versions and performs the key-healing action, which narrows his path and opens the door. The final cost is conceptual and spatial—the doorway vanishes, foreclosing return—but it's understated and arrives without a visceral trade-off or loss of a live option during the attempt. The escalation is largely interior and observational; Rowan's agency is more receptive (noticing, aligning) than decisive under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (repair requires forgiving past failure) emerges from concrete images—the sheared key, the mentor's workshop, the clocks ticking "not forward but inward." The closure offers a resonant answer without stating a moral: Rowan becomes custodian by embodying the lesson in action (adjusting escapements, timing his pulse). However, "to mend the world you must first forgive the gear that slipped" is a near-thematic-echo line that verges on articulating the premise too directly. The final image (overlapping ticks, distant morning, moon waiting) is non-literal and charged, lifting the score despite the single overt statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is locksmith-specific (gear assortment, pins, escapements) and the prose texture is consistent, elevated but not implausible for an introspective craftsman. However, register drifts occasionally into ornamental lyricism ("silver gauze," "hauntingly bright reflection… like a twin who already knew the ending") that crowds peak beats without clear voice motivation, and the syntactic patterns (many participial openers, stacked modifiers) recur enough to flatten rhythm under pressure. Purposeful elision is minimal; the piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, so no penalty for compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, especially in peak beats: "breath unfurled as silver gauze," "frost racing along the shank," "driftwood nostalgia," "overlapping ticks a distant morning soft as hush." Multiple adjacent sentences carry metaphor without clear payoff, violating the overwriting density check (−0.5). Template cadence appears in several runs: "He uncapped… letting… so he held… listening…" and "Rowan stepped… Rowan set… opened… started adjusting…" (−0.4). Mixed vehicle: "mirrors… repeated it in fractal chorus" conflates visual and auditory modes without coherent mapping (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or scaffold, and information density is generally high. Total artifact penalty ~−1.2, pushing the score below 7.0 and disqualifying 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—locksmith heals a key by aligning it with a better reflection in a hall that stores discarded drafts—is specific and non-obvious. The lunar-eclipse framing, clockmaker gears, and frozen library synthesize into a coherent fantastical logic. The turn (mirrors show versions "just before the mistake") feels earned in hindsight and drives the key-healing action. However, the mentor-funeral backstory and the "gear that slipped" phrasing echo common metaphors for loss and forgiveness, and the final workshop tableau leans toward wish-fulfillment (all clocks begin to tick, teaching their cadence). The piece commits to its premise but does not take bold structural or moral risks beyond the initial concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rowan's choice to align the flawed key with the mirror-reflection creates the pivotal turn (key heals, door opens). He is present in setup, drives the middle discovery, and his final action (adjusting escapements, timing his pulse) embodies the closure. Three beats; causal pressure; closure linkage; cost connection (he cannot return). Early signal and irreplaceability are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The gear assortment is uncapped in the first third, held near the keyhole in the middle (no gear hums), and placed on the bench in the workshop at the end. Two distinct beats; early signal; closure participation (bench action). However, the gears never narrow a tactic or constrain a choice—the mirror-healing solves the problem, not gear selection. Causal pressure is low; the assortment is present but largely ornamental after the initial attempt.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors shapes the central discovery (reflections show better versions) and enables the key-healing action, which unlocks the door. It is introduced early, constrains the middle choice (Rowan must use the mirror to repair the key), and the final workshop scene extends the mirror logic (reflecting the mentor's space). Three beats; high causal pressure; closure linkage; irreplaceability strong. The concept is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" appears three times (spires, reflections, repeated reflections mocking hope) but functions as atmospheric description rather than constraint. It does not enable or prevent an action, nor does it carry cost. Present in setup and middle; ornamental use; swappable with "brilliant" or "cold." No causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Uncapping the brass tube releases the gear assortment, initiating the attempt to find the correct piece. This action is signaled early, drives the middle beat (testing gears), and leads to the realization that the gears do not hum—prompting the mirror solution. Two beats; causal pressure (the failed attempt redirects tactics); closure participation (gears placed on bench). The uncap itself is easily swappable (he could draw them from a pouch), but the act of testing gears is necessary to the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" are introduced in paragraph three as Rowan's means of finding the lock. The method is signaled early and motivates his journey, but the prophecy's mechanics (warning that "the correct piece would hum when lunar umbra kissed the door") shape only one attempt before being bypassed by the mirror solution. Setup and middle participation; minimal causal pressure after the first beat; no closure linkage. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frozen library anchors the entire story spatially and tonally. The crystal floors, vaulted glass with auroras, astronomy aisle, hall of mirrors, and final workshop all derive from the setting and constrain Rowan's movements and choices. The setting enables the mirror-healing tactic and provides the tactile resources (frost, bronze door, cedar shards, moon-dials) that charge the closure. Early signal; three beats; high causal pressure; closure linkage; irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Under the soft hush of a distant morning" appears in the opening line and is reprised in the final sentence ("overlapping ticks a distant morning soft as hush"), creating a lyric frame. However, the timeframe does not constrain decisions or tactics—Rowan's actions are not timed, and no clock pressure exists. Present in setup and closure; ornamental reprise; no causal pressure. The reprise reweights the opening phrase with closure resonance, lifting it slightly above pure decoration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rowan's desire "to learn the rhythm of repair" is established early, connected to his irregular heartbeat and mentor's death, and dramatized through his doubt ("if no gear fit, the rhythm would stay a stranger") and final action (timing his pulse to the restored escapements). The motivation drives setup, middle, and closure; it shapes his interpretation of the mirror-discovery and his acceptance of the custodian role. Friction between want and cost is present (the doorway vanishes, sealing his transition). Three beats; causal pressure; closure linkage; cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" is named once in the workshop chamber description and tonally coheres with the elegiac, lyric register throughout (mentor's loss, hauntingly bright reflections, forgiveness theme). The tone modulates subtly—anticipation in the corridor, doubt at the door, acceptance in the workshop—and charges the final image (clocks ticking inward, teaching their cadence). However, the tone is largely static and does not shift decisively under pressure; it supports rather than intensifies. Coherent through turns; charges the ending; moderate closure linkage.</comment>
