<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to preserve memory and mentor through example is clear and coherent. Her backward walking and mirror-shard annotations are embodied traits with texture. However, the child's arrival and immediate understanding feel unmotivated; the protagonist's interior contradiction (refusal versus acceptance) resolves without visible cost or struggle in the present scene. The mentor's teacup functions more as symbol than lived choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression. The reversible-exile premise is established early, and the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the child can return without forgetting because Lira "remembered for both"). Cost is asserted but remains conceptual; the on-page action (walking backward seven times, catching a page) does not dramatize a foreclosed path or visible forfeiture. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library is vividly rendered with specific details: warped doorway, afternoon shadow caught in glass, shelves like breathing ribs. The ghost swing and shard-mirror coat constrain Lira's perception and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The setting actively pressures the protagonist's choices and supplies the teacup, page, and shadow as tactile anchors for the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (refusal to forget versus exile). The tea-leaf prediction introduces a fork, but the child's arrival feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven. The seven-circuit ritual and page-catching provide one tightening moment that reweights options. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens needs sharper visible cost; the resolution asserts that Lira "remembered for both" without a dramatized forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of resilience-through-refusal emerges organically from the reversible-exile conceit and backward-walking motif. The final teacup image ("perfect circle unbroken") and the annotation "walking backwards until the path agrees to follow you" offer a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture (spitting into dust, kneeling in reverse) and the mentor's erased name burrowing into glass. No thematic echo penalty; the ending reweights prior material with conceptual resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lira. Perceptual signature is distinct: annotations on bronze plaques, shard-light metaphors, combative tenderness. Diction remains internally consistent; no head-hopping. The child's dialogue ("Triangles, and a circle almost mended") and immediate comprehension feel slightly over-articulated for age and context, lowering naturalism slightly. Register control is strong; psychic distance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully; opening and closing images are vivid. Some figurative density ("hush felt like an empty playground swing," "shelves shifting like ribs breathing") approaches overwriting in adjacent beats but remains legible. Minor paraphrase loop: "walked backwards" recurs across five beats without changing cost or texture each time; baseline −0.2 applied. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Information density is high; clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist role, backward-walking-when-nervous trait, and reversible-exile premise combine into a specific synthesis. The geometry-of-tea-leaves method and afternoon-shadow-caught-in-glass object avoid stock metaphor. Risk-taking (lyric compression, non-standard causality) heightens stakes without obscuring closure. The emotional arc of mentor-become-text is transformed through the loop that lets the child return; not derivative but closely adjacent to archetype territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira appears in every beat and her choices (refusing exile, annotating, circling the teacup seven times, pressing the page to her heart, holding out the cup) drive the sequence. However, key turns depend on external arrivals (the page drifting down, the child's footsteps) rather than her agency narrowing options. Setup/development/payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The afternoon shadow caught in glass appears in the opening beat (lintel), is referenced when Lira angles the teacup to it, scatters across spines via mirror shards, and slips free at closure as the library exhales. Four distinct touches across setup/middle/payoff. The shadow's properties (pinned time, warm honey) charge the ending image and constrain Lira's annotation work. Specificity is high; cost connection is conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Reversible exile is introduced early, shapes Lira's refusal to forget, and provides the dominant stake. The seven-circuit ritual "seals a clause" to let the child choose with eyes open, altering the exile's terms. The concept appears in setup/middle/payoff and directly enables the ending's logic. Causal pressure is moderate; the rewrite lacks visible cost on the page but conceptually reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Walks backwards when nervous is mentioned in the opening ("always walked backwards when nervous") and Lira walks backward repeatedly throughout. However, the trait functions as atmospheric texture rather than constraining a choice with cost. The backward motion does not alter tactics or foreclose a path; it remains ornamental. One-beat involvement only; no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Annotating appears early (cracks in reality), mid-story (bronze plaque: "Resilience sounds like rusted chains"), and implicitly at closure (teacup leaves rearranged into annotation). The action shapes Lira's identity and provides a method for cataloging. However, the final annotation ("walking backwards until the path agrees") is attributed to the teacup rather than directly performed by Lira in the ending beat, weakening causal linkage. Setup/middle/payoff present; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is signaled early ("analyzing the geometry of tea leaves: triangle for journey, fractured circle for return, perpendicular line for refusal") and predicts both the reader and the resolution. The child peers into the cup and sees "a circle almost mended." The method appears in setup and payoff; its mechanics (triangle/circle/line) shape Lira's expectations and the child's comprehension. Causal pressure is moderate; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forgotten library is established in the opening line and pressures every choice: shelves about to collapse, the building absorbing memories (swing's ghost), responding by shuddering and drifting down the mentor's name, finally exhaling and settling. The library's active participation (breathing ribs, releasing the shadow) constrains Lira's ritual and charges the closure. Setup/middle/payoff all present; environment alters tactics and outcome. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" functions as atmospheric tone rather than a ticking clock. The hush is mentioned early and the swing's ghost appears mid-story, but elapsed time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The "afternoon shadow" provides temporal specificity (three o'clock) but remains static. Present in setup and middle; minimal causal pressure; no visible deadline cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to mentor resilience quietly is stated early ("mentor that stranger the way she had been mentored: without words, only example") and dramatized through her actions: holding out the teacup, pointing to the mentor's absence, walking backward together. The child's comprehension ("standing in the absence until absence itself taught strength") fulfills the goal. Setup/middle/payoff present; friction between wants (preserve memory) and method (silent example) is visible. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Combative tenderness appears explicitly ("spat into the dust—combative tenderness toward her own fate") and implicitly in gestures: kneeling while moving in reverse, smiling "the way a blade smiles when it chooses not to cut." The tone modulates with pressure and charges the ending's dual image of defiance and care. Coherent through turns; present in middle and payoff. The phrase itself is slightly over-articulated for peak beats but the effect holds.</comment>
