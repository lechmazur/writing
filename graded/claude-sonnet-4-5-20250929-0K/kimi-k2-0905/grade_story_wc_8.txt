<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her baseline trait ("emotionally rational") recurs, but the interiority leans on stock phrasing ("seductive pull," "inherited false glory") rather than embodied contradiction. The peak choice—taking the letter—feels inevitable from the start with no genuine internal conflict dramatized in scene. Micro-choices (knife work, climbing the semaphore) show competence but lack visible cost or foreclosed paths until the final walk away, which reads more as thematic summary than earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with light Accumulative layering (rosebush petals marking time). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara walks toward the city with the letter, cost implied in "ministers would curse her name" and the final image of dawn on rusted rails. Cost is conceptual and social rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping this shy of high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The disused station is vividly rendered (ivy-punched skylights, rusted rails, nettles) and the rosebush functions as both timekeeper and motif. Spatial choreography is clean through the semaphore climb and freight-tunnel exit. The setting constrains one choice (climbing to evade the watchman) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the professional detail (historian's archive work) remains abstract and untested by tactile constraints, capping the band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—expose the forged letter to rescue truth—is signaled early and coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the watchman's torch forces Elara onto the semaphore arm, narrowing her escape options. Agency is decision (taking the letter) and evasion, but the cost remains largely projected ("scholars would argue, citizens would doubt") rather than paid on the page. No visible trade-off or loss alters her tactics after the retrieval.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of truth versus noble lies emerges from the illuminated letter and the dynasty's deception, integrated into Elara's family history and her dissertation reversal. The rosebush's final petal and the ivy's "slow green edit" offer purposeful images. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("distrust the beauty of convenient stories," "truth…traveled farther than noble lies"), replacing earned resonance with thesis statement and triggering the thematic-echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (measuring shadows with "emotionally rational eyes," parallels drawn explicitly). Diction is controlled and elevated, fitting a historian's lens. The prose compresses transit efficiently and filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "imagined") are voice-motivated. Minor slip: "心跳 counting options like a metronome" intrudes as an untranslated fragment, breaking the established register without clear purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Three distinct artifacts lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in the backstory block ("praised…until correspondence revealed" restated as "lived to rescue truth from the pit"), (2) template cadence in the penultimate paragraph ("scholars would argue, citizens would doubt, ministers would curse"), and (3) stock metaphor strings ("pit of lies," "noble lies," "sanctioned history") clustering without fresh texture. The loop and template trigger −0.6 baseline; the metaphor stack adds −0.3, totaling −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—historian retrieves a forged illuminated letter to expose dynastic lies—synthesizes archival thriller with post-collapse setting. The rosebush timekeeper and ivy-reclaimed station offer specific texture. However, the emotional arc (from inherited pride to truth-teller's resolve) and the parallel-drawing method feel familiar, nearly matching template scholar-reclaims-truth plots without a non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's didactic turn ("distrust the beauty of convenient stories") retreats from bold specificity into abstract thesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara (fictional historian) is present throughout, drives the retrieval (prying the tile, taking the letter), evades the watchman by choice, and walks toward the city at closure. She creates two key turns: the decision to take the letter and the evasion climb. Early signal, beat involvement across three moves, and closure linkage satisfy all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate—her choices narrow options but the stakes remain largely projected. Cost is conceptual (future backlash) rather than paid on the page, capping the band below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The illuminated letter appears in the opening setup (motivates the mission), is physically retrieved mid-story (pried from the lead box, held, felt for "seductive pull"), and is pressed against Elara's ribs at closure, "warmer with future honesty." Three distinct beats, all three gates, causal enabling (the retrieval is the story's hinge), and closure linkage. Irreplaceability is strong—its gold-and-lapis artistry and role as dynasty's first lie are unique. Slight deduction: the letter's transformation is asserted ("warmer with future honesty") rather than shown through altered handling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Noble lies shape the premise (Rowan's famine cover-up) and Elara's motivation throughout. The concept constrains her choice to expose the forgery and frames the thematic question. Early signal, one decision beat (taking the letter to collapse "the manuscript's authority"), and closure participation (the letter's honesty rewrites the dynasty's lie). Cost is conceptual and social. Swappability is low—remove "noble lies" and the stakes collapse. Minor friction: the concept is more often discussed than shown altering on-page tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Emotionally rational" appears three times as a label (opening, midpoint reflection, closing smile) but constrains no on-page choice with visible cost. It colors her perceptual filter (measuring shadows, drawing parallels) yet never creates a tradeoff—no moment where rational analysis conflicts with emotion or vice versa. The trait is ornamental descriptor rather than active pressure. Setup and closure gates are met, but middle development is absent, triggering the missing-development cap at 3.4; the reprise lifts it slightly within band to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Recapture" (retrieval of the letter) is signaled in the opening mission statement, executed at midpoint (prying the tile, opening the box), and directly enables the closure walk toward publication. Two beats, all three gates, and high causal necessity—the entire plot hinges on this action. Cost is visible in the evasion and projected backlash. Minor deduction: the recapture itself proceeds without complication; Elara finds the tile, pries it, and takes the letter with no obstacle or price paid in the retrieval beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Drawing parallels" is named twice: Elara recalls her father's chronicle recitations and "forced herself…drawing parallels between patriotic noise and silence." The method is asserted in reflection but not shown shaping a choice or enabling a tactic. Setup is present (early backstory anchor), development absent (no middle decision driven by parallel-making), closure absent (the final walk does not hinge on analogy). The method is swappable—Elara could reach the same conclusion via direct observation. Missing two gates and swappability cap at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The disused railway station is present from the opening petal-drop, supplies the hidden tile and freight tunnel (middle constraint and escape route), and anchors the closure image (overgrown tracks, rusted line ahead). Three beats, all three gates, and clear causal pressure—the setting's layout enables both retrieval and evasion. Irreplaceability is high; the ivy-reclaimed depot and rail semaphore arm are specific to this locale. Cost linkage: the nettles and freight tunnel impose bodily price during escape.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the final petal drops") is signaled in the opening and marked at midpoint ("the rosebush outside had shed its final bloom, marking…'unmasking time'"). It teaches a symbolic clock but does not tighten on-page decisions—Elara's moves proceed at her own pace, and the watchman's arrival is coincidental rather than time-driven. Setup and payoff gates are met (the petal recurs in the ending image), but middle development is weak. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; the reprise reweights the image ("petal-less air," future blooms) with cost, lifting the score into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rescue truth from a pit of lies" is stated early, dramatized in the tile-prying and letter-taking beats, and frames the closure walk toward publication with projected cost ("ministers would curse"). Three beats, all three gates, and causal pressure—the motivation drives every choice. Friction between want (expose the lie) and cost (family legacy, future backlash) is present but more told than shown; no on-page moment forces Elara to weigh competing goods. The desire is front-loaded rather than tested under contradictory pressure.</comment>
