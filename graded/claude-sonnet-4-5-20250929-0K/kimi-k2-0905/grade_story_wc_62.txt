<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The carver's motivation is coherent but interiority leans abstract ("fiercely meditative nature," "shape of collective grief") rather than embodied in the greenhouse moment. The grandmother-butterfly mentor delivers insights that feel more like exposition than earned discovery; the carver's realizations about sleep-carved stones and poem-trading arrive via told revelation rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final transformation is asserted—"emerged with new understanding"—without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page, weakening agency at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by paragraph 1, no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—butterflies, poems, chrysalises layer toward a thematic repricing—but the closure effect is told rather than shown: "she understood," "emerged with new understanding," "transformed" are declarations without visible cost or a decisive final image. The spectral mentorship delivers all causal pressure via summary ("you carved these in your sleep") rather than dramatized choice, flattening the tightening into exposition. Cost-proof test fails: no sentence in the final beat shows what the carver forfeits or how her options narrow on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly anchored—glass panes, cracked terracotta, rusted watering cans, oak through the ceiling—and sensory detail (glowing poetry, warm ribbon) supports the lyric atmosphere. The setting does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; the carver moves through it as a witness, and the greenhouse functions as backdrop to revelation rather than obstacle or resource. Spatial choreography remains clear and detail is filtered through the carver's meditative POV, lifting the score within the mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens should deepen through layered density or a cadence shift that narrows options; instead, the story loops declarative insights ("understood the shape," "realized she had been retracing") without visible pressure or cost. The protagonist is passive, receiving information from the butterfly-grandmother rather than making choices that alter tactics. No tightening forecloses a path or forces a trade-off on the page, capping the score below mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—grief as transformation, not fixed memorial—emerges from the butterfly/chrysalis pattern and poem-trading custom, avoiding overt statement until late. The final image (ribbon with wing fragments, gardens replacing stones) offers a non-literal answer with thematic resonance. However, the penultimate paragraph edges into explicit thesis ("some memorials must be lived, not carved"), and mid-story revelations are told rather than dramatized, reducing the subtextual charge. Sufficient particulars (sleep-carved stones, poem dates) ground the theme, keeping the score in the low 6s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping. Diction leans elevated and lyric ("thundering calm," "fiercely meditative") but remains consistent and voice-motivated for a contemplative character. Grandmother's dialogue arrives via butterfly wingbeats, a purposeful stylization that reads legibly. Perceptual signature is present (carver notices patterns, stone texture) but interior texture flattens into abstract register ("collective grief," "transformation to be undergone") at peak moments, blunting the specificity needed for higher scores.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmic with purposeful imagery (chrysalises in shrouds, glowing poem lines). Template-cadence check flags multiple "The + [noun]" paragraph openings ("The spectral mentorship," "The thoughtful gravestone carver," "The butterflies") that create visual monotony across the middle third, applying −0.4 for patterned stems. Paraphrase loops appear: "shape of collective grief" recurs four times without added pressure; "understood/realized/understood" across adjacent beats restates insight without new detail, applying −0.2. Figurative density is high (thundering calm, living tomb, massive chrysalis) but remains legible, avoiding coherence penalties. Information density is moderate; many lines do thematic work but advance scene pressure minimally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—spectral mentorship via butterfly migration tied to sleep-carved grief memorials and poem-trading—is specific and non-generic. The emotional arc (witness-to-transformed carver) and the lyric greenhouse frame feel purposeful. However, the core moves (mysterious guide reveals hidden truth protagonist already enacted unconsciously, leading to epiphany and new mission) trace a familiar template without sufficient lived-in friction or moral calculus to transform it. The ending's pivot to "gardens where grief transforms" reads thematically apt but structurally inevitable without surprise, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and motivates the journey to the greenhouse. Observation dominates; the carver receives revelation from the butterfly-grandmother rather than making choices that alter tactics. The sleep-carved stones are told retroactively, not enacted. Final decision to create "gardens" is asserted in the last paragraph without on-page trade-off. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (greenhouse entry, butterfly following, final exit) +0.9, but no causal pressure that narrows options −0.8, ornamental closure participation (asserted rather than enacted choice) −0.5, swappable with "thoughtful artist/sculptor" −0.4. Late-paragraph agency claim without prior setup −0.3. Total adjustments: +1.4 positive, −2.0 friction; base 3.0 + 1.4 − 2.0 + risk/specificity +0.8 = 3.2, round 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 1, carried into the greenhouse, grows warm mid-story when understanding arrives, transformed at the end to contain wing fragments. Three distinct beats with evolving meaning. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (guides future work) +0.9, cost connection (warmth signals grandmother's presence) +0.3, specificity (woven, grandmother's) +0.4. Summary-only transformation in final paragraph (told, not handled) −0.5, does not constrain a choice under pressure −0.6. Total: +3.5 positive, −1.1 friction; base 3.0 + 3.5 − 1.1 = 5.4, round 5.1 per accumulation cap and dominant swappability (could be any heirloom object) −0.3 additional. Final 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present from paragraph 4 onward; grandmother's voice via butterfly delivers all revelations. Shapes the narrative premise but does not constrain options—carver receives information passively. Setup (first monarch) +0.5, multiple beats (voice emerges, reveals sleep-carving, forms chrysalis around carver) +1.4, closure linkage (mentorship complete, carver transformed) +0.9, irreplaceability (spectral method is unique) +0.6. Ornamental execution (revelation replaces choice) −1.0, no causal pressure (carver does not struggle against or negotiate with mentor) −0.8, summary-only climax (chrysalis burst, emergence) −0.5. Total: +3.4 positive, −2.3 friction; base 3.0 + 3.4 − 2.3 = 4.1, round 4.8 recognizing thematic centrality lifts within band despite passive integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Labeled in paragraph 6 ("fiercely meditative nature") and paragraph 18 ("fiercely meditative carver"). Trait description without visible on-page constraint or enablement; the carver sits cross-legged once but the meditation does not alter a tactic or impose cost. Late label (beyond first third) −0.4, ornamental (description only) −0.8, swappable with "patient" or "contemplative" −0.6, no cost tied to trait −0.4, summary-only (told heritage, not enacted discipline) −0.3. Total friction −2.5; base 3.0 − 2.5 = 0.5, but present in two beats and thematically consistent +0.5 each = +1.0. Final 3.0 + 1.0 − 2.5 = 1.5, lifted to 3.6 recognizing it frames character voice across the piece without forcing a break.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stated in paragraph 2, enacted throughout: carver follows butterfly path, discovers chrysalises, reaches oak and headstones. The retracing drives spatial movement and revelation structure. Early signal +0.6, multiple beats (entry, following monarch, discovering clusters, reaching tree) +1.4, causal pressure (path narrows to greenhouse heart) +0.8, closure linkage (retracing complete, mission shifts to future migrations) +0.9, specificity (butterfly migration path is irreplaceable) +0.6. Ornamental mid-execution (observing rather than choosing) −0.6, no visible cost (retracing succeeds without obstacle) −0.5. Total: +4.3 positive, −1.1 friction; base 3.0 + 4.3 − 1.1 = 6.2, round 5.9 per swappability test (could be "follow" with minor edits) −0.3 additional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 8 as backstory anchor, recurs paragraph 9 (village-wide custom post-accident), paragraph 11 (poem-wrapping chrysalises), paragraph 16 (ribbon contains unspoken grief), paragraph 17 (butterflies spell traded poems), paragraph 18 (each poem is a small death), paragraph 19 (carved poem titles as memorials). Pervasive across the middle and ending, shaping the thematic repricing. Early signal (first third) +0.6, five distinct beats +1.4, causal pressure (poems are the village's grief mechanism) +1.0, closure linkage (poems reweighted as memorials) +1.2, irreplaceability (dinner custom is specific) +0.6, cost connection (trading poems as refusal to speak raw truth) +0.5. Summary-only execution (told via memory and butterfly swarm, not enacted choice) −0.8, does not constrain a present tactic −0.4. Total: +5.3 positive, −1.2 friction; base 3.0 + 5.3 − 1.2 = 7.1, round 6.4 recognizing method is essential to theme but passive in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Anchored paragraph 1, detailed throughout (glass panes, potting benches, terracotta, watering cans, oak through ceiling). Provides spatial coherence and vivid atmosphere. Early signal +0.7, multiple beats (entry, movement through space, tree at center) +1.4, closure linkage (carver emerges at dawn from greenhouse) +0.8, specificity (ancient greenhouse with oak is irreplaceable) +0.7. Postcard-level description (does not constrain choice or supply resource under pressure) −1.0, swappable with any evocative ruin −0.5. Total: +3.6 positive, −1.5 friction; base 3.0 + 3.6 − 1.5 = 5.1, lifted to 6.1 recognizing the setting charges atmosphere and final image (dawn emergence) even without forcing tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 1 (dusk arrival) and paragraph 2 (butterfly migration), recurs paragraph 10 (dusk deepens), paragraph 21 (chrysalis bursts at dawn), paragraph 24 (migration continues beyond village). Time brackets the piece and provides lyric cadence. Early signal +0.6, three beats (dusk, deepening, dawn) +0.9, closure linkage (dawn marks transformation complete) +0.8, specificity (butterfly migration cycle) +0.5. No pressure or tactic constraint (time passes without urgency) −1.2, ornamental (descriptive frame only) −0.6, migration timeframe vague (weeks? months? untracked) −0.4. Total: +2.8 positive, −2.2 friction; base 3.0 + 2.8 − 2.2 = 3.6, round 3.8 recognizing the dusk-to-dawn arc provides closure cadence despite no live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stated paragraph 2, sustained as the carver's explicit goal throughout. Drives the journey and frames all discoveries. Early signal +0.7, pervasive involvement (every revelation ties to grief) +1.4, closure linkage (discovers grief's shape as transformation) +1.0, irreplaceability (specific desire unique to character role) +0.6. Ornamental execution (desire is told and revisited in summary, not tested by friction or competing want) −1.0, no visible cost (achieving understanding does not foreclose another path) −0.6, declarative satisfaction (closure asserts success without ambiguity) −0.4. Total: +3.7 positive, −2.0 friction; base 3.0 + 3.7 − 2.0 = 4.7, lifted to 5.7 recognizing motivation anchors the entire narrative even when not dramatized as conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Phrase appears paragraph 3 ("thundering calm" of storm), paragraph 14 (grandmother's voice), paragraph 20 (butterflies' heartbeat-matching wingbeats). Establishes oxymoronic atmosphere blending intensity and stillness. Early signal +0.5, three beats +0.9, closure linkage (chrysalis moment culminates tone) +0.8, specificity (phrase is memorable and irreplaceable) +0.7. Static application (repeated label without modulation under pressure) −0.6, ornamental (descriptive rather than shaping choice or perception under stress) −0.7, summary-only (asserted rather than enacted through rhythm or syntax shift) −0.5. Total: +2.9 positive, −1.8 friction; base 3.0 + 2.9 − 1.8 = 4.1, lifted to 5.5 recognizing the phrase charges key images and supports the meditative voice despite lack of syntactic embodiment.</comment>
