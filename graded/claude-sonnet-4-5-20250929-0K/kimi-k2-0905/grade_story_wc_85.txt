<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's guilt is embodied through physical gestures (watch hand cutting crescents, vomiting in the alley) and his profession creates authentic internal contradiction. The mother's final revelation—that she'd always known and paid for the false memory to free him—feels slightly convenient but doesn't break character logic. The climactic choice to confess is earned through the grandfather's driftwood teaching and the mother's terminal diagnosis, though the resolution arrives quickly. Interior voice remains consistent and particular throughout pressure points.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture: Elias's discovery that his mother was the client creates the core reversal, and the driftwood carving of his honest face provides the pivot toward confession. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—two people "finally light enough to carry the weight of what had always been unsaid"—with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors quickly (cobalt terrace, Elias, dusk, his profession). The mother's pre-emptive knowledge slightly undercuts protagonist agency at the final beat but doesn't eliminate the cost of his arrived-at stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace, driftwood shore, and watch hand create a tight spatial container. The grandfather's carvings—mermaids, ships-as-whales, featureless children—accumulate senory weight and constrain Elias's path by offering the carved honest face as mirror and proof. Micro-setting (kelp tangle, terrace steps, his pocket) grounds each beat. The carved face charges the final image by serving as the second heart "that had learned to beat true."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elias must choose whether to confess the truth to his dying mother. The pressure tightens meaningfully when he recognizes her as his own client, then deepens when he finds the carved portrait that embodies integrity. The mother's pre-knowledge slightly softens the peak cost—she grants him permission rather than forcing a harder breach—but the resolution still forecloses his fifteen-year pattern of false genealogies with visible relational and professional cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through wood-remembers-its-shape motif and the contrast between manufactured memory and carried truth. The grandfather's teaching—rings know when they're lying—recurs with escalating pressure and charges the closure without overt statement. Elias's line "the weight of a withheld truth wasn't measured in the lies you told but in the ones you believed yourself" risks slight over-articulation but lands as earned insight from vomiting-in-alley particulars. The final image of two people "light enough to carry the weight" reweights prior material with conceptual cost and quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent interiority and perceptual signature (e.g., "sieved hush," "crescents into his palm," "rings know when they're lying"). Diction occasionally elevates ("genealogist of ghosts," "tempered regret") in ways that feel slightly imposed rather than emerged from Elias's mental register under pressure. The mother's single line of dialogue carries subtext and goal but we get only one exchange, limiting full voice distinction test. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment to reflective overview.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"sky holds its breath," "family trees grafted from air," "sieved hush poured over the raw wound"—with some vehicles (ship masts as whale ribs, watch hand as dismembered time) doing double thematic work. However, stacked metaphors in the opening beat and "second heart that had learned to beat true" near closure verge on overwriting without pattern-teaching. Minor paraphrase loop: "manufactured false memories" / "manufacturing coats of arms" / "manufactured the memory." Propulsion remains steady; no scaffolding detected. Information density is strong in the grandfather backstory integration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The black-market genealogist premise is fresh and the mother-as-client reversal transforms familiar confession-story territory. The grandfather's driftwood carvings—especially the pre-carved honest face waiting in kelp—provide a specific, non-obvious hinge that grows from established world logic (wood remembers its shape). Risk: the carved portrait of "the man Elias might have been" could read as symbolic convenience, but it's grounded early enough in the grandfather's beach practice to feel earned rather than late-dropped. The piece commits fully to its emotional and conceptual premise without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (guilt-ridden black market genealogist) drives every major turn: recognizing his mother's request, manufacturing the false memory, vomiting in realization, searching the shore, climbing the terrace to confess. His profession shapes all tactics and the closure cost. Present throughout; causally active in at least three beats; shapes ending stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Watch hand appears in opening (cutting crescents, "time itself could be dismembered"), reappears when mother asks for it to return to the sea, and is placed in her palm at closure. It accumulates meaning (dismembered time, family continuity) and participates in the ending image but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. Two-beat reprise with thematic reweighting but not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" appears twice as a phrase (opening, mother's voice at end) and functions as tonal/thematic texture—kindness poured over wounds, forgiveness—but does not shape on-page choices or tactics. The concept echoes in the quiet ending but remains metaphorical rather than operant. Present in closure image but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Manufactures false memories" is the engine: Elias's profession creates the premise, the mother-as-client reversal, the fifteen-year guilt, and the need for confession. It constrains his identity and enables the plot's central irony. Visible cost (vomiting, renunciation of career) tied directly to this attribute. Drives multiple beats and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quell" appears in the opening stake ("quell the roaring in his chest") and frames his search for the driftwood truth. The action is signaled early but the actual quelling arrives through confession rather than an on-page act of suppression. It names the dominant desire but does not itself create a turn; the carved face and confession do the causal work. Functional framing; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore" is signaled early, occupies the middle investigation beat, and delivers the carved honest face that pivots Elias toward confession. The method is specific (kelp tangle, weathered sculptures, grandfather's hand) and its mechanics matter: wood remembers shape, carvings teach integrity. Shapes two beats and primes closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cobalt terrace at dusk bookends the piece (opening image, mother's silhouette at end) and serves as the confession site. It provides atmospheric charge ("moment before confession," sky holding breath, cobalt deepening to black) and spatial pressure (mother waiting above while Elias searches below). Micro-setting (terrace steps) alters his ascent choice. Two-gate integration; charges final image but does not constrain middle tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" frames the opening and the mother's terminal diagnosis imposes a time constraint, but elapsed time is not tracked and no live clock tightens decisions on the page. The timeframe is more emotional atmosphere (dusk, life running out) than tactical pressure. Present as mood; does not alter moves or pace.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Discover the weight of a withheld truth" is the dominant motivation, dramatized through the search for the carved face, the recognition of his own complicity, and the choice to confess. Internal friction: his need to quell guilt versus his fifteen-year habit of manufacturing comfort. The discovery unfolds in scene (carved face, mother's pre-knowledge) with visible relational cost. Drives all major beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" coheres throughout: Elias's guilt is neither raw nor resolved until the ending, modulating through embodied shame (vomiting), quiet search (driftwood sifting), and final acceptance (two people "light enough"). Tone intensifies under pressure (recognition of mother's request) and the phrase "tempered regret" appears explicitly in the closure line, charging the final image. Consistent modulation; participates in ending.</comment>
