<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator-translator's motivation is clear and deepens through the scene, with embodied choices around the coral fragment and decryption. The morphine haze and "lotus-hearted ache" work as internal pressure but edge toward label-speak without full embodied contradiction. The child's shrewdly innocent quality is asserted more than shown in action; his whispered instruction and tapping gesture are the only dramatized beats. Interior voice is distinctive, though some phrasing ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") reads slightly therapeutic rather than crisis-urgent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, reflective mode early; pressure accumulates through layered confession and the unknotting ritual. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ache shifts from shrapnel to sediment, coral lightens) with felt cost visible in the shared weight and the narrator's return to the buffer zone carrying dew instead of blood. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; no debt penalty. One micro turn (the realization that notes are confession, not inventory) deepens stakes without breaking accumulative coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atrium, mist, banana leaves, and twilight create a contained sensory world; the glass roof and droplets constrain the scene spatially and acoustically. The coral fragment functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pocket, then resting on cast) and charged at closure when aligned with the spiral. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's exhausted, anesthetic-softened perception. The field-hospital setting and buffer-zone geography anchor the conflict without requiring occupation-level depth at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unknotting the notes to redeem past mistranslation and shared trauma. The narrator's agency is renunciation and ritual speech; the tightening occurs when the birthday and village name are recognized, raising the cost of naming. The child's whispered imperative and finger-tap add pressure. Escalation under the accumulative lens is one deepening move (confession replaces inventory) and a cadence shift at closure (ache becomes sediment). Cost is felt in the weight transfer and the narrator's return tomorrow to radios and ultimatums, but the stakes remain largely internal and symbolic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—trauma, translation, and the grafting of new meaning—emerges from coral, cast, and confession without overt moralizing. The lotus-hearted ache and reef-memory metaphor provide a non-literal answer: wounds can hold dew instead of blood. The final image (droplets echoing footsteps as "quiet percussion of peace still possible") reweights prior material with genuine ambiguity and cost. Subtext operates in the child's shrewdness, the shared birthday, and the spiral's recurrence. Minor risk: "graft new meaning onto old wounds" edges toward prompt echo, but scene particulars ground it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, first person, stable distance. Voice is lyric and densely figurative ("lotus-hearted," "barbed wire through the bone," "palimpsest where trauma and translation overlapped"), which fits the anesthetic haze and the narrator's translator register. Perceptual signature is consistent: coral, ink, dialect, and reef imagery recur with purpose. Dialogue is minimal (two lines from the child, one from the narrator) but purposeful and distinct in register. The high metaphor density in nearly every sentence risks overwriting but remains mostly legible and voice-motivated; a few constructions ("gyres of shared anxieties," "lotus-hearted ache") verge on elevated abstraction that may exceed the narrator's crisis lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and sustained: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile ("anesthetic hummed like distant shelling," "droplets…each drop a syllable," "wire ran through the bone," "trauma and translation overlapped like tide lines"). While voice-motivated and mostly legible, the accumulation flattens propulsion in the middle third; several lines paraphrase the same trauma-translation equivalence without added pressure. Minor template cadence in the list of confessions and in paired noun phrases. The final image sequence (mist lifted, coral lighter, ache holding dew) is clear and rhythmically controlled. No major loops or pronoun drift, but density without variance creates moderate momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The coral-fragment-as-shared-memory device and the cast-notes-as-confession ledger offer specific, non-obvious inflections on war-trauma material. The translator role and coastal dialect add authenticity. The lotus-hearted metaphor and the idea of unknotting by naming feel slightly template-mystical, but the birthday transposition and the spiral alignment are fresh particulars. Risk-taking in sustained lyric register and reflection-heavy mode is purposeful; the piece commits fully to its accumulative design without retreat. Transformation of familiar tropes (guilt, child-as-witness, symbolic object) is moderate but present.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The translator is present throughout and makes the key choice to unknot by naming, decrypting the notes and confessing the village mistranslation. Setup early, involved in the middle decryption beat, and present at closure carrying the lightened coral. Agency is renunciation and ritual speech rather than external decision, but the choice forecloses retreat and alters the narrator's internal stance. Swappability: another caregiver role could perform similar work with minor edits, but the mistranslation backstory ties the role to the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coral fragment is introduced early (breast pocket), handled mid-scene (child taps it through shirt), and rests on the cast at closure with grooves aligned to the spiral, visibly reweighted. It shapes two distinct beats and charges the final image with the weight-transfer metaphor. Specificity: brain coral's whorls mirror shared anxieties and reef memory; irreplaceable. Minor ceiling: the coral enables reflection more than it constrains tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Shared anxieties are named early ("gyres of shared anxieties that every civilian and soldier carried like invisible shrapnel") and return implicitly in the confession ledger and weight transfer. The concept frames the narrator's guilt and the child's witness role, shaping the stakes. It is present at closure in the shift from shrapnel to sediment. Development: the concept is more thematic anchor than on-page constraint; it does not narrow tactical options in the middle beat. Moderate causal role; strong thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The child is labeled "shrapnel-eyed and shrewdly innocent" early. The trait is demonstrated weakly in his whispered dialect instruction and the deliberate finger-tap on the coral, which show awareness. The attribute does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost; it colors perception but remains largely ornamental. Swappable: a simply "watchful" child could perform the same beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unknotting is signaled early (child's whispered imperative), executed in the middle (narrator decrypts and voices each symbol), and completed at closure (the cast becomes a palimpsest, knots loosened into story). The action drives the middle beat and provides the ritual frame for the confession. Specificity: the act of naming aloud and the ink-dilution image are tied to the translator role. Moderate causal necessity; another confessional or interpretive act could substitute with edits, but unknotting fits the cast-as-text device cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method—decrypting smudged notes on the cast—is introduced early (plaster crowded with glyphs), executed in the middle beat (date, village name, fish/spiral symbols), and present at closure (cast as palimpsest). The mechanics shape the narrator's approach and enable the confession. Specificity: the cast as ledger written by children who watched adults fail is irreplaceable; the translator role makes the method inevitable. Minor cap: the decryption itself is rapid summary rather than dramatized struggle, slightly reducing felt difficulty.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The atrium is present from the opening line, anchors the entire scene spatially, and returns at closure ("walked back through the atrium, droplets echoed my footsteps"). Mist and twilight create atmosphere and mirror the anesthetic haze. The glass roof and banana leaves supply acoustic and visual detail. The setting does not visibly constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions more as charged backdrop than pressure-source. Strong atmospheric integration; moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Timeframe is anchored early ("anesthetic hummed through my veins") and returns at closure ("morphine pulling him under," "tonight I had grafted"). The drugged state shapes perception (watercolor grays, softened edges) and tone. The frame does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the scene unfolds in a dilated, reflective present without urgency. Functional but replaceable; another post-crisis moment could serve similar atmospheric work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("I had come to graft new meaning onto old wounds") and dramatized through the unknotting ritual, confession, and weight transfer. It drives the middle beat and is completed at closure ("tonight I had grafted new meaning…simply by speaking the knots aloud"). The desire is conflicted by guilt (the village mistranslation) and the persistent ache. Minor issue: the phrasing "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is slightly therapeutic-sounding and borders on prompt echo, but the coral and cast particulars ground it in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("lotus-hearted ache") and modulated through the scene: morphine softness, guilt, ritual solemnity, and final tentative hope ("petals held dew instead of blood"). The ache recurs at key beats (sternum opening outward, remaining but holding dew, carrying across checkpoints) and charges the final image. Coherence is strong; the lyric, mournful register fits the accumulative design. Minor cap: "lotus-hearted" is abstract and slightly ornamental; a more embodied anchor would raise integration.</comment>
