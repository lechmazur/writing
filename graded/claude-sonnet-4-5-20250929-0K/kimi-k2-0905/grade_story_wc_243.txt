<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archivist's interiority is concrete and embodied—pulse syncing with waves, knees creaking, the locket's warmth against her wrist. Her final choice to steep the locket into the tube forecloses a visible path with felt cost ("lighter yet heavier"). Internal contradiction is present (preservation vs. letting go) and drives the climactic renunciation. The daughter remains largely off-page until the coda, limiting relationship pressure, but the archivist's micro-choices under duress are legible and character-specific.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (archivist, blooming jetty, twilight). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—the archivist relinquishes the locket, sealing it with the boy's name, and the final waltz with her daughter reweights the archival act as ongoing presence rather than loss. The cost is visible: "steep absence like a clean nail wound." Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift (security interruption, sealing the tube, the confrontation at home) that tightens the stake of preserving small moments. One persistent constraint (demolition deadline) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The jetty is vividly rendered with selective, pressure-driven detail: salt-rimmed planks, barnacles, sunflower petals dried into wood. The setting constrains choice—contractors test equipment, security patrols—and charges the final image when the archivist hides the copper tube before demolition. Body and tool (walnut ink, copper tube, locket) function as micro-setting elements that directly enable the archival act. Spatial choreography is coherent across the jetty, shore road, and apartment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: preserve the jetty's memory before demolition. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when security arrives and the archivist must finish and hide the tube, then a second deepening when she chooses to seal the locket itself inside. Agency is clear: her decision to relocate the locket forecloses its personal function with visible cost. The boy's drowning history and her daughter's parallel age create moral weight. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is density increase and cadence shift; the final act (playing waltz with daughter, tube's strap on the music stand) reweights the opening archival mission.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "artifacts become verbs instead of nouns," "regenerated covenant not as stone but as rhythm: rise, fall, rise." The final image (waltz with daughter, empty strap as metronome) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how memory outlasts demolition—through presence and shared gesture rather than possession. The locket's relocation is both literal and symbolic, charged by the boy's drowning and the daughter's gap-toothed smile. No overt moralizing; the piece trusts image and action to carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance remains controlled. Voice carries a distinct texture—"haunted euphoria," "steep promise," "graft of futures and pasts"—that reflects the archivist's archival mindset. The single line of dialogue ("Evening, miss; just packing memories?" / "No, planting them") is purposeful and advances the thematic stakes. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices barnacles, nails, splinters, the locket's warmth. Some diction ("blooming jetty," "regenerated covenant") occasionally tilts ornamental, but remains voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. However, figurative language saturates several high-pressure beats without clear payoff: "wind carried haunted euphoria," "ink blooming like bruised violets," "sky forgets its own colors." The phrase "regenerated covenant" repeats three times with shifting referents (stones, agreement, rhythm) that blur rather than sharpen. "Steep" appears twice as verb (steep the locket, steep promise) in non-standard usage that reads as diction drift. Apply −0.6 for density without full coherence and −0.2 for register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—archivist preserving a demolition site by sealing a locket with a drowned boy's memory—offers a fresh synthesis of occupation, setting, and stakes. The walnut-ink medium, copper tube with patina, and the choice to entomb the locket rather than keep it are specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth (maternal grief refracted through archival duty) avoids generic templates. The transformation test is satisfied: plot and arc would collapse with different names and places. Risk-taking (lyric density, unconventional diction) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though some phrases ("haunted euphoria," "steep") trend ornamental. No close echoes of famous work detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist frames the story, makes the key decision to seal the locket (middle and closure beats), and her occupation shapes every tactic (sketching, inking, sealing). Her choices alter tactics under pressure (security arrival) and the final waltz reconfigures the archival mission. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in beat one (warmth against pulse), beat two (opened and pressed to sketch), and closure (steeped into tube, then absence noted by daughter). Its removal forecloses a path with visible cost ("steep absence like a clean nail wound"). The photo's shift from personal talisman to archival artifact reweights the dominant stake. Strong causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Regenerated covenant" is signaled early (covenant stones lifted by pilings) and returns thematically in the middle ("not just stone but agreement: we will keep telling") and at closure ("not as stone but as rhythm: rise, fall, rise"). It shapes the archivist's understanding of her mission but does not constrain tactics on the page. The concept charges the thematic layer without altering physical choices. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting qualifies for mid-6s under the allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is demonstrated in the opening beat ("sketch every barnacle, every nail, every splinter, gently thorough, as if care itself could slow decay") and enables the archival work under deadline pressure. The trait constrains her method (meticulous rather than hasty) and the security guard's reaction ("some urgency in her gentleness warned him") shows cost—her manner buys time. Setup, middle constraint, and closure consequence present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Steep" as verb appears twice: "she steep the locket itself into the tube" (climactic choice) and retrospectively in "steep promise" (earlier). The act of steeping the locket is the story's major turn—irreversible, visible cost, redefines the archival mission from external documentation to personal sacrifice. The word's use is non-standard but consistent with the voice's alchemical/archival idiom. Removal would collapse the closure unit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is signaled early (loose board, slick algae, dare, absence of railing for the boy's drowning) and returns in the coda (cracked sidewalk, delayed ambulance, vote, budget). The method shapes the archivist's attention (drawing "the space where he had been") and her walking-home reflection. It constrains her approach to memory-work but does not alter physical tactics under pressure. Lyric reprise with thematic charge, no middle-beat constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors the entire first two-thirds: planks, pilings, tide, barnacles. The setting supplies the object of preservation and the deadline (demolition). "Blooming" recurs subtly ("ink blooming like bruised violets"). The jetty's physical details (furthest piling with sunflowers, loose board) enable the archivist's sketch-work and the security guard's interruption. Removal would erase the story's spatial and temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"When context changes" appears in the opening line and returns thematically ("When context changes, she believed, artifacts become verbs"). The timeframe (twilight, "sky forgets its own colors") creates urgency and charges the atmosphere. Distant engines and headlights mark the countdown to demolition. The shift from jetty to home marks a second context change. The timeframe tightens decisions and modulates tone without functioning as a live on-page clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of small moments" is the archivist's stated job in beat one and drives every choice: sketching details, sealing the tube, whispering the boy's name, ultimately sacrificing the locket. The motivation is dramatized in friction—her pulse syncs with waves, she works faster under pressure, the locket's absence is felt as "steep." The final waltz with her daughter enacts preservation through presence rather than artifact. Strong causal linkage and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named once ("Wind carried haunted euphoria: gulls laughing like children who knew they were already ghosts") and enacted throughout: the archivist's smile that makes the guard step back, the braided laughter of boy and daughter, the waltz that closes the story. The tone modulates from archival focus to urgency to quiet resolution. It charges the final image (playing music with the empty strap) and coheres across structural turns without static repetition.</comment>
