<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivations are clear but remain largely static; her seven-night escalation reads as iterative rather than internally conflicted. The boy's arc from fear to "mournful elation" lacks intermediate micro-choices that would ground the shift in contradictory impulses. Interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("lovingly venomous," "mournful elation") rather than embodied sensation under pressure. The final forgiveness arrives without visible internal cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure unit—forgiveness and transformation through fruit harvest—lands on the page with a visible image (the bride gains feet, the bead cracks). However, the drive lens wavers between Causal (debt repayment logic) and Accumulative (seven-night ritual), and the mechanics of how the fruit "distills sorrow" into payment are asserted rather than dramatized. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where/when clarified only after greenhouse description), triggering a −0.4 deduction and capping Q3 at 7.0. The boy's agency in the final beat is muted; he follows guidance rather than forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard is vividly detailed (copper pipes, pomegranate runes, quartz grafts) and returns at closure when the trees wither. Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop. The orientation cap applies due to Q2 penalty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (debt repayment) is signaled early, but escalation reads as accumulation of visits rather than a tightening choice or reversal. The boy's offer of blood is refused without a trade-off that narrows options; the fruit-harvest solution appears as revelation rather than a decision under pressure. Cost is visible (trees wither, bead cracks, bride dissolves) but the boy's own forfeiture is unclear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of inherited debt and forgiveness emerges through image and ritual, not statement. The final image (seed in hand, dawn, ordinary seasons) offers a resonant answer. However, phrases like "lovingly venomous" and "mournful elation" risk poetic abstraction; the story toggles between sorrow and release without sustained irony or counter-reading. The boy's understanding arrives as epiphany rather than earned friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, psychic distance consistent. Diction is ornate and purposeful ("ashen-veil," "ephemeral cameo," "furnace wind") but occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue is minimal (two exchanges); the boy's line "I didn't do it" is clear, but the bride's "Debt is a vine; it finds any sun" reads as thematic pronouncement. No head-hopping or tense breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("iron air," "tongue of a bell," "rope of memory," "petals of moonlight") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering −0.5 for overwriting. Several paraphrase loops: "the bead thrummed louder, answering something" followed by "the bead inside him beat once, twice"; "carriage overturned" and "screaming snow" recur without added pressure. Template cadence in the seven-night sequence ("On the second night... By the seventh night"). Artifacts touch multiple beats, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ghost-bride-debt premise is familiar, but the alchemical orchard and fruit-as-currency offer fresh specificity. The seven-visit structure and final forgiveness lean on established folklore patterns; transformation is present but incremental. Risk-taking is moderate: the ornate diction and gothic atmosphere are executed competently but do not subvert or deepen the template. No close echoes of famous lines, but emotional arc follows a predictable redemption path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ghost bride drives all seven visits and the final guidance, but most beats are observational or ritualistic rather than decision-driven. Her choice to forgive at the end is signaled early and arrives without visible trade-off or renunciation that would raise the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The carved stone bead appears in beat one (carried), beat two (placed on chest, lodges in heart), and returns at closure (cracked open, pressed into boy's hand). It evolves from token to memory-seed to gift, constraining the boy's experience and charging the final image. Early setup, mid-development, and payoff gates all met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" appears twice as a phrase but functions primarily as thematic echo rather than a mechanic that shapes stakes or tactics. The bead's pulse and the boy's epiphany could exist without this exact label. Present but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" is used twice as a descriptor but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It labels the bride's manner without altering her choices or the boy's responses. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ghosting is central to the bride's presence and all seven visits; her spectral form enables the bead transfer and nightly escalation. The final transformation (gaining feet, dissolving into moths) hinges on her ghost state. Early setup, middle beats, and closure participation all strong. Removing ghost status would require full restructure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Ephemeral cameo appearances" is named once and the seven-night structure demonstrates it, but the mechanic is ritual rather than pressured choice. It shapes the pacing and middle beats but the final turn depends on fruit harvest, not cameo logic. Two gates (setup, development) met; closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is established early, houses all action, and at closure the trees wither and glass dissolves. The environment supplies the fruit that enables debt repayment and the endless night frames the ritual. Setup, development (trees ripen faster each visit), and payoff all present. Indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" appears once in narration and is referenced at closure when the bride seeks "winter-cracked fields where her own story had begun." It evokes tone and memory but does not tighten a decision or impose a deadline. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Debt repayment is the dominant stake, signaled early ("Your line will pay") and resolved at closure (bead cracked, debt complete). The bride's desire is consistent across all beats. However, the boy's friction between guilt and innocence is asserted more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices. Two gates met strongly; development phase is summary-inflected.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is named once and the tone oscillates between sorrow (screaming, guilt) and wonder (light, forgiveness), but the modulation feels binary rather than layered. The final image leans toward release without sustained ambivalence. Coherent but not deeply charged by pressure.</comment>
