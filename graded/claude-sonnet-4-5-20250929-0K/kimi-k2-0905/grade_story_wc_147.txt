<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and embodied—guilt, survival instinct, and need to preserve memory drive concrete choices (prying open the console, uncorking the vial). Internal contradiction appears in "overriding her own instinct to flee" and the tension between escape and recording. However, several emotional beats rely on elevated summary ("lonesome splendor," "her motivation sharpened") that drifts toward abstraction rather than staying grounded in physical sensation. The final choice to leave the vial is earned by prior causality, and the cost (surrendering her last anchor to home) is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density increase (the hush tightening, air pocket shrinking, organ mechanism discovered) and culminates in a meaningful tightening when the lilac signal breaks the temple's resistance. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the rescue arrives, but Mira stays to record, and the temple adopts her past as liturgy—options are reweighted with felt cost (the empty vial as offering, her certainty that "some places are forgotten only until someone chooses to remember them out loud"). One persistent concern: the temple's shift from muffling to amplifying reads slightly convenient; the organ mechanism provides scaffold but the causality feels compressed in the middle third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater temple environment constrains choices throughout: cracked lapis tiles, coral-grown organ, stone tendrils wrapping the mast, air pocket shrinking. Mira's professional identity (cartographer) filters perception toward mapping and recording. The crystal vial and copper coil function as micro-setting elements that enable the climactic action. Spatial choreography remains clear (floats above tiles → kicks deeper into sanctuary → pries open console → uncorks vial). The final image of the vial on the console charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, weighted toward the visual and tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survive and be heard) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira realizes she must "feed the organ one pure note" to amplify her distress—this narrows options and forces a trade-off (sacrifice the vial or remain unheard). The turn from temple-as-adversary to temple-as-ally is earned by her agency (uncorking the vial, translating scent into frequency). Cost is visible: she loses her last anchor to home. However, the arrival of the rescue sub after the signal succeeds reads slightly mechanized; the causal link between her broadcast and the reply could be more viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: memory preservation, solitude transformed into signal, the ephemeral made durable. The lilac vial shifts meaning from keepsake to offering, and the temple's adoption of her past as liturgy reweights the premise without stated moral. The final image—"a single voice—scented, stubborn, and true—can teach stone to yearn"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the empty vial, the temple "laughing" with her) and implication (sailors dreaming of lilacs without knowing why). Minor slip: "some places are forgotten only until someone chooses to remember them out loud" edges toward thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited through Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (cartographer turned signal-sender, filtering through spatial awareness and guilt). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, which fits the "lonesome splendor" tone but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("gathered hush," "slowmotion thunder," "lonesome splendor of the moment felt like arrival"). Under peak stress (prying open the console, uncorking the vial), the prose maintains its texture without compression, which is acceptable for this voice but borders on overwriting in a survival scenario. Narrative certainty matches what Mira can know; the temple's "instinct" and "preference" read as her projection rather than omniscient claim.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("violet star," "wet parchment," "startled glassfish," "kelp," "bubbles shaped like lilac blossoms") and occasionally stacks without clear payoff, approaching overwriting in middle beats ("gathered hush recoiled, memories scattering like startled glassfish" follows "lilac drop drifted out, spherical and luminous"). Template cadence appears in paired participial openers ("having tasted," "carrying only"). Several lines carry abstract elevation that slows momentum: "lonesome splendor of the moment felt like arrival rather than ending" summarizes an emotional state that could be shown through image. Information density is generally strong, but the final third includes scaffolding phrases ("perpetual aria of gathered hush now threaded with fragrance") that restate prior content. No major loops, but synonym churn around "hush" and "resonance" across adjacent paragraphs slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of distress signal + forgotten temple + scent-as-frequency + cartographer-as-voice offers a fresh, non-obvious angle. The lilac vial anchoring both past and present, personal and functional, feels organic rather than ornamental. The turn (temple resisting → temple amplifying) arises from established pattern (organ mechanism introduced mid-story, vial seeded early). Emotional specificity (guilt over pocketing the vial, salt tears adding brine to gears) avoids generic templates. Minor friction: the "gathered hush" as a force that "touches memories" reads slightly abstract and could be more concretely grounded in the world's physics. The piece commits fully to its lyric-textural mode and follows implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (distress signal sender) drives key turns: overriding flight instinct, prying open the console, uncorking the vial, placing it as offering, choosing to stay and record. Early signal (opening line). Beats: tightening the coil, kicking deeper, opening console, uncorking vial, staying to record. Causal pressure throughout narrows options. Closure linkage strong (her choice to leave the vial and record). Cost visible (last anchor surrendered). Specific to her role and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystal perfume vial appears early (paragraph 7), recurs in beat where she uncorks it (paragraphs 18–19), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (paragraph 36: placed as offering). Three distinct beats: carried as keepsake, used to generate signal, left as offering. Causal pressure high (enables the climactic signal). Closure linkage strong. Cost tied directly to it (surrendering last anchor to home). Highly specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gathered hush (Core Concept) is signaled early (paragraph 5) and recurs throughout as the temple's muffling force. It shapes stakes (her words are swallowed) and tactics (she must find the organ to override it). Middle beat: "gathered hush recoiled" when the lilac signal vibrates. Closure linkage moderate: transformed into resonance but not directly named in the final image. Cost connection indirect (she must sacrifice the vial to break the hush). Reasonably specific but could be more concretely grounded in the world's physics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Touches memories" appears early (paragraph 6) and recurs when the hush recoils and memories scatter (paragraph 21), then again when Mira's memories are projected (paragraph 28). Constrains action moderately (the hush resists her signal by touching/swallowing memories). Cost connection indirect (she must override this to be heard). Two distinct beats but primarily atmospheric rather than driving a causal turn. Present in closure paragraph ("touching memories of sailors") but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears in paragraph 11 ("trying to unsnarl her signal into quiet") and paragraph 25 ("temple had learned to unsnarl loneliness by overriding instinct"). Early signal moderate (first use ~mid-story). The action shapes the climactic turn (she unsnarls the organ's clogged mechanism, enabling amplification). Closure linkage strong (final image echoes the concept). Cost tied to the vial sacrifice. Reasonably specific to the underwater-signal context but could be replaced with "untangle" or "clarify" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" appears early (paragraph 12: "overrode her own instinct to flee") and recurs at closure (paragraph 38: "overriding instinct"). Mechanics matter: she chooses to stay rather than flee, enabling discovery of the organ; the temple overrides its instinct to forget, enabling amplification. Two beats. Causal pressure moderate (the method enables both her persistence and the temple's shift). Closure linkage strong. Cost connection moderate (overriding flight instinct exposes her to drowning risk).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Forgotten underwater temple is present from the opening and pressures choices throughout: flooded nave limits air, cracked tiles and stone tendrils supply obstacles, coral-grown organ provides the key resource, shrinking air pocket creates the deadline. Micro-setting elements (copper coil, organ console) alter tactics. Spatial choreography clear. Closure linkage strong (temple keeps broadcasting; Mira surfaces but the temple remains). Cost tied to setting (she risks drowning to engage it). Highly specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is signaled early (paragraph 3: "time ran short and the temple's last pocket of air shrank") and recurs (paragraph 31: "when time runs short"). The shrinking air pocket creates urgency but the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat. Tightens decisions moderately (she must act before air runs out) but elapsed time remains vague. Closure linkage weak (the rescue arrives but time pressure is not emphasized in the final image). Cost connection moderate (she risks death by staying).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is signaled early (paragraph 9: "believed the vial could harness the ephemeral") and drives the climactic choice (she uses the ephemeral lilac drop to generate a signal). Two beats: carrying the vial as potential, then using it. Causal pressure strong (desire to preserve the ephemeral motivates the sacrifice). Friction between wants (keep the keepsake) and costs (surrender it to survive) is visible. Closure linkage strong (ephemeral made durable as the temple broadcasts). Specific and tied to her backstory.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears explicitly once (paragraph 31) but the tone is coherent throughout: solitary grandeur, melancholy beauty, elegiac resonance. Modulates with pressure (quiet opening, crescendo at the organ's awakening, elegiac closure). Charges the final image ("beneath them an ancient architecture had learned to unsnarl loneliness"). Diction and rhythm support the tone without static repetition. Specific and irreplaceable to this story's emotional texture.</comment>
