<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior is dense with imagery but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The ghost encounter feels abstracted—"chronological contempt," "empathy traveling backwards"—rather than dramatized through visceral reactions or bodily tension. The protagonist's agency at closure (breaking the wheel, reading fragments aloud) arrives without prior contradiction or visible foreclosure of alternatives; the "shared erosion" reads as stated concept rather than earned shift. Interiority leans on poetic assertion ("regret is just empathy traveling backwards") instead of character-particular thought under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early through dense imagery and fragments. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration ("shared erosion") with conceptual cost legible in the dissolving images and the ghost's permanence on the bench. However, the midpoint causality is elided—why breaking the wheel and reading fragments aloud produces "fracture so still that even silence holds its breath" is asserted rather than motivated. The orientation anchors (kinetic lagoon, obsidian mare, 03:17) land clearly by ~120 words. Cost is visible (images dissolve, ghost remains), but the protagonist's path from mounting the mare to breaking the wheel lacks a because/therefore hinge that would lift this higher under even an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon, cloudwater, obsidian mare, and mirrored walkway are vivid and purposeful. The mare's "empty cartridge" eyes and the cloudwater that "thickens into silver glass" anchor the negotiation scene and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's haunted perception. The setting supplies resources (the wheel clicks release slides, cloudwater freezes mid-ripple) that shape the encounter. Spatial choreography remains clear across the carousel-to-mare-to-bench sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—negotiating with the ghost to reconcile eroded ambitions—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the camera wheel clicks and the ghost's accusation, culminating in the shared reading of undeveloped squares. The protagonist's agency (mounting, speaking fragments, breaking the wheel) drives the tightening, and the cost (images dissolve, ghost stays) is legible on the page. However, the escalation lacks a felt reversal or narrowing of options; the ghost's presence and the wheel-breaking feel more like stations in a ritual than a contested choice under rising pressure. One meaningful deepening is present but the stakes remain largely internal and asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly from the imagery of erosion, collection, and negotiation without overt moralizing. The camera wheel, ticket-stub lining, and dissolving images embody the tension between preserving others' stories and losing one's own future. The ghost's line "You replaced our future with a collection of other people's endings" crystallizes the thematic question. The ending offers a resonant answer—"shared erosion" as acceptance rather than resolution—without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy closure and invites reflection on the cost of witness. Conceptual Repricing is legible in the final image of the dissolving bench and weary wave.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice is consistent and lyrically dense with a poetic, introspective register ("regret is just empathy traveling backwards," "cloudwater lapped at the copper deck"). POV distance remains stable in first-person singular with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—chronologically confused, fragment-collecting—but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ambitions erode another micron") that feels more authorial than character-lived. Free indirect style is absent; interiority is direct and image-heavy. The ghost's dialogue carries distinct voice ("You replaced our future"), but dialogue is minimal. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful, moving from exterior carousel description to intimate negotiation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or image. "Cloudwater lapped," "voices are sand inside me," "regret is just empathy traveling backwards" stack without breathing room, creating a single elevated register that flattens momentum and risks overwriting. Paraphrase loops appear ("I stepped off... I need to speak," "I twist... I hold the camera wheel"). Some vehicles strain coherence ("voices are sand... abrading the lens of ambition until the picture is only a white blur"). Syntactic variety is present but rhythm is consistently lyric-slow, even at the wheel-breaking beat where propulsion would help. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere more than plot. No major clarity breaks, but the elevated diction pervades peak beats without pattern-taught purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—negotiating with one's younger self via a kinetic lagoon and camera wheel—is fresh and non-obvious. The synthesis of time confusion, fragment collection, and erosion feels coherent and specific to this narrator's predicament. The obsidian mare, cloudwater mechanics, and undeveloped slides are concrete and purposeful, avoiding generic quirk. The ghost encounter and "shared erosion" closure offer a resonant angle on regret and ambition without retreating to safe binaries. Risk-taking is evident in the dense lyric mode and temporal layering. Minor limitation: the carousel and kinetic lagoon setting, while vivid, feel somewhat ornamental relative to the core ghost negotiation; the piece could function in a simpler frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "resolute scavenger" is named in the opening and the protagonist mounts the mare, speaks fragments, and breaks the wheel—three distinct beats. However, the scavenger identity (clutching the camera wheel, collecting fragments) is more atmospheric trait than decision driver. The final action (breaking the wheel, reading aloud) arrives without prior resistance or trade-off that would mark "resolute" as causal. Present and functional, but the exact scavenger framing is swappable with "collector" or "witness" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The disposable camera wheel appears in five beats: introduction ("cracked disposable camera wheel"), twist/click releasing undeveloped night, speaking fragments through it, holding it against the mare's neck, and breaking it to spill twenty-four squares. It drives the negotiation (releases slides, projects images) and the breaking triggers the shared reading and fracture. Setup, middle use, and closure participation are all clear. The wheel's specific mechanics (clicks, undeveloped squares) matter and are irreplaceable. Cost is visible (images dissolve after spilling). Strong integration across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Eroded ambitions" frames the opening ("I once wanted to map every island") and the ghost's accusation ("You replaced our future"). The narrator's ambitions "erode another micron" mid-scene and the final "shared erosion" is the closure concept. The erosion image recurs and the concept shapes the negotiation's stakes (youth's velocity vs. age's decay). However, erosion is more thematic claim than tactical constraint—no on-page choice hinges on the fact of erosion versus, say, "lost dreams." The concept charges the closure image but does not narrow options in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is declared early ("I am chronologically confused; yesterday I buried tomorrow's body") and returns in the mirrored walkway ("left foot precedes right by three seconds, so I walk beside my own past"). The attribute colors perception and the ghost encounter's logic. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—the narrator moves freely through the lagoon and carousel without the confusion creating friction or forcing a trade-off. The trait enriches atmosphere and supports the time-layered premise but remains more label than lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Regret" is named mid-story ("Each click is a regret I collected") and defined ("regret is just empathy traveling backwards"). The protagonist offers the wheel to the ghost, and "regret" motivates the negotiation. The final "shared erosion" can be read as acceptance of regret's cost. However, the major turn (breaking the wheel, reading fragments) is not clearly caused by regret versus general ambition-erosion or the ghost's presence. The action is thematic anchor more than structural hinge; swappable with "loss" or "mourning" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Collecting fragments of overheard stories" is signaled early ("I collected by gathering fragments... from passengers") and the ticket-stub lining embodies it. The method supplies the camera wheel's cargo (story fragments → undeveloped squares) and the ghost's accusation directly addresses it ("You replaced our future with a collection of other people's endings"). The final act (reading fragments aloud, images dissolve) uses the method to produce closure. Setup, middle pressure, and closure payoff are all present. The method shapes the negotiation's terms and is causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "kinetic lagoon above the clouds" is introduced in the opening line and houses the carousel, cloudwater, and obsidian mare. The cloudwater mechanics (lapping, hissing, thickening into silver glass, freezing mid-ripple) enable the projection and negotiation. The lagoon's center (obsidian mare) is the negotiation anchor. However, the "kinetic" quality (floating, three kilometers above the dead ocean) is atmospheric; the lagoon could be a static surreal space without loss. The setting shapes the mood and supplies resources but does not force a tactical trade-off. Present across all three gates and purposeful, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "After the carousel halts" is anchored precisely (03:17, later 03:27). The ten-minute window frames the encounter. However, the clock does not tighten decisions—no urgency hinges on the carousel restarting at 03:27, and the protagonist steps on "alone" without consequence for delay. The timeframe provides structure but does not constrain choice or escalate pressure. Functional framing, but swappable with "at dawn" or "during the night" without affecting tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To negotiate with one's own ghost" is declared early ("tonight I need to speak with the ghost who wears my seventeen-year-old face") and dramatized through the encounter. The ghost materializes, accuses, and the protagonist offers the wheel, breaks it, and reads fragments "together, without agreement." The negotiation drives the middle and closure beats and the final image (ghost waving, dissolving bench) is the negotiation's outcome. Desire is conflicted (chronological contempt, shared erosion) and the cost (images dissolve, ghost stays) is visible. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Fractured stillness" is named explicitly in the closure beat ("In that fractured stillness I understand negotiation is not settlement but shared erosion") and embodied throughout: the carousel halts, lights fade, cloudwater laps then freezes mid-ripple, silence "holds its breath." Tone is consistent—lyric, suspended, elegiac—and modulates subtly from motion (carousel, walking) to stasis (obsidian mare, frozen ripple). The tone charges the final image (dissolving bench, weary wave) and supports the Accumulative/Textural lens. The exact phrase "fractured stillness" appears once but the tonal effect pervades and intensifies to closure.</comment>
