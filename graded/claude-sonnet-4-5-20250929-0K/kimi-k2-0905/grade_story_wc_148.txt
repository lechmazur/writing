<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cassian's motivation—threading a labyrinth with his father's story—is declared but never dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. The father's appearance is neither ghost nor man, a convenient hedge that avoids committing to stakes. Interior texture relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("hush darted ahead, a silver minnow") rather than embodied perception. The final choice to descend the impossible staircase lacks visible cost; the "heartbeat he could finally trust" reads as unearned epiphany.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure unit—Cassian walking into copper morning carrying the hush—lacks visible cost or a legible before/after change in options. Orientation is delayed and fragmentary: who Cassian is, why he's arrived now, and what "before they find the bodies" means remain opaque past the 120-word mark without payoff at closure. The Drive Lens is ambiguous between Accumulative/Textural and Causal; metaphorical density suggests the former, but the lattice-fitting and staircase descent gesture toward causal turns that never tighten options. The keepers' vanishing, the father's imprisonment, and the wolf's reality are all withheld without dramatized friction that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and Fresnel lens are vividly rendered and anchor the piece spatially. The lattice constrains one choice—Cassian fits it to the lens—charging the final beam across the reef. Sensory selection is often purposeful: "salt-bitten hinges," "lantern oil and gull blood," "communion wine fog." However, micro-setting does not pressure multiple tactics, and the impossible architecture (doors onto previous years, sprouting bars) remains ornamental rather than a constraint that shapes Cassian's route or cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Cassian threading his father's story to find his own exit—is declared early but never tested by a concrete on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options. The timeframe "before they find the bodies" is invoked twice but exerts no pressure on Cassian's decisions; no clock tightens tactics. The father's appearance and Cassian's descent are sequential without causal friction; coincidence (the hush pools, the floor hovers) complicates atmosphere but does not escalate conflict. No visible price is paid; the final claim "I am exact" asserts resolution without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The parable of the boy who cried wolf emerges through image and implication: the wolf "made entirely of withheld truth," the keepers who "perjured," the son inheriting the echo. The lattice as confessional filter and the staircase of lies-into-truth offer thematic texture. However, the final assertion "this time the wolf is me, and I am not early, I am exact" states the thesis rather than embodying it through action or cost. The piece invites reflection but the ending crystallizes meaning through declaration, not resonant particulars. Theme is coherent but the closure leans on meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice is ambitious and texture-driven: "copperlight repose," "hush coiling, fleeing," "manuscript unspooling." However, register drifts into elevated diction that strains credibility for a son chasing his father's echo ("parishioner," "perjured," "Conceptual Repricing"). Psychic distance is unstable: "the building sustains impossibilities" reads as narrator assertion rather than Cassian's perception. The father's single line of dialogue ("You chased the quiet all the way to silence") and Cassian's reply feel written rather than spoken. Perceptual signature is present but often submerged under metaphorical overlay.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is extreme and sustained across high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "hush darted ahead, a silver minnow," "copper blades that sliced the dark into slow-motion fins," "wolf made entirely of withheld truth." Mixed metaphors abound—hush as living thing, minnow, then pooling liquid. Template cadence runs through the middle: "Each cell was a chapter... each a lie... each a truth." Paraphrase loops appear: "chasing hush the way men chase fog" restated as "You chased the quiet all the way to silence." Coherence of vehicle is frequently violated (hush that is chased, cornered, leaps into chest, becomes heartbeat). Line-level opacity measurably dulls the closure image. Apply −1.7 in Q7 for artifacts touching closure and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-prison, confessional lattice, and the cry-wolf parable offers a specific angle. The impossible architecture and the hush-as-character are bold risks that heighten atmosphere. However, the emotional arc—son confronting father's legacy—follows a familiar template, and the thematic turn (I am the wolf, exact not early) is stated rather than transformed through lived detail. The lattice's use (fitting it to the lens to cast a true beam) is purposeful but the stakes remain abstract. Risk-taking is present but closure leans on declaration, limiting transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cassian is present throughout, and his choice to descend the impossible staircase at the climax drives the ending. However, most of his journey is observational (reading the manuscript, listening through the lattice, watching the lens rotate) without on-page friction that alters his tactics. The decision to fit the lattice and descend is asserted rather than earned through conflicting impulses. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, payoff) but causal pressure is mid-range; the son's choices feel more symbolic than viscerally constrained. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability −0.5 and summary-only interiority −0.4, landing near 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lattice appears early (under Cassian's coat, bearing tooth-marks), warms mid-story when pressed to stones (the past confesses back), and is fitted to the Fresnel lens at the climax to cast the true beam. Three distinct beats. However, the lattice does not constrain a choice; Cassian's decision to use it is uncontested. The object's properties (crossed slats, tooth-marks, filtering sins) are described but their mechanics never narrow his options. Present in all three gates, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, but no causal pressure −0.8, ornamental in middle beat −0.3, landing near 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is the declared motivation and frames the piece, but it functions as atmosphere rather than stake. The hush darts, pools, thickens, and finally leaps into Cassian's chest, but these are metaphorical states, not on-page tactics that narrow options or impose cost. The concept is lyric and pervasive but does not create friction or alter Cassian's route. Setup +0.5, closure cameo +0.3, specificity +0.4, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability (could be "chasing silence" or "seeking truth") −0.6, landing near 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" describes the lighthouse's architecture (doors onto previous years, sprouting bars, hovering floors). The hovering affects Cassian twice (first landing, lantern room), but it does not constrain his path or impose a trade-off; he simply experiences it. The attribute is label-only in setup ("he believed the building sustains..."), and its mechanics are never tested by a choice. Present in setup and two beats, but ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3, no cost tied to the trait −0.5, landing near 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Hover" occurs twice: Cassian hovers at the first landing for three heartbeats, and both he and his father hover in the lantern room during their exchange. The second instance coincides with a key moment (the dialogue, the lattice-fitting) but does not drive the turn; the hovering is simultaneous effect, not cause. The action is specific and irreplaceable but does not redefine options. Two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.6, but no causal pressure −0.9, simultaneous rather than causal −0.5, landing near 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" is the means of entry, mentioned in the opening and closing beats. The door is open; no mechanics matter, no friction is encountered. Cassian steps through without obstacle or cost. The phrase is vivid but functionally inert. Setup +0.5, closure reprise +0.4, but ornamental −0.8, swappability (any open door) −0.6, no causal work −0.7, landing near 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison is anchored early, supplies the lantern room and catwalk for the climax, and the reef and boats charge the final beam image. Spatial choreography is coherent: narrow door, first landing, cells, spiral stair, lantern room. The setting's impossible gravity and rotating lens shape two beats (hovering, the lens casting light). The reef and emerging bones frame the timeframe. Present in all three gates, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (lens, reef) +0.8, specificity +0.6, but some ornamental architecture −0.4, landing near 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" is invoked twice (mid-story and near the end) but exerts no pressure on Cassian's choices or pacing. No clock tightens his route; the gulls circling at the end are simultaneous observation, not consequence of delay. The timeframe is present but does not alter tactics. Setup +0.4, two mentions +0.5, closure cameo +0.3, but no causal pressure −0.9, told-only −0.5, landing near 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is declared twice (opening exposition, dialogue with father). Cassian states it but the desire is never dramatized through conflicting choices or visible friction. The labyrinth is metaphorical; no on-page maze constrains his path. The motivation frames the piece but does not drive beats. Setup +0.6, closure dialogue +0.6, but told-only −0.8, no friction or cost −0.7, landing near 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" appears three times: opening (dusk copperlight glazing rails), middle (hovering in copperlight that smelled of lantern oil), and closing (copper morning). The tone is consistent—elegiac, suspended—and modulates slightly (dusk to morning, repose to exhale). The final copper morning charges the ending image. Tone is coherent and purposeful. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, but static mood with minor modulation −0.6, landing near 5.6.</comment>
