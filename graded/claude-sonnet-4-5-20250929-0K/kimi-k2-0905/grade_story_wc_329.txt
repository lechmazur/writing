<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Calla's goal (uproot the seed of beauty) is clear, but her interior process remains largely abstract—she "understands" and "signals" without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The statues' shift from threat to ally lacks earned causality; their sudden cooperation feels convenient rather than motivated by Calla's prior choices. Emotional states are asserted through poetic abstraction ("breathless pause that tasted of iron and apricot") rather than specific physical sensation tied to her body under pressure. The final walk away forecloses no visible path with cost; she succeeds fully without meaningful trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered imagery (shell, music, seed) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard transforms and Calla departs. Orientation anchors (sky-bridge, orchard, statues) arrive early. The closure effect (orchard blooms outward, statues root as trees, bridge dissolves) reconfigures the world, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—Calla suffers no visible loss, and the shell "dissolving into gold dust" reads as reward, not sacrifice. The middle linkage (lullaby backward → blossoms rise → statues drowse) accumulates density but lacks a tightening choice that narrows Calla's options or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sky-bridge, orchard rows, and "glass parted like water" create vivid spatial anchors. The locust shell's veins matching bridge cables and the "blossoms became tiny lanterns" charging the exit path demonstrate setting-as-constraint that shapes Calla's final move. Sensory selection is poetic and consistent, though some details (bronze guardians, moon-gray towers) serve mood more than choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uproot the seed before calcification) is signaled early. One meaningful turn: the backward lullaby confuses the statues, allowing Calla to advance and extract the seed. However, this success arrives without visible cost or foreclosed option—statues freeze cooperatively, the seed comes free, and Calla walks away unscathed. The escalation is textural (softer music, rising blossoms) rather than a choice that narrows her path or forces a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (reawakening beauty vs. mechanical order) emerges through image and action—blossoms as lanterns, statues rooting as trees—without overt statement. The locust shell's molt metaphor and the "gap between knowing and understanding" frame recharge at closure when the orchard "blooms outward instead of upward." Yet the final image offers conceptual satisfaction without ambiguity or counter-reading; the resolution is tidy and sentimental, lacking the complexity the middle imagery promised.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; distance modulates purposefully between close observation and poetic reflection. Diction ("tarnished wonder," "sunrise heard through closed eyes") is distinctive and voice-consistent. However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats ("apricot blossoms drifted upward instead of down, reversing gravity's decree"), creating a lyric uniformity that softens urgency. No dialogue appears; interiority is largely summative rather than contradictory in real time.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or poetic construction—creating a lush texture that occasionally muddles causality (e.g., "childhood fairy tales left out in the rain to rust" as atmospheric filler). Paraphrase loops appear: "beauty, once reawakened, travels on its own legs, even if those legs are only remembered wings" restates the orchard's independence without new pressure. Template cadence runs ("One guardian paused… and in that hesitation Calla advanced… She played… Apricot blossoms drifted…") flatten propulsion. The closure paragraph stacks abstraction ("gap between knowing and understanding," "fruit tasting faintly of escape") where concrete image would sharpen impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sky-bridge violinist and living-statue guardians offer fresh visual anchors, and the locust-shell map is a specific, non-obvious device. However, the emotional arc (artist vs. mechanized world, reawakening beauty through music) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or moral calculus. The backward lullaby and heartbeat-skip signal are inventive tactics, but the resolution—statues cooperate, orchard transforms, protagonist departs unscathed—delivers genre satisfaction without risk or complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Calla appears throughout; her choices (play the lullaby backward, uproot the seed, press seed to shell) drive middle and final beats. However, her agency lacks friction—decisions succeed without visible cost or foreclosed option. She walks away with pocket empty "except for the echo," a poetic assertion rather than a tangible loss that alters her state.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locust shell appears in three beats: held to light (map), vibrates during backward lullaby (attempting to molt), dissolves into gold dust to write instructions on the seed. Its molt metaphor recharges at closure ("shell that had learned to beat like a heart"). Yet the shell's dissolution reads as fulfillment rather than cost; its absence does not constrain Calla's final walk.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Breaking free" shapes stakes (gardener vanished, Calla seeks to liberate beauty, statues learn to wave) and tactics (backward lullaby as release). It is dramatized through the orchard's transformation and Calla's departure. However, the concept is fulfilled without ambiguity or price—everyone breaks free without visible trade-off, reducing conceptual tension.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" constrains Calla's musical tactic across multiple beats: first note, lullaby whisper, final heartbeat thud. It enables the statues' confusion and eventual cooperation. The trait is specific, irreplaceable (loudness would fail), and causally active in the middle and closure, shaping how the orchard responds.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Uproot" is the climactic physical action: Calla kneels, plunges fingers into glass, extracts the glowing seed. It is signaled early (goal: "uproot the last seed of beauty"), executed mid-climax, and directly enables closure (seed pressed to shell rewrites instructions, orchard exhales). Swapping for "retrieve" or "take" would weaken the violent, transformative specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaling through heart rhythms (arrhythmic flutter, skip every fourth beat) is introduced early and used twice: Calla mimics the gardener's lullaby and conducts the final heartbeat along the bridge cables. The mechanic is specific and causally active, though its logic (how statues "hear" heartbeats) is asserted rather than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard with living-statue guardians pressures every choice: statues patrol and threaten, the bridge sways, glass parts like water, trees sing. The setting supplies resources (bridge cables matching shell veins, roots for the final heartbeat) and transforms at closure (statues root as trees, bridge dissolves). Removal would collapse the story's spatial and causal logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"The gap between knowing and understanding" appears twice: mid-story as Calla's internal state and at closure as her destination. It frames thematic resonance but does not function as a temporal constraint that tightens decisions—Calla operates at her own pace without a ticking clock or cost tied to duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Reawakening beauty is Calla's stated goal, dramatized through her actions (play lullaby, uproot seed, conduct heartbeat). Conflict arises externally (statues threaten) but not internally—Calla never doubts, hesitates, or sacrifices a competing want. The motivation is present and causal but lacks friction or visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" coheres across beats: "blossoms drifted upward," "bronze guardians with gears," "fairy tales left out in the rain to rust," "copper face cracking into something almost like a smile." Tone modulates from twilight caution to lyric transformation and charges the final image (child finds seed that hums). The tarnish-then-reawaken arc is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
