<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Corin's interiority shows contradiction—he's spent seven years pursuing false quantification of emotion, then recognizes the shell's spiral "suggested a mathematics beyond chemistry." His crushing of the pocket-sun is motivated by the shift from preservation to release. However, the epiphany feels compressed; the leap from "selling absence" to understanding "presence" arrives quickly without embodied struggle in the moment. Mira's "directed spontaneity" and her whispered secret to the shell show restraint, but her role remains reactive rather than forcing Corin's hand.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story seeds images early (shell spiral, pocket-suns, ember nexus) and returns to them with reweighted meaning at closure. The crushing of the pocket-sun is a Decisive Change with visible cost—he destroys his product and its commercial logic. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. One substantive weakness: the middle reflection on "capturing presence" and "scientifically romantic paradox" summarizes rather than dramatizes the turn, flattening pressure briefly before the final act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember nexus is concretely rendered: "volcanic glass beneath his boots," "glowing fissures that cracked the ground like luminous veins," "obsidian archway." The shell is handled twice with tactile detail and its spiral recurs with charge. When Corin crushes the pocket-sun, the light "spread outward, bathing the ember nexus in gold that made the volcanic glass sing"—the setting responds and amplifies the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Corin's choice between commodifying moments (pocket-suns as "holes where moments should be") and releasing presence. The confession to Mira and the crushing of the pocket-sun are protagonist-driven acts with visible cost—he forfeits his product and its market. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira returns the shell "with her warmth, her breath, the salt of her tears," reweighting the spiral's meaning. However, the turn from confession to crushing happens rapidly without a visible escalation beat that tests Corin's resolve under new pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: the shell's spiral, the pocket-suns as "compressed light without context," and the final light that "spread outward" rather than being trapped. The closing line—"a moment that would never need preserving because it had never been captured, only shared"—answers the central question without stating a moral. Minor slip: "palette of resolve" and "scientifically romantic paradox" veer close to prompt echo in abstract register, but the particulars (crushing the sun, the shell's physical handling) anchor the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable. Voice has distinct texture: "cracking like cooling magma," "urgent of someone who'd practiced truth until it became foreign," "long ribbons that tied past to future." Mira's dialogue carries subtext ("directed spontaneity of someone who'd rehearsed casualness"). Weakness: elevated register in reflection passages ("the density of presence," "mathematics beyond chemistry," "palette of resolve") drifts from the tactile voice used in action beats, and the phrase "scientifically romantic" reads as a label rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in action beats. The final image—light spreading, glass singing, shadows becoming ribbons—is vivid. However, multiple template patterns cluster: "pocket-sun alchemist, whose name was Corin" (scaffold); "he understood that capturing the density of presence meant something entirely different than preservation" followed by "the shell's spiral suggested a mathematics beyond chemistry" (paraphrase loop on the same epiphany); "measuring love in milligrams of oxytocin, grief in cortisol levels, joy in dopamine spikes" (list cadence). These patterns appear in reflective beats and dull momentum before the final turn. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loop, plus minor deduction for figurative density in non-peak beats ("elastic as caramel," "like a bird trying to escape").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—alchemist who traps sunlight learning that presence cannot be commodified—offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy craft and philosophical stakes. The shell's spiral and the act of crushing the pocket-sun feel specific and earned. However, the "scientifically romantic" frame and the "oxytocin/cortisol/dopamine" quantification read as template philosophical scaffolding rather than lived character logic. The turn from preservation to release is thematically familiar; the story's freshness lies in tactile execution (volcanic glass, nautilus columella) rather than a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Corin drives two key beats: the confession ("I've been selling absence") and the crushing of the pocket-sun, both altering tactics and foreclosing his prior path. Present throughout, shapes middle and ending, with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The columella curl appears in three beats: Corin holds it at the opening, Mira presses it to her lips and returns it with warmth, and it remains "unchanged yet utterly transformed" at the end. It constrains Corin's choice (he offers it as "a question") and charges the closure. Setup, development, and payoff are present; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Palette of resolve" appears once in abstract narration ("The palette of resolve shifted inside him") without shaping a prior beat or constraining a choice. It labels the interior shift but does not drive tactics or escalation. Present in the final third only; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" is named once in reflection ("His scientifically romantic mind had always sought to quantify emotion") and echoed in the oxytocin/cortisol list. It explains his prior method but does not constrain an on-page choice or create a visible tradeoff under pressure. Label-only trait; swappable with "analytical" or "quantifying."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Revalue" (and "revaluing") appears twice: Corin says "I've been revaluing everything" and the final line states the shell "carried not just the weight of its own history but the density of their shared presence." The word frames the confession and closure but does not drive a discrete middle turn. Present early and at the end; shapes the arc but could be replaced with "reconsidering" or "reassessing" without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By returning differently" is Mira's line when she returns the shell with her warmth. The method shapes one beat: her return of the shell reweights its meaning and prompts Corin's final act. Present in the middle and echoed in the closure image (the shell "unchanged yet utterly transformed"). Causal role in one beat; lyric reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ember nexus frames the entire scene: volcanic glass beneath boots, glowing fissures, obsidian archway. It provides the heat and light that resonate when Corin crushes the pocket-sun ("made the volcanic glass sing"). The setting is present throughout, supplies the atmosphere for the confession, and charges the final image. Setup, development, and closure participation are all clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The timeframe appears in one narratorial beat: "In the moment a secret is whispered between friends, time behaves differently—stretching elastic as caramel." It labels the temporal lens but does not create a ticking clock or constrain Corin's choices. The whispered secret (Mira's breath on the shell) reweights one beat but does not tighten decisions. Lyric reprise without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Corin's desire "to capture the density of presence" drives the confession and the decision to crush the pocket-sun. It is named in reflection and dramatized when he realizes "capturing presence meant something entirely different than preservation." The desire creates friction (seven years of false method) and is resolved with cost (forfeiture of his product). Present early, shapes middle and ending, with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tone is signaled in Mira's entrance: "directed spontaneity of someone who'd rehearsed casualness." The phrase describes her behavior but does not modulate across beats or charge the final image. The story's overall tone is lyric and reflective, not spontaneous; the phrase applies narrowly to Mira's speech and does not govern narrative rhythm. Functional but limited in scope.</comment>
