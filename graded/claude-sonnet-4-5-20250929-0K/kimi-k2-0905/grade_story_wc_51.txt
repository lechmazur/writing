<comment>The fractal weaver's interior world is richly textured through embodied perception (bronze tiles, kerosene flame, calcified air), and her final confession about her sister's death earns the closure choice. However, the interiority relies heavily on elevated, abstract phrasing ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") that occasionally distances us from immediate emotional stakes. The confession arrives late and feels somewhat explained rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Motivation is clear but the path to the final surrender reads more as fulfillment of a taught ritual than as a choice emerging from live internal conflict.</comment>

<comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the weaver gathers burdens, weaves them, and must add her own to complete the lattice. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first 120 words. The closure—her confession calcifying, the grotto unfolding, her departure carrying "only the memory of their weight"—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid) with visible cost: she surrenders her heaviest burden and leaves the lamp behind. One deduction: the grotto's mechanics (sevenfold symmetry, flame-kissing-tile protocol) feel more incanted than causally motivated, and the final unfolding hinges on the confession's weight rather than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<comment>The bronze grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (shingled tiles, metallic sigh, cracked glass chimney) and the environment directly constrains choice: the flame must stay lit or the walls will "cool and seize." The kerosene burner functions as micro-setting, returning at closure when she leaves it behind as "a small sun." Spatial choreography is coherent (pool, floor, walls, roof shaft). One minor slip: "boundary-lessly trapped" is asserted rather than shown through failed exit attempts, and the grotto's recursive reflections are more atmospherically claimed than spatially navigated.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—collect burdens to prevent the valley's collapse, but only by surrendering her own—is signaled early and tightens when the grotto resists and the flame sputters. The confession choice forecloses a path (she can no longer withhold the story) and the cost is visible (blood on the wick, the lamp left behind). However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on atmospheric pressure ("the silence itself grew heavy") rather than a series of choices that narrow options. The climactic turn feels more ritualistic than driven by protagonist agency testing alternatives.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges cleanly from concrete particulars: to release others' burdens, one must first release one's own. The final image—climbing out with "only the memory of their weight, balanced evenly against the hollow where her own burden had been"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The weaving/lattice motif charges the closure by making emotional weight literal and structural. One deduction: the teaching ("only by giving weight to her own burden could the lattice hold") is articulated on the page rather than discovered through failed action, edging toward thematic statement.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the confession, observational during ritual). Perceptual signature is distinct: metallic textures, recursive reflections, weight-as-tangible-object. Diction is elevated and lyric ("whalebone reverie," "auric note," "calcifying the air") but consistent within the established voice. Two issues lower the score: the prose occasionally drifts into ornamental register that feels more authorial than character-filtered ("boundary-lessly trapped," "shingled hush" repeated without functional variation), and the single line of dialogue ("the day she left her sister…") shifts abruptly into plain speech without tonal bridge. No head-hopping, and the focal control remains clean throughout.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several patterns accumulate: "shingled hush" appears three times in similar contexts without evolving function; figurative language clusters densely in nearly every sentence of the middle section ("auric note," "moth wings," "dark amber," "mandala of sorrow") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff; and stock phrases ("pressed against her ears," "touched each sheet") appear in template-like cadence. The loop/paraphrase check flags "the grotto resisted, tightening its shingled hush" immediately after "the shingled hush of the cavern pressed against her ears" (similar restatement). Elevated diction ("boundary-lessly," "calcifying") occasionally clashes with the embodied present action. Apply −0.8 for density and loop issues in non-closure beats, and −0.3 for template cadence in the middle third.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The premise—emotional burdens literalized as weavable threads—offers a fresh synthesis of myth and interiority, and the grotto's recursive geometry is vivid. The turn (she must weave her own loss) is earned in hindsight by the ritual's logic. However, the core emotional arc (confession enables release) is familiar, and the ritual mechanics (flame, symmetry, calcification) feel more decorative than causally unique to this world. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but the "teacher must learn the lesson" frame and the closing moral summary ("whoever next descended… must learn that to collect the weights… one must first surrender the heaviest stone") drift toward template wisdom. Risk-taking in diction and structure is present but does not radically transform the emotional template.</comment>

<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The fractal weaver's choices drive two key beats: gathering the memory-sheets and speaking her confession. The confession choice alters the grotto's state (walls unfold, weave rises) and forecloses her prior withholding. She is present throughout, her ritual labor and final surrender shape the closure, and her agency is visible. Slight deduction: much of the middle section is ritualistic execution (kneeling, tilting flame, touching sheets) rather than decision-under-pressure; the stakes hinge on her *willingness* to confess rather than a series of tactical choices testing alternatives.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The kerosene lamp burner is handled in three beats: carried in, used to kiss the tile and produce the memory-sheets, sputtering as pressure mounts, and left behind as "a small sun" at closure. Its mechanics matter (flame dies → walls seize) and its final reprise reweights it from tool to legacy. The burner enables the ritual and its endangered state raises stakes. It does not deeply constrain tactical choices (she never adjusts flame, replaces fuel, or improvises around malfunction), so it sits just below the high band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"Shingled hush" appears three times as atmospheric descriptor and once as active agent ("the grotto resisted, tightening its shingled hush"). It contributes to tone but does not clearly constrain on-page choices or alter tactics. The weaver never tests the hush, breaks it, or adapts her method because of it. It is present early, recurs, and colors the closure (the grotto seals "with a soft metallic sigh, the shingled hush restored"), so it passes two gates and shapes one key beat (the resistance moment). The concept reads more as setting-texture than stake-shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is asserted in the opening third ("every direction felt like forward, boundary-lessly trapping her in recursive reflections") and reversed at closure ("The boundary-lessly trapped space unfolded, walls peeling back"). It frames the stakes (she could be locked in "an eternal now") but is not tested through failed exit attempts or navigational choices. The trait is present early and resolved at the end, but it does not visibly constrain an on-page action with cost; it remains a declared condition rather than a lived friction that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>"Calcify" drives the central mechanism: the flame calcifies air into sheets, the confession calcifies into the heaviest sheet, and the teaching requires calcification of her own burden. It appears in three distinct beats (air → sheets, confession → obsidian sheet, final weave completion) and the major turn (confession) traces directly to this action. The specificity of calcification (becoming denser, stone-like, permanent) is irreplaceable; no near-synonym could carry the same weight-made-solid logic. It shapes the ending image (the weave rises, valley settles) and ties the ritual mechanics to emotional stakes.</comment>

<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Orienting properly" is named once ("knelt beside a pool… and oriented properly, aligning her breathing with the sevenfold symmetry") but its mechanics are not dramatized or tested. We do not see her misalign, struggle to find the symmetry, or adapt when pressure mounts. The method is signaled in the first third and presumably enables the flame-kissing ritual, but it functions more as a check-box step than a means that shapes tactical choices. It does not return or reweight at closure. Present and functional, but replaceable with "prepared" or "readied herself."</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The bronze grotto supplies the recursive reflections, the pool for orientation, the floor's sevenfold symmetry, the bronze tiles that must be flame-kissed, and the roof shaft that opens at closure. It constrains choice (flame dies → walls seize) and the starlight piercing the roof marks the successful weave. The setting is present throughout, drives the ritual mechanics, and its transformation (sealing with a "metallic sigh") charges the final image. Specificity is high (bronze, shingled, metallic, seams for rainwater). It does not supply varied resources across multiple beats, so it sits below 8.5, but it is essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>"After the first snowmelt" anchors seasonal timing in the opening line and implies urgency (mountain streams "still carried the taste of winter," ritual must occur now). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page; no clock counts down, no seasonal window closes during the scene. It sets context but does not alter tactics or choices. Present early, functionally replaceable (could be "after the autumn harvest" with no structural change), and absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The weaver's goal—collect the weights of different burdens to prevent the valley's collapse—is stated early and dramatized through the gathering ritual (farmer's ox, child's kite, old woman's daughter). It faces friction when the grotto resists and she realizes she must add her own burden. The confession choice is motivated by this friction, and the cost (blood on the wick, lamp left behind, "hollow where her own burden had been") is visible. Slight deduction: the motivation is more fulfilled through ritual obedience than tested through competing wants; we do not see her tempted to leave without confessing or to gather fewer burdens.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>"Whalebone reverie" appears once in the opening paragraph, establishing a tone of archaic solemnity and tactile strangeness ("pressed against her ears like whalebone reverie"). The tone—lyric, elevated, ritualistic—is coherent through the ritual beats and modulates subtly under pressure (shorter clauses when the flame sputters, longer when the grotto unfolds). The final image maintains the tone's gravity. However, "whalebone reverie" itself does not recur or charge the closure; it is a descriptor rather than a through-line. The tonal coherence is strong, but the specific phrase is ornamental rather than load-bearing.</comment>
