<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Garnet's interiority is purposeful and embodied through gestures (pressing masked cheek to iron, tracing with graphite), and her micro-choices advance pressure. Internal conflict appears in the "cradle of sparks" phrase—obedience turning to invention—but the contradiction never acts simultaneously in a beat; it's narrated rather than shown through contradictory impulses colliding on the page. The final unmasking gesture carries symbolic weight but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; we see no trade-off or renunciation. Luce remains a functional accomplice without applying secondary pressure or status friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening lines (Garnet at the postern gate during blackout), satisfying the orientation test. Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: coded sundial mechanics and aether manipulation provide causal linkage, while the "cradle of sparks" motif accumulates texture. Closure attempts a Decisive Change (barges freed, fort unlocked, mask dropped) but the cost is asserted rather than felt—"Tell the ministry that their ink has dried" declares revolution without showing what Garnet forfeits or risks in that moment. The night's events succeed too cleanly; Voss is fooled, chains slacken on cue, and dawn arrives with the fort "unlocked in every sense" in a summary flourish that skips the friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight is vividly anchored: cold torches, bruised violet sky, gear-driven lanterns dark. The blackout functions as a live constraint, guarding conspirators while endangering the garrison. Spatial choreography remains clear across postern gate, chain-room, and inner keep. The bronze quill holder as micro-setting object constrains and enables—graphite picks the lock, threaded base bleeds aether—charging the closure sequence. Sensory hierarchy reflects Garnet's priorities (touch of iron, smell of sealing wax), though some details lean decorative ("murdered torch bracket," "startled swans") rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—spark a silent revolution before dawn—is signaled early and pressure coheres through the blackout window. One meaningful tightening occurs when Voss storms in and Garnet must improvise a false surge report, narrowing options. The resolution, however, relies on off-stage mechanics: Luce's chain-room work is summarized, the timer triggers relays without friction, and barges drift free as planned. Agency at closure is gestural (dropping the mask, whispering to the wind) rather than a decision with visible trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve, but convenience does—no sentries intervene, no unforeseen cost materializes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of obedience turning to invention emerges through particulars: the graphite sliver, the half-painted sundial, the cradle of sparks. The final image of the fort "unlocked in every sense" and Garnet unmasking attempts non-literal resonance, reweighting prior material. The piece resists overt moralizing until "Tell the ministry that their ink has dried," which edges into thematic echo—a character articulating the story's thesis in prompt-like language. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (conspirators "exchanging no words"), though the waltz of citizens and gently inventive earth in the closing lines veer toward abstraction rather than earned specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Garnet with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct baroque texture—"murdered torch bracket," "lovers' exhale," "thin kites snagging on surprise"—that is consistent and purposeful. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("motif of the hour," "reweights the dominant stake") that sits uncomfortably with the action-driven urgency. Luce's brief whisper and Garnet's response feel functional rather than character-distinct. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "recognized") appear but remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the lock-picking and Voss encounter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense—"sky-barges tugged their anchors taut, then slack, then free," "thin kites snagging on surprise"—but the metaphoric load approaches overwriting in high-pressure beats (the keep door "sighed open, a lover's exhale" during the climax; "tongues of the same silent flame"). Mixed metaphors appear: "cradle of sparks" is cradled again inside the machine, recycling the vehicle without fresh tension. Template cadence emerges in the closing paragraph: "banners hanging neutral," "gates yawning toward a horizon," "the last winking hush settle into history"—parallel constructions that flatten propulsion. Paraphrase loop between "the cradle of sparks inside her chest" and "the cradle of sparks expand beyond her ribs" restates without added pressure. Information density is high, but some lines ("sentiment itself had swallowed their sparks") obscure more than clarify.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of heist mechanics, coded sundial, and aether-punk setting offers a non-obvious angle on revolution narrative. Specific details—graphite sliver, threaded quill-holder base, half-painted sundial gnomon—feel purposeful rather than ornamental. The "cradle of sparks" phrase as an old rebel idiom adds texture. However, the arc follows a familiar template: oppressed sentinel turns against regime, aided by ally, outwits commander, sparks uprising at dawn. Emotional specificity is present in Garnet's embodied tension, but the victory lacks friction or surprise; the resolution feels preordained. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, yet the boldness is more in texture than in structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Garnet is signaled early, drives three distinct beats (lock-picking, Voss encounter, unmasking at dawn), and her choices create key turns. Her decision to deceive Voss narrows options and her final gesture (dropping the mask) charges the closure image. However, the unmasking is symbolic rather than causally costly—no visible price or trade-off is shown. The trait "vigilant" is embodied in her listening and observation, but "lock sentinel" is more role than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder is seeded early (clipped at belt, smells of sealing wax and fear), used in two beats (graphite picks lock, threaded base bleeds aether), and returns with reweighted meaning when Garnet slides it to Luce as a covert spanner. Its dual mechanics—holder and tool—are specific and irreplaceable. It shapes the generator-heart beat and the chain-room work. However, the closure image (Luce raising it "like a candle") is a cameo rather than causal participation in the final turn. Strong integration across setup, development, and partial payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" is introduced early as "an old rebel phrase for the moment when obedience turns to invention," appears in the generator scene ("cradled again inside the machine"), and returns in the closing image ("expand beyond her ribs into the lungs of the fort itself"). It frames the thematic question and charges the ending metaphorically. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics; it functions as motif and label rather than active pressure. The concept is present at closure but not causally active there. Mid-band for lyric resonance without mechanical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is attributed to Luce ("the calmly inventive cartographer") and the schematic Garnet uses ("a calmly inventive schematic"). It characterizes method but does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost. The label recurs but remains descriptive rather than forcing a trade-off—Luce's sundial work and Garnet's wiring are competent without friction. The trait is present in setup and development but does not shape the ending. Functional but replaceable with "clever" or "resourceful."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is seeded early ("conspirators who have rehearsed this intrigue in dreams"), drives the coded-sundial exchange, the lock-picking, the Voss deception, and the chain-room coordination. Major turns trace to conspiratorial action: the decision to proceed despite blackout, the improvised false-surge lie, the timed relay trigger. It shapes tactics and is causally indispensable across beats. The element is specific—coordinated covert action under surveillance—and not easily swappable. Strong presence in setup, development, and payoff, with visible cost in the risk of discovery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial is introduced in the second paragraph (Luce carrying it under cloak), its mechanics explained in the middle beat ("coded angles etched between the incomplete hour lines"), and it sets the timer for the relay closure. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (Garnet translates angles into lock-picking steps), and it enables the final turn. However, the actual use is summarized rather than dramatized—"when the half-painted sundial's shadow reached the next coded angle, relays would close"—so the reader does not witness the mechanism in action at the climax. Solid development, partial payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight is anchored early and the blackout setting tightens every move: sentries change shifts by memory, the conspirators are guarded by darkness, Garnet must work without light. The fort's spatial layers (postern gate, chain-room, inner keep, wall-walk, ramparts) structure the action and the aether-generator heart is the target resource. Twilight and the bruised violet sky charge the final image ("dawn finally painted the ramparts gold"). The setting constrains choices across beats and supplies the micro-setting (bronze holder, graphite, copper coils) that alters tactics. Strong integration with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The unexplained blackout is signaled in the opening line, creates immediate pressure (garrison endangered, conspirators guarded), and tightens the decision window ("tonight was the hinge," "before dawn"). The timer—sundial shadow reaching the next coded angle—adds live-clock urgency. However, elapsed time is vague; we do not track minutes or feel the dawn approaching until it arrives. The blackout shapes tactics across beats (Voss inspecting by lantern, sentries counting stone by memory) and participates in closure (lights returning as barges drift free). Solid pressure and payoff, but the clock is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To spark a silent revolution" is stated early in Garnet's intention ("she intended to spark a silent revolution before dawn") and drives her choices: picking the lock, deceiving Voss, bridging the aether terminals. The desire is dramatized through action rather than told-only. However, friction between want and cost is minimal—the revolution succeeds as planned with no visible sacrifice or loss. The motivation shapes beats and charges the ending metaphorically ("citizens tasting ownership of the hour"), but the final image declares triumph without showing what Garnet pays. Mid-band for clear drive with muted cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Winking hush" appears early ("the winking hush of conspirators") and recurs at closure ("the last winking hush settle into history"). The tone is coherent—secretive, charged, quiet rebellion under cover of darkness—and modulates with pressure (tense during the Voss encounter, celebratory at dawn). However, the phrase itself is more label than embodied texture; the tone is enacted through gesture and silence but the "winking hush" is invoked rather than felt in the prose rhythm. The final reprise reweights the opening motif, earning lyric credit. Solid setup and payoff, mid-development presence.</comment>
