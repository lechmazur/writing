<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's interior is well-embodied through specific memories (the anise drop, her father's script) and her night-patrol choice shows character-particular caution. The photograph trail triggers a recognizable emotional arc—grief over her father's foreclosed life—that motivates her final act of tearing the label and reframing the town's story. Minor slip: the leap from private grief to "museum of common loss" feels slightly under-dramatized; the decision to photograph the town is told more than shown in micro-choices that test competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (Marisol, levee office, draw-down town at twilight). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and the photograph trail deepen until the final act—tearing the label, restringing the chime—reconfigures Marisol's relationship to the town's memory with visible cost (she releases private scandal to build shared narrative). Closure lands on the page with felt cost. One micro weakness: the transition from discovering the photos to her interpretive leap ("arranged to expunge something") relies slightly on assertion rather than letting image sequence alone carry the insight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ridgeway, silt-choked lounge, and resurfacing rooftops are vivid and selective, filtered through Marisol's professional lens (souvenir divers, attic peaks). The sapphire bottle and art-deco sign function as charged objects that constrain her choice to tear the label rather than preserve it. Spatial choreography is clean (descent, window entry, hallway trail, ridge return). The wind chime bookends the piece and charges the final image by returning restrung, a micro-setting element that reweights her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Marisol's relationship to her father's hidden life and the town's drowned history, signaled early via the bottle and sustained through the photograph trail. The tightening occurs when the final Polaroid reveals her father's foreclosed choice, narrowing Marisol's options: preserve the secret or release it. She chooses release (tearing the label, reframing the narrative) with visible cost—she forgoes sole ownership of her father's story. The escalation is meaningful but the on-page moment of choice is compressed; a beat showing her hesitation or competing pull would deepen the visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: drowned towns, private versus shared memory, duty sealing lives into fixed paths. The sapphire label and chime return with reweighted meaning, and the final image—Marisol photographing the town to build "a museum of common loss"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "the stories we'll never tell" and the interpretive leap to "evidence of choice" edge toward stating theme rather than letting image and action alone carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and Marisol's perceptual signature is distinct (professional vigilance, memory-triggered detail like "anise and rain"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("damp gauze," "mirrored hush"). No dialogue present; internal rhythm modulates well under emotional pressure. One slip: "arranged to expunge something—not evidence of crime, but evidence of choice" reads slightly expository, a helpful-narrator moment that edges out of Marisol's immediate perception into interpretation that could be more dramatized through her physical handling of the photos.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied ("metallic sigh," "slicing through twilight," "scrap carrying the weight of private grief"). Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, memory, or choice. Two slips lower the score: "Behind the bar rested a single intact bottle, label facing outward as if waiting" leans into convenient staging, and the phrase "building a new trail that would lead tomorrow's visitors not to forgotten scandal but to shared memory: a museum of common loss and common survival" stacks abstraction ("common loss," "common survival") where a concrete image would sharpen. No loops or major artifacts, but a slight scaffold quality in the explanatory clauses.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drowned-town premise is familiar but transformed through the specific photograph trail and Marisol's dual role as warden and daughter. The sapphire liqueur label as both personal relic and evidence she chooses to destroy is a fresh synthesis. The final turn—shifting from private grief to public memory-keeping by photographing the town herself—feels earned. Minor limitation: the reservoir-town-resurfacing frame and themes of duty versus desire are well-executed but not entirely novel; the emotional arc follows a recognizable template of private reconciliation enabling communal service.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marisol's vigilance drives the night patrol (setup), her discovery of the lounge and decision to follow the photograph trail (middle development), and her choice to tear the label and photograph the town (closure participation). Her decisions create the key turns; without her agency the story collapses. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the role is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sapphire liqueur label is present early (her father's memory, the bottle in the lounge), handled when she pockets it, and destroyed at closure (tearing it into flakes). It appears in three beats and its destruction is the pivot that releases private grief. However, the label itself is somewhat swappable—any personal relic tied to her father could serve a similar function. Strong involvement but not entirely irreplaceable in its specific properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The reservoir town resurfacing shapes stakes (souvenir divers, the draw-down revealing the Sapphire Swan), tactics (Marisol's night patrol, her descent into the newly exposed lounge), and the final image (photographing each resurfacing roof and chimney). The concept is indispensable: removing it breaks the logic of discovery, the photograph trail's preservation in silt, and the thematic weight of "common loss" tied to the drowned quarter-century. Present across all three gates with high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" is signaled early (Marisol's vigilance to keep divers safe) and informs her final choice to reframe the town's story rather than exploit scandal. However, the trait is more label than visible constraint; we see her care in patrolling but no on-page moment where precision and humanity trade off or cost her something specific. Functional but the trait could be demonstrated more concretely through a choice that tests competing goods.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears in Marisol's interpretation of the photograph trail ("arranged to expunge something—not evidence of crime, but evidence of choice") and motivates her counter-action: instead of expunging, she builds a shared archive. The action shapes the thematic turn and her final choice. However, it is somewhat swappable—"conceal" or "erase" would work with minor edits. Present in middle and closure but not indispensable in its exact wording.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The trail of photographs clipped to fishing line is introduced early, followed beat by beat (mayor, marching band, her mother, her father's Polaroid), and drives Marisol's interpretive journey and final decision to create a new trail. The method is specific (physical photos on a line, deliberate sequence) and its mechanics matter: the trail leads her backward through time, shaping her realization. Strong setup, development, and closure participation; nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway at twilight frames the opening (levee office, flashlight beam) and the closure (tearing the label onto the water, photographing the town from the ridge). The setting provides resources (vantage over the town, access to the newly exposed lounge) and constrains movement (rocky path, slime). Present in all three gates and integral to the spatial logic; without the ridge the visual scope and final image lose coherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wind chime falling silent opens the piece and its restringing closes it, bookending Marisol's arc with a concrete image of repair and renewal. The timeframe "after the chime falls silent" signals a threshold and the chime's return charges the final beat. However, the chime does not tighten decisions or apply a live clock to tactics; it functions more as symbolic framing than temporal pressure. Lyric reprise is strong but causal work is limited.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Marisol's motivation to "spin the submerged stories into something the living could carry together" is dramatized through her choice to tear the private label, photograph the town, and reframe the narrative for "tomorrow's visitors." The motivation is present in her night-patrol role (setup), her interpretive decision about the photos (middle), and her final act of public memory-keeping (closure). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the desire is tested and fulfilled with visible cost (releasing her father's secret).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears explicitly ("the reservoir outside lapped against the bricks, echoing the mirrored hush inside her chest") and the tone of quiet, reflective melancholy coheres throughout: the metallic sigh, the damp twilight, the photographs, the final dawn. Tone modulates subtly with pressure (discovery, grief, resolve) and charges the final image (the restrung chime's "tentative notes sounded like a question she could now answer"). Strong coherence and closure participation but slightly abstract as a tonal marker rather than a concrete constraint.</comment>
