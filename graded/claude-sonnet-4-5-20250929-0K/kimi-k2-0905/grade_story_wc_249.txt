<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's core motivation—to reclaim internal space from grafted memories—is legible and drives her movement from clinic to lagoon. The shift from "trying to externalize the overload" to accepting "teaching harmony" arrives suddenly without intermediate contradiction or embodied hesitation; the pivot feels declared rather than wrestled through visible micro-choices. Interiority relies heavily on figurative language ("moth wings," "contraband metronomes") that beautifies state but rarely grounds it in specific bodily sensation or irrational impulse under duress. The final stance—"conductor emeritus"—reads as a conceptual label rather than an earned identity forged by prior cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—memories accumulate, pressure deepens via drumming and immersion, closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "no longer a fugitive guinea pig but a conductor emeritus"). Orientation anchors by ~120 words (Mira, garden, escape). The escalation from "trying to externalize" to "teaching harmony" lacks an on-page causal turn or visible cost that forecloses the prior tactic; the shift reads as realization-by-assertion rather than dramatized friction. The lagoon sequence does deepen the stake (identity vs. chorus), and the final image reconfigures her stance, but the cost—what she loses or sacrifices to become "conductor emeritus"—is implied rather than made tangible in a concrete forfeiture or action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sound wave garden, auric lagoon, and quartz bough are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (leaves as "pale green speakers," water chiming at "electrolytes," starlight "like liquid metal"). The garden constrains her escape route (following cricket frequency) and the lagoon water actively responds to her drumming, enabling memory release. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (garden → lagoon → return to bough). Minor: the "upside-down tree" and "soap-bubble helmet" visions add color but do not materially alter Mira's choices or tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reclaim enough internal space to "breathe her own dream" vs. the chorus of grafted memories. The lagoon immersion narrows options—she wades deeper despite memory-threads trying to anchor her—and the drumming accelerates pressure. However, the resolution (slowing tempo, inviting harmony) is not forced by a reversal or visible price; Mira shifts strategy after a realization ("tender accountability") that arrives as epiphany rather than through a dramatized failure or trade-off. The cost—what she loses by choosing harmony over erasure—is stated ("weary smile") but not shown in a concrete forfeiture or consequence that alters her situation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—identity can expand without shattering through communal entanglement—emerges from the memory-graft premise and drumming motif. The final image (drumming "for whoever next needed proof") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, key beats rely on direct thematic articulation: "teaching it harmony" and "identity could expand without shattering" veer toward prompt-language echoes. The auroral veil and released jellyfish memories are vivid, yet the shift from solitary escape to communal conductor feels conceptually asserted rather than discovered through scene friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with psychic proximity that allows figurative interiority. Voice is lyric and science-fictional, maintaining register throughout (no colloquial intrusions). The perceptual signature favors synesthetic metaphor ("sound wave garden," "contrail smoke spelling names") that feels consistent with Mira's altered senses. However, peak-pressure beats layer dense metaphor without grounding in simpler sensory anchors, risking opacity: "ghost notes of lullabies hummed by mothers she had never met" is evocative but does not clarify what Mira physically hears or feels. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful (clinic procedures summarized to focus on garden sequence).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across most sentences, mixing vehicles without full coherence: "contraband metronomes," "moth wings," "liquid metal," "bioluminescent jellyfish" stack rapidly, and some contradict (memory as solid contraband, then fluttering moths, then liquid). Template cadence appears in repeated "she + verb" openers and paired clauses ("trying to anchor her…but she waded"; "no longer a fugitive…but a conductor"). Paraphrase loops: "externalize the overload, to give every stolen moment a doorway out" restates the same idea. "Conductor emeritus" and "quietly rebellious" are abstract labels in the closure paragraph. Apply −0.8 for density/coherence issues and −0.4 for template stems (−1.2 total, per Non-closure Accumulation Cap).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and entangled-memory serum premise offer a fresh synthesis of sensory world-building and identity conflict. The drumming-as-agency motif and the lagoon that "dissolves identity" avoid stock SFF tropes. However, the emotional arc—fugitive finds peace by accepting communal self—follows a familiar self-acceptance template. The specific science-fictional mechanics (auric fluid, altered electrolytes, frequency-tuned crickets) are verifiable within the story's logic and feel particular. The final "conductor emeritus" image is thematically coherent but conceptually tidy, lacking the sharp ambiguity or cost that would elevate ingenuity into the high 7s or 8+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira is identified as the "quietest rebel of the Aurora Clinic's sleep trials" and "guinea pig" in the opening paragraphs. The attribute frames her prior passivity and current escape, but her key decisions (wade into lagoon, slow tempo) are driven by the immediate pressure of memory overload rather than guinea-pig-specific constraints or tactics. Present across beats, shapes context, but not indispensable—remove "guinea pig" and the plot still functions via "clinic escapee."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The auric lagoon appears mid-story and is used in multiple beats: Mira approaches it ("rumored to dissolve identity"), steps onto the mirrored shore (surface chimes, recognizing her electrolytes), wades in to heart-depth, drums on the water (ripples in B-minor), and the underwater constellation mimics her cadence. The lagoon enables memory release and the realization of bidirectional entanglement. Present in the closure paragraph as cleared water reflecting "her own weary smile." Drives two key beats (immersion, drumming) and charges the ending image. Not entirely irreplaceable (another dissolving medium could serve), but the starlight/auric properties are woven into the sensory logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Entangled memories are the core stake: "clinic's entangled memory grafts had succeeded, weaving strangers' lifelines through her synapses." Drives the central conflict (Mira seeks to reclaim space), shapes her tactics (drumming to externalize, lagoon immersion to dissolve), and resolves in the realization that entanglement runs both ways. The concept constrains her initial attempt (memories tighten, trying to anchor her) and enables the final stance (communal conductor). Present in setup, development (memory-threads resist), and closure (memories drift free as jellyfish, yet shared dream persists). Strong integration, though the mechanics could be swapped for another memory-bleed trope with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly rebellious" is stated in the opening ("quietest rebel") and the final paragraph ("quietly rebellious, forever entangled"). It frames her character but does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost. Her rebellion (escape, drumming, immersion) could proceed identically if labeled "determined" or "defiant." The trait colors tone but is not mechanically essential to any decision or tactic. Present early and at closure, but functions as thematic label rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira perches on the quartz bough in the opening beat and returns to perch "once more" at closure. The perching action bookends the narrative and signals her transition from "fugitive guinea pig" to "conductor emeritus," reweighting the recurring image. However, the perch itself does not constrain or enable a key choice; it is a vantage and symbolic anchor. The drumming that occurs while perched is the active mechanic. Present in setup and closure with charged reprise, but swappable with another vantage without breaking plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Drumming appears in the opening beat (fingertips on quartz bough, "testing whether the experimental serum still allowed her to keep time"), escalates mid-story ("drummed faster, a glissando of knuckles on crystal bark"), becomes the lagoon tactic ("began the rhythm she had practiced in the ward's dark…fingertips slapping luminous ripples"), and returns in the final paragraph ("gentlest drumming—just index finger on thumb—marking time"). Drives three beats (garden arrival, lagoon immersion, closure), shapes tactics under pressure, and the mechanics matter (cadence loosens grief, invites harmony). Essential—remove drumming and the plot loses its central mechanic and symbolic through-line.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is present by the title beat, provides the environment for escape (crickets tuned to her blood frequency), responds to her drumming (leaves broadcast memories, seedpods split releasing lullabies), and leans over the lagoon in the resolution to "listen." Constrains her route (following tremolo) and amplifies her cadence into plot-driving consequences (seedpods split, crescendo drives her to lagoon). Present in setup, development, and closure. Strong integration, though the garden's mechanics (leaves as speakers, sound-reactive seedpods) could be simplified without breaking the core plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"At the hush of the universe inhaling—that suspended instant before dawn" is stated in paragraph three and repeated in the final sentence ("The universe inhaled again, quieter now"). The timeframe frames atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Mira's actions unfold without a ticking clock or temporal pressure. The phrase functions as poetic motif and tonal anchor rather than causal constraint. Present early and at closure with lyric reprise, but swappable with any other liminal time descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to breathe her own dream" is stated mid-story ("reclaim enough space inside to breathe her own dream") and evolves into "to breathe life into a shared dream" after the realization of bidirectional entanglement. Drives her descent to the lagoon and the choice to slow tempo rather than erase memories. The friction between wanting solo space and accepting communal presence shapes the final stance. Present in development and closure, though the phrasing is abstract and the shift from solo to shared is told via epiphany rather than dramatized through competing on-page choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is signaled via "B-minor, the key of auroral sorrow" mid-story and the "auroral veil" at closure. Tone is lyric, melancholic, and wonder-tinged throughout, matching the sound wave garden's strangeness and Mira's grief over lost selfhood. Modulates subtly (desperation at the lagoon, tenderness at the realization, weary peace at closure). The tone charges the final image (communal exhalation, shared dream) but is not mechanically indispensable—another melancholic register could serve. Coherent across beats and closure reprise, but the tone could shift without breaking plot.</comment>
