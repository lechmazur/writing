<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's internal conflict between vigilance and letting go is embodied through concrete gestures—the buckle, the tally marks, the descent—and the encounter forces a choice that forecloses her prior stance with visible cost. However, the older-self encounter leans heavily on symbolic conveyance rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the decision to pass the buckle feels more allegorical than psychologically knotted. Interiority remains specific to the watcher role, but the final peace arrives without sufficient dramatized resistance or ambivalence in the peak beat. The piece earns endurance-as-agency but stops short of the tension required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to release): the protagonist relinquishes the buckle and her vigil, accepting that preservation can mean letting go, with the cost legible in her lightness "by one buckle but heavier by one choice." The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density of ritual (tallies, signals, muscle memory) builds until the glider encounter breaks the pattern and the final tally shift reweights the stake. Orientation anchors (arbor, post-radio silence, sky-watcher role) arrive within the first third. One friction: the time-folded older-self device introduces a causal ambiguity (instructor's voice, mirrored eyes) that the text does not fully earn through prior rule-teaching, creating a brief mid-story opacity before the thematic payoff clarifies intent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor and vertical staging (highest bough, glider's level, descent branch-by-branch) constrain movement and choice throughout; the parachute buckle functions as micro-setting, its tactile detail (scratches, false catch, snap) charging multiple beats and the final handoff. Sensory selection reflects urgency: pulse as "soundless echo," breath clouds, moon-reflection mask. One cap: the "above the clouds" detail remains atmospheric rather than materially affecting a choice (no wind, no altitude consequence), and the arbor's specifics (leaf/wind rhythm cataloging) are asserted more than demonstrated in action. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting earns its place but does not reach indispensability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the network's secrecy versus trust the familiar signal—is signaled early and tightens when the glider violates the ceiling and flashes the stolen code. The descent and buckle-handoff constitute protagonist agency that forecloses her prior stance (watching forever) with visible cost (lighter by one buckle, heavier by one choice). Under the Accumulative lens, the single meaningful deepening (realizing the vigil itself became the threat) is sufficient for this length and reweights the watcher's burden. One friction: the older-self reveal softens the antagonistic pressure into allegory, reducing the felt cost of misjudgment; coincidence (time-folded double) enables rather than complicates resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust, surveillance, and the cost of perpetual vigilance—emerges through concrete ritual (tallies, signals, muscle memory) and the final shift from "sightings" to "releases" reweights the premise without stating a moral. The parachute buckle recurs with accumulating meaning (oath symbol, false-clue consideration, relay baton) and the "soundless echo" motif brackets the piece, moving from dread to peace through earned pressure. Subtext operates in the instructor's posthumous voice and the mirrored mask encounter. One limit: the older-self device leans allegorical, and the final paragraph's "exact angle of surrender" phrase approaches thematic echo, though it remains embedded in bodily memory rather than declarative thesis. No overt moralizing in the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the watcher notices patterns, wingbeats, and signal cadences through professional filter. Diction stays consistent (attentive, cataloging, revision) and modulates under pressure without register drift. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the glider encounter. Two frictions: some filter-verb reliance ("feeling its weight," "seeing the pilot's mask") in peak beats dulls immediacy, and a few elevated constructions ("fibers of her muscles," "bruised the horizon") drift slightly above the established technical voice. No head-hopping, no POV leakage; the instructor's radio voice is externalized cleanly. Elision (three-year backstory) is purposeful and anchored to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance ritual, choice, or motif. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates (short beats at the signal exchange, longer reflection during descent). Three friction clusters lower the score: (1) paraphrase loops—"trust under pressure" appears verbatim twice; "soundless echo" recurs four times with diminishing return; "muscle memory" is restated in adjacent lines. (2) Template cadence in the middle third: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences during the descent without taught pattern. (3) Stock metaphor: "dawn bruised the horizon" and "burden settle across her shoulders like the harness" are competent but familiar. Loops and cadence issues spread across non-closure beats, capping high-band entry. Clarity and propulsion remain intact; no causality obscured.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of sky-watcher + time-folded self-encounter + ritual object (buckle) offers a specific angle on trust and succession, and the "tallies of releases" inversion at closure feels earned in hindsight. Transformation test: the emotional arc (letting go of perpetual vigilance) and the buckle's ritual weight are particular to this frame. Two limits: the older-self device is a familiar time-loop/mentor-return trope not fully transformed by fresh mechanics (the radio voice and mirrored eyes remain unexplained within the story's physics), and the nocturnal-arbor-watcher role reads close to sentinel/lookout archetypes without occupation-specific detail that would deepen freshness. Risk-taking (lyric pacing, elliptical time mechanics) is present but does not fully cohere without rule-teaching. No close echoes of famous lines; voice is singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The midnight pattern seeker is present from the opening line and drives three key beats: the decision to descend (agency), the buckle handoff (pivot), and the new tally system (closure participation). Her choices—descend rather than attack, offer the buckle rather than withhold, etch releases rather than sightings—alter tactics and foreclose her prior stance with visible cost. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is strong: each decision narrows options under the inferred Accumulative lens. Specificity is high (watcher role, tally rituals, signal fluency). Cost is tied directly to her renunciation of the vigil. Swappability is low; another character type would break the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The parachute buckle appears in five beats: opening clip, weight consideration, false-clue ideation, handoff, and implied new-guardian use below the clouds. It functions as oath token, tactical object (considered as decoy), and relay symbol. Setup (first paragraph), development (descent deliberation), and payoff (handoff that "reverberates through both futures") are met. Causal pressure: the buckle's scratches encode watch-count history and its handoff enacts the thematic shift from preservation-by-guarding to preservation-by-release. Cost is tied to its loss ("lighter by one buckle"). Closure linkage is strong. One friction: the buckle's mechanics (false catch / real catch) are described but not tested on the page in a choice beat, slightly reducing irreplaceability. Specificity and beat involvement justify high scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The watcher's burden is named explicitly and shapes the protagonist's stakes: deciding "when the vigil itself became the threat." It pressures the descent choice and is reweighted at closure when she shifts from sightings to releases. Setup (first third: "the watcher's burden settle"), development (mid-story realization), and payoff (final oath revision) are met. Causal pressure is moderate: the concept frames the dilemma but does not impose a material constraint (e.g., stamina cost, resource limit) that alters tactics beat-by-beat. It operates more as thematic lens than on-page obstacle. Cost is conceptual (heavier by one choice) rather than physical. Swappability is moderate; "guardian's duty" or "sentinel's cost" could substitute with minor edits. Closure linkage and thematic resonance lift it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is dramatized through cataloging silhouettes, memorizing leaf/wind rhythm, and the false-clue consideration (drop the buckle as misdirection). Setup is present (third paragraph: "three years attentively inventive"). Development: the attribute enables her to spot the anomaly (glider without lights) and invent the tactical option (decoy buckle), though she does not execute the decoy plan. Payoff: the new tally system (releases) is inventive revision. Two gates met; middle development is weak because the attribute is asserted more than constrained—her inventiveness does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff on the page. Causal pressure is modest. Swappability is moderate; "resourceful" or "adaptive" could fit. One distinct beat (anomaly detection) and closure accent justify mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Revise" drives three beats: the protagonist's internal recognition that trust protocols must be revised (mid-story turn), the decision to "revise" her oath by descending, and the closure action of etching a new tally type ("not of sightings but of releases"). Setup is woven throughout (revision as method and theme). Development: revision reframes her stance under pressure. Payoff: the final tally shift is the enacted revision with cost (lighter/heavier). Causal pressure is strong under the Accumulative lens: revision is both the problem (stolen signal = revised use of her code) and the solution (revised oath). Closure linkage is explicit. Swappability is low at thematic level but moderate at plot level—"adapt" or "change" could work with edits. Specificity and beat involvement justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Muscle memory is signaled in the sixth paragraph (parachute training jumps) and returns in three later beats: the coaxing of the buckle's false catch, the aligned memories at handoff ("stored in the fibers of her muscles"), and the final "exact angle of surrender." Setup, development (handoff beat where memories align), and payoff (closure sentence) are met. Causal work is moderate: the method enables the thematic link between training and trust but does not materially alter a tactical choice on the page (she does not use muscle memory to solve a physical problem; it functions as metaphor). Cost is conceptual. Swappability is moderate; "instinct" or "embodied knowledge" could substitute. Closure linkage and recurring presence justify mid-6s; lack of tactical constraint caps higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor provides vertical structure (highest bough, glider's level, descent branch-by-branch) that stages the encounter and constrains movement. Setup is immediate (opening line). Development: the descent through branches is goal-directed and embodies the choice to engage. Payoff: she returns to her post and etches into the bark, using the arbor as witness and record. Spatial choreography is clean. One friction: the "above the clouds" detail and leaf/wind cataloging are atmospheric rather than materially affecting a choice—no weather, no altitude consequence, no tactical use of the canopy. Causal pressure is modest; the arbor enables staging but does not impose cost. Swappability is moderate; another elevated perch (tower, cliff) could work. Closure linkage (bark tally) and spatial coherence justify low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" anchors the opening moment and signals a post-event window. Setup is immediate. The timeframe does not impose a ticking constraint (no countdown, no patrol schedule) but provides narrative hygiene: the encounter unfolds in one continuous night, ending at dawn. Development is weak: time does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. Payoff: dawn arrival ("bruised the horizon") marks closure and the shift to a new day/new tally. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is absent. Causal pressure is low; the night duration is a container, not a driver. Swappability is moderate; "at midnight" or "before dawn" could substitute. Closure linkage via dawn image and coherent single-night structure justify low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve trust under pressure is signaled early ("trust, once shattered, could not be sewn back together") and dramatized through the dilemma: trust the familiar signal or protect the network. Setup, development (the descent and buckle-offer as acts of trust), and payoff (revised oath that preserves by releasing) are met. Causal pressure is strong: the motivation shapes the descent choice and the handoff, with visible cost (foregoing permanent vigilance). Friction between want (preserve network secrecy) and fear (exposure via wrong trust) is present. Cost is tied to the motivation: trusting the older self means abandoning her post's original logic. Closure linkage is explicit. Swappability is low; another motivation would break the thematic arc. Specificity and beat involvement justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" recurs across the story: pulse as soundless echo (opening), breath cloud vanishing (mid), swallowed warnings (mid), the snap "reverberating through both futures" (handoff), and the final echo "carried not dread but peace" (closure). Setup, development (multiple reprises), and payoff (tonal shift from dread to peace) are met. The tone coheres—hushed, ritualized, attentive—and modulates under pressure (urgency during signal exchange, contemplative at closure). One friction: the phrase "soundless echo" is repeated verbatim four times without enough variation in context to justify the recurrence; it risks becoming ornamental. Closure linkage is strong (final sentence uses it to charge the ending image). Tone as recurring motif shapes atmosphere but does not materially constrain a choice. Swappability is moderate; "silent witness" or "unspoken weight" could work. Reprise structure and closure charge justify mid-6s.</comment>
