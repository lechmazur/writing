<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is coherent—she wants understanding without forgiving—but her interior voice trends toward elevated, label-like phrasing ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradictions") that reads more authorial than character-particular under pressure. The final choice to "bet on herself" is set up by the diary revelation, but the embodiment of that shift remains somewhat abstract; we see her leaving pages but not a visceral micro-choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. The father exists mostly in backstory and diary entries; his compulsive gambling is told rather than shown influencing present tactics, and Mira's "theoretically rebellious" attribute never visibly constrains an on-page action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (library, post–heart attack, Mira with lantern). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: scrawls accumulate, the diary deepens understanding, and the final subway loop + page-leaving ritual reconfigures her stance from refusal to openness. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira leaves the unlit candle and walks out "wider," reweighting her relationship to her father's contradictions. Cost is oblique—she relinquishes anger and the need for tidy resolution—but the final image ("not lighter, but wider") makes the trade legible. One pressure tightening: the diary entry forces her to see "the lattice of love beneath the ruin."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and subway are anchored early with sensory specificity ("wet stone and old paper," "clover melancholy"). The lantern's cracked mica pane catches light and charges the final image when she scratches a note on it. However, much of the setting remains descriptive backdrop; the library basement and subway don't meaningfully constrain her choices—she could traverse the city by any method. The micro-setting (lantern, pressed clover) does more work than the macro environment, lifting the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding her father without forgiving him, signaled early. The diary discovery is a meaningful tightening that forces Mira to see his love beneath the gambling wreckage, narrowing her refusal. Her final subway loop and page-leaving ritual demonstrate agency—she chooses risk over escape—but the escalation is more conceptual than visceral; no live option is dramatized as foreclosed on the page. The cost (releasing anger, accepting ambiguity) is legible in the final image ("not lighter, but wider"), meeting the Accumulative lens requirement for one deepening with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—holding and releasing, mourning and moving, lucid contradictions as invitations rather than traps—emerges from the diary, the scrawls, and Mira's ritual. The final image ("She bet on herself") reconfigures the father's gambling metaphor without stating a moral, and "clover melancholy...no longer clung—it guided" reweights prior material with specificity. The pressed clover returns with new meaning at closure. However, a few phrases edge toward thematic statement: "The contradictions were lucid now: to hold and release, to mourn and move" reads slightly explanatory rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("rainwashed," "clover melancholy," "lattice of love beneath the ruin"). However, diction sometimes drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Mira-particular under pressure: "traverse the city I mapped in riddles," "widen perspectives responsibly," "lucid contradictions." The father's diary voice and Mira's narration converge in tone, reducing distinction. Purposeful compression is present but the perceptual signature doesn't shift noticeably under stress, keeping this in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Syntax is varied and rhythm supports the accumulative design, but several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure: "She had come after the heart attack—her father's, not hers" / "her throat tight" are vivid, yet "clover melancholy" recurs three times without new function, and "traverse" appears four times. Stock metaphor: "lattice of love beneath the ruin" and "fracturing it into a spectrum" read familiar. The final paragraph stacks abstract summaries ("not lighter, but wider," "hold and release, mourn and move") where a single concrete image would suffice, triggering −0.6 for paraphrase loops and −0.3 for template stems in the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—daughter decoding gambler father's cryptic scrawls after his heart attack—is functional but not fresh; it leans on familiar reconciliation-via-hidden-diary tropes. The lantern with mica pane and pressed clover offer specific detail, and the subway ritual ending provides a non-obvious inflection. However, the emotional arc (anger → understanding) and the "bet on yourself" resolution follow a well-worn template. Transformation is present but modest; swapping the gambling metaphor for another obsession would leave the arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and the diary reveals her father's compulsive gambling, but the attribute shapes backstory and theme more than on-page choices. The professor/gambler contradiction is told, not dramatized in a beat that alters Mira's tactics. She interprets his riddles and leaves pages, but those actions don't hinge on his gambling per se—any hidden message would serve. The element is functional but swappable, capping it in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lantern appears in beat one (she carries it), returns at the library when the mica pane "caught the fluorescent light, fracturing it into a spectrum," and is placed on the returns desk at closure with a new candle and scratched note. It anchors the father connection, enables the final ritual, and charges the ending image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage lift this into the high-7s, though its specific properties (cracked mica) could be swapped for another heirloom object with minor adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" titles the book Mira finds, structures the scrawls ("The only way out is further in"), and recurs in her realization: "The contradictions were lucid now: to hold and release, to mourn and move." It shapes her final stance and charges the closure image. However, the concept is more thematic label than active constraint—it doesn't narrow options in a dramatized beat. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, reaching mid-5s for resonance but lacking middle-beat causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is label-only; the text asserts Mira "had inherited his mind but not his disease, or so she told herself," yet no on-page action demonstrates rebellion or its cost. The trait is ornamental, present in exposition but absent from beats, capping it below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira "traverses the city" by interpreting scrawls, leading her to the library and then riding the subway end-to-end while leaving pages. The action drives two beats (library discovery, subway ritual) and shapes the closure image. However, "traverse" could be replaced with "search" or "follow clues" with minimal structural change; the specificity of traversal qua movement doesn't constrain tactics. Solid causal role across beats and closure, but swappability holds this in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The method appears early (scrawls on subway seats lead her to the library) and recurs at closure (she waits for the next scrawl, then leaves her own annotated pages). It shapes two beats and the ending ritual. However, the mechanics remain vague—how do the scrawls encode directions?—and the method could be replaced with any hidden-message system. Present in setup and closure with modest causal pressure, reaching mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library is anchored early with sensory detail and houses the restricted archives where Mira finds the diary. The setting enables the discovery beat but doesn't pressure choices; she could find the diary anywhere. "Midsummer" is mentioned once without consequence. The library supplies a resource (the book) but acts more as backdrop than constraint, capping this at low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the heart attack" frames the inciting condition and appears in the diary's final entry ("dated the day before his heart attack"). The timeframe motivates Mira's search but doesn't create urgency or tighten decisions on the page; no live clock alters her tactics. Functional setup, minimal middle or closure pressure, mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to widen perspectives responsibly" is stated once ("She had come to widen perspectives responsibly, to understand without forgiving") but not dramatized in friction. Mira's actions—reading the diary, leaving pages—align with the desire, yet no on-page beat shows her wrestling with irresponsibility or cost. The phrase feels authorial rather than character-driven, and the motivation is told more than tested, low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" recurs three times: as scent in the library, as lingering quality, and at closure ("no longer clung—it guided"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly from passive ("clung") to active guide, charging the final image. However, "melancholy" remains somewhat static across beats—no sharp tonal shift under pressure. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, reaching low-6s for pattern and closure participation.</comment>
