<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gryphon's interior state is vividly embodied through "brittle awakening," "crack inside her sternum," and "fissures admitted moonlight"—concrete, character-particular imagery that grounds loneliness as physical pressure. The final choice to refuse the chorus is motivated by prior interiority (translating isolation into independence) and foreclosed with visible cost (stepping backward, accepting solitude). Minor deduction: the middle beats lean on abstract language ("unmapped space, continents of possibility") that edges toward platitude, and the broader motivation remains more asserted than tested through micro-choices under genuine competing pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening (gryphon, tidal library, brass sundial, post-reincarnation). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes symbolic weight through recurring images (moonlight, feathers, sundial, stone circle) until the final gesture—stepping backward, rotating the sundial, etching "Alone"—reweights the dominant stake (isolation into independence) with conceptual cost. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): refusal of the chorus forecloses haunting partnership, and the cost is legible in the continued solitude and the blank codex page released as promise. One meaningful deepening occurs when the interior crack admits moonlight and reveals "unmapped space," narrowing the path toward singular autonomy. The cost-proof test is satisfied: "stepped backward off the stones," "disappointed yet respectful," and the torn page "addressed to the future" all register renunciation and its price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: salt-crystal volumes, cloud-suspended shelves, and the stone circle beneath the observatory provide resources (indexes, protocol, hum) and pressure (the chorus memory, the sundial gnomon as stylus). The brass sundial is handled twice (perch, rotation to mark decision), and the atomically reflective feathers scatter moonlight to disperse the chorus—environment charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (clouds drifting, bass note older than parchment, warm metal talons), filtered through the gryphon's priorities. Spatial choreography is clean across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate isolation into independence) is signaled early and tested once: the stone circle offers partnership with extinct-species memories, and the gryphon refuses, accepting solitary cartography. The tightening is clear—accept chorus or step back—and the cost is on the page (disappointed hum, continued aloneness, torn page as promise rather than presence). Agency is renunciation that forecloses the path of shared haunting. One minor gap: the middle exploration of "interior sky" and "unmapped space" adds texture but does not materially narrow options or raise price; the core turn is binary (accept/refuse) rather than progressively escalated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (isolation vs. independence, the grammar of solitude) emerges through concrete images: brittle sternum crack, atomically reflective scattering, sundial shadow writing "Alone," blank codex page as letter to the future. The final gesture offers a resonant, non-literal answer: naming loneliness grants power, and the torn page becomes "a tiny moon," proof that isolation can translate into independence without erasing the aching self. No overt moral; the gryphon's refusal and the library's continued respiration enact "alone together." Subtext operates in the chorus's "disappointed yet respectful" hum and the choice not to return to the circle. The piece resists tidy resolution—solitude persists, charged with new resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in the gryphon's perceptual signature: "bronze feathers rang, atomically reflective," "the brittle awakening," "the precise loneliness she now sought to alchemize." Diction is elevated and consistent, voice-motivated for a mythic register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the sternum crack, wider at the library's respiration). Minor deductions: some constructions edge toward ornamental complexity ("atomically reflective surfaces scattering the chorus into prismatic shards") that slightly obscures immediacy, and a few beats ("the shadow became a stylus") rely on metaphor density that could flatten momentum. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance image, choice, or resonance. Rhythm varies across beats (short declaratives at the refusal, longer accumulative sentences in flight). Overwriting check flags elevated diction density in peak beats: "atomically reflective," "alchemize," "cartographer," "prismatic shards"—register drifts toward ornamental in moments that warrant sharper immediacy. Paraphrase-loop detected: "let us live through you, let us share the weight" and "the offer was seductive, a chorus that promised she would never be alone" restate the same pressure without added detail (−0.2). Template cadence in the final third: "She stepped," "She launched," "She climbed," "She tucked"—four successive "She [verb]" openers (−0.4). No loops touch the closure image directly, so accumulation cap applies. Grammar and pronoun clarity are clean; no typos or tense breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—last gryphon, tidal library above clouds, reincarnation memory, stone circle chorus—feels specific and non-obvious. The central turn (refusing communal haunting to preserve singular identity) is earned through prior particulars (brass sundial protocol, atomically reflective scattering, interior sky). The piece commits fully to its lyric-symbolic premise and follows implications without retreat. Minor deduction: the emotional arc (loneliness calcified → crack → moonlight interior → refusal → independence) follows a recognizable template of solitary-creature-finds-self-sufficiency; transformation is present but not boldly surprising. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, image-dense) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Character (contemporary of extinct species) is signaled early ("hatched from an egg that had waited three centuries"), drives the middle choice (stone circle offers extinct-species memories), and shapes closure (refusal to be "crowded by ghosts," solo flight as proof for "another last-of-kin"). Causal pressure: the gryphon's last-of-kind status motivates the quest to translate isolation into independence and makes the chorus offer both seductive and threatening. Irreplaceability high: swap "contemporary of extinct species" for "lonely scholar" and the story's stakes collapse. Cost on page: stepping backward forecloses partnership, torn page becomes promise to future last-kin. Three beats (opening hatch mention, circle temptation, ending solo flight) plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Object (brass sundial) appears in beat one (perch, gnomon), beat two (stepping from gnomon onto stones), and closure (gripping, rotating, shadow as stylus writing "Alone"). Causal role: the sundial provides protocol anchor and becomes the instrument that marks the moment of decision. Cost connection: the etched mark and shadow-word crystallize the refusal. Swappability moderate: another symbolic instrument (bell, lens) could perform similar plot work with edits, though the sundial's time-marking function fits thematically. Setup strong (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), but moderate irreplaceability and no visible tradeoff tied to the object itself cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Core concept (brittle awakenings) is seeded early ("the awakening was brittle: a crack inside her sternum"), tested at the circle (fissures admit moonlight, interior sky revealed), and present at closure ("no longer brittle, but resonant"). The concept shifts from fragility (calcified loneliness threatening to shatter) to transformation (cracks widen, admit light, become resonance). Causal role in one major beat: the brittle-to-resonant shift enables the refusal and solo flight. Lyric reprise reweights the stake. Swappability low for the exact metaphor. Cost implicit: brittleness must crack to allow independence. Setup (+0.6), development (+0.4), closure participation (+0.8), but only one clear choice-altering beat limits upper range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attribute (atomically reflective) appears in beat one ("bronze feathers rang, atomically reflective, doubling the moonlight"), beat two (scattering the chorus into prismatic shards), and closure (moon's reflection bright enough to read by, torn page shimmering). Setup strong. The trait enables one on-page action with tactical consequence: dispersing the chorus by reflecting/scattering. Closure linkage: the page "atomically reflective, catching starlight, becoming a tiny moon." Swappability moderate: "mirror-bright" or "light-scattering" could achieve similar plot effects. Cost connection weak: no visible tradeoff or price tied to the reflectivity itself. Two beats (+0.9), closure (+0.8), but replaceable mechanics and no felt cost prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Action (coexist) is the story's central question: coexist with absence, coexist with extinct-species ghosts, or coexist as solo system with the library's respiration. Signaled early ("learn how a singular creature might coexist with absence itself"), tested at the circle (chorus offers coexistence via haunting), resolved at closure ("two independent systems sharing the same sky, alone together"). The concept redefines options: coexistence does not require merger or partnership; the gryphon can coexist with silence and the library without begging it to speak. Causal pressure across three beats. Irreplaceability high: swap "coexist" for "survive" or "endure" and the thematic weight and final image lose specificity. Cost on page: refusal of easy coexistence, acceptance of solitary resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Method (by the hum of an ancient stone circle) is seeded early (reincarnation memory rippling through the circle beneath the observatory), mechanics shown mid-story (bass note, vibration carrying extinct-species memories, protocol decoded from salt-stained indexes), and outcome dramatized (gryphon steps onto stones, feels the offer, refuses, steps back). The hum shapes the middle attempt: it delivers the temptation that must be refused. Swappability moderate: another mystical conduit (pool, mirror, chant) could deliver memories with similar edits. Setup (+0.6), one beat causal pressure (+0.4), mechanics matter (+0.5), but the method does not return at closure or impose additional cost there.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setting (tidal library above clouds) is established immediately, provides resources (salt-crystal volumes, indexes with protocol, stone circle, blank codex), and constrains the gryphon's choices throughout. The library's tidal respiration mirrors the gryphon's internal rhythm at closure ("she breathed with it, two independent systems sharing the same sky"). Micro-setting elements—sundial, gnomon, highest shelf, cloud-page—enable key actions. Causal role in multiple beats: indexes teach protocol, circle delivers temptation, shelf supplies blank codex. Closure linkage strong: the library's continued breathing and the gryphon's perch enact "alone together." Irreplaceability high: remove the tidal library and the story's logic, tone, and final coexistence image collapse.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe (after the reincarnation memory) is mentioned twice: opening ("egg that had waited three centuries for the reincarnation memory to ripple") and closing ("after the reincarnation memory, beyond the hum"). The phrase anchors backstory and frames the gryphon's singularity but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. No escalation tied to time pressure; the gryphon's choices unfold without deadline. Swappability high: "after the great hatching" or "in the age of solitude" could serve similar framing with minor edits. Setup present, but no causal constraint or closure pressure tied to the timeframe itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Motivation (to translate isolation into independence) is signaled early ("she had come to the library above clouds to translate isolation into independence"), tested at the circle (chorus offers to end isolation via merger; gryphon refuses to preserve independence), and resolved at closure (isolation translated: "Alone" named and wielded, "the grammar of independence," solo flight as proof). The motivation drives every major choice: seeking the library, decoding protocol, refusing the chorus, etching the mark, tearing the page. Friction between want (connection, not being alone) and cost (surrendering singular edges) is dramatized on the page. Causal pressure across all beats. Irreplaceability high: swap this motivation and the story's stakes vanish. Cost visible: continued loneliness, but now resonant and named.</comment>
