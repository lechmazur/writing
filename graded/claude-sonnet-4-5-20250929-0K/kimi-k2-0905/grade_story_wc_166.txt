<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysira's motivation to create an indelible verse is clear and her body memory defying the ban provides internal contradiction. However, the interiority leans heavily on lyric assertion rather than micro-choices under pressure—she circles, dances, and speaks to moonstone dust without encountering meaningful resistance or cost until the verse appears. The final lines about "forever fledged" and walking toward the horizon read as declared transformation rather than earned through on-page struggle. Embodiment is present in the dancing but the stakes feel more thematic than viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and establishes Lysira's goal: to inscribe a forbidden verse on her skin. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of image and the intensification of her dance ritual. Closure arrives when the verse completes and she becomes "the forbidden memory," a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or Charged Poise). The cost is legible: she embodies contraband that censors cannot erase. One tightening occurs when the moonstone dust dims and burns to complete the final line, foreclosing return but anchoring her new state. The method coheres under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The twilight garden is rendered with selective sensory detail—moss warm from day's sigh, dry fountain, dew, night-blooming datura scent—and the setting constrains her midnight work (sunrise would "seal the ink if she faltered"). The moonstone dust functions as micro-setting, orbiting her wrists and inscribing lines. The eastern gate and seawall anchor spatial choreography. The garden's hush and the stars rearranging into her signature charge the final image. Environment and body both shape the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: pen a verse the censors cannot confiscate. Pressure tightens once when the moonstone dust dims and demands sacrifice to complete the stanza, narrowing her window before dawn. Agency is present in her choice to dance the gaps and let the dust inscribe her skin. The resolution—becoming the forbidden memory—feels more like thematic crystallization than a turn driven by on-page conflict; no antagonist or reversal complicates her path. Cost is legible (dust burns out, exile deepens) but the escalation is primarily atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist decisions under opposing force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the nostalgia ban, body memory, and the act of inscribing forbidden verse beneath visibility. The final image—skin singing verses only the tide can read, footprints spiraling into absence—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether memory can survive erasure. Subtext operates in the gap between official history and bodily knowledge. The piece avoids explicit moralizing. Minor slip: "obsidian grace" and "spontaneously anchored" are repeated as labels rather than fully dramatized through fresh particulars at each recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with a controlled register—"day's last sigh," "absence refused to remain empty; it grew teeth." POV remains stable in close third with Lysira's perceptual signature (tide-dancer idiom, moonstone dust as contraband, gaps as memory's hiding place). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the dance intensification. Minor pattern: several lines rely on abstract phrasing ("flavor she knew," "motivation rose like an underground spring") that edges toward poetic assertion rather than concrete perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Compression and patterned elision are taught early and remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Multiple beats, however, exhibit template cadence: "She began by dancing…," "She danced faster…," "She halted…," "She walked…," "She smiled…" across adjacent paragraphs. Overwriting is present in stacked metaphors—"absence refused to remain empty; it grew teeth, chewed at her ankles" followed immediately by "Tonight the air tasted of obsidian grace, smooth and cutting." Filter-verb reliance is moderate ("felt the moment," "understood she had become"). Information density is high but some lines paraphrase: the concept of "fledge" is restated three times without adding new pressure. Apply template-cadence and paraphrase-loop penalties: −0.6 total in Q7, with artifacts touching the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of body memory, forbidden language, and invisible inscription offers a fresh angle on memory-under-censorship. The moonstone dust as contraband grammar and the idea of verses visible only between blinks are specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth is present in exile's double bind. The premise does not closely match generic templates. However, "obsidian grace" and "spontaneously anchored" feel like prompt-driven labels inserted without full dramatization, reducing organic cohesion. Transformation test: the arc is tightly tied to tide-dancing and lunar idiom, lending authenticity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lysira is present throughout and her identity as tide dancer motivates the movement-based inscription. Her choices to circle the fountain, dance the gaps, and chase twilight before dawn drive the sequence. The role is seeded early, shapes her method (dancing rather than writing), and participates in closure (the garden exhales, stars rearrange into "a dancer mid-leap"). Causal pressure is moderate—her skill enables the act but does not create a key turn or obstacle. Cost is tied to her but not uniquely to the "tide dancer" skill.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Moonstone dust appears in paragraph three (contraband from the palace mirror), orbits her wrists mid-scene as "obedient minnows," and draws the silver lines that inscribe the verse. Final grain burns to form the closing period. The object is handled across at least three beats and its depletion (dimming, burning) imposes cost. It enables the inscription and charges the ending. Specificity is high (ground from a mirror that reflected the moon), making it irreplaceable. Strong integration but one beat short of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Elective exile" is named in paragraph four and frames her situation: sentenced to dance propaganda or walk away. It explains her presence in the garden and her need to create something the state cannot confiscate. The concept appears again near the end ("Elective exile had not removed her from the world; it had removed the world from inside her"). It shapes her motivation and the story's central tension but does not constrain a specific on-page choice or tactic—she never weighs returning, hiding, or alternate paths. Lyric reprise at closure reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" is introduced in paragraph six (age seven, shadow glued to breakwater) and echoed in the third inscribed line ("I anchor only in the interval between heartbeats"). The trait is named and thematically linked to her method of dancing gaps, but it does not visibly enable or constrain an on-page action—no moment shows her becoming rooted or freed by this quality. Late in the story, the label reappears without new causal work. Swappable with "unmoored" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Fledge" is seeded in paragraph six (age seven, when her shadow learned to pirouette) and declared as tonight's goal ("she would fledge again, not bones but words"). Mid-scene, her skin begins to fledge—phrases emerging where sweat meets sky. The action defines the climax (verse inscription) and closure ("forever fledged"). It appears across three beats and could not be swapped without rewriting the premise. Cost is visible (dust burns out). Strong causal role; one step short of indispensable because the dance and inscription could be reframed with a different verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is named in paragraph seven as the method: "hush between cricket chords, black river between stars, breath a lover withholds." She then "began by dancing the gaps, soles printing absence into dew." The method is signaled, attempted, and linked to her tide-dancer knowledge of "undertow." It shapes her ritual and the final image (verses visible only when the reader blinks). Two beats, moderate causal pressure, present at closure. Could be reframed as "dancing absence" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The twilight garden is established in the opening line and provides spatial anchors (marble fountain rim, eastern gate, seawall). It supplies the moonstone dust's hiding place and limits her window (sunrise would seal the ink). The garden's hush teaches her "where memory hides" and at closure it exhales, stars rearranging. Micro-setting (her body and the dust) also constrains. The garden pressures timing and charges the final image. Two beats, causal role, closure participation. Essential but not uniquely irreplaceable—another hidden night setting could serve.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After the nostalgia ban" anchors the timeframe in paragraph two and explains why memory is forbidden. The ban creates the premise and her need for invisible inscription. It does not impose a live countdown within the scene (dawn approaches but is not tracked beat-by-beat). The ban appears again near the end ("dictators of nostalgia") as the antagonist she evades. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but cost is not uniquely tied to "after" versus "during."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in paragraph nine ("to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin—her own—inkless, scarless") and drives the entire sequence. She circles the fountain, dances, and commands the moonstone dust to "braid a verse across her ribs." Four lines are inscribed, each named on the page. The goal is tested (dust dims, demands sacrifice) and achieved (verses complete, she becomes the forbidden memory). Desire is dramatized across multiple beats and shapes closure. Cost is visible. Strong integration; one friction: the motivation is told in summary before being enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" is named in paragraph six ("Tonight the air tasted of obsidian grace, smooth and cutting"), appears in the first inscribed line ("etched in living dusk"), and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("obsidian grace cutting her face into a crescent moon"). The tone—dark, sharp, ritualized—is coherent and modulates with the dance's intensification. It charges the final image. Three touches, purposeful reprise. One friction: the phrase is used as a label more than embodied through fresh sensory particulars at each recurrence. Setup, development, closure all present.</comment>
