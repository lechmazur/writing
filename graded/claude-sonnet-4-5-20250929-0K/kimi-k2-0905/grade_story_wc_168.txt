<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to translate pain is embodied through concrete actions—placing ash on tongue, drawing the spiral—but the internal experience leans heavily on poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The backstory (ridge fire, girl's death) anchors present action and the final choice to visit the survivors' group forecloses isolation with visible cost. However, interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the mind's darker forest where every tree was a question") that risks distancing the reader from immediate embodied struggle, and the emotional progression feels more curated than credibly irrational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through ritual gestures (opening box, tasting ash, drawing spiral) that deepen the stake of speaking versus silence, and the closure—leaving the box open, descending lighter, committing to the survivors' group—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to commitment) with felt cost (innocence bargained is never returned). Orientation anchors (Elias, moonlit ridge, three years post-fire) arrive cleanly within the first third. One friction: the celestial bodies and "bargain" motif remain somewhat abstract and the causal linkage between tasting ash and the decision to speak relies more on lyric accumulation than because/therefore steps, which is acceptable under this lens but prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, granite dish, and porcelain box constrain and charge the ritual: moonlight projects the cracked pattern onto his scar, the granite becomes an altar for the spiral drawing, and the ridge's geography (narrow path, remembered rescue site) anchors each beat. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("pines still smelled of last summer's burn," "tears salt-washing the burn ridges"), filtered through Elias's firefighter lens. The micro-setting (box, granite, moonlight interplay) drives the final image and the spiral's projection into the valley, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: speak the pain versus swallow it in silence. The piece tightens through one meaningful deepening—tasting the ash transforms it into ink, enabling the spiral drawing—that narrows Elias's options from silent carrying to active testimony. The final commitment (visiting survivors' group, showing the inked spiral) forecloses the path of mute endurance with on-page cost (he is "not forgiven" but "commissioned"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, but no sharp reversal tests commitment; the escalation reads more as ritual unfolding than a choice under competing pressures, keeping this in mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—transforming private suffering into shared language—emerges organically from Elias's ritual actions and the final image of the spiral visible to "anyone awake at 3 a.m. hurting and wordless." The piece resists didacticism; the girl's face invites rather than accuses, and the ending offers a resonant image (ash-water spiral, forest sprout) without stating a moral. One slip: "hard softness of speaking every scar until it becomes a sentence someone else can read without burning" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, articulating the premise a bit too directly when the spiral image already carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, metaphor-dense, and controlled through most beats ("silver scar," "fire writes in verbs too quick to read"). Psychic distance remains stable in tight third with Elias's perceptual signature (firefighter idiom, pain as language). However, register drifts into elevated diction under peak pressure ("celestial bodies performed their slow dance," "hard softness," "syllable by blistered syllable") that risks sounding authored rather than interior to a scarred ex-firefighter. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose occasionally prioritizes lyricism over immediacy, and some metaphors stack without adding pressure ("the ridge dissolved into the mind's darker forest where every tree was a question").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid, but density becomes a liability in high-pressure beats: "the moment innocence became currency spent in smoke," "reflecting deeply until the ridge dissolved into the mind's darker forest," and "hard softness" recur as abstract intensifiers without concrete anchoring. Template cadence appears in paired constructions ("instead of a pulaski…instead of water," "not accusing but inviting"). Paraphrase loop: the notion of translating pain into language is restated across multiple paragraphs without new pressure. Mixed metaphor: "fire writes in verbs" pairs uneasily with "every tree was a question." These artifacts touch the closure third, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of firefighter guilt, ritual ash-dispersal, and pain-as-language offers a fresh angle on survivor testimony. The porcelain box as vessel and the spiral as signal are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the "bargained innocence" frame and the celestial-witness motif lean on familiar redemption-arc scaffolding without fully transforming them through lived occupational detail (the pulaski is named but not used; firefighting procedure remains abstract). The piece commits to its lyric premise but the metaphoric density sometimes substitutes for grounded particulars, keeping this in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, and his choices—tasting ash, drawing the spiral, leaving the box open, descending to visit the group—create every key turn. Setup: first paragraph. Development: tasting ash, speaking aloud, crying and drawing. Payoff: descent and commitment to survivors' group. The scar and firefighter past constrain his perception and tactics. His agency drives closure with visible cost (commissioned, not forgiven). Strong causal and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The porcelain box appears in beats across the arc: cradled at opening, opened to reveal ash, warmed by moonlight, fracture projects pattern onto scar, left open at closure. Setup: second paragraph. Development: warming, fracture-as-lens. Payoff: left open, ash emptied into spiral. The crack's interaction with moonlight enables the scar-alignment image, and leaving it open signals the shift from containment to dispersal. Essential to closure and charged at the end.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "bargain" named in paragraph five ("the bargain had been struck that night"). Development: "innocence once bargained is never returned" reappears near the end. Payoff: final paragraph acknowledges "paid interest on the bargain." The concept frames the guilt stake and shapes Elias's sense of irrevocable cost, but it functions more as thematic overlay than a mechanic that narrows on-page choices. Removing "bargain" language would leave the guilt-to-testimony arc intact. Present across beats, but replaceable with "debt" or "price" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Gently skilled" appears once in a late paragraph describing his words ("gentle yet skilled, shaped like the lullabies his mother once hummed"). Setup: absent early. Development: not invoked in prior choices. Payoff: the phrase modifies speech cadence at closure but does not constrain action or create cost. The trait is told rather than shown through on-page technique, and swapping "gentle yet skilled" for "careful" or "practiced" would not alter the arc. Late, ornamental, and swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's goal is to enlighten others by illuminating his own wound. Setup: signaled in paragraph four ("to enlighten others he must first illuminate the wound"). Development: speaking aloud to the ridge, crying, drawing the spiral all enact enlightenment-as-testimony. Payoff: the spiral projected into the valley as a signal, commitment to the survivors' group. The action defines the arc and redefines his stance from silent to testimonial. Essential; removing "enlighten" dissolves the central turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "reflecting deeply" named in paragraph six. Development: internal questioning ("Why did you turn left…"), then tears and spiral-drawing emerge after reflection. Payoff: the method enables the ink-from-ash transition and the final image. However, "reflecting" is told more than dramatized—no on-page mechanics distinguish it from generic thought. The method is present and contributes to closure, but the specificity is low and it could be replaced with "remembering" or "contemplating" with minor edits. Present across beats but moderately swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path anchors every beat: narrow path tests footing, granite dish holds moonlight and becomes altar, ridge geography (rescue site memory) pressures Elias's ritual. Setup: opening line. Development: path narrowing forces the stop, granite enables projection. Payoff: moonlight prints spiral into valley, Elias descends the path lighter. The setting constrains action (narrow path, specific granite dish) and charges the final image. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup: "celestial bodies performed their slow dance" in paragraph five. Payoff: "celestial bodies resuming their slow dance, satisfied" in the penultimate paragraph. The timeframe is poetic but does not constrain decisions—no clock pressure, no tactical urgency tied to planetary conjunction. The phrase frames atmosphere but is swappable with "deep night" or "midnight" without altering choices. Present at open and close but ornamental; no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: motivation stated in paragraph four ("the wish to translate pain into a universal language"). Development: speaking aloud, crying as "small dictionary entry," drawing spiral as translation all dramatize the desire. Payoff: inked spiral and commitment to survivors' group enact the translation. The motivation is told early and then performed through ritual gestures, creating friction between private grief and public testimony (leaving box open vs. keeping ash). Visible cost ("not forgiven") charges the final choice. Essential and costly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "hard softness" first appears describing the girl's eyes, then Elias's mirror reflection (paragraph three). Development: recurs describing his future speech to survivors ("hard softness of speaking every scar"). Payoff: tone modulates from solitary ritual to communal witness, and the oxymoron charges the ending (sprout through fire-crust as "first word in the forest's reply"). The tone is coherent and reweighted at closure, but "hard softness" as a phrase is somewhat abstract and replaceable with "tender strength" or similar. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake; eligible for mid-6s under the allowance.</comment>
