<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marrow as a character remains largely opaque; her trait of weaving truth carefully is stated but never demonstrated through a meaningful on-page choice with visible cost. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves through dream logic without embodied struggle or competing impulses. The drowned passengers exist as atmospheric voices rather than pressure sources, and no secondary character applies immediate resistance that would force Marrow to reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation debt is severe: by 120 words we have a dream within a dive, melted snow globe appearing from nowhere, and no clear anchor for who/where/when in the waking frame. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout—accumulative texture competes with causal quest logic, neither fully cohering. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (knowledge that wreckage cradles light) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; the globe's "pure thing" and her teaching future-self are tell-only abstractions. The midpoint shrine sequence introduces new mechanics (candles, air-corridor) without earned setup, and the ending conflates multiple closure gestures (mirror, future vision, meltwater footprints) that dilute rather than sharpen the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glacier-shrine setting is vivid and specific (candles burning cold, ice walls, ballroom ghosts in rime), and the original snow globe encased in unfrozen water at the heart constrains the quest spatially. However, spatial choreography breaks: the submerged tent, shrine location, corridor to the ship's heart, and surface return are never coherently mapped, creating impossible distances. The setting does charge the final image (meltwater footprints, snow-placed globe), lifting the score into mid-6s despite the logistical gaps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvage something pure—is declared but never tested by a meaningful on-page choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The glacier "answers with silence, then with a single crack" is coincidental opening rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Marrow's journey through the wreck involves no tactical trade-offs, no loss of resource or stamina, and no moral calculus; the drowned passengers guide rather than oppose. The ending gesture (placing the globe on snow, walking away) carries no legible price—she retains the knowledge, the future vision, and the ability to return, making the renunciation ceremonial rather than costly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—wreckage cradling light, collective sorrow as tapestry—emerges through image (melted globe, shrine, passengers dissolving into glitter) but is undercut by direct thematic statement in the final paragraphs ("the knowledge that even wreckage can cradle light" and "truth carefully balanced between what was lost and what was saved"). The cameo-dream concept hints at deeper currents but remains ornamental; the story never dramatizes how analyzing these appearances exposes the glacier's secret. The snow globe's miniature-shrine recursion is a vivid symbolic choice, yet the piece leans toward allegory without narrative cost, making resonance more asserted than earned.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and textured—"borrowed starlight," "glacier groaned like a sleeping whale," "hymn that tasted like salt and forgiveness"—with purposeful compression and lyric patterning throughout. Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited, and perceptual signature (dream logic, ghost-medium idiom) is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("windows of connection," "collective sorrow," "tapestry whose pattern") that feels more thematic than character-particular under pressure. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("the future she is still weaving") blurs the line between Marrow's perception and authorial gloss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but often stacked without causal progression: "folded inside a glacier like a secret," "memories floated like jellyfish," "love letters had fused into a single diamond of ink," "dissolved into glitter." Template cadence appears in the middle third (repeated "past X, past Y" structure). Paraphrase loop: "weaves truth carefully; she never lies, but she never tells the whole story" is immediately glossed as "ghosts are fragile and the living are worse," restating caution without added pressure. The closure beat escapes major artifact contamination, preventing deeper penalty, but cumulative loop/scaffold issues across beats lower the score. Information density is uneven—vivid images often serve atmosphere rather than advancing causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The wreck-diver ghost whisperer frame and glacier-shrine setting offer fresh synthesis, and the melted-versus-intact snow globe recursion (miniature shrine inside the globe inside the shrine) is conceptually bold. However, the cameo-dream method—analyzing recurring faces across strangers' dreams—is introduced as premise but never operationalized; Marrow's three nights "analyzing" consist of watching candle-windows rather than tracing dream patterns. The story's emotional arc (salvage purity, release passengers, teach future diver) follows a familiar quest-and-knowledge-transfer template without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in structure (dream-within-dive, lyric recursion) is present but does not fully cohere with the quest mechanics, leaving the piece inventive in texture but derivative in emotional journey.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Marrow appears in all major beats but her choices are passive: she follows memories, lifts the globe when it is revealed, and places it on snow without opposition. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. The character is present and observes extensively but does not drive reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in the opening dream, sits beside her thermal bag at waking, reacts in the shrine by projecting fragments, and is mirrored by the intact globe at the heart. The final beat places the "pure globe" on snow and the melted globe "formed a perfect mirror of ice." Two distinct uses (shrine projection, final mirror transformation) with reweighted meaning at closure, but the globe's mechanics remain opaque and it does not constrain a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is named early and recurs thematically (thin places, memory leaks, windows sealing, flakes as tiny windows in the final image) but never shapes an on-page tactic or alters Marrow's options. The concept functions as atmospheric metaphor rather than narrative constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated in paragraph four but never demonstrated through a scene choice where withholding or partial truth imposes cost or enables progress. The trait remains label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Expose" is the stated mission (expose what the glacier swallowed) and structures the quest, but the act of exposing—analyzing cameo appearances—occurs off-page during "three nights" summarized in one sentence. The major turn (finding the intact globe) results from following floating memories rather than analytic work, making the action swappable with a more generic "discover."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Analyzing cameo appearances is described as the method ("she must analyze these cameo appearances, trace how the same faces surface") but the mechanics are never shown. The three nights in the shrine involve lighting candles and watching windows, not tracing dream patterns. The method is stated as setup but does not shape middle or closure beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glacier-shrine setting is introduced early (dream in paragraph five, physical arrival by paragraph twelve), provides resources (candles, ice walls, corridor of air pockets), and charges the final image (miniature shrine glowing inside the globe, meltwater footprints). The shrine's spatial properties—splitting to reveal a corridor, encasing the unfrozen sphere—enable the climactic discovery. Setting drives at least two beats and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation to "salvage something pure" is stated by the drowned passengers in paragraph three, drives the quest structure, and is fulfilled when Marrow lifts the intact globe and carries the knowledge forward. However, the desire is never internally conflicted—no competing want or cost forces a trade-off. The friction exists between ghost need and glacier resistance, not within Marrow's hierarchy of values, limiting the motivation's dramatic charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears in the opening dream frame, recurs in the shrine ("borrowed starlight dimming as dawn filtered"), and closes the piece ("watches borrowed starlight flicker across the snow"). The tone of luminous melancholy and second-hand radiance is coherent throughout and modulates with the rising pressure of descent and the quiet release of the ending. The recurring image reweights the dominant stake (salvaging light from wreckage) and charges the final beat, meeting the lyric-resonance standard for mid-6s.</comment>
