<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's professional meticulousness translates into character-specific perceptual filtering (wind shear "to the third decimal"), and her motivation to preserve data integrity drives the lateral escape and underground recording. The choice to write backward-dated entries and release counter-evidence via pigeon shows agency under pressure with visible cost (staying underground until contradictions overflow). Minor weakness: the follower remains abstract, limiting relational pressure. Internal contradiction between solitary integrity and the need for a "lateral chain" creates authentic tension at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Elara, courtyard, dusk, three-year routine). The piece operates under a Hybrid lens: causal pressure (follower forces lateral move) escalates into accumulative/textural closure where the underground log and released scrolls reconfigure the quarantine from disease-containment to truth-suppression. Closure lands on-page with visible cost: Elara forgoes surface life until "screens overflow," an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid that forecloses normal return. One tightening (vellum discovery → descent → counter-log) is sufficient for this length; the cost of solitude is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gargoyle's eye, pneumatic shaft, and phosphorescent lichen-map constrain Elara's lateral escape and provide underground navigation, directly shaping tactics. Sensory hierarchy filters through her professional attention (wet limestone, pigeon feathers as "proof"). The courtyard's dry fountain and cloister arcade anchor spatial choreography; the shaft's descent replaces dusk murmur with "layered tranquility," charging the ending's rain-tasting image. Minor cap: the "forgotten pneumatic layers" could use one more concrete anchor to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (data integrity vs. state censorship) is signaled early and escalates through the forged vellum dated tomorrow, the follower's pressure, and the revelation that Zone 9 quarantines truth rather than disease. Elara's agency drives the tightening: she chooses descent over compliance, writes backward-dated counter-logs, and releases them laterally—each choice narrows options and raises cost. The final decision to stay underground "until screens overflow" forecloses her prior routine with visible price. Coincidence (pigeon arrival) complicates but does not resolve; the resolution is earned by her counter-recording and patient stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. state-sanctioned fiction, solitude as integrity's crucible) emerges through concrete particulars: raw weather data smoothed into "gentle forecasts," the rogue zone as ghost-double, backward scrolls as counter-censorship network. The closing image—unrecorded rain, tasting "silvered proof"—resonates without stating a moral; weather/conscience as unquarrantine-able is earned by prior action. Minor slip: "integrity in solitude" and "lateral chain" risk slight abstraction, though the pigeon-network and underground log keep it grounded. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; closure reweights premise cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited with stable psychic distance; diction ("bruised into violet," "credibly curious nature," "reflex that made her note wind shear to the third decimal") roots voice in Elara's professional idiom. Perceptual signature is character-specific (meteorological precision filters sensory detail). Minor density slip: "the hush felt borrowed, as though someone had paused the world and forgotten to press play" reads slightly elevated for crisis narration, and "silvered proof" risks decorative abstraction. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches her knowledge throughout. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (vellum content, lichen-map function, pigeon-circuit proof compressed efficiently). Minor loop: "solitude" appears four times across the piece, twice in close proximity without functional shift—apply paraphrase-loop deduction (−0.2). Stock metaphor: "Ice traced her spine" is a bodily cliché without embodied specificity. "Layered tranquility of earth breathing" and "silvered proof" tilt decorative in peak beats, risking slight overwriting. Clarity and propulsion otherwise strong; no template cadence or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarantine-as-truth-suppression premise and backward-dated counter-logs offer a fresh synthesis of surveillance/data-integrity material. The lateral-escape method (via gargoyle panel into pneumatic shaft) and pigeon-as-clandestine-network are specific, non-obvious solutions rooted in world logic. Minor familiarity: meteorologist-versus-censorship echoes climate-data-integrity debates; the piece personalizes it through Elara's three-year ritual and the forged-handwriting twist. Risk-taking (phosphorescent lichen-map, releasing scrolls before surfacing) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; the conceptual integrity (weather cannot be quarantined) is followed through to the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's meticulous nature drives the kneeling observation (waiting instead of startling), the calibration of instruments underground, and the decision to write counter-logs backward-dated to tomorrow. Her professional reflex (noting "wind shear to the third decimal") shapes perception and tactics across three beats (courtyard, descent, underground log). Choice to release pigeon-scrolls and stay underground until "screens overflow" creates key turns with visible cost. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The message tube appears in three functional beats: arrival with crimson thread (setup), Elara loosening it to read the forged vellum (inciting discovery), and her repurposing it to carry backward-dated counter-logs (closure action). The tube's shift from incoming threat-vector to outgoing integrity-network reweights its meaning at the ending. Specificity (silver tube, crimson thread lashing) and causal pressure (tube enables both the forgery and the counter-move) make removal structural. Strong integration; one more mid-scene handling detail could push higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Zone 9 shapes stakes (breach warning on vellum), reveals the central conflict (quarantine contains truth, not disease), and provides the underground setting where Elara records uncensored data. The lichen-map overlays "official city grid like a ghost double," making the zone's function legible and tactical. Present in setup (vellum mention), development (lichen revelation), and closure (staying until contradictions overflow). Removing it breaks the story's logic. Could score higher with one more on-page constraint tied to zone boundaries affecting a micro-choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is demonstrated on-page: Elara waits and watches the pigeon instead of startling it, enabling her to receive the vellum. This trait enables the inciting discovery and aligns with her three-year calibration ritual (patient observation). Present in setup and one key choice. Cost is modest (delay before reading message); the trait does not constrain later choices or reappear at closure. Solid functional use; lacks the friction or reprise needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara "intuited the next move" appears only in the penultimate paragraph, summarizing her decision to stay underground rather than dramatizing the reasoning in scene. The action is present at closure but arrives late and is told rather than shown through embodied hesitation or micro-choice. The cost (waiting until dawn, carrying "nothing but quiet certainty") is legible. Late first appearance (−0.5) and summary-only use (−0.5) prevent higher score. If "intuit" had been seeded earlier or dramatized as a felt process, integration would strengthen.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Progressing laterally" is signaled early ("proceed laterally" in the vellum) and dramatized in two beats: Elara's physical move along the cloister wall to the gargoyle panel, and her conceptual counter-move (lateral chain of recorders vs. vertical hierarchy susceptible to "single arrest"). The method shapes both escape tactics and thematic closure. Mechanics matter: the ivy-latticed wall and panel provide the means; the lateral network charges the ending. Specificity and causal pressure across setup, middle, and closure make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard provides the stage for pigeon arrival, discovery, and Elara's decision to move laterally via the gargoyle panel. Spatial elements (flagstones, dry fountain, cloister arcade, ivy-latticed wall) enable choreography and the hidden shaft entrance. Present in setup and inciting choice. Weakness: once Elara descends, the courtyard's pressure ends; the underground lichen-map and shaft do more tactical work at closure. Solid early integration; to score higher, the courtyard's features would need to constrain or charge the final image directly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After being followed home" is present in one sentence ("confirming that she had been followed home from the meteorological archive") and motivates the lateral escape rather than forward movement through the gate. The timeframe tightens the decision (immediate threat) but does not track as a live clock across beats. Present in setup and implied at closure (staying until dawn), but the follower remains abstract and time is not dramatized as escalating pressure during descent or underground recording. Functional use; lacks the continuous tightening needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to nurture integrity in solitude" is dramatized across three beats: her three-year evening calibration ritual (setup), the flare "like a lantern in wind" when she realizes falsified data would make "every storm a lie" (inciting choice), and the final seated moment where "solitude complete yet populated by every honest storm" charges the ending. The motivation directly drives her counter-log choice and the decision to stay underground. Friction is visible: integrity requires isolation, yet she releases scrolls to a lateral network—want vs. method creates authentic tension. Strong integration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone opens with "quiet courtyard," "hush felt borrowed," and "world paused," establishing tranquility. It modulates under pressure: "Ice traced her spine" (discovery), "murmur of dusk disappeared" (descent), "layered tranquility of earth breathing" (underground), and returns charged at closure ("hush that followed," tasting rain in quiet certainty). The tone shapes perception and charges the final image where solitude and release coexist. Coherent across turns; to reach higher bands, the tone would need to constrain a choice or appear as an obstacle the protagonist navigates, rather than primarily coloring atmosphere.</comment>
