<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is anchored in concrete professional expertise (seven years mapping the labyrinth, trained ear identifying walks), but her motivations remain largely reactive—she responds to the stranger rather than pursuing a visible goal of her own. The stranger's walk is identified ("short strides, weight on the balls of the feet"), yet this attribute never constrains or enables an on-page choice with cost; it's label-only observation. Internal contradiction is minimal; Mira moves from wariness to collaboration without visible friction or trade-off, flattening the arc into smooth consensus.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a hybrid lens (situational pressure of the storm/labyrinth meeting + accumulative discovery pattern). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly: geomagnetic storm, port labyrinth, Mira as maintenance worker. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the labyrinth reweights from storage system to acoustic whisper network—but the conceptual cost remains abstract; no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a path with felt consequence. The "prove it worked" motivation lands as thematic declaration rather than earned dramatic pressure, and the Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where Mira or the stranger pays a visible price at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly anchored with concrete sensory detail (corrugated corridors, rusted walls, harmonic frequencies during the storm) and charged by the geomagnetic interference that disables GPS. Spatial choreography is clean through the seven-corridor star junction. The environment constrains one choice—Mira's reliance on hand-drawn maps and memory—but the constraint is setup rather than a pivot; once inside, the labyrinth becomes stage rather than active pressure. The final chamber and resonating containers charge the ending image, lifting the score into mid-7s despite limited tactical friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the whisper network's existence—is declared late and remains abstract; no on-page cost or trade-off tests commitment. The stranger's arrival complicates Mira's routine, but escalation is minimal: they walk, reach the panel, speak three words, and the door opens without struggle or sacrifice. The "calculated spontaneity" tone implies rising pressure, yet the stranger's key and knowledge arrive as convenient solutions rather than earned reversals. Agency is mostly observational; Mira's map-reading and the stranger's coin placement are acts of revelation, not choice under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—"secrets travel farther when spoken softly"—is woven into the acoustic labyrinth premise and the whisper network's wartime history, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate beat. The grandmother's inheritance and zodiac coins ground the abstraction in concrete particulars. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic echo: "sometimes the quietest voices travel farthest" restates the premise without a non-literal image to reweight it, and the resonance arises more from setup than from Mira's arc or a charged cost. The piece invites reflection but the ending leans explanatory rather than earning wisdom through dramatic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature is professional and sensory (tracking footsteps by rhythm, vibrations through container walls). Voice is consistent, though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("calculated spontaneity of the moment," "layers of emotion that seemed to echo"). Dialogue carries subtext in the whisper exchanges and reads naturally goal-driven, but the grandmother's explanation and Mira's responses are functional rather than character-distinct. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with the storm's intensification, though peak-beat diction sometimes favors poetic gloss over embodied immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong, with vivid sensory anchors (violet ribbons, metallic whisper, aurora's light) and clean sequencing. However, several craft issues accumulate: paraphrase loops appear ("whispers travel farther than shouts" recurs three times with minimal variation; "the woman" is repeated as a sentence subject across adjacent lines), template cadence in exposition ("She unfolded... A metallic whisper... Mira's trained ear..."), and elevated diction that clashes with Mira's blue-collar expertise ("calculated spontaneity," "harmonic frequencies" used as poetic gloss rather than technical precision). Information density is adequate but scaffold sentences like "They walked in deliberate silence" add little. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping deduction per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, but the patterns prevent entry to high bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The acoustic-labyrinth premise offers a fresh synthesis of urban industrial setting and wartime whisper network, and the geomagnetic storm as catalyst is non-obvious. However, the execution leans on familiar "hidden history revealed by inheritance" scaffolding without transforming the emotional or moral calculus; Mira's maps and the stranger's key align too smoothly, and the ending's thematic clarity borders on tidy resolution rather than earned complexity. The sensory particulars (zodiac coins, triangular key, harmonic resonance) distinguish the piece from pure template, but the core arc—stranger arrives with artifact, protagonist guides them to secret chamber—reads as a competent genre exercise rather than a bold synthesis with narrative risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her professional expertise (maps, trained ear, labyrinth knowledge) enables the journey to the chamber. However, her choices are reactive facilitation rather than pivot points: she responds to the stranger's request, leads the way using existing knowledge, and observes the revelation. No decision alters her tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Setup and development gates are met (present early, guides the middle action), but closure participation is observational—she picks up a coin and realizes the maps were incomplete, a realization rather than a choice. The element is functional but does not drive key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears early (stranger holds it, reflects aurora light in twelve symbols) and recurs at closure (placed in the constellation center, triggering the chamber's pulse). It shapes one key turn—signaling the whisper network's celestial alignment logic—and charges the final image with inherited meaning. However, its mechanics remain decorative; the coin is described and placed but never handled in a way that alters tactics or imposes cost. Two beats (initial reveal, final placement) with closure linkage and thematic resonance place it in mid-5s, but swappability (any inherited talisman could serve similar function with minor edits) and lack of causal pressure prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Folded maps are established immediately ("hand-drawn maps, their creases forming a topography") and used twice: to guide navigation when GPS fails and to locate the sealed maintenance door. The maps constrain Mira's tactics (reliance on analog memory vs. digital systems) and their incompleteness becomes the closure realization—"her maps had been incomplete... wasn't meant to be navigated by sight, but by sound." Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. The maps enable the middle journey and are reweighted at the end with conceptual cost (professional expertise revealed as partial). Causal pressure is moderate—the maps guide but do not create pivotal friction—and specificity is strong (creases as topography, "particularly worn section"). This exact element is necessary to the ending's thematic repricing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The walk-identification trait is mentioned once in detail ("short strides, weight on the balls of the feet, a hesitation before each turn") and used to deduce the stranger's unfamiliarity. It is then noted again in summary ("Mira studied the woman's walk... educated gait, probably academic"). The attribute establishes Mira's professional acuity but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost; the stranger's walk is observed, not leveraged in a choice. Setup gate is met (early signal), but development and payoff are absent—it does not shape a middle turn or return at closure. Ornamental use without causal pressure or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "challenge" appears in the middle third as exposition: "Three whispers in the right sequence, at the right junction, can open passages that shouting never could." It motivates the journey to the star junction and frames the final act (the stranger speaks three words in maritime code, the panel opens). Setup is late but present by midpoint; development and payoff are met (shapes the chamber unlock). However, the challenge is told rather than dramatized—no failed attempt, no visible cost of misuse, no tactical adaptation. The three-word sequence is performed once, successfully, with no friction. Swappability is moderate (any acoustic ritual could serve), and causal pressure is soft (the challenge enables the ending but does not create earned reversals). Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The triangular brass key is introduced in the middle third ("teeth worn smooth by time... unusual triangular shape") and used at closure when the stranger holds it "like a tuning fork" while speaking the code. Setup is late (second third), capping at 4.6. Development is minimal—the key's mechanics are told ("responds to sound, not metal") but not tested or adapted. Payoff is present (held during the final unlock), but the key's role is passive staging rather than active constraint; the spoken code, not the key itself, triggers the opening. The dozen similar keys in the revealed chamber retroactively lower the original key's uniqueness. Late arrival, ornamental staging, and lack of causal pressure despite closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is established in the opening line and remains the primary pressure throughout: towering corridors, rusted walls, GPS failure forcing analog navigation, acoustic properties that amplify whispers. The setting supplies resources (Mira's maps, seven-corridor star junction) and constraints (darkness, solar interference, metal canyons) that shape every choice. The geomagnetic storm charges the sensory layer (violet ribbons, electrical hum) and triggers the harmonic resonance at closure. All three gates are met (setup, development, closure). The labyrinth is irreplaceable—remove it and the story's logic, stakes, and thematic repricing collapse. Strong causal pressure, multiple beat involvement, and closure linkage justify high-7s scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is present from the opening line, disables GPS to force Mira's hand-drawn maps, and intensifies at closure to trigger the container resonance and panel opening. Setup and payoff gates are met; the storm's escalation coincides with narrative pressure. However, the timeframe remains atmospheric rather than a live ticking clock—no countdown, no deadline that alters tactics, no visible cost if they delay. The storm complicates (GPS failure) and enables (harmonic frequencies unlock the chamber), but does not tighten decisions through temporal constraint. Development is moderate (the storm's interference shapes the middle journey), and closure linkage is strong (the surge opens the panel). The element is essential to mechanics but functions as backdrop intensifier rather than a temporal vise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is stated late (final third: "She wanted me to prove it worked") and remains the stranger's inherited goal rather than Mira's lived desire. Mira's own stake is never dramatized—she facilitates the stranger's quest without visible want or fear in friction. Setup is absent until the ending explanation; development shows the collaborative journey but no conflicting pulls; payoff is thematic declaration rather than earned choice with cost. The whisper theme is woven throughout the setting and action, but the character motivation itself is told, belated, and uncontested. Late signal, summary-only dramatization, and lack of on-page friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone is anchored in the opening ("calculated spontaneity of the moment") and sustained through Mira's professional wariness meeting the stranger's purpose-driven arrival, blending procedural control with discovery's charge. The tone modulates as the storm intensifies and the whisper exchanges grow "clearer," supporting the acoustic-magic atmosphere. However, "calculated spontaneity" itself is abstract and under-embodied in the prose; the story demonstrates carefulness and mounting wonder more than a taut spontaneity-under-design. The tone is coherent and purposeful but not sharply distinctive or irreplaceable—swap in "charged discovery" or "restrained wonder" and the beats read similarly. Setup (early signal), development (modulates with pressure), and payoff (tone charges the harmonic-resonance ending) are all met, placing it in mid-5s with credit for coherence but capped by moderate specificity and replaceability.</comment>
