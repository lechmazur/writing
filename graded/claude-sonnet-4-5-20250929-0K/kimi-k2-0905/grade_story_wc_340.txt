<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's curiosity is consistently portrayed through concrete actions—gathering pages methodically, tracing symbols, humming notes—and her progression from servant to agency-bearing actor is embodied rather than declared. The captain remains a cipher whose smile and wager are told rather than dramatized, limiting his impact on present tension. Minor interiority phrases like "she felt the goggles translate" skirt abstraction but anchor quickly in sensory detail. The final renunciation ("a servant no longer ascending but expanding") carries visible cost—she chooses roots over mobility—but the choice feels more lyric declaration than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches a pattern of scattered artifacts (goggles, pages, cipher, map, seed) that accumulate and reconfigure meaning by the ending. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Lira, elevator, tenth floor, captain's death a week prior). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lira plants the seed and remains below, forgoing ascent with visible cost—she trades her servant trajectory for rootedness. The cost is legible in "watering the future with melted ice" and "no longer ascending but expanding." One minor friction: the diary lock clicking open "as if the book itself had waited" introduces light convenience, though the prior accumulation of cipher-work earns much of the payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vividly anchored with frost-lensed floors, cold iron corridors, and a broken glass dome through which snow drifts. Sensory detail is purposeful: engine-oil and bergamot, humid apricot air, melted ice. The sub-basement hothouse—warm, iron-barred, skylight-lit—directly contrasts the spire's cold and constrains Lira's final choice by offering a hidden refuge that validates the captain's wager. The goggles function as micro-setting, translating dimness into scattered light that charges the ending image. Spatial choreography across ten floors, five, two, and sub-basement remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Lira seeks to understand why the captain smiled—implicitly, to find the joy beneath his death. The diary discovery tightens options by revealing the map and seed, and her choice to descend and plant rather than report forecloses her servant path with on-page cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the goggles reveal the cipher, then again when the map and seed reconfigure her understanding. Coincidence—the gust that unlocks the diary—feels borderline convenient, though the prior cipher work mitigates it. The price (remaining below, trading mobility for rootedness) is visible and scaled appropriately to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of joy smuggled into sorrow's fortress emerges through particulars: the apricot tree, the captain's wager, Lira's laughter "with scattered light." The ending reweights prior material—her ascent becomes descent, service becomes rootedness—without stating a moral. Minor weakness: "affectionately detached from the grief" in the penultimate paragraph approaches direct thematic statement rather than letting the action and image carry it. The goggles and seed motifs constrain choice and charge the closure, avoiding token recurrence. The final image of "roots and branches alike" offers resonance but skirts the edge of overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: Lira notices with a servant's methodical care ("arrayed the pages…aligning edges") and her sensory filter (bergamot, frost, scattered light) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and lyric ("frost-lensed heartbeat," "anguish dressed in confetti") without breaking focalization. The single brief line of dialogue—"the music faltered when she smiled"—is implied action rather than spoken, maintaining distance. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during key moments (goggles warming, laughter). No filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across the piece. Information density is high—nearly every line advances discovery or deepens atmosphere. Minor template cadence appears in the "On floor X" parallel structure (floors five and two), though it serves a clear mosaic function and remains brief. One paraphrase near the end: "affectionately detached from the grief that had brought her here, yet tethered to the joy now germinating" restates the core tension without new pressure, costing ~0.2. Figurative language ("joy disguised as ornament, anguish dressed in confetti") is dense but coherent and voice-consistent. No loops or scaffolding that obscure causality; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of icebound spire, encrypted diary solved through goggles, and hidden hothouse offers a fresh synthesis. The captain's wager—jumping to scatter joy's seed—transforms the suicide trope through specific world logic (apricot tree, molten heat, wind as delivery). Lira's choice to remain below rather than report inverts the servant-ascends arc with earned specificity. Minor proximity concern: "joy smuggled into sorrow's fortress" and the broader emotional calculus echo familiar poetic territory, though the execution through concrete objects (goggles, seed, coal ash) particularizes it. The transformation test holds: the arc depends on these exact elements and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira (ascending servant) is present throughout and drives all key turns: retrieving the goggles, solving the cipher, descending to plant the seed, choosing to remain below. Setup clear in paragraph one. Development across multiple beats (cipher discovery, map reading, hothouse descent). Payoff: her final choice to stay and "expand" rather than ascend is causally earned and closes the arc. Visible cost: she forecloses her upward mobility. High causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable given the class-mobility theme.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The goggles appear in beat one (polishing tray), return in beat two (refract cipher through left lens), are worn in beat three (tint amber, resolve musical staff), warm in beat four (fogging with breath, understanding the wager), and are strapped around her neck "like a promise" before the descent. Development: the goggles enable cipher-solving (middle choice). Payoff: they translate the hothouse's dimness into scattered light, directly shaping the ending image. Three distinct beats; causal enabling; closure linkage. Minor swappability: another optical device could theoretically serve, but the captain's bergamot scent and the specific left-lens projection make them irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is discovered in beat two, its cipher solved via goggles and page-alignment in beat three, and its map/seed payoff drives the final descent. Setup by ~30%. Development: solving the diary constrains Lira's next choice (descend vs. report). Payoff: the seed taped inside the back cover is planted, closing the loop. Two gates solidly met (development, payoff); setup slightly delayed but functional. Causal pressure moderate—solving the diary enables the map but does not deeply narrow options until the seed is revealed. Cost tied indirectly (the seed's planting, not the diary itself).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is labeled directly in paragraph four ("an inconvenient curiosity that had elevated her from scullery to parlour") and shown in her methodical gathering of pages, humming notes, and descent with trowel. Setup early. Development: her curiosity drives her to solve the cipher rather than simply deliver the goggles, a mid-story choice. Payoff: her inquisitiveness leads to the hothouse discovery, but the final choice (to stay) hinges more on the seed's promise than on the trait itself. One beat of clear causal work (cipher pursuit); visible in closure participation but not indispensable to the ending's charge. Swappability moderate—"determined" or "persistent" could replace with edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears as the cipher's repeated word in beat two, is enacted when Lira arrays the pages (paragraph nine: "aligning edges until the stain formed a continuous spiral"), and echoes in the final paragraph when she "unfolded the captain's map" to plant the seed. Setup by ~25%. Development: the unfolding action enables the diary's unlock and map reveal. Payoff: the seed planting is the story's decisive act, and "unfold" bookends the arc. Two beats of causal work; irreplaceable given the thematic and literal unfolding. Minor: the word's thematic resonance (opening, revealing) is strong but the action itself is somewhat generic (many verbs could describe arranging pages).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Scattered light" is signaled in beat two (elevator lamps flicker, ice facets refract through goggles' left lens, projecting cipher), returns in beat three (light resolves the musical staff), and charges the ending: "the goggles translate the hothouse's dimness into scattered light that danced across the walls like children chasing geese." Setup early (~20%). Development: scattered light is the method that solves the cipher, a middle choice-enabler. Payoff: it directly shapes the final image and Lira's laughter. Three beats; causal; closure-linked. Specificity high—no other method is taught. Cost indirect (the method itself carries no price, but it enables the costly final choice).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire is anchored immediately (paragraph one) and recurs throughout: frost-lensed floors, cold iron corridors, sub-basement hothouse, skylight of frozen cloud. Setup immediate. Development: the spire's vertical structure (ten floors, sub-basement) organizes Lira's descent and pressures her choice—she must leave the inhabited floors to reach the hidden hothouse. Payoff: the spire's architecture (heat from below, cold above) validates the captain's wager and enables the seed's survival. Two beats; causal (descent logistics, hothouse conditions). Closure participation moderate—the setting enables but does not charge the final image as directly as the goggles or seed.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The elevator climbs ten floors in the opening, establishing vertical movement, but the timeframe is not sustained or leveraged as pressure. After the first beat, Lira spends indeterminate time in the observatory, then descends across multiple floors in mosaic shards (five, two, sub-basement) with no clock or urgency. Setup present (~10%). Development: absent—time does not constrain middle choices. Payoff: the ending's "when the elevator climbed again" mentions time as retrospective frame, not live pressure. One gate only (setup); no escalation tied to elapsed time. Highly swappable—the story would function identically without the ten-floor count.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" is stated in paragraph four ("itched to know why he had smiled") and enacted when Lira solves the cipher, discovers the hothouse, and plants the seed. Setup by ~15%. Development: her motivation drives the cipher-solving and descent rather than reporting. Payoff: she laughs "with scattered light" and remains below, "watering the future"—the joy is found and chosen. Two beats; causal link moderate. Weakness: the motivation is told more than dramatized in friction—Lira's choices align too smoothly with the goal without visible competing wants. Cost present (she forgoes ascent) but tied to outcome rather than to pursuing the motivation itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is signaled through diction ("soft apology," "laughing mouth," "affectionately detached from the grief") and modulates across the piece: warm curiosity in the opening, methodical care in the observatory, tentative joy on floor five, and embodied laughter in the hothouse. Setup by ~30% (implicit in voice). Development: tone supports the pressure without flattening—detachment allows Lira to process the captain's death while pursuing his legacy. Payoff: the final image's "affectionately detached from the grief…yet tethered to the joy" directly names the tone, charging but also risking over-articulation. Coherent and purposeful, but the explicit label in the penultimate paragraph reduces organic resonance slightly. Tone charges the ending but is not indispensable—removal would leave the arc intact.</comment>
