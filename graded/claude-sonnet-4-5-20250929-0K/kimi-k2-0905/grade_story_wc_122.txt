<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is concrete and specific: the felt-wrapped silence, the numbness she can *feel* through vibrations. Her motivation—to convert numbness into livable pain—drives every choice from filing the needle to pressing her palm on the drumhead. The emotional arc from muffled shock to grief arriving "loud inside her silence" is embodied and earned. Minor slip: Temen remains thinly sketched, a facilitator rather than a pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors quickly (Mara, cavern, post-sister's-death). The closure—Mara feeling seasons turn again, grief arriving fully—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting to Earned Stasis) with visible cost: she welcomes pain as drumroll, ending numbness. The needle's backward spin and the drum's forward beat bracket the transformation. One meaningful deepening: the lullaby peels layers, the drum delivers present pulse. Cost is legible in "grief arrived fully" and her choice to teach through skin-listening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cavern is tactile and purposeful: cedar dust, goatskin stretched like moonlit lakes, felt-bearing lathe, packed-earth floor conducting vibrations. The phonograph and drum become micro-settings that constrain Mara's interaction—she *must* feel through bones and floor. The needle on leather cord and snow's hush at closure charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating numbness—signals early and tightens via the needle-repair sequence and the backward lullaby that peels protective layers. The reversal: numbness gives way to "loud" grief, a trade Mara accepts with visible cost (she keeps the needle as reminder, commits to teaching touch-listening). Agency is renunciation of safety for raw pain. One tightening deepening is sufficient at this length; the choice forecloses the muffled cocoon with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as transformable medium, grief as resonance rather than void—emerges through concrete particulars: the backward lullaby, the drum's forward beat, vibrations through floorboards. The needle becomes a "filament to remind her that numbness is only silence waiting to be spun backward into song," which risks thematic echo but stays grounded in the on-page action. The final image (drum pressed to heart, beats echoing forward) reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in Temen's quiet presence and the sister's laugh surfacing as sensation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is distinct (vibrations, floor-conducted sound, visual signing). Distance control is consistent. Minor register drift: "filament of hush she hoped might enthrall the numbness" and the closing meta-statement "to remind her that numbness is only silence waiting to be spun backward into song" tip toward elevated diction that edges outside natural interiority under stress. Temen's sign-language and the phonograph's "broken wing" tone-arm add texture without obscuring focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, many lines do double work (e.g., "vibrations traveled...entering the bones of her ankles like a shy knock"). Stock metaphors appear: "tears...silver as tin," "emotion had been wrapped in felt." Template stems cluster in the closing paragraph: "She signed...He answered...Together they carried...She kept...When students arrived...But tonight." The phrase "filament of hush" recurs but shifts meaning purposefully. Clarity and propulsion are strong; minor loops and decorative phrasing prevent higher band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—deaf music teacher using backward phonograph playback to unwind numbness—is specific and non-obvious. The pairing of reversed lullaby (memory) with forward drum (present) feels organic and earned. Risk: the piece commits fully to sensory-vibration world-building and sign language without exposition. Slight derivative note: the "object repairs grief" frame is familiar, though the backward-spin mechanism adds freshness. Transformation test: swap Mara for a hearing character and the logic collapses, confirming specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's deafness constrains every interaction (sign language with Temen, vibration-based perception) and enables the core solution (feeling rather than hearing the backward lullaby). Present in setup, middle (filing needle, setting it down), and closure (signing "seasons turning," pressing drum to heart). Her choices—repair, play backward, make drum, keep needle—drive all key turns. Cost: she trades numbness for raw grief.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The needle appears in setup (broken, "jagged tip caught lamplight"), middle (Mara files it, sets it on disc), and closure (she lifts it, threads it on cord as reminder). Its repair and use enable the backward playback that peels numbness. Specificity: "thinner than moth antenna," hooked point. Cost tied to it: the final gift of sister's laugh, then grief. Swappable with generic repair object only with structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Filament of hush" recurs throughout: the needle, the cavern's ambient hush, the final resonance. It shapes Mara's quest (she came for "a sound she could not hear, a filament of hush") and charges the ending ("hush she could almost hear," "hush within her, no longer vacant but resonant"). However, it functions more as lyric motif than on-page constraint; it reweights theme but does not narrow tactical options mid-scene. Early signal, closure reprise, but middle development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" describes Mara's post-grief world in setup ("the world felt audibly muted, as though every emotion had been wrapped in felt") and reverses at closure ("audibly muted no more, thrilled against their bones"). It constrains her teaching method (vibrations through floorboards) and motivates the needle quest. Cost: she must actively dismantle the muting to access pain. Visible tradeoff: safety for rawness.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears once in setup ("a filament of hush she hoped might enthrall the numbness out of her chest") and governs her intent but does not return as action verb in middle or closure beats. The backward lullaby does peel layers ("each reversed note peeled a translucent layer"), but "enthrall" itself is not re-invoked. Swappable with "draw out" or "transmute" without major structural edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Backward playback is signaled in setup ("she had read that backward recorded songs could unwind memory"), executed in the middle (she winds the crank, needle rides grooves, "melody run backward"), and delivers closure effect (sister's laugh surfaces, numbness peels). Its mechanics matter: the reversal must suck numbness out, contrasting with the drum's forward beat. Specificity: 78 rpm shellac, "Autumn Lullaby, 1932." Essential to the transformation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cavern supplies resources (hides, lathe, workbench) that enable the repair and drum-making. It conducts vibrations through packed-earth floor, essential for Mara's perception. The setting pressures choices: she must work there to access tools and Temen's knowledge. Closure participates: they carry phonograph and drum to the cavern mouth where snow falls with "hush she could almost hear." Micro-setting (floor, bench) alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"During the faint rustle of turning seasons" opens the story and bookends at closure ("I can feel the seasons turning again"). It frames the emotional thaw but does not tighten on-page decisions or supply a live clock. Early signal, thematic payoff, but no middle constraint. Lyric resonance qualifies for mid-band, but the timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to convert numbness into livable pain—is dramatized in every choice: seeking the cavern, repairing the needle, playing the disc backward, welcoming grief "like a drumroll building under ribs." Internal friction: she wants relief but must accept raw pain as the cost. The final choice (keeping the needle, committing to teach through skin) forecloses the muffled safety. Desire drives all key beats and the closure turn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Tone—mirrored hush—is coherent and modulates with pressure: the opening's frost-crept silence, the cavern's "inhale" pause, the backward lullaby's peeling quiet, the drum's heartbeat presence, the closing snow's landing hush. The tone charges the final image ("hush within her, no longer vacant but resonant") and reflects Mara's internal shift from muffled to resonant silence. Consistent through turns without static mood.</comment>
