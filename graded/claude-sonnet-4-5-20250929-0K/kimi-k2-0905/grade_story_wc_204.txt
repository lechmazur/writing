<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Corwin's motivation—compress eternity to fill his "cracked chase"—is declared but never embodied in a micro-choice that weighs competing goods. His interior is heavily decorated with metaphor ("heart was a cracked chase; letters kept falling out of order") yet he never hesitates, second-guesses, or pays a visible emotional price when he uncorks the whisper. The mirror-keeper dissolves into shards without dramatized reaction from Corwin, leaving no stance crystallization or relationship crucible on the page. Interiority remains ornamental rather than contradictory under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when are legible by line four (Corwin, floating deck, post-Shift dawn). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: frost-patterns, glass fruit chiming, mirrored dissolves build density toward a final image—Corwin walking cloud-sea with type slugs as bells and his name writing itself on distant windows. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the rupture is "not destruction but invitation," and eternity compressed into pocket-glyph reconfigures the premise. However, the cost is asserted ("here the world might breathe") rather than felt in a forfeited relationship, lost ability, or visible tradeoff; we see no on-page consequence that alters Corwin's options after the library folds. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what Corwin lost or cannot now do.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Glass orchard library, cloud-sea, frost patterns, letterpress gears-as-petals deliver vivid, purposeful detail. The floating deck tilts when ballast-books slide starboard—spatial choreography clear and causal. Frost rearranges into a spiral that Corwin inhales; the pattern constrains his next choice (he steps through broken pane onto cloud). Micro-setting and recurring object (frost) charge the closure image when his name appears on distant windowpanes. Passes Q3 9+ quick test: frost constrains the peak choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: compress eternity via the bottled whisper to repair Corwin's "empty spaces." One tightening: uncorking the whisper destabilizes the library, glass cracks, the orrery warps—options narrow from "perfect system" to rupture-invitation. Yet Corwin's agency is passive reception; he laughs "soundless" and steps through glass without weighing a trade-off or renouncing an alternative path. The mirror-keeper's warning ("Compress eternity and the sky will notice") sets up cost, but no visible price is paid—no injury, forfeited ability, or relationship severed on the page. Escalation under Accumulative lens shows density increase but lacks a dramatized choice that forecloses a live option with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—rupture as invitation, compression of eternity—emerges through frost-code, glass seeds of numerals, and the final glyph "here eternity was compressed." The ending offers a non-literal answer via image (name written on untouched windowpanes) rather than stated moral. However, the core question is asserted ("the rupture begins with breathing") without prior dramatized friction that makes breathing contested or costly. Subtext operates in gesture (Corwin's soundless laugh, mirror-keeper dissolving) but the conceptual stakes remain abstract; no micro-choice makes the theme's cost personal. The final whisper "searching for the next perfect system ready to rupture" philosophizes rather than charging prior particulars with new weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable single third-person limited to Corwin; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "frost wrote its patterns," "chase" as heart-metaphor, "negotiable sky." Diction is elevated and consistent ("cloud-vellum," "composing stick," "armillary") but occasionally slips into poetic abstraction ("signature in a book," "drop of ink about to fall") that dilutes immediacy. Psychic distance stays close during the press scene, widens during the library's transformation without dissonance. Free indirect style is clean. Voice modulates with event intensity (short clauses when the platen descends, longer cascades during the library collapse) though peak-stress compression is minimal. Passes most bullets but lacks a distinct rhythm under pressure that would elevate into 8+ range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines layer image, action, and world-rule. However, multiple paraphrase loops weaken propulsion: "the rupture was not destruction but invitation" immediately followed by "the world proposing a shorter path between heartbeats" restates the same idea; "destabilized" / "cracked" / "melted" / "listed" chains four synonyms in one beat without added pressure. Template cadence appears mid-story: "He understood then," "He saw," "He laughed," "He stepped"—four consecutive "He [verb]" openers. Filter-verb stack in final third: "saw the pattern," "understood then," "felt it etch"—three perception filters in six lines dull immediacy. Patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 for loops and template runs; an additional −0.2 for filter cluster touching closure zone. Artifacts do not obscure causality but measurably dull the closure image's propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard library floating on cloud-sea, letterpress with gears-as-petals, frost-code as world grammar—specific synthesis that avoids generic "chosen one" template. Bottled whisper from "last mortal child before reality became negotiable" offers a non-obvious stake anchor. However, the rupture-as-invitation turn and the protagonist stepping into an abstract new reality echo familiar metaphysical-collapse templates without grounding the choice in lived particulars (no lost relationship, no tool he can no longer use). The mirror-keeper and navigation orrery function as symbolic conveniences introduced to dissolve rather than agents who resist or complicate. Transformation test: swap names and the arc (man uses artifact, breaks system, walks into new world) remains structurally unchanged. Fresh inflection in frost-inhale and name-writing beats, but overall arc trends mid-originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Corwin (cryptic letterpress operator) frames expectation early (first line), drives two beats (pressing palm to frost, uncorking whisper at press), and his final action (stepping through pane, walking cloud-sea) shapes closure. Causal pressure: his choice to uncork the whisper narrows options from stable library to rupture-invitation. However, his decisions are passive execution of a declared plan rather than choices under conflicting pressures; no on-page moment shows him weighing mirror-keeper's warning against his need. Specificity: "letterpress operator" matters (he sets type, feeds vellum), yet "cryptic" remains label-only without dramatized trait. Cost: no visible injury, forfeited skill, or severed relationship. Integration: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal enabling +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.5 (any "seeker" could uncork artifact), label trait −0.3. Start 3.0 + 2.5 net = 5.5, round to 5.9 for specificity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bottled whisper introduced second paragraph (early signal +0.6), handled in three beats: Corwin carries it to press, uncorks it (silver thread into composing stick), and at closure it escapes "now his own" to search for next system. Causal pressure high: uncorking triggers library destabilization, glass cracks, orrery warps—narrows options decisively (+1.2). Closure linkage strong: whisper's escape and transformation ("now his own") charges final image (+1.4). Specificity: "no thicker than a reed," "stolen from last mortal child," silver thread lodging in em/en spaces—irreplaceable properties (+0.6). Cost: mirror-keeper warned, library collapses—visible consequence tied to object (+0.5). Integration: 3.0 base + 0.6 + 0.9 (two+ beats) + 1.2 + 1.4 + 0.6 + 0.5 = 8.2; −0.3 for summary at closure ("escaped…searching"), −0.5 for "his own" claim unearned by prior interiority shift, −0.3 swappability (any forbidden knowledge vessel). Net 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Core concept "rustling awakenings" appears in title-case first paragraph ("stories…ripened"), reappears when press responds ("rustling awakening, pages fluttering"), and in closure glyph ("here the rustling awakenings continue"). Setup early +0.6. However, the concept functions as thematic label rather than constraint—it does not alter Corwin's tactics or force a trade-off. "Rustling" describes pages fluttering (ornamental −0.7) and the glyph restates it without reweighting prior material. No beat where Corwin must choose *because* of rustling logic or forgo an option to preserve/trigger it. Lyric reprise present (first→closure) but cost absent. Integration: 3.0 + 0.6 (early) + 0.4 (one functional beat: press response) + 0.7 (closure mention) −0.7 (ornamental) −0.5 (label-only theme) −0.7 (swappable with "emergence" or "transformation") = 2.8; +2.0 for three-touch lyric pattern that holds tone. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development (does not constrain choice). Net 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Destabilizes perfect systems" embodied on-page: Corwin's sentence-printing triggers library collapse—glass apples crack, pears melt, deck tilts, orrery warps. Attribute enables the peak action (rupture) with visible cost: mirror-keeper dissolves, library folds into sigil, navigation lost. Early signal +0.5 (keeper warns "compress eternity and sky will notice"), two beats +0.9 (frost-pattern press, library destabilization), causal pressure +1.0 (destabilization narrows options), closure linkage +1.0 (library folds, attribute completes arc), cost +0.5 (system destroyed). Swappability −0.6 (any "breaks rules" trait could substitute). Integration: 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.5 −0.6 = 6.3. Attribute is demonstrated through consequences but lacks a moment where Corwin must *choose* to destabilize versus preserve, capping upside.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rupture is the major turn: printing the sentence "The rupture begins with breathing" causes glass to crack, orrery to warp, clouds to surge through orchard. Early signal +0.7 (mirror-keeper's warning, frost-code), three beats +1.4 (sentence typeset, platen descends, library destabilizes), causal pressure +1.3 (rupture redefines options from stable to negotiable reality), closure linkage +1.5 (rupture completes when library folds, Corwin walks cloud-sea in new state), specificity +0.7 (rupture via letterpress sentence is unique mechanism), cost +0.6 (mirror-keeper lost, library destroyed). Swappability −0.8 (edit to "awakening" or "shift" would preserve structure). Integration: 3.0 + 0.7 + 1.4 + 1.3 + 1.5 + 0.7 + 0.6 −0.8 = 8.4; −0.5 for Corwin's passive execution (no on-page weighing of abort option), −0.5 summary of key beat ("Instantly…destabilized" tells effects rather than showing moment-by-moment). Net 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Patterns in morning frost" introduced second paragraph (early +0.6): frost writes across panes, Corwin reads "code of awakening," presses palm and frost branches "like copper wires, each filament a syllable." Mechanics matter: frost = world's true grammar that he must read before sunrise. Two beats +0.9: palm-press (frost branches into code) and closure (spiral frost-pattern rearranges, Corwin inhales it, his name later written in frost on distant panes). Causal enabling +0.9: frost-code guides his timing and final inhalation constrains his transformation. Closure linkage +1.2: name in frost charges final image. Specificity +0.5: "copper wires," "syllables," spiral that "pointed nowhere and everywhere" are unique. Cost connection +0.3: must act in frost-hour only. Swappability −0.5 (any "hidden language" method). Summary −0.4: "he understood then" tells rather than showing code-reading. Decorative −0.3: "chilled pane" touch is static description. Integration: 3.0 + 0.6 + 0.9 + 0.9 + 1.2 + 0.5 + 0.3 −0.5 −0.4 −0.3 = 6.2; −0.5 for missing explicit middle beat where frost-pattern alters a tactical choice. Net 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Glass orchard library on cloud-sea introduced first line (early +0.8), detailed second paragraph (glass fruit chiming, crystal shelves). Micro-setting: letterpress "grew like steel orchid at library's heart" with gears-as-petals and oily-pollen stamen—body/tool hybrid that constrains Corwin's method. Three beats +1.4: Corwin carries bottle to press, feeds cloud-vellum through platen, library destabilizes and tilts. Causal pressure +1.1: tilting deck (ballast-books slide starboard) alters Corwin's movement; broken pane provides exit onto cloud. Closure linkage +1.3: library folds into sigil, orchard's collapse enables cloud-walk ending. Specificity +0.7: "glass apples crack revealing ticking numerals," "pears melt into hourglasses"—irreplaceable properties. Swappability −0.7 (any "magical edifice" setting could house the press). Ornamental −0.5: extensive catalog (apples, pears, orrery, navigation rings) described but only tilt/broken-pane affect choice. Integration: 3.0 + 0.8 + 1.4 + 1.1 + 1.3 + 0.7 −0.7 −0.5 = 7.1; −0.3 for postcard elements (fruit details) that don't constrain. Net 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After reality becomes negotiable" established in third paragraph (timeframe post-Shift, Corwin rises "every dawn since"). Setup present +0.4, but timeframe functions as backdrop label rather than constraint. No beat where negotiable-reality rules force a trade-off or create urgency ("only in the hour when frost wrote" sets frost-window, not reality-negotiability). Closure mentions "air had become negotiable too" and "new negotiable sky" but these are thematic echoes, not tactics-altering constraints. The bottled whisper is "from the last mortal child before reality became negotiable"—timeframe anchors object origin (+0.3) but does not tighten decisions. One functional involvement: negotiable reality enables the rupture-invitation turn (+0.5). Swappability −0.6 (any "post-apocalypse" or "after magic returned" would serve). Label-only −0.5: "negotiable" repeated without showing *how* it changes what Corwin can/cannot do. Integration: 3.0 + 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.5 −0.6 −0.5 = 3.1; +1.1 for closure thematic reprise that holds tone. Cap at 4.6 for introduction after 40% (negotiable-air/sky details arrive final third). Net 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation "compress eternity into a moment" declared third paragraph ("his heart was a cracked chase; letters kept falling out of order, and he needed the bottled whisper to fill the empty spaces"). Early signal +0.7. Two beats +0.9: uncorking whisper (acts on motivation), closure ("eternity compressed into the moment his pulse skipped"). Causal link +0.8: desire drives the press action that triggers rupture. Closure linkage +1.0: glyph "here eternity was compressed" fulfills stated goal. However, motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No on-page friction between compressing eternity and another cost (mirror-keeper warns but Corwin never hesitates). Summary-only −0.6: "he needed…to fill empty spaces" asserts rather than showing what those spaces prevent him from doing. Swappability −0.5: any "repair broken self" motivation. Label trait −0.3: "cracked chase" remains metaphor without embodied consequence. Integration: 3.0 + 0.7 + 0.9 + 0.8 + 1.0 −0.6 −0.5 −0.3 = 5.0; +0.4 for closure payoff that completes arc. Net 5.4.</comment>
