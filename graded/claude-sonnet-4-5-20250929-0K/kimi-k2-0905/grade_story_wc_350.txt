<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mireya's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "empathetically decisive" gift reads as a label without embodied cost or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The piece tells us she "felt the tower's wheeze" and "knew she must rehabilitate" but offers no on-page struggle or competing desire—she simply executes a sequence of technical tasks. Emotional states remain abstract ("exhausted," "confident") without embodied tension or genuine flaws that complicate the repair.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through language-braiding and the final image reweights the connection between tower and elevator. Orientation is delayed—spatial anchors (who, where, when) are not legible until ~150 words in, and the causal chain between actions remains vague (−0.4 under Orientation Test). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bridge metaphor charges the final image and the "roadway of resonance" shifts the initial problem from mechanical silence to shared resonance. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—Mireya's exhaustion and "metallic dust" are told, not shown as a meaningful forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower and its interior star map are vivid and purposeful, anchoring Mireya's descent and ascent. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (spiral catwalk, maintenance alcove, observation balcony), and the speaking tube supplies a functional constraint. However, the grain elevator remains distant and abstract—its "wooden throat" and "cedar ribs" are lyric gestures without tactile use. The cuckoo clock weight (lead pine cone, copper wire, chain) constrains one beat and charges the final mechanical sigh, meeting the micro-setting test for 9+ eligibility at the lower threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the conversation between tower and elevator before dawn—is signaled early and drives Mireya's actions. One meaningful tightening occurs when the elevator demands "Build me a bridge, librarian, or let me rot," but the escalation is told rather than dramatized through narrowing options. Agency reads as execution rather than decision: Mireya never faces a trade-off or renunciation; she simply completes the technical sequence. The cost (exhaustion, apron dust) is mentioned but not legible as a forfeiture that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bridge/silo metaphor and "languages as living rope," and the final image ("a bridge is a song you can walk across") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The piece resists easy answers, leaving the boundary "porous" rather than resolved. However, the thematic statement in the penultimate beat ("a bridge is a song you can walk across") edges toward direct articulation, and the line "bread can remember the music of its becoming" feels like a poetic coda rather than earned resonance. The story's commitment to its linguistic premise is clear, but subtext operates mostly at the level of metaphor rather than gesture or silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mireya, and the diction carries a consistent lyric-archival texture ("borrowed starlight," "vigorous tender hymn"). However, the prose often drifts into elevated register that exceeds Mireya's plausible lexicon ("interspersing languages into a single liturgy," "ontological custodianship"). The grain elevator's one line of dialogue—"Songs are bridges; silos are islands"—feels like authorial thesis rather than the "gritty vernacular" claimed. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Mireya notices gears and lexicons, but her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias or blind spots.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Density is high, but figurative language saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching or payoff, especially in peak beats: "cradling a fallen cuckoo clock weight like a cold heart," "wooden throat sang a bass note," "iris to the cosmos." Mixed metaphors abound—"construct bridges from silos" conceptually conflicts with the physical tower/elevator setup (−0.6). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "She descended… She opened… She spoke… She climbed…" (−0.5). Register drift into abstract academic phrasing ("dissolving the barriers between human need and mechanical memory") clashes with the narrative voice in high-pressure beats (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "empathetically decisive" is restated as "felt the tower's wheeze and the elevator's hunger as clearly as off-key chords" without added pressure (−0.2). Cumulative artifacts total −1.7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The combination of astronomical clock tower, grain elevator, and language-as-repair offers a specific synthesis, and "interspersing languages" as method is non-obvious. However, the core premise—solving mechanical estrangement through empathetic mediation—maps closely to stock "healing broken systems through special gift" templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 within Q8). The ending's lyric imagery (wheat tasting of metronomes, bridge complete) feels like decorative payoff rather than earned risk. The piece commits fully to its concept but retreats into poetic abstraction rather than grounding the stakes in concrete human or mechanical cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mireya is present throughout and her actions drive all beats, but her choices are technical execution rather than decisions that alter tactics. She is introduced early (setup ✓), enables middle repair beats (development ✓), and appears in the final descent (payoff ✓). However, her agency reads as competent problem-solving without on-page trade-offs or visible cost tied to her character trait. The role could be filled by any skilled mediator. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, but no causal pressure narrowing options (−0.8) and high swappability (−0.6). Starting anchor 3.0 + 1.4 + 0.6 − 0.8 − 0.6 = 3.6, round to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cuckoo clock weight appears early (setup ✓), Mireya mends and rehangs it mid-story (development ✓), and its steady swing is noted in the resolution (payoff ✓). It is handled in two distinct beats: the initial fall and the rehang with copper wire and hymn. However, its role is functional rather than transformative—it enables the tower's chime but does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning at closure. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables one action) +0.5, closure mention (passive) +0.3, moderate swappability (any mechanical part could serve) (−0.5). Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.6 + 0.9 + 0.5 + 0.3 − 0.5 = 4.8, but strong setup and beat involvement push toward upper 6-range under lyric allowance. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The talking grain elevator is introduced early via the broken midnight signal (setup ✓), speaks one line demanding a bridge (development ✓), and sings the renewed bass note at closure, harmonizing with the tower's chime and spelling gratitude in wheat-glints (payoff ✓). The concept shapes stakes: Mireya must restore the "conversation between iron and wood," and the elevator's demand "Build me a bridge, librarian, or let me rot" drives her liturgy-weaving. The final harmonized song and wheat-prism Morse directly enact the concept's promise. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (frames the dominant stake and shapes her method) +1.2, closure linkage (the elevator's renewed song is the payoff image) +1.4, moderate specificity +0.5. Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.7 + 0.9 + 1.2 + 1.4 + 0.5 = 7.7, but some swappability (the elevator could be any distant dependent system) (−0.6). Final: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" is declared in one line ("Mireya's gift was empathetically decisive") but functions as a label without on-page constraint or visible tradeoff. The text tells us she "felt the tower's wheeze and the elevator's hunger" but does not dramatize a moment where empathy costs her, forces a choice, or compels a decision against another impulse. The trait is summary-only (−0.7) and ornamental (−0.6). Mentioned once in first third (setup ✓), no middle constraint (development ✗, cap 3.4), no cost at closure. Starting anchor 3.0, capped at 3.4, then −0.7 −0.6 = 2.1, but minimal thematic echo lifts slightly. Final: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rehabilitate" is the action named explicitly: Mireya must "rehabilitate the conversation between iron and wood before dawn" and later asks the elevator to "rehabilitate its voice." It appears early (setup ✓), structures the middle repair sequence (development ✓), and the closure declares "the boundary between mechanical and human breath would remain porous, a rehabilitated seam" (payoff ✓). However, the action is abstract—any repair verb could substitute with minor edits. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (frames her method) +0.8, closure linkage (the "rehabilitated seam" charges the final image) +1.0, swappability (mend, restore, repair are near-synonyms) (−0.7). Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.7 + 0.9 + 0.8 + 1.0 − 0.7 = 5.7, but strong closure integration lifts toward 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Interspersing languages" is introduced explicitly ("Her method was interspersing languages, braiding them into living rope") early (setup ✓), executed in the middle with Proto-Clockwork, speaking-tube vernacular, and the four-language liturgy (development ✓), and mentioned in the final beat ("singing softly in four languages at once") (payoff ✓). The method shapes her approach: she tucks lexicons into her apron, speaks to cuckoo and elevator in distinct tongues, and weaves them into a single liturgy. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables the repair and bridge-building) +1.0, closure linkage (she sings in four languages to complete the bridge) +1.0, some specificity +0.4. Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.8 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.4 = 7.6, but mild swappability (any hybrid communication could serve) (−0.5) and one summary beat (liturgy-weaving told more than shown) (−0.4). Capped by development being partly summary: adjust to 5.8, then recognize three beats and closure use push higher. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower is introduced in the opening line (setup ✓), houses the maintenance alcove where Mireya retrieves languages and the observation balcony where she weaves the liturgy (development ✓), and its final chime harmonizes with the elevator to complete the bridge (payoff ✓). The tower's interior (spiral catwalk, brass planetary rings, star map, speaking tube) provides spatial resources that Mireya navigates across three beats. The speaking tube is a functional constraint: it runs three miles and enables her to address the elevator. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the tower's structure and tube enable her actions) +1.0, closure linkage (the tower's chime is the resolution image) +1.2, high specificity +0.6. Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.8 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 0.6 = 8.0, minor descriptor redundancy (−0.3). Final: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "under the hush of borrowed starlight" opens and closes the piece, and the midnight failure creates urgency ("before dawn"). The clock chimes thirteen at the start and strikes "the true hour" at the end; 4:43 a.m. is noted when the cuckoo bursts forth. However, time pressure is declared rather than dramatized—Mireya never races the clock or adjusts tactics as dawn approaches. Early signal +0.7, frames two beats (midnight silence, 4:43 repair, dawn approach) +0.9, mild causal pressure (urgency stated) +0.4, closure linkage (starlight returns, true hour struck) +0.8, poetic frame credit +0.3. Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.7 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.8 + 0.3 = 6.1, but live-clock test not met (time noted, not felt in choices) (−0.5), and some vagueness (exact duration unclear) (−0.4). Final: 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To construct bridges from silos" is stated explicitly mid-story: "Mireya understood: to construct bridges from silos meant dissolving the barriers between human need and mechanical memory." It is introduced past the first third (late setup, −0.3), shapes the middle liturgy-weaving (development ✓), and the final image declares "between them stretched a roadway of resonance no silo could contain" (payoff ✓). However, the motivation is told as insight rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Two beats +0.9, causal pressure (frames her liturgy method) +0.6, closure linkage (bridge metaphor charges final image) +1.0, but late first appearance (−0.3), label-only desire (−0.4), no on-page friction between want and cost (−0.5). Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.9 + 0.6 + 1.0 − 0.3 − 0.4 − 0.5 = 4.3, lyric reprise lifts slightly. Final: 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Vigorous tender" is named once ("a vigorous tender hymn that promised no farmer would stand alone") and implied in the closing "singing softly" and the tractor driver's brimming eyes. Tone is consistent—archival-lyric with earnest emotional stakes—and modulates from urgent repair to quiet completion. However, the tone descriptor itself is ornamental; removing "vigorous tender" would not alter the story's emotional arc. Setup (named mid-story, −0.3), development (implied in hymn and resolution beats) ✓, payoff (soft singing and emotional closure) ✓. Two beats +0.9, mild closure linkage (tone supports final image) +0.5, coherence across turns +0.4, label-only mention (−0.5), late first appearance (−0.3). Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.9 + 0.5 + 0.4 − 0.5 − 0.3 = 4.0, but tone consistency and emotional charge at closure lift toward mid-5s. Final: 5.4.</comment>
