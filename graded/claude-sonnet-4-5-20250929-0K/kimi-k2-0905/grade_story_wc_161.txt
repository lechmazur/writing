<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mirela's motivation to preserve lost songs is established early, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The meteorite chip functions more as symbolic gesture than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Her final disappearance reads as summary rather than a dramatized renunciation, and the phrase "learning to trust again across learning to trust again" is a scaffold artifact that obscures rather than reveals her psychological progression. The pigeon Inkspot and Mr. Blackwood remain functional supports without applying meaningful relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust-mote balance, archival sorting, and the lullaby fragments pattern toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. However, the closure unit—Mirela's escape and the song's dispersal—occurs largely off-page ("She was already gone"), summarized rather than dramatized, which weakens the felt cost at the moment of departure. The conceptual repricing (songs survive when set free) lands in reflection rather than image, and the children humming years later functions as epilogue rather than on-page closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The attic skylight and dust motes constrain Mirela's balancing practice and charge the final image when the light "rearranges into a brief, bright chord." Spatial details—rafters, floorboards, the meteorite hollow—are woven through action and recur with purpose. Sensory selection is vivid and filtered through Mirela's particular attention (camphor, iron taste, oil-drop eyes), though some diction ("blooming withering light") edges toward ornament. The pigeon loft between chimney stacks integrates setting into the network-rebuilding plot, and the micro-setting (body, skylight, copper plate) effectively substitutes for broader world-building at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving lost songs while evading capture—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the constables trace the paper trails, but the resolution (Mirela's departure) happens off-page, diluting the on-page cost. Her balancing exercises accumulate texture but do not narrow live options or force a dramatized trade-off. Mr. Blackwood's offer of sanctuary and the micro-sheet melody network add complications, yet the constables' arrival feels coincidental rather than a consequence of Mirela's prior choices, and her escape is recounted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: burned sheet music, deportation tags, the meteorite as proof that worlds survive collision. The lullaby fragments and the children's rope-jumping reprise reweigh the opening stake without overt moralizing. However, the phrase "identities, like songs, survive best when set free to migrate" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, and the final image—dust motes rearranging into a chord—is evocative but risks symbolic convenience rather than earned resonance from prior dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and texture-rich, with strong perceptual signature: "dust motes rose and fell in slow arpeggios," "oil-drop eyes," "bronze throat releasing a flutter of wooden cuckoos." POV remains stable in close third, filtering setting and memory through Mirela's musician's idiom. However, the scaffold phrase "across learning to trust again" appears twice verbatim, a copy-paste artifact that breaks rhythm and clarity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("dissolved network," "carte blanche") that sits uneasily against the immediate sensory texture, and Mr. Blackwood's dialogue ("chamomile tea and curiosity") is told rather than voiced on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "dust motes…slow arpeggios," "bronze throat," "pruned her branches bare," "folded herself into a dawn release of wings." While many images are vivid, the concentration in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching creates overwriting that slows momentum during key beats. The phrase "across learning to trust again" duplicates exactly, a paraphrase loop that obscures meaning. Mixed metaphors appear: "branches bare" (pruning) versus "bronze throat" (anatomy) clash in vehicle logic. Line-level clarity suffers when ornament stacks without advancing causality, particularly in the closure paragraph where summary dominates over image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—pigeon trainer as song archivist fleeing a smuggling network—synthesizes familiar refugee and preservation tropes with specific detail (rice-paper diet, micro-sheet melodies, meteorite chip as seed). The balance-training frame and dust-mote choreography offer fresh inflection on embodied recovery. However, the core arc (hiding, cataloging, escaping) follows a predictable template, and the constables' arrival plus Mirela's off-page departure read as conventional rather than inevitable in hindsight. The lyric register and archival particulars elevate the execution, but the story does not take a bold structural or moral risk that transforms its component tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mirela is present throughout and her archival work plus pigeon training anchor the plot. She makes two key choices: hiding the meteorite chip and accepting Mr. Blackwood's sanctuary. However, her final departure—the highest-stakes decision—is summarized rather than dramatized, reducing causal agency at closure. The profession shapes the smuggling backstory and melody-dispersal method but does not constrain a climactic on-page choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The meteorite chip appears in three beats: tasting it in the opening, pressing it into the windowsill hollow, and referenced at closure as "last evidence." Its symbolic role (proof that worlds survive collision) is clear, but its physical use does not constrain a tactical choice or enable a turn. The chip functions more as thematic anchor than causal tool, and the closure reprise is a cameo mention rather than a reweighted action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Paper trails" drives the central conflict: Mirela flees trails that tie her to smugglers, and constables eventually trace them to the bookshop. The concept also grounds her archival work (sorting ration cards, valentines, deportation tags) and the "watermark stolen from a 1918 hymnal" used to draft her new identity. It shapes both backstory motive and present stakes, though the constables' tracing is told rather than shown, which limits on-page tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Reinventing personal history motivates Mirela's cataloging work and her drafting of the "Mirela Skylight, Archivist of Airborne Refrain" identity. The attribute appears in the opening line and recurs when she back-dates her birth. However, the on-page cost of reinvention is oblique—her escape is summarized—and the attribute functions more as thematic framing than a trait that constrains a high-stakes choice with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Balancing on the rafter's narrow beam and walking the widening gyre of dust are central to Mirela's recovery arc and recur across multiple beats: steadying on the beam, learning effortless balance, and the dust motes' final chord. The action shapes her progression from fugitive to archivist and charges the closing image. However, the climactic departure does not hinge on a balance maneuver; the action redefines her stance but does not alter the constables' arrival or her escape tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mapping the swirl of dust motes is introduced in the third paragraph, practiced "night after night," and returns in the final image when dust motes "rearrange into a brief, bright chord." The method is specific and recurs, but its mechanics (how mapping teaches balance) remain poetic rather than tactical. The method does not enable a turn or constrain an option; it accrues atmosphere and supports the thematic repricing without driving a causal beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The attic provides hiding, the skylight enables the dust-mote mapping, and the hollow beneath the windowsill stores the meteorite chip. Mr. Blackwood's offer of sanctuary in exchange for cataloging makes the attic a resource that alters Mirela's tactics. The pigeon loft between chimney stacks integrates the setting into the melody-dispersal network, and the attic's spatial details (rafters, floorboards, copper plate) recur with functional purpose. The setting constrains choices and charges the final dust-mote image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The phrase "across learning to trust again" is the designated timeframe, appearing twice verbatim as a scaffold artifact. The story spans "months" and references "night after night" and "years later," but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a clock that pressures tactics. The doubled phrase obscures rather than tracks progression, and the epilogue structure diffuses urgency rather than compressing it.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Preserving lost songs motivates Mirela's archival work, the micro-sheet melody flights, and the lullaby etched into the meteorite chip. The desire is dramatized through her humming, the pigeon's code-tapping, and the children's rope-jumping reprise. However, the motivation is stated directly ("We will preserve the echo of lost songs") rather than revealed through conflicted choice, and the escape that enacts preservation occurs off-page, reducing friction between want and cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" recurs as a phrase ("blooming withering light") and modulates through the piece: dust motes rising and falling, the sun slicing in then fading, the final chord image that is "blooming, withering—an unfinished cadence." The tone supports the theme of transience and survival. However, the exact phrase appears only twice, and the tone's coherence depends more on lyric density than on modulation under pressure; the constables' arrival does not darken or compress the register in a way that charges the ending.</comment>
