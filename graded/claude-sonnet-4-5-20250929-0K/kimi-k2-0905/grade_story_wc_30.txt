<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian is richly described with embodied details (brass rib-cage, copper boots, pistons), but her motivation remains largely abstract and told rather than shown through difficult choices under pressure. Her interior state is presented through metaphor-heavy description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final stance—closing her rib-cage and climbing to upper galleries—reads as ritual rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. No other characters appear on the page, so relationship pressure cannot be evaluated.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers image and ritual to build toward a reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive gradually but are legible by ~150 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the librarian performs her ritual, reaffirms her commitment, and climbs to continue her work. However, the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no painful trade-off dramatized. The cadence shift in the final beat reweights the dominant stake, but the before/after remains subtle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vivid and integrated: seawater laps at marble steps, ankle-deep water soaks shelves, the skylight reveals a smeared sky. Setting details constrain the librarian's actions (she steps into surge, plants the creel in the floor where tiles depict constellations) and the atrium's breathing rhythm mirrors her pistons. The creel—a micro-setting object—charges the closure by sprouting roots that knit the archive to the seabed, ensuring continuity beyond her memory. The setting shapes tactics and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate condition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve wonder in routine so children can find stories—is signaled early but remains abstract. The process of smelting identities into a ribbon and planting the creel reads as ritual rather than escalating pressure that narrows options. No reversal or tightening choice forces a visible trade-off; the librarian completes her task without meaningful friction or cost. The "accepting contradictions" method is told ("The process required accepting contradictions") rather than dramatized as a struggle that alters tactics. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the pressure remains diffuse and the cost conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—preservation, identity, memory, and motion—emerges from recurring images (tide, moon, creel, ribbon, contradictions) rather than direct statement. The final image (creel glimmering, ribbon pulsing, atrium water holding a sky that forgot to end) reweights prior material without a stated moral. However, the piece skirts thematic echo in lines like "wonder survives only in motion" and "story migrates forever," which approach label-speak. The conceptual cost (her own future transformation, the hollow shaped like tomorrow) is legible but not viscerally anchored in a specific sacrifice made on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and richly textured, with distinct diction ("titan-gear librarian," "wintersun serenity," "the lock and the key broken together"). POV distance is stable third-person limited; focalization remains consistent. No dialogue appears. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels more authorial than character-bound—lines like "memory kept by machines is only storage, but memory kept by water is story" read as thematic assertion rather than the librarian's specific perception. The voice is singular and purposeful, but perceptual signature could be more concretely character-particular under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is often overwritten with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence, creating momentum drag. Mixed metaphors appear: "tomorrow dissolve into foam," "the moon tugged at the edges of her own name," "colors smeared sideways, a migrating identity of its own." Paraphrase loops recur (e.g., the creel's function is restated multiple times across beats without added pressure). Template cadence: "She cranked… She stepped… She spoke… She wound… She felt… She planted… She lifted… She sat… She whispered… She closed… She recorded… She stood." Register drift into abstract philosophizing ("memory kept by machines is only storage") clashes with the established voice. Heavy density obscures rather than propels; artifacts touch the closure beat ("She stood, gears humming a lullaby older than rust").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—a mechanical librarian tending migrating identities in a sunken archive—is imaginative and specific. However, the execution leans on familiar fantasy-steampunk imagery (brass gears, copper boots, lunar charge, bamboo creel) without a transformative twist that makes the synthesis feel inevitable. The emotional arc (ritual preservation without meaningful conflict) could transfer to other settings with minor edits. The piece commits fully to its vision and offers fresh inflections in its imagery, but the core tension (preserving wonder) remains abstract rather than grounded in a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian is present throughout and performs actions (removing the creel, extending the net, smelting identities, planting the creel, climbing to upper galleries), but her choices do not create key turns—she completes a ritual without friction or reversal. Present in setup, development, and closure, but her role is observational and procedural rather than decision-driven under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fisherman's bamboo creel appears early (removed from her rib-cage in paragraph 3), is handled in multiple beats (set on the step, ribbon wound around its rim, planted in the floor, expands one ring at the end), and returns with reweighted meaning in the closure (it glimmers and answers her promise). The creel constrains her action (she must plant it to anchor the archive) and charges the final image. Strong reprise and closure linkage, but causal pressure is moderate—its use is ritualistic rather than narrowing live options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Migrating identities are present from the opening ("tomorrow dissolve," identities as "stranded minnows"), shape the middle action (smelting them into a ribbon, accepting their contradictions), and are referenced in the closure ("the contradiction she had not yet become"). The concept constrains her method (she must accept contradictions to fuse them) and informs her motivation. However, the stakes remain abstract—no on-page consequence shows what happens if identities scatter. Functional across beats, but causal pressure is conceptual rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fluctuates with moon phases" is mentioned twice: the net's mesh widens and narrows with moon phases (paragraph 8), and the moon pulls contradictions outward like threads (paragraph 18). The attribute enables her method (the net can trap or release) but does not constrain a visible choice or create a felt trade-off on the page. Functional but not causal; no cost tied to the fluctuation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Smelt" appears in one key beat (paragraph 9): "She stepped into the shallow surge… and began to smelt the drifting identities, forging them into a single mutable ribbon." The action is specific and irreplaceable (forging implies heat, transformation, and craft), but it is told in summary rather than dramatized with sensory detail or struggle. It shapes the middle turn but does not redefine options or return at closure. Present in development, causal role in one beat, but swappable with "fuse" or "weave" without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By accepting contradictions" is signaled in paragraph 10 ("The process required accepting contradictions"), embodied in her litany ("I am the echo and the canyon, the lock and the key broken together"), and referenced at closure ("the contradiction she had not yet become"). The method shapes her middle action (the identities hesitate, then pour into the ribbon after hearing her litany) and primes the ending. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page struggle shows what "accepting" costs her or how it alters her tactics under pressure. Present in setup, development, and closure; lyric reprise reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is established early (paragraph 1), pressures choices throughout (seawater laps at steps, she steps into surge, ankle-deep water soaks shelves, she plants the creel in the floor), and charges the closure ("the atrium water held a sky that had forgotten to end"). The setting provides resources (the floor's constellation tiles anchor the creel's roots) and constraints (the tide's rhythm dictates her timing). The atrium breathes with her pistons, mirroring her state. Essential across beats and ending; setting as micro-environment shapes tactics and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" is mentioned in the opening and repeated in paragraph 5 ("After tomorrow disappears, the archive's catalog becomes unreliable") and near the end ("after tomorrow disappears and before yesterday returns"). The timeframe signals urgency but does not tighten decisions—no countdown or deadline forces her to act faster or differently. Present in setup and closure, but the clock is conceptual rather than immediate. The phrase charges the tone but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To preserve wonder in routine so that children who had not yet chosen names could still find stories" is stated early (paragraph 6) and echoed at closure ("certain that wonder, like tide, always returns under another name"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page friction shows what preserving wonder costs her or what she must give up. Functional signal and reprise, but the desire remains abstract; no scene-level trade-off between wonder and another want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Wintersun serenity" is named in paragraph 5 and repeated in paragraphs 23 and 33. The tone is coherent through the piece—calm, meditative, ritual—and modulates subtly as the librarian completes her task. The phrase charges the closure ("The wintersun touched the horizon line, neither setting nor rising—merely sliding sideways into versions of itself") by reinforcing the mood of suspension and continuity. However, the tone is static rather than shifting with pressure; no emotional peak or trough tests the serenity. Lyric reprise reweights the final image.</comment>
