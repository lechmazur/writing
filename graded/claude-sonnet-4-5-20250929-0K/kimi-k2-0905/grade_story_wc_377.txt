<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The tuner's motivation (preserving wonder's color) is established early and drives her thirty-year project, but her interiority remains abstract and ceremonial rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The mute-season constraint functions as backstory flavor rather than creating on-page friction or micro-choices under pressure. The final gesture—giving the boy a wedge—reads as symbolic closure but lacks the earned internal shift or visible cost that would ground the character's arc; we never see her struggle with doubt, exhaustion, or competing desires during the calibration itself.</comment>

<comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the comet's arrival provides the occasion, and the sculpture's activation reweights the tuner's lifelong preparation into a moment of resonance. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two paragraphs, satisfying the test. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—crystallizes the tuner's thirty-year mission in the final image of her walking wordless into the valley, trusting the instrument to the wind; however, the cost remains conceptual (leaving the work behind) rather than felt on the page with visible sacrifice or foreclosed options during the calibration itself.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The bluff setting is anchored early (basalt stair, cloudless hush, high altitude) and the iceberg fragment functions as a concrete object that constrains the sculpture's mechanics and refracts light during the comet's pass. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"ice sweating cold diamonds," "green nucleus," "ribbons of unseen hues"—filtered through the tuner's perceptual priorities. The kinetic sculpture's physical structure (cantilevered ribs, counterweights, bearings) shapes the tuner's calibration work and charges the final image when she leaves it to the mountain wind, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and appearing in the closure.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder's frequency before the comet's passage—is signaled early and sustained through the tuner's calibration work. Pressure accumulates via the comet's approach and the sculpture's readiness, but the escalation lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening choice that narrows options; the tuner completes her adjustments without visible friction, error, or trade-off. The ending reconfigures the mission (entrusting the sculpture to wind and passing the wedge to the boy), yet the cost remains thematic rather than dramatized through a difficult choice or visible sacrifice during the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the tuner's silence, the sculpture's mechanics, and the iceberg's transformation into light: wonder as frequency rather than feeling, silence as resonant cavity for future voices. The final image—boy receiving wedge, tuner walking wordless—offers a non-literal answer to the question of preservation without stating a moral. However, the piece edges toward thematic statement in lines like "wonder is not a feeling but a frequency" and "silence is not absence but the resonant cavity," which risk explaining the resonance rather than letting the particulars carry it fully.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated diction and lyric compression throughout, with a perceptual signature filtered through the tuner's mute-season discipline ("fingertips reading micro-oscillations the way blind priests read breath-scriptures"). POV distance is stable, though some phrases veer toward abstract narrator commentary ("the color of wonder itself") that exceeds what the tuner can plausibly think mid-calibration. The purposeful compression and patterned syntax are taught early and remain legible, but under peak pressure (comet's pass, sculpture activation) the voice does not modulate—it stays ceremonial when sharper sensory immediacy might ground the tuner's experience.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Figurative density is high and consistent, with phrases like "continents were rumors," "breath-scriptures," "symphony of truth orbiting itself"—many striking individually but clustering densely enough to slow momentum in some beats. A paraphrase loop appears in paragraph 13: "she understood now that after words become unnecessary, silence is not absence but the resonant cavity" restates the mute-season premise without new pressure. Template cadence in parallel constructions ("not with sound but with light," "not a feeling but a frequency") becomes predictable. Some metaphors stretch plausibility: "droplets glistened like newborn stars before evaporating" mixes scales awkwardly, and "emotional flatlining" is avoided but the prose never varies rhythm under stress.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of bell-tuning, kinetic sculpture, iceberg fragment, and comet feels purposeful and specific, avoiding stock lonely-artist or preservation-quest templates. The mute-season frame and the concept of wonder as frequency offer fresh angles. However, the thirty-year silent pilgrimage and the wise-elder-passing-token-to-child closure echo familiar spiritual-quest arcs without transforming them through lived difficulty or failure. The tuner's competence is unbroken—no miscalibration, no doubt dramatized on the page—which limits the emotional stakes and keeps the originality in the mid-high band rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The bell tuner is present throughout, frames the stakes early, performs the calibration work across multiple beats (ascending, placing ice, adjusting weights, feeling synchronization), and appears in the closure where she descends and gives the boy a wedge. Her choices drive the narrative arc—deciding to complete the final calibration, choosing to leave the sculpture to the wind, choosing to pass a wedge to the boy. However, these choices feel more like ceremonial checkpoints than contested decisions with visible cost or friction; there is no moment where she must choose between competing goods or confront a miscalibration. The integration is functional and spans setup, development, and payoff, but the tuner's agency lacks the on-page struggle or trade-off that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The iceberg fragment is introduced in paragraph 5, placed into the sculpture's heart in paragraph 6, becomes the focal point during the comet's pass (paragraph 11, "began to sing—not with sound but with light"), and shrinks to "a pearl of memory" in paragraph 14. It is handled physically (lifted from cedar box, slid into cradle, locked with pin) and its changing state (sweating cold, refracting light, shrinking) alters the sculpture's function and charges the closure image. The object is causally essential—without it, the sculpture cannot sing and the tuner's mission lacks its physical anchor. The fragment's evolution from sea-born ice to light to memory provides a clear through-line and reweights meaning at the ending, satisfying the beat-involvement and closure-linkage criteria.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The phrase "symphonies of truth" is mentioned once in paragraph 6 ("the symphony of truth she had composed without words") and echoed in the final paragraph ("a symphony of truth orbiting itself"). It functions as a thematic label for the tuner's mission but does not shape on-page tactics, create friction, or constrain her choices during the calibration. The concept is described rather than enacted—we are told the sculpture is designed to convey truth, but the story does not dramatize what "truth" means or how it differs from other possible goals. The concept is present and consistent but remains ornamental, swappable with "beauty," "memory," or "wonder" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The "seasonally mute" attribute is established in paragraph 2 ("she had not spoken since the autumn equinox," "her mute quarter") and returns in paragraph 10 ("She calibrated by starlight, seasonally mute") and paragraph 13 ("the mute season cracking open; yet she did not speak"). It frames her communication style (motion, metallic sound) and provides backstory texture. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice with cost—she never faces a moment where speaking would help but she chooses silence, or where silence creates friction. The attribute is functional flavor that colors her actions but remains label-only in terms of causal pressure; it could be removed and the calibration sequence would proceed unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Glistening appears in paragraph 5 ("the droplets glistened like newborn stars"), paragraph 11 ("began to sing—not with sound but with light, refracting..."), and paragraph 16 ("the boy...stared upward...at the after-image still glistening above the clouds"). The action is tied to the iceberg's transformation and the comet's ionic glow, creating visual continuity from setup through climax to ending. It helps mark the sculpture's activation and provides the after-image that the boy witnesses, linking the tuner's work to future wonder. However, "glisten" is one sensory note among many and could be replaced with "shimmer," "gleam," or "radiate" with minor edits; it does not uniquely enable or constrain the plot. The action is present across beats and participates in closure but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The kinetic sculpture is introduced in paragraph 4 ("cantilevered ribs of brass and glacier-forged steel, each joint balanced to tremble at the frequency of human wonder"), becomes the vessel for the iceberg in paragraph 6, and is the focus of the tuner's calibration work in paragraphs 7, 10, and 12 ("adjusting micro-weights," "spin of a counterweight," "sculpture's ribs rocked"). The sculpture's mechanics—counterweights, bearings, micro-oscillations, electromagnetic response—shape the tuner's tactics and are causally essential to the ending, where it continues to "quiet sentence to the sky" after she leaves. Without the kinetic sculpture's specific design and function, the story's central action and closure image collapse. The method is signaled early, developed across multiple beats, and indispensable to the plot.</comment>

<comment>The whispering bluff is anchored in paragraph 1 (basalt stair, precipice, thin air, cloudless hush) and paragraph 8 notes "Villagers in the lowlands claimed the bluff whispered at night" due to the tuner's adjustments. The bluff's altitude matters—thin air, isolation, proximity to sky—and provides the stage where the comet's electromagnetic tail can interact with the sculpture. Paragraph 10 shows "the bluff wind licked" the ice, and paragraph 17 refers to "the bluff continued its quiet sentence to the sky." The setting pressures the tuner's work (harsh conditions, isolation) and is present in the closure image. However, the bluff's specific features (basalt, wind, altitude) do not constrain a discrete on-page choice or alter tactics in a way that another remote mountaintop could not; it functions more as apt stage than irreplaceable constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The phrase "after words become unnecessary" appears only in paragraph 13 ("she understood now that after words become unnecessary, silence is not absence but the resonant cavity"), where it functions as a thematic reflection rather than a timeframe that structures decisions. The story's present action spans dusk through the comet's passage to pre-dawn descent, but this timeline is not pressured by a ticking clock or deadline that alters the tuner's tactics. The mute quarter (autumn equinox to now) is backstory; the comet's seventy-six-year return provides occasion but does not tighten on-page choices—she completes her work without visible time pressure or risk of missing the window. The timeframe is mentioned as theme, not enacted as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The motivation to "preserve the color of wonder" is stated in paragraph 7 ("adjusting micro-weights until the structure's potential song aligned with the color of wonder she feared the earth was forgetting") and echoed in the final paragraph ("preserving the exact shade of awe she had carved into the wind"). It drives the thirty-year project and the night's calibration, providing clear stakes. However, the motivation is told and thematically asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—we do not see her wrestle with doubt, temptation to abandon the work, or competing desires during the calibration itself. The goal shapes the overall arc and closure image but lacks friction or visible cost in the present action; her dedication is complete and uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The tone of "muted vigor" is established early through the tuner's silent determination, the "cloudless hush," and phrases like "dusk's muted vigor" (paragraph 7) and "faint metallic lullabies" (paragraph 8). The tone remains consistent and purposeful: restrained yet driven, quiet yet powerful. It modulates subtly during the comet's arrival (paragraph 11's "light, refracting...ribbons of unseen hues") where the energy intensifies without breaking the muted frame, and it charges the final image where the tuner walks "wordless, tuning the horizon with every footfall." The tone is coherent across beats, reflects the protagonist's seasonally mute state, and supports the thematic resonance of silence as active preservation rather than absence, satisfying high-band criteria.</comment>
