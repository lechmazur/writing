<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The embroiderer's core motivation (listening for unheard stories) and method (disguising wisdom as foolishness) are asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her decision-making at the climax—spreading the cloth, speaking softly—feels smoothly competent without internal contradiction or visible struggle that would foreclose a path. The lieutenant's trembling hand offers a micro turn, but the embroiderer herself never wavers or pays a personal cost; her renunciation or alteration is not legible on the page. Interiority remains at a remove, with stock gestures ("she did not flinch") replacing embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid: the embroiderer gathers intelligence, creates the hidden-layer map, and reveals it at a timed moment to avert the coup. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first two sentences. However, closure cost is largely conceptual—the conspirators "left the chamber changed"—without a visible forfeiture or decisive on-page alteration by the protagonist that narrows her own options. The coup is averted off-page ("dawn arrived without speeches"), and the final image returns her to routine stitching, suggesting Earned Stasis, but the cost that forecloses a path is not made legible in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, autumn wind, stained glass, and mirrored alcove are vividly established and recur across beats. The embroidered cloth and projector glass plate function as micro-setting tools that constrain the reveal. However, spatial choreography during the council-chamber scene (how she walks the corridor, spreads the map, positions the candle beneath the lens) remains abstract; the environment supplies atmosphere but does not force a tactical choice or directly charge the final image when she returns to her stool.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the coup by finishing and revealing the map before dawn—is signaled early. Pressure is linear: she gathers information, stitches the dual-layer map, times the reveal at three bells, and succeeds. The astronomers' laughter and the lieutenant's drawn pistol offer a micro reversal, but his hand trembles and lowers without the embroiderer altering her own tactics or paying a visible price; her soft speech about adjacent possibilities persuades without friction. One meaningful tightening (the three-bell deadline) narrows the window, but escalation remains declarative rather than forcing a trade-off with legible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—wisdom disguised as foolishness, the power of listening, cultural memory versus erasure—emerges from images (dual-layer embroidery, candle flame, children's nonsense song) rather than overt statement. The final image of stitching "quiet stars whose names no one had yet learned to fear" offers thematic resonance. However, the protagonist never confronts a thematic cost or internal contradiction; the resolution is tidy (coup averted, families saved, republic intact) without ambiguity or a non-literal reweighting of the central question. The piece privileges concept over dramatic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature (the embroiderer's craftsperson idiom, attention to thread and flame). The prose occasionally slips into elevated diction that clashes with the focalizer's embodied perspective: "synchronize her heartbeat to the echoed silence," "rewrote the night." Dialogue is minimal and functional; the embroiderer's "quavering voice that sounded senile" is told rather than shown through speech rhythm. Filter verbs ("she listened," "she heard") are frequent but voice-motivated. No head-hopping, but psychic distance flattens during the climax when her soft speech persuades without interior friction or embodied doubt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Phrase recycling and template cadence weaken line-level momentum: "flame from eternal candle" repeats verbatim three times without reweighting; "echoed silence" appears four times as a label rather than dramatized perception; "disguised wisdom as foolishness" is stated twice. Stock constructions ("she did not flinch," "her fingers disguised") flatten peak beats. Paraphrase loops: "conspirators' supply routes" / "supply lines, armory keys, assassination schedules" restates without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: "stars bloomed" (organic) clashes with "safe houses, loyal regiments, escape corridors" (architectural). These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("quiet stars whose names no one had yet learned to fear"), applying −1.7 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dual-layer embroidery mechanic (one image atop another, visible only by flame) offers a fresh twist on the hidden-message trope. The frame—galaxy-chart embroiderer as underestimated operative—synthesizes craft, surveillance, and cultural preservation in a non-obvious way. However, the plot structure (lone operative gathers intelligence, reveals conspiracy, averts coup through persuasion) follows a widely used template without transformation through lived cost or moral calculus. The conspirators' capitulation (trembling hand, lowered pistol) lacks friction; the protagonist's renunciation or risk is not dramatized. Specificity in world detail (cobalt silk, mirrored alcove, children's nonsense song with reversed syllables) elevates texture but does not fully break free of the median safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer is present across all three gates: setup (opening line), development (humming the song, stitching the map), payoff (spreading the cloth, speaking softly about adjacent possibilities). Her choices—finishing the map, timing the reveal, guiding the room's breathing—create the key turn at the council chamber. However, her decisions feel smoothly executed without internal friction or visible trade-off; she never wavers or pays a personal cost. Causal pressure is moderate: her craftwork enables the reveal, but the conspirators' change of heart is persuaded rather than forced. Irreplaceability is high (the exact role matters), but the absence of on-page struggle or forfeiture caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The flame from eternal candle appears in three beats: opening (lighting her work), midpoint (risk of being snuffed by politics), and climax (beneath the projector lens to reveal the hidden layer). Early signal is strong; the second mention foregrounds its fragility. At closure it functions as the mechanism that "ignited the hidden layer," driving the reveal. However, the flame itself is handled passively—she trims the wick at the end—and its properties (eternal, mirrorable, projectable) are asserted more than tested under pressure. Cost tied to the flame is conceptual (cultural erasure if snuffed) rather than a visible on-page tradeoff. Two-gate presence and causal role justify mid-band; lack of embodied struggle with the object caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies shapes the dominant stake from the opening (coup plotters rehearsing) through the climax (hidden-layer embroidery reveals supply lines, armory keys, assassination schedules). The concept is dramatized: she listens, encodes intelligence into the map, and exposes the conspiracy at the projector. It constrains her choices (she must finish before dawn, disguise the content) and alters tactics (dual-layer stitching, nonsense song). Closure directly hinges on the concept: the conspiracy unravels "across the dome ceiling like a confession," and families escape via the revealed corridors. High causal pressure and irreplaceability; the resolution is competently executed but lacks friction or personal cost for the protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Disguises wisdom as foolishness is signaled early ("her fingers disguised wisdom as foolishness") and recurs as a label in the climax ("wisdom disguised as foolishness rewrote the night"). It enables two on-page actions: the astronomers dismiss her as "decorative, a quaint relic" and laugh when she offers a "bedtime story," granting her access to spread the map. However, the attribute is asserted more than embodied; we never see her perform foolishness through speech rhythm, gesture, or micro-choice under pressure. The quavering voice is told ("in a quavering voice that sounded senile") rather than shown in dialogue. Cost is implied (she must endure dismissal) but not dramatized. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) and functional role place it in mid-band; lack of specificity and embodied struggle prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Synchronize appears in three contexts: "synchronize her heartbeat to the echoed silence" (listening method), "began to synchronize the room's breathing" (persuading the conspirators), and "futures now synchronized with hers" (outcome). The second instance is the clearest action beat, enabling the climax turn when her soft speech guides "every eye back to the embroidery." However, the mechanics are abstract—how does she synchronize breathing?—and the action is label-only rather than shown through gesture or speech rhythm. It does not constrain a prior attempt or force a visible cost. Late emergence in full form (climax) and swappability (could be "calmed," "mesmerized") reduce causal necessity. Functional in one beat but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Through adjacent possibilities is introduced via backstory ("learned the method… from her mother, who taught that every stitch rejected becomes a doorway to another pattern") and returns at climax ("speaking softly about adjacent possibilities where the republic survived"). It enables the dual-layer embroidery mechanic and frames her persuasive speech. However, the method's mechanics remain vague: we are told it exists, not shown how a stitch-choice opens a tactical option or imposes a cost. The phrase functions as thematic vocabulary more than dramatized constraint. Setup and payoff are present, but middle development (a choice shaped by the method's rules) is thin. Generic replacement (e.g., "alternative futures," "hidden patterns") would require minor edits only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cobalt observatory in autumn anchors from the opening line ("cobalt silk the exact shade of the observatory dome above her") and recurs across beats (stained glass, great bell tolling three, council chamber, dome ceiling). Autumn wind and seasonal chill frame the timeframe. The setting supplies vivid atmosphere and the projector apparatus that enables the reveal. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or force a tradeoff; she moves freely through corridors, and the environment accommodates her plan. The dome ceiling serves as projection surface at climax, charging the image when constellations rearrange, but the observatory's cobalt hue and autumn season are primarily descriptive. Early signal, moderate beat involvement, closure linkage via projection justify mid-6s; lack of environmental pressure caps score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Before the coup establishes urgency from the opening ("outside, coup plotters moved") and recurs: "Tonight, before the coup, she had to finish the map"; "the great bell tolled three"; "before the coup, wisdom disguised as foolishness rewrote the night"; "dawn arrived without speeches, without gunfire." The timeframe creates a live deadline that narrows her window and drives the three-bell reveal. However, time pressure is largely asserted rather than felt; we do not see her rush, make mistakes, or forfeit an option due to the clock. The coup is averted off-page, and the ending returns her to routine without temporal cost. Strong setup and payoff, but middle tactics are not visibly altered by time scarcity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To listen for unheard stories is signaled early ("she listened for unheard stories hidden between star-threads") and motivates her intelligence-gathering: "they spoke freely above her head," "she listened… because the sky was still unfinished, and there would always be more unheard stories." It frames her role and recurs at closure. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. We do not see her struggle between listening and acting, or pay a personal cost (risk, exhaustion, isolation) for her attentiveness. The desire aligns smoothly with her task without friction. Present across three gates and causally relevant, but lack of embodied conflict or visible tradeoff prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Echoed silence recurs as a label four times: "mirrored alcove… full of silent galaxies"; "synchronized her heartbeat to the echoed silence that followed their careless words"; "the echoed silence was so complete she heard thread fibers crackling"; "the faint, persistent echo of a silence that had once been loud with conspiracy." It establishes tone (watchful, hidden, charged pauses) and modulates at the climax when silence becomes "so complete." However, the phrase functions as descriptive vocabulary more than embodied perception; we are told there is echoed silence rather than shown how sound and quiet shape her choices or the room's pressure. Tone coheres but does not sharpen under stress or distinctly charge the final image, which shifts to "quiet stars" and unfinished sky. Recurrence without functional reweighting or causal constraint.</comment>
