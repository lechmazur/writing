<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and his "lukewarm mage" trait creates a plausible obstacle, but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("those griefs," "brittle devotion") rather than embodied contradiction. The shift from active effort to passive keeper is summarized across years rather than dramatized with visible internal cost. The children and dolphin appear as symbolic placeholders without distinct pressure or relationship dynamics that would test Kael's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the drip rate and rust-to-minnow imagery build density until the bell cracks and the ocean persists through cultural transmission. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ocean endures because remembering becomes collective), with conceptual cost legible in Kael's death and the children's inherited vigilance. Orientation anchors quickly (viaduct, Kael, vanished ocean). The years-long compression sacrifices causal granularity—we jump from ankle-deep water to full whales without on-page escalation of the physical or social stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct's arches and the dry seabed anchor the opening; dawn light striking the bell is purposeful and returns at closure. The bell's rust and the transparent minnows charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear in the single location, and the viaduct's hum and the rising water constrain Kael's decision to stay. The years-long span lacks environmental evolution detail (weather, decay, seasonal change), but the core setting elements—viaduct, bell, drip—drive the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: rebuild the ocean through sustained belief. The drip-rate acceleration (47→46→44 seconds, then doubling) provides one meaningful tightening, and Kael's choice to remain as keeper forecloses his prior life with visible cost (death under the viaduct). However, the escalation is told across years rather than dramatized in a second on-page beat, and the dolphin's warning ("not the faith") introduces a problem that resolves off-page through the children's devotion without a visible tactical pivot from Kael.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the drip-rate mechanic and the shift from individual to collective devotion. The bell's transformation (weeping, rusting, cracking) and the recurring 47-second interval charge the ending without overt moralizing. The final image—"a fish is born… because it must"—reweights the premise with quiet inevitability. Minor slip: "brittle devotion" is named twice as a thematic label rather than remaining fully implicit in the children's ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and clean, with perceptual signature in salt-crusted metal, rust as rebirth, and water tasting like "iron and memory." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the drip-counting, pulling back for the years-long span). The dolphin's dialogue feels slightly elevated but is brief and mythic by design. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("a dolphin, its skin stitched from rust and regret"), but several paraphrase loops appear: "The ocean didn't vanish. The children… kept counting. They taught their children to count" restates the same content across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence in the children's offerings paragraph ("shells… lures… tears") stacks without on-page consequence. The closure paragraph avoids these patterns and lands cleanly, limiting deduction to −0.6 in Q7 under the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The drip-rate-as-belief mechanic and the rust-to-minnow transformation offer fresh specificity, and the shift from lone mage to cultural keeper is a non-obvious synthesis. However, the "lone keeper sustains a cosmic force until a community inherits the duty" frame echoes familiar mythic templates (Prometheus, lighthouse keeper, eternal guardian). Transformation is present but modest; the emotional arc and ending would function similarly if the ocean were replaced by stars or a forest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael's choices—hanging the bell, staying for seven days, becoming the keeper—create the story's major turns and his death triggers the final test (will the ocean vanish?). His earnest naivete is dramatized in his belief that one mage can rebuild the sea, and his decision to stay forecloses his prior life with visible cost. Present in setup (opening), development (choosing to stay), and payoff (his death and the children's continuation). Causal pressure is strong across all three beats; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken ship's bell appears in setup (opening paragraph), is handled in multiple beats (hung, weeping, rusting, ringing, cracking), and its final crack is the hinge for closure—yet the ocean persists. Its transformation (weeping → rust → crack) reweights its meaning from artifact to generative force. The bell's 47-second drip returns as epitaph, directly shaping the ending image. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. Could push higher if its crack had forced an on-page tactical shift from Kael or the children.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Brittle devotion" is named twice and is described as the kind "that keeps a widow polishing her husband's boots," but the concept shapes tactics primarily through Kael's sustained ritual and the children's inheritance. It constrains the middle (Kael stays despite the dolphin's warning) and is reweighted at closure when collective devotion proves less brittle than individual. Present in all three gates but leans toward theme-claim rather than on-page cost differentiation between brittle and durable belief.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Earnestly naive" is named in the opening and enables Kael's belief that he can "right" the cosmic imbalance despite being lukewarm. It constrains his choice to attempt the impossible and persist for seven days. However, the trait does not generate a visible tradeoff or mistake on the page—naivete is an asset here, not a friction. Present in setup and development but does not charge the closure image or create felt cost; more label than enacted constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the story's central action: Kael rebuilds the sea drop by drop, and the children rebuild collective faith. Major turns—the bell weeping, the wave through the arch, Kael's choice to stay, the ocean's persistence after his death—all trace directly to this action. It is signaled early, shapes all three gates, and would be difficult to swap (e.g., "restore" or "summon" would not fit the drip-rate mechanic). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; not quite indispensable because the drip-rate and bell do more mechanical work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Understanding dripping rates" is explained in setup (Academy archives, water carving stone over centuries) and the 47→46→44-second acceleration is the story's pressure mechanism. The method shapes Kael's attempt (hanging the bell, counting seconds) and the doubling rate triggers the wave. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure. Slightly swappable—another slow-accumulation metaphor (tides, erosion) could function similarly—but the specificity of counting seconds and the 47-second epitaph make it nearly irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct is introduced in the opening, its lowest arch is the site where Kael hangs the bell, and dawn light striking the bell is the daily ritual that returns in the ending ("every dawn, beneath the sapphire viaduct, someone still rings the bell"). The viaduct's hum and the wave crashing through its arch constrain Kael's choice to stay. Present in all three gates with solid causal and closure linkage. The "sapphire" descriptor and the arch structure are vivid but not mechanically essential—another structure (bridge, tower) could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last fish is caught" frames the inciting condition (oceans vanished overnight, every fish gone) and creates urgency in the opening. However, once Kael begins his ritual, the timeframe becomes expansive (seven days, then years) without a ticking clock that alters tactics. The frame is present in setup but does not pressure middle choices or charge the closure; the ending focuses on cultural transmission, not the temporal distance from the last fish. Functional but not tight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Kael's desire "to right" the cosmic imbalance is stated in the opening and drives his choice to hang the bell and stay for seven days. The dolphin's challenge ("You've rebuilt the sea, but not the faith") dramatizes friction between the physical and the cultural dimensions of the imbalance. Present in all three gates. However, the motivation is more told than conflicted on the page—Kael's internal doubt or cost of staying is summarized rather than dramatized in a choice beat. Causal but not deeply embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone holds "plausible impossibility" throughout: the ocean vanishing overnight is impossible, yet the drip-counting, rust-to-minnow transformation, and dolphin stitched from rust are presented with matter-of-fact acceptance. The tone modulates subtly (earnest in the opening, elegiac during Kael's vigil, collective at closure) and charges the final image ("Not because it makes sense. But because it must"). Coherent across beats, modulates with pressure, and shapes the ending's register. Strong fit.</comment>
