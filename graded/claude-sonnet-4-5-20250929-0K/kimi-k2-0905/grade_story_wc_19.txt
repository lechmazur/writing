<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "collect the flavors of different silences" drives her ascent with concrete micro-choices (limiting exposure, trading memories, releasing stored silences). Her claustrophobia is embodied through "contracted walls of her lungs" and the final transformation feels earned—she descends with "lungs wide," no longer contained. However, interiority occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction ("intangibly tangible," "gilded hush") that reads more as texture than contradiction. The keeper trade and membrane passage show stakes, but the emotional progression leans heavily on metaphor rather than embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Lira climbs, encounters silences, collects them, then releases them in a pattern-break that reweights her relationship to confinement. Orientation anchors quickly (inverted gravity, xenial trellis, claustrophobic child). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she returns to the bunker transformed, "the walls, now intangibly tangible, could no longer contain her," with visible cost (the empty doll left behind, the lost collection). The reversal—releasing rather than hoarding—pays off prior accumulation. Minor causal softness: the keeper's trade and membrane passage feel more symbolic than mechanically constrained, but the lens holds and cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The xenial trellis constrains choice: planks "yield like memory" until trusted, forcing Lira to limit exposure; the narrowing rail creates a membrane she must break. Sensory details are selective and voice-filtered: "gilded hush coated the air, thick as honey yet weightless, tasting of the silence that follows a last breath." The inverted sky with dangling roots charges the collection beats. Spatial choreography remains clear across ascent and descent. The final image—porcelain doll "wedged between two vines"—anchors closure. The body (lungs, skin, hair tugged by inverted gravity) functions as micro-setting throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (collect silences vs. escape claustrophobia) is signaled early and deepens through the keeper trade and membrane passage. The piece tightens once: Lira chooses to release the silences rather than carry "the bunker inside her forever," forecloses the collection path, and descends transformed. The membrane passage ("stretched her skin until the contracted chambers of her heart unfolded") imposes felt cost. Agency is clear in the final choice. However, escalation relies more on symbolic accumulation than causal pressure; the keeper and membrane feel more like stations than obstacles that narrow options through resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—confronting claustrophobia by releasing rather than hoarding control—emerges through concrete particulars: the doll as vessel, the three named silences (iron-sweet, lullaby, bolt-sigh), the membrane that must be broken. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "she carried the stretched sky in every breath," reweighting confinement as something she can now hold without being held. The piece resists moralizing; the doll "keeping watch" over freed silences adds resonance without stating a lesson. Subtext operates in the choice to leave the doll—a renunciation of her mother's legacy and the collection impulse inherited from her bunker-builder father.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: "the flavors of different silences" filters all observation through Lira's synesthetic frame. Diction is lyric and controlled, with compression that reads purposeful ("intangibly tangible," "audible colors that only the claustrophobic could see"). Register remains within the focalizer's metaphor-dense idiom throughout. No dialogue appears. Minor slips: "She believed that if she could name each quiet, she might stretch the contracted walls of her lungs" tells motivation rather than showing the belief in action, and the phrase "xenial trellis" is repeated without variation, risking echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images anchor voice and closure. Information density is high in collection beats. However, figurative density is unrelenting: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor ("gilded hush," "intangibly tangible," "audible colors," "membrane clung"), and some vehicles contradict (hush is "thick as honey yet weightless," planks "yield like memory" then "firm into certainty"). The phrase "intangibly tangible" recurs without functional shift. Clarity holds, but the prose leans decorative in middle beats ("roots dangling like chandeliers," "porcelain chrysalis") where plain action would tighten momentum. No loops or scaffolding, but template lyricism ("tasted of X," "sprouted," "bloomed") accumulates.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of inverted-gravity hour, claustrophobia-as-lung-constriction, and silence-collecting is specific and non-obvious. The trellis as "reversed cathedral" and the choice to release rather than hoard transform familiar coming-of-age beats. However, the emotional arc (learning to let go, expanding one's world) is structurally familiar, and the lyric mode risks feeling like a genre exercise in fabulist language. The keeper, membrane, and doll function more as symbolic way-stations than lived-in particulars. Strong voice and thematic integrity elevate, but the piece hovers near the boundary of ornament-for-its-own-sake.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's claustrophobia drives setup (crawling from the hatch she feared), middle choices (limiting exposure, trading memory, breaking the membrane), and closure (descending with "lungs wide," no longer contained). Her trait is causally active across all three gates and shapes the final image. Cost is visible: she leaves the doll and the collection behind. High irreplaceability and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The doll appears in setup (carried as only possession), middle beats (transferring silences into its throat and dress, opening its cracked skull), and closure (left "wedged between two vines" as a "porcelain chrysalis"). Its transformation from vessel to abandoned relic charges the release decision and the final watch image. Specificity (porcelain, chipped eyes, secret name Mira) matters; swapping it would break symbolic logic. High integration with closure linkage and cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Gilded hush" is introduced early, recurs as the substance Lira collects, and structures the keeper's trade ("a coil of quiet that sighed like her mother's last exhalation"). It shapes middle tactics (pocketing flavors in the doll) and appears at closure ("ungilded, hers"). However, it functions more as thematic texture than a constraint that narrows options; removing "gilded" would not break causality. Moderate integration with beat involvement but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is introduced early (planks yield then firm when trusted) and recurs at closure ("the walls, now intangibly tangible, could no longer contain her"). It frames her transformation and charges the final image. However, mid-story it disappears; no middle beat turns on this property. The lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not constrain a choice. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with conceptual payoff but limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sprout" appears once in the middle: "The first silence she met sprouted between her teeth when she whispered the doll's secret name." It is swappable with "bloomed" (used for the second silence) or "emerged" without altering causality. The action does not recur or shape closure. Functional but ornamental; low irreplaceability and single-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By limiting exposure" is signaled early ("stepped only three planks forward, letting the hush settle on her skin like gold leaf that could be peeled away if panic rose") and governs her ascent tactics. It does not recur explicitly in middle beats or closure, but the method underlies her cautious climb and frames her claustrophobia management. Moderate integration: setup and implicit middle constraint, but absent from closure. Causal role is present but not charged.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is introduced in setup, structures middle beats (planks that yield, narrowing rail, the keeper encounter), and anchors closure (doll left "wedged between two vines," trellis "trembled, xenial no longer"). It constrains choices (limiting exposure on planks, breaking the membrane at the rail) and charges the final image. High specificity: "xenial" (hospitable, then withdrawn) matters; "lattice of vine and brass" is tactile. All three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The inverted-gravity hour is present in setup, creates urgency in middle beats ("Time thinned; the hour was half gone," "the hour neared its end"), and forces descent at closure ("As gravity slowly righted itself, she descended"). It constrains the window for collection and tightens decisions. However, the mechanics are not tracked precisely; no countdown shapes specific choices. Moderate to strong integration with all three gates and escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to "collect the flavors of different silences" drives setup (her stated goal), middle beats (three named collections: iron-sweet, lullaby, bolt-sigh), and closure (the choice to release them instead). The final reversal—"to collect it would be to carry the bunker inside her forever"—reweights the desire with visible cost. High irreplaceability and causal pressure; friction between collection and freedom charges the ending. All three gates with strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates: confined dread in setup ("countdowns that never reached zero"), breath-held wonder mid-climb ("sweet, like the moment before a lullaby"), and expansive release at closure ("lungs wide, tasting the ordinary hush of wind—thin, ungilded, hers"). The phrase "stretching contracted" governs the arc (lungs, walls, heart "unfolded like paper cranes"). Tone charges the final image. Strong coherence and payoff across all three gates.</comment>
