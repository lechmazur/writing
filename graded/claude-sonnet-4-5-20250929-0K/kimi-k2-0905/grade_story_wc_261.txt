<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and interiority is highly specific (the serum-plant telepathy, the scar wound as text), but the emotional progression feels too smooth given the stakes. The peak choice—reopening the wound—lacks sufficient contradiction or hesitation; the narrator moves through this pivotal self-harm with poetic distance rather than visceral ambivalence. The micro-choices are present but feel pre-determined by the lyric design rather than genuinely conflicted in the moment. Embodied emotion appears ("tasting iron and lilac") but is often abstracted by the elevated register ("cellulose thread, teaching me that scars are simply stories written sideways").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist accepts the scar as a "period" rather than a question mark, achieves the miracle's displacement, and gains a new relationship to grief. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and motif convergence (coffee rings → tunnel, hourglass → red sand, seed swallowed) reweight the dominant stake. One meaningful deepening occurs underground when the miracle demands "fresh loss" and blood becomes language. Cost is legible: the wound reopens, blood is given, and the protagonist carries a new story "heavier by one story." Minor ellipsis at the underground descent is purposeful compression that the piece teaches early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tower, osage tree, windowsill, and underground clay jar supply concrete spatial anchors and constrain action (the protagonist physically roots through stone, the miracle is trapped underground). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "frosted hourglass," "tannic grooves," "phosphorescent xylem." The coffee rings function as micro-setting, enabling the tunnel action that drives the middle beat. The final image (seed on windowsill replacing hourglass) charges closure by making displacement tangible and internal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—releasing the displaced miracle and achieving closure on the sister's death—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the miracle demands "Trade requires fresh loss," forcing the protagonist to reopen the wound with visible cost (blood as apology, scar splitting). Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to "give you back" and performs the reopening. The escalation under the Accumulative lens works through density increase (coffee rings → tunnel → underground jar → rising miracle → seed), and the cost is legible on the page. No second reversal is needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief as unfinished story that must be read and integrated rather than closed—emerges organically from action (reopening wound, blood as syllables, scar as period). The core concept (displaced miracle) integrates cleanly with the theme of misplaced bargains and their belated repair. The final image (swallowing the seed, pulse steady "as any reader closing a book") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution: the sister remains dead, the miracle is internalized rather than restored, and the protagonist is "heavier by one story." Subtext operates in the plants' telepathy as externalized grief and the hourglass inversion as futile bargaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a highly elevated, lyric register ("meteor hush of pre-dawn," "braiding with radicles that tasted of rust and morphine"). The perceptual signature is distinct and consistent—botanical, medical, and memorial diction. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. However, the register strain is considerable: phrases like "chlorophyll code" and "cellulose thread, teaching me that scars are simply stories written sideways" push toward abstract poeticism that risks distancing the reader from embodied urgency. The final lines ("go teach the silence to speak kindly") verge on thematic echo. Under peak stress (underground, reopening wound), the diction stays elevated rather than compressing into sharper immediacy, which slightly flattens pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is very high throughout, creating a lyric texture but risking opacity in key beats. "The stone softened into loam under my fingertips, the way flesh yields when sutures dissolve" stacks metaphor on simile mid-turn. "Scars are simply stories written sideways so the heart can keep beating" in the climax is a thematic statement rather than image-driven closure. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the elevated register and stacked vehicles ("tunnel of coffee rings," "vertebra in the spine of memory," "mason jar of clay") occasionally muddle rather than sharpen. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. The closure image (swallowing seed, pulse steady) is clean and concrete, which anchors the piece despite prior density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of experimental serum, plant telepathy, displaced miracle, and wound-as-text is specific and non-obvious. The coffee-ring tunnel and blood-as-language are fresh particulars that avoid stock fantasy tropes. The emotional truth—grief as unfinished business requiring physical and symbolic reopening—feels earned rather than decorative. However, the "miracle" itself remains abstract; its mechanics and original function are vague, which limits the sense of lived-in consequence. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and follows through to a resonant image, demonstrating conceptual integrity and bold risk-taking within the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "closure seeker who opens wounds" appears in setup (waking after anesthesia, wanting to read scars), drives the middle beat (reopening the wound to release the miracle), and is causally active at closure (swallowing the seed, "the wound did not close into a question mark but into a period"). The character's choices create the key turn underground and the final reconfiguration. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass is handled in the opening (run out, grain snagged), inverted as ritual, and returns transformed at closure (filled with red sand, time restarting). However, it does not constrain a middle choice or enable tactics; its middle use is summary ("I inverted it each visit"). The final transformation is vivid but arrives as consequence rather than active participation. Lyric reprise with reweighted meaning, but limited beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The displaced miracle shapes stakes (protagonist seeks to return it), drives the underground beat (trapped in clay jar, demands fresh loss), and is causally active at closure (rises through coffee rings, inhabits the seed). Removal would collapse the story's central bargain and the sister's death backstory. Present across setup, middle turn, and ending with high irreplaceability and visible cost (blood offering).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accidentally telepathic with plants enables the osage's guidance ("She is still bleeding," "Inside the spiral is the moment you lost," "Step"), which directs the protagonist's actions across multiple beats. The telepathy is established early (serum experiment) and fades at closure ("their telepathy fading with the serum's half-life"), marking a visible arc. It enables middle tactics (listening to roots, phosphorescent xylem showing the miracle) and carries cost (accident, not mastery). Strong beat involvement and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tunneling through coffee rings / stone into underground is the story's central spatial and symbolic action. Signaled early (coffee rings as "tunnel when stared at long enough"), executed in the middle beat ("Down I went, not falling but rooting"), and paid off at closure (miracle rises back through the tunnel). The action is indispensable; removal would eliminate the physical journey that literalizes the emotional descent. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Examining coffee rings is signaled early ("three overlapping halos that formed a tunnel"), guides the protagonist's gaze and descent ("I traced the coffee rings clockwise, then widdershins"), and provides the mechanism for the underground journey. The rings' "tannic grooves" become "a vertebra in the spine of memory." The method matters: without the rings, the tunnel and descent lack a concrete anchor. Present across setup, middle, and ending with strong specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn anchors who/where/when in the opening and supplies the windowsill, courtyard, and underground jar as spatial resources. The tower's isolation supports the introspective tone. However, the setting does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics under pressure; it provides atmosphere more than pressure. The seed resting on the windowsill at closure charges the final image. Functional with closure linkage but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthesia wore off" anchors the opening moment and implies recent surgery/treatment, but elapsed time is vague ("sometime during the night," "dawn had finished its arc"). The clock does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the underground journey and ritual unfold without temporal pressure. The frame establishes context but does not shape tactics or escalate stakes. Present in setup, minimal middle involvement, absent from closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to read the stories in scars is established early ("to open the old wound on my wrist and finally read the stories"), dramatized in the middle beat (unwrapping gauze, scar splitting, blood as syllables), and resolved at closure ("the wound did not close into a question mark but into a period"). The desire conflicts with cost (reopening injury, giving blood) and drives the key choice underground. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Meteor hush appears early ("the meteor hush of pre-dawn," "even alarms sounded like falling stars") and recurs at closure ("the meteor hush deepened into ordinary morning"), marking a tonal shift from cosmic suspension to grounded dailiness. The tone is coherent through turns—quiet, elegiac, elevated—and modulates subtly as telepathy fades and the protagonist integrates loss. The final modulation charges the closure image by signaling return to the mundane with new understanding. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
