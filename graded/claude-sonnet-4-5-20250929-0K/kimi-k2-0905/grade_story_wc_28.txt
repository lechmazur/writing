<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Asha's internal arc from "gentle radical" to "Iron Cradle" is traced through concrete moments (the mother burning the book), but the transformation relies heavily on summarized reflection rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The motivational core—"aberrant mercy"—is told more than shown in conflicted action. Embodied emotion is present in isolated beats (pressing palm to minaret, arranging tesserae) but the peak choice to leave and teach others feels unmotivated by prior on-page causality. The final renunciation lacks visible cost that would foreclose a path with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece attempts a mosaic structure (three months of visions → one night's work → departure → legend) but the transitions are summative rather than dramatized, flattening causal linkage. Orientation is delayed: who Asha is and why she's alone in the ruins isn't anchored until deep in the second paragraph. The closure—Asha's departure and the plaza's organic growth—reads as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted ("what we allowed ourselves to forget") rather than made undeniable through a concrete final image or choice. The orientation debt and summarized key beats prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shattered sky, minaret, and cracked stepping stone are vivid and consistent. The tesserae function as both texture and constraint: the number forty-nine and their placement guide Asha's ritual, charging the final mosaic. Sensory hierarchy (touch over sight) reflects her work and the night setting. However, the plaza's spatial choreography during the closure sequence—how others find the work, how the pattern "spread outward"—remains abstract. The micro-setting (stepping stone) constrains one choice and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate partially.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Asha reconciling memory and forgetting after the fire—is signaled but never tightens through on-page opposition or a forced trade-off. The night's mosaic work unfolds without complication or visible cost; no choice narrows options or raises stakes. The departure is a summary denouement, not a crisis that tests commitment. One meaningful deepening (the map of forgetting) shifts her internal stance, but the escalation remains conceptual rather than dramatized with agency and visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—mercy as selective forgetting rather than universal access—emerges through the mother's choice and Asha's mosaic work. "Knowledge could be both burden and blessing" integrates into her actions without overt moralizing. The final image of the spreading constellation resists tidy closure and offers a resonant answer to the opening question. However, phrases like "empathy's armor" and "cradling the capacity for understanding" edge toward thematic echo, and the ending paragraph's summary voice ("The Iron Cradle became legend") tells rather than shows the theme's aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance and perceptual signature are consistent (touch-focused, reflective). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("retrocognitively trapped," "gentle radical," "Iron Cradle"). However, the narration occasionally slips into elevated register ("empathy's armor," "living document of the city's wounded healing") that feels imposed rather than organic to the focalizer's texture. The final two paragraphs shift to external summary ("They never discovered," "became legend"), loosening POV modesty. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent. However, several passages loop conceptually: "what mercy existed in choosing who deserved to remember" is restated as "greatest mercy lay...in what we allowed ourselves to forget." The phrase "empathy's armor, cradling the capacity for understanding in arms of steel" mixes metaphors (armor/cradle/arms). Template cadence appears in the opening: "had spent...had proven...had once been...had watched." Minor filter-verb stacks ("She'd watched," "had seen") dull immediacy in peak reflection. Propulsion is adequate but density could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—knowledge as burden and the ethics of selective memory—offers a thoughtful angle, but "gentle radical learns nuance after trauma" follows a recognizable arc. The tesserae ritual and "map of forgetting" provide fresh texture, yet the Iron Cradle legend frame and her itinerant teaching fall into familiar closure territory. The mosaic figure with infinite arms is evocative but borders on symbolic convenience. Transformation is present but not bold enough to escape the template's gravity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Asha is present throughout and her past stance ("gentle radical") contrasts with her current solitary work. Her choices—gathering forty-nine pieces, arranging the mosaic, departing—advance the plot. However, the "gentle radical" identity functions more as backstory label than a trait that actively constrains or enables on-page decisions with visible cost. The character drives the story but the specific attribute could be swapped for other ideological backstories without breaking structure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tesserae appear early (touching minaret base), drive the middle beat (gathering exactly forty-nine), and shape the closure (new constellation created from them). Each piece represents a memory released, and their chipped patterns guide Asha's hands. The mosaic work is on-page and causal. The element touches three beats and charges the final image, though the ending summary dilutes direct presence. Strong integration with minor closure dilution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named explicitly ("that image had renamed Asha") and shapes the thematic question. It drives Asha's shift from universal access to selective forgetting. However, the concept is more reflected upon than tested through conflicting choices with visible stakes. The mosaic work embodies it symbolically but does not force a trade-off that narrows options. Present across beats and closure-adjacent, but pressure remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped in cycles of memory" appears early and establishes her visions of the fire. It provides backstory texture but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost. The visions are summarized rather than experienced in scene, and her present work (touching tesserae, arranging mosaic) does not depend on this trait. Functional setup but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rename" appears twice: "that image had renamed Asha" and the city calling her "Iron Cradle." The action links her transformation to the moment she witnessed the mother's choice and motivates her solitary ritual. However, the renaming itself is asserted rather than shown through a decision or turn that alters tactics. It participates in closure thematically but is not indispensable to story logic; her arc could function with different language. Solid integration but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" are introduced in the middle, guide her tessera arrangement, and transform the Merciful Judge constellation into outstretched arms. The stepping stone shapes the method of her ritual and appears in the closure image. She takes it with her, linking it to her future teaching. Present in setup, middle work, and ending; the mechanics matter and the element is causally active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" frames the entire scene and provides spatial continuity. The plaza's isolation enables Asha's solitary work and becomes the site of communal healing after she leaves. However, the setting does not pressure her choices during the mosaic work; the night and ruins are atmospheric but passive. The "shattered sky" recurs but remains descriptive. Present throughout but not constraining tactics until the final summary.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the great fire" anchors backstory and the forty-nine days (fire start to rain) structure her gathering. The timeframe motivates her catalog work and the city's need for healing. However, the present-scene time (one night's work until dawn) does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The fire is setup, the night is durational rather than pressured. Functional framing but not a live constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated explicitly and visualized in the mosaic figure with infinite arms. The motivation links her past radicalism to her present ritual and teaching. However, the desire is told ("she understood that she was building...empathy's armor") rather than tested through conflicting pulls with visible cost. It shapes the thematic closure but is not dramatized as a friction that alters on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is implicit in the Iron Cradle epithet and the tension between Asha's compassionate goal (empathy) and her solitary method (steel, alone in ruins). The tone modulates from reflective (opening visions) to tactile (night work) to distant summary (legend frame). However, the tone does not sharpen under pressure; the mosaic work unfolds without emotional friction. Present and coherent but static rather than charged by turns.</comment>
