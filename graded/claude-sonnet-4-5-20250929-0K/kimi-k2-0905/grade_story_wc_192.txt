<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shadow keeper's motivations are established through embodied detail (practicing breath-holding, scars traced), and the boy's suffocation under parental expectations is specific. However, the protagonist's arc feels more like a repeated ritual than an evolving choice—she performs the same role without internal contradiction or stakes that test her. The final "gift" of the boy's first breath arrives without visible cost to her stance or methods, making the change feel conferred rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow keeper learns to breathe through suffocation). Orientation is clear early. The closure image—"tomorrow she would practice suffocating again"—does reweight the opening practice, but the cost remains oblique: we don't see what path she has foreclosed or what tactical shift this gift imposes. The ritual structure flattens causality; the boy's dissolution feels inevitable rather than contingent on her choices, weakening the closure's felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary with collapsed roof and scorched circle anchors the scene vividly and constrains the ritual space. The doorknocker ring is handled twice (pressed to chest, then to the boy's chest), charging the threshold motif. Starlight filtered "like frozen tears" recurs, lending cadence. The setting does not constrain a choice—it serves as stage rather than obstacle—but the micro-setting (the scorched circle, the iron ring) supports the final image enough to enter the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the boy to cross over—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is minimal: the shadow keeper performs a familiar ritual without adaptation or setback, and the boy's resistance flickers but never forces a tactical shift. The ending reconfigures the keeper's understanding (suffocating as beginning, not ending) but the arrival of this insight feels passive, a gift rather than a choice under pressure. One meaningful deepening is present but lacks visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the paradox of suffocating to breathe, avoiding overt moralizing until the final implied practice. The scars-as-bridges metaphor accumulates resonance, and the boy's realization—"You're teaching me to suffocate so I can breathe?"—lands as earned dialogue rather than thesis. The ending reweights the opening breath-holding without stating a moral. The core concept integrates with theme through specific ritual rather than abstraction, though the symmetry (she teaches, he dissolves, she continues) risks tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the breath-sharing, wider for exposition). Diction is consistent and voice-specific: "loaded emptiness," "frozen tears," "stones into a deep well." Dialogue feels natural and advances the thematic question. Brief filter verbs ("she felt," "she noticed") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The prose rhythm shifts with pressure—short sentences during the ritual, longer reflection afterward—without head-hopping or tense drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and momentum is steady, but several paraphrase loops appear: "suffocated under the weight of being loved too much" / "the crushing expectation of being their perfect son"; "She burned every bridge carefully" echoes "each one a bridge she had carefully burned"; "threshold" recurs eight times, some ornamental. Figurative density is high throughout ("memories burned like embers," "candle about to die," "words falling like stones"), occasionally muddling register. The opacity does not break causality but dulls propulsion in mid-beats. Apply −0.8 for loops and density; cap at 6.9 per artifact spread.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—teaching ghosts to breathe by suffocating—offers a fresh inversion of the psychopomp trope, and the scars-as-bridges detail is specific. However, the ritual structure and the "savior who suffers" arc follow familiar templates without bold risk. The boy's dissolution feels predetermined rather than contingent, reducing surprise. Emotional truth is present (the weight of expectations) but the synthesis does not reach non-obvious territory; the transformation test suggests plot and arc could transfer to a different keeper and ghost with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The shadow keeper is present throughout and makes key moves: extends her hand, leads the boy to the circle, presses the ring, urges him to cross. However, these actions follow a prescribed ritual rather than adaptive decisions under pressure. Her stance shifts at the end (understanding suffocation as beginning), but this change arrives as received gift rather than costly choice. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is observation-led. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but ornamental ritual execution −0.6, swappability −0.7. Start 3.0, net +1.0 → 4.0; closure gift without visible cost on her part caps at 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring is handled twice: pressed to the keeper's chest (paragraph 1) and to the boy's chest (paragraph 24), both times named as "threshold." It anchors the core concept and charges the ritual beat. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (iron, threshold function) +0.5. However, its properties do not constrain a choice—it is used as symbol rather than tool with mechanical consequence—and the reprise is more echo than reweighting. Start 3.0, net +3.2 → 6.2; round to 6.4 for purposeful recurrence that charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fading threshold is signaled early ("the place between staying and leaving") and shapes the ritual's stakes: the boy must cross it, and his form "flickered more violently now, fighting against the fading threshold." The concept defines the method (teaching to cross by sharing pain) and the keeper's role. Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (narrows the boy's options to cross or remain) +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6. Start 3.0, net +5.3 → 8.3; slight swappability (could substitute "boundary" with edits) −1.1 → 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" appears as label in paragraph 12 and retrospective claim in paragraph 31 ("I burned every bridge carefully"). The trait does not constrain an on-page action—we do not see her refuse contact or test a bridge-burning choice under present pressure. The boy's dissolution is his bridge-crossing, not hers. Two gates (setup as backstory, thematic payoff); no middle development. Early retrospective −0.4, label-only −0.6, summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.5. Start 3.0, net −2.1 → 0.9; late thematic echo without visible cost caps near default; adjust to 5.1 for thematic resonance that primes the closure motif.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Encroach" signals the boy's arrival (paragraph 7: "one such fragment encroached upon her solitude") and defines the inciting incident. The ghost's presence forces the ritual sequence. Two gates (setup, development into ritual); closure is the boy's crossing, not further encroachment. Early signal +0.7, one beat (arrival) +0.4, causal pressure (initiates the ritual) +1.0. However, the action is swappable—any ghost arrival would serve—and it does not return or charge the ending. Start 3.0, net +2.1 → 5.1; swappability −0.7 and missing closure participation (late cap 4.6 waived as inciting) → 6.7 for clean inciting function and signal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Linking through scars is signaled (paragraph 16: "his scars glowed faintly"), demonstrated in the hand-touch beat (paragraph 18), and central to the ritual (paragraph 29: "linking their scars together like matching wounds"). The method shapes the tactic—shared pain until bearable—and appears in the ending resolution. Three gates met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables the ritual's mechanism) +1.3, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.7. Start 3.0, net +5.3 → 8.3; slight summary (mechanics told more than shown in real-time sensation) −0.6 and swappability (could substitute "wounds" or "marks") −0.3 → 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary is anchored early (paragraph 2) with vivid detail (collapsed roof, starlight, charcoal stones) and houses the scorched circle (paragraph 22) where the ritual occurs. Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, two beats (arrival, ritual site) +0.9, closure linkage (she remains in the sanctuary at the end) +0.8, specificity (ashen, charcoal, starlight filter) +0.6. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—it stages rather than pressures—and the details could frame a different ritual. Start 3.0, net +3.0 → 6.0; postcard risk −0.5, but micro-setting (scorched circle, iron ring) that charges ritual +1.4 → 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Three months had passed since she cut off all contact" (paragraph 3) sets the timeframe but does not tighten present decisions. The isolation is backdrop; no clock or deadline alters tactics during the ritual. One gate (setup); missing middle and closure participation (time does not shift or pressure the ending). Early signal +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.7 (any duration would serve), summary-only −0.5. Start 3.0, net −1.6 → 1.4; late cap 4.6 not applied (setup met); adjust to 4.2 for framing function without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach suffocating to breathe" is dramatized: the keeper practices breath-holding (paragraph 13), tells the boy "That's not how breathing works" (paragraph 21), and enacts the ritual explicitly (paragraphs 22–35). Three gates met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (defines the ritual's method and goal) +1.2, closure linkage (the keeper learns the lesson herself at the end) +1.1. However, the friction between this want and a competing cost is thin—she performs the ritual smoothly without visible sacrifice or temptation to refuse. Start 3.0, net +4.3 → 7.3; missing on-page friction or trade-off −0.7 → 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" is signaled early ("iron weight," "ashen," "fragments of souls") and sustained through "the boy's eyes held the loaded emptiness of someone who had forgotten how to breathe" (paragraph 11) and "the loaded emptiness of the truth" (paragraph 33). The tone modulates: heavy and static during exposition, pressured during the ritual, breathed-open at the end. Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, coherent modulation under pressure +1.2, closure linkage (final starlight image charged by prior emptiness) +1.4, specificity +0.5. Start 3.0, net +5.2 → 8.2; slight phrase-recurrence flatness −0.4 → 7.8.</comment>
