<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's stance is consistent—seed guardian driven by heritage—and embodied details anchor her choices (breath into the cap, cracking it to share the spiral). However, interiority leans abstract ("collective memory murmur," "furiously tranquil promise") and misses concrete contradiction or struggle; the cap's solution arrives without visible hesitation or cost that tests competing impulses. The final walk feels more like thematic coda than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to circulation stance): she splits the bead, integrating half into seeds and half into herself, then walks out as "spiral bearer." The lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered imagery, cadence shifts, density increase around the vortex sequence). Cost is conceptual and relational—she becomes the new axis, carrying spirals forward—but the on-page price is oblique; we see the cap "now empty of seeds but full of spirals" without a dramatized forfeiture or visible tradeoff in the moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when she chooses "circulation" over preservation or surrender, narrowing options under the inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is vividly rendered (frost-feathered orchard, fountain shedding ice skin, starlight seeping through glass) and the oak acorn cap functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice—she places it on ice, breathes names into it, uses it as cradle for seeds. Spatial choreography is clean (walkway, fountain center, snowfield exit). The setting charges the closure: the atrium's dome "glinted once… then dimmed," and the snowfield becomes the stage for her spiral-bearer walk, fulfilling the Q3 9+ gate of environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: reopen linear time by decreasing entropy to save possibility itself. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vortex awakens and she must act; the choice to split the bead (circulation vs. preservation/surrender) narrows options and forecloses the path of simple release. However, the escalation is more textural accumulation than protagonist-driven pressure—obstacles (frozen atrium, vortex spin) yield without visible struggle or tactical cost. The final act carries conceptual weight but lacks a dramatized tradeoff or visible price paid on the page that would push this into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—saving seeds as saving possibility, circulation vs. stasis—emerges from concrete images (seeds orbiting, sap that "never knew decay," fractured cap) rather than statement. The ending offers a resonant answer: she becomes the path by splitting the spiral, embodying the cycle rather than choosing preservation or collapse. The final image (breath as "small white vortex") reweights prior material without overt moral. Minor: "wild serenity" and "furiously tranquil" approach label-speak in peak beats, and the grandmother's lullaby callback feels slightly engineered, but the thematic synthesis is specific and non-obvious.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and textured, with a consistent elevated register ("wild serenity," "silk soaked in dawn," "chronicle") and controlled psychic distance. However, the diction occasionally drifts toward abstract poeticism that blurs immediacy ("furiously tranquil," "murmur: We are the unspent future") and repeats syntactic stems ("felt," "She walked," "breath"). No head-hopping; POV remains stable. The compression and patterned repetition serve the accumulative lens, but under peak pressure (vortex moment, choice to split) the voice stays ornamental rather than tightening, missing the rhythmic escalation expected at 8+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often effective ("frost feathered," "time would pool," "silk tearing and mending"), but overwriting in high-pressure beats reduces clarity: "furiously tranquil" appears three times, "wild serenity" twice, and mixed metaphors muddle sense ("time exhaled," "fold itself into seed coats"). Paraphrase loops: the cap's warmth and summer memory are restated across two paragraphs without added detail. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" stems. Information density is high, but the closure beat's figurative pile ("silk soaked in dawn," "spirals," "crunching… tearing and mending") obscures the mechanical cost of her choice. Apply −0.6 for density + coherence issues, −0.3 for stem repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—heirloom seeds, vortex inheritance, decreasing entropy via ancestral memory and a living-sap acorn cap—is specific and non-obvious. The choice to "circulate" rather than preserve or surrender offers a fresh inflection on the seed-saving premise. However, the core frame (magical keeper restores broken time using heritage artifact and family lore) follows a familiar structure, and the emotional arc lacks the lived friction or moral calculus that would transform the template. The lyric execution elevates but does not fully escape the derivative seed-guardian/temporal-reset blueprint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present by paragraph one (setup ✓). She walks onto the walkway, opens the tin, kneels, places the cap, breathes names, touches sap to vortex, lifts the cradle, splits the bead (development ✓✓). The split-bead choice drives the ending and her walk as spiral bearer (payoff ✓). Causal pressure: her actions narrow options (choosing circulation) and the final walk embodies the new role. Cost: she becomes the axis, carrying spirals forward—conceptual and felt. Irreplaceability: her role as seed saver and memory keeper is essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup ✓ (paragraph five, warm keepsake). Development ✓✓: she places it on ice (paragraph thirteen), it unfolds to reveal sap (fourteen), she uses it as cradle for seeds (seventeen), lifts it (eighteen), cracks it to split the bead (twenty-two). Payoff ✓: "fractured acorn cap… now empty of seeds but full of spirals" (final paragraphs). Causal: the cap's sap slows the vortex; cracking it enables the circulation choice. Cost: splitting the cap is the physical act that divides the spiral, forecloses other paths. Irreplaceability: the oak lineage and sap's unspent nature are unique; no generic container could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup ✓ (paragraph three: "the egg that contained a vortex inheritance"). Development ✓: the vortex awakens, draws seeds, spins the cyclone (paragraphs seven–eleven); she must interact with it to reopen time. Payoff ✓: she splits the bead (the vortex's condensed form) in paragraph twenty-two, integrating half into seeds and half into herself. Causal pressure: the vortex's spin and the requirement to slow it shape her tactics. Cost: becoming the new axis is tied to absorbing the vortex. The concept is more atmospheric premise than on-page constraint—she does not navigate competing inheritance rules or sacrifice one legacy for another—so it trends mid-high rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup ✓: "furiously tranquil" appears in paragraph two. Recurs in paragraphs fifteen ("wild serenity") and twenty-five ("furiously tranquil promise"). Payoff: the phrase charges the final image of her walk and the horizon's promise. However, the attribute is label-only; it describes atmosphere rather than constraining or enabling a choice with tradeoff. She does not face a dilemma where tranquility under fury costs her speed or clarity. It functions as tonal motif—present and resonant—but not as a trait that alters tactics or forecloses a path, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup ✓ (paragraph four: "reopen its path"). Development ✓✓: she acts to reopen time by slowing the vortex (paragraph fifteen), and the atrium "exhales" as time resumes (twenty-three). Payoff ✓: the ending hinges on her success—tomorrow will arrive, the future can "find its way back." Causal: the reopen action defines her goal and the stakes; her methods (sap touch, bead split) serve that aim. Cost: reopening requires her to become the axis, carrying the spiral forward. Irreplaceability: swapping "reopen" for a synonym like "restart" would not change structure, and the mechanics are oblique, so it trends high but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup ✓ (paragraph four: ledger warns she must decrease entropy). Method signaled ✓: paragraph twelve states "to decrease entropy" she must "unknot what had already frayed." Development: she breathes ancestral names into the cap (paragraph thirteen) and touches sap to the vortex rim (fifteen), acts framed as entropy reduction. Payoff: the vortex slows, frost retreats "into earlier geometries" (sixteen), implying reversal. However, the mechanics are metaphorical—how breathing names or touching sap decreases entropy is not dramatized as a constraint or tradeoff. The method labels her tactics but does not shape competing attempts or visible cost, so it remains functional but abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup ✓ (title and paragraph one: "icebound atrium," starlight through glass). Development ✓✓: the frost-feathered orchard and frozen fountain supply the physical stage; she walks the frost-rimmed walkway (paragraph nine), kneels on ice (thirteen), and the atrium's walls thin as time resumes (twenty-three). Payoff ✓: the dome "glinted once… then dimmed" (final paragraph), and her exit onto the snowfield completes the spatial arc. Causal pressure: the ice and glass create the hermetic space where the vortex can awaken; the setting's transformation (ice retreating, walls clearing) signals success. Cost: leaving the atrium means stepping into the glacial world. Specificity: starlight and ice are vivid and charged.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup ✓ (paragraph three: "after the egg hatched"). The timeframe anchors causality—she arrives post-hatch, in the vortex's active window. However, no live clock or countdown tightens decisions; "tonight" and "when she exited… dawn was still hours away" offer only loose markers. The urgency is atmospheric (vortex spinning, time pooled) rather than tracked pressure. Payoff: the ending implies cyclical time—"until the next egg hatched"—but this is thematic echo, not a beat-by-beat constraint. The timeframe is present and logically consistent but does not alter tactics or force a tradeoff, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup ✓ (paragraph six: "to discover the texture of borrowed time"). Development: she handles the warm cap and understands "it was the key to discovering the texture" (six); later she "felt its weightlessness, and understood that borrowed time felt like silk soaked in dawn" (eighteen); the final lines describe "the texture of borrowed time crunching beneath every step." Payoff ✓: the closing image fulfills the motivation. However, the desire is more quest frame than conflicted want—she does not choose between discovery and another competing goal, and the "discovery" is declarative understanding rather than a choice with visible cost. It shapes the thematic arc but not a beat-by-beat tradeoff, so it trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup ✓ (paragraph two: "furiously tranquil"; paragraph eight: "wild serenity"). Recurs in paragraphs fifteen ("wild serenity rippling outward"), twenty-five ("furiously tranquil promise"), and twenty-eight ("wild serenity of the night"). Payoff ✓: the tone charges the final image—her breath as "small white vortex" in the night's wild serenity. The oxymoron is coherent and modulates with pressure (calm atrium → vortex spin → resolution). However, the tone is maintained by repetition of the label rather than embodied shifts in syntax or rhythm that reflect the dual quality under stress, so it functions as atmospheric anchor more than structural constraint.</comment>
