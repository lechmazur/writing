<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior voice is established through her trained detachment versus innate empathy, and the choice to swallow her own bottled emotions is embodied with clear cost ("terrifying and bright"). However, much of her characterization relies on told attributes ("courageous anomaly," "calmly intuitive") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final confrontation with the Keeper and her return feel more thesis-driven than psychologically inevitable, reducing the visceral stakes of her transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a hybrid lens—causal mechanics (mirror-entry, fragment reconstitution) nested in an accumulative/textural frame (empathy mapping). Orientation anchors arrive clearly: Mara, orchard, mirrors, shard. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (reflection trapped as collateral, empathy dripped into future dreams), and the final image ("voice steady, heart unhidden") reweights the detachment premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara swallows her bottled empathy and confronts the Keeper. Minor causality wobble: the revocation phrase and harbor-market mechanics arrive late without prior setup, relying on exposition ("taught only in nightmares") rather than earlier cues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, shifting ice floes, and vintage mirrors create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Mara's tactics (mirrors as "only reliable window," ice clock ticking toward dawn). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional lens (peacekeeper duty, border-keeping). The memory-harbor's foggy pier and crate-market offer atmospheric specificity, though the transition lacks spatial grounding—how Mara moves through the doorway and navigates the market remains abstract. The final image (sphere on bough, locked ice) charges the ending, pushing the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—map empathy onto action before the orchard forgets how to care—is signaled early and drives Mara's choices. Pressure tightens when the border thins and the ice threatens the lighthouse at dawn, forcing her mirror-entry. The swallowing of her own empathy ("terrifying and bright") is a clear escalation with embodied cost, and the confrontation with the Keeper narrows options (he dissolves, the harbor collapses). However, the revocation phrase and harbor-market rules arrive late without prior constraint or failed attempt, reducing the sense of earned agency. One meaningful deepening is present and scaled appropriately for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—detachment versus empathy as protocol—emerges through concrete action (swallowing bottled emotions, revocation phrase, sphere dripping into dreams) rather than thesis statement. The final image (orchard tasting of apples instead of salt, bell ringing, voice steady) reweights the premise without moralizing. The Keeper's self-fragmentation to scatter conscience is a strong conceptual anchor. Minor demerit: "mapping feeling onto action became the only protocol that mattered" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, though it remains embedded in action (sphere's function) rather than naked assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, third-person limited with a lyric-poetic register that matches the mythic premise. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during empathy-swallowing, cooler during exposition of the harbor-market). Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue, so naturalism and subtext bullets are moot. The perceptual signature—border-keeping vocabulary, emotional residue on objects, mirror-warping—is character-specific and sustained. Diction occasionally tilts elevated ("weighted breath before reply," "bruise-colored clouds") but reads intentional rather than register-drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual cadence; no template runs. Information density is high (each beat advances Mara's goal or world-rules). However, figurative language clusters densely without always earning its space: "shadow-laced peacekeeper," "emotions flew home like startled gulls," "dissolving into dark water that tasted of every tear" stack metaphor in quick succession, some functional, some decorative. Minor paraphrase loop: the orchard "tasting of ripe apples instead of salt" echoes the earlier closure that the border is now a bridge. No major clarity breaks, but the density of lyric phrasing in peak beats (Keeper confrontation, return) nudges slightly into overwriting without full payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—peacekeepers who bottle and sell empathy, a fragmented conscience scattered to prevent future intervention—offers a fresh synthesis of detachment-as-trauma and memory-commodification. The lighthouse orchard and vintage mirrors as setting-tools feel specific rather than stock. The revocation phrase and self-swallowing of empathy are bold, non-obvious choices. Minor demerit: the memory-market mechanics and crate-labeling ("M. Vale—Empathy, surplus") lean toward allegory-convenience, and the Keeper's dissolution into tear-water risks symbolic obviousness. Overall, the piece commits to its premise and follows implications without retreat, earning mid-7s for originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (shadow-laced peacekeeper) is present throughout, drives the mirror-entry, swallows her bottled empathy (middle turn), confronts the Keeper (climax), and hangs the sphere (closure). Her choices—stepping into mirrors, feeding the shard her sorrow, speaking the revocation—create every major beat. The character is indispensable; no swappable protagonist could execute these trained-yet-transgressive moves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment appears in the opening (Mara's hand), is fed her sorrow (middle), pulses and completes itself during the Keeper confrontation, and reconstitutes into a sphere hung on the bough (closure). Its fracture lines guide the vision, its incompleteness drives the urgency, and its transformation charges the final image. The object is causally active across setup, development, and payoff, with visible cost (Mara's reflection trapped as collateral).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is stated early ("born able to see... yet trained to suppress") and shapes Mara's unique position. However, it functions more as backstory label than on-page constraint. The anomaly enables her to see emotional residue and choose to swallow her empathy, but the trait itself does not force a visible tradeoff or alter tactics under pressure—any peacekeeper willing to break protocol could attempt the same moves. Present and functional, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is told ("Calmly intuitive, she let the fragment warm") but not demonstrated through a constrained choice. Mara waits for the mirrors to wake and breathes to match the sea's cadence, which reads as method rather than trait-driven cost. The attribute is mentioned early but does not enable or constrain a decision with visible price; it could be removed with minimal rewrites. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the central action: Mara's goal is stated early ("needed to reconstitute the full vision"), she feeds the shard her sorrow (middle), the fragment pulses and forms a single scene (harbor), and the shard becomes a perfect sphere by the ending. The action drives the plot's major turn (vision completion enables confrontation) and is paid off at closure. Removing "reconstitute" would require a different mechanic for the vision-quest and sphere creation; the specificity makes it hard to swap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors are introduced early (paragraph two: "nailed to the trunks years ago... now her only reliable window"), used actively when Mara steps into the ring and the fracture widens into a doorway (middle), and implicitly present when the orchard mirror seals, trapping her reflection (closure participation). The method shapes her tactics (waiting for the mirrors to wake, pressing shard to oldest mirror) and the cost (reflection as collateral). Setup, development, and payoff are all present; the mirrors are purpose-specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is anchored early and provides a ticking clock (ice will grind the lighthouse at dawn), forcing Mara's urgency. The setting supplies the mirrors (vintage store mirrors on trunks) and the final stabilization (ice locks solid, orchard now tastes of apples). The location is vivid and constrains choice, appearing in setup, middle pressure, and closure. However, the orchard itself is more stage than active pressure—most tactical work happens via the mirrors and memory-harbor. Strong integration, but the setting does not alter Mara's moves as directly as the mirrors do.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" opens and closes the story as a lyric frame and evokes suspended urgency. However, the timeframe is never tracked as a live constraint. The ice-dawn clock is mentioned once ("before the floes ground the lighthouse from its perch at dawn") but does not tighten Mara's decisions or force tempo changes. The phrase recurs at the end ("The weighted breath before reply ended"), but as thematic closure rather than temporal pressure. Present and resonant, but does not function as a timeframe that alters tactics. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Map empathy onto action" is stated as Mara's motivation early ("her motivation sharpened") and dramatized when she swallows her bottled empathy, confronts the Keeper, and ensures future keepers will receive empathy dripped into dreams. The desire drives the middle and ending beats, and the cost (terror, heart unhidden) is embodied. The motivation is irreplaceable—removing it would gut the thematic arc and closure image. Strong causal integration with felt price.</comment>
