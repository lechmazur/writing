<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet exhibits a clear artistic motive and the text attempts interior contradiction ("certainty…tremor"), but interiority is abstract and label-driven ("aesthetically driven," "tremor of certainty") rather than embodied through competing impulses in scene. Her risk of re-freezing is stated but never forces a visible micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The "lantern-moth hush" and quartz-recognition beats provide atmospheric texture, yet no genuine struggle or flaw complicates her execution—she succeeds via poetic assertion without on-page cost that forecloses a lived option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines and the piece holds single-POV across a continuous scene. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through density of image and cadence shift rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights "boundary" and "law" as "rough draft of light"—but the cost remains asserted rather than felt: no tactical path is foreclosed, no relationship severed, no body marked. The lake's transformation and the poet's forward motion read as triumph without visible sacrifice, weakening the CR's undeniability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake supply vivid, purposeful anchors; sensory detail (A-flat hum, green glow, hairline fissures) is selective and filtered through the poet's perception. The quartz pillars constrain her method (she must let them "paraphrase themselves") and the ice's density shift charges the final crossing. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ellipse walk and lake traverse, and the setting evolution (ice to mist) tracks causally with her recitation, meeting the micro-setting test for choice constraint and closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: rewrite boundary law through poetic paraphrase. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening occurs when "None shall pass" becomes "None shall stay," altering the decree's semantic charge. However, the protagonist faces no live opposition or trade-off—her boots touch water "that had forgotten how to be solid" without on-page cost (stamina, social consequence, or risk of error). The stated risk of mispronunciation never materializes as a near-miss or tactical pivot, leaving escalation asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—law as mutable text, perception as revision—emerges from concrete image (quartz lattice rewriting, ice as calligraphy) rather than assertion. The final metaphor "every law is a rough draft of light" is non-literal and reconfigures the opening ban into editorial work. Yet the poet's internal arc is thin: she arrives already certain, performs her art, and departs without a thematic question that the ending answers under pressure. The piece leans on elegance of articulation more than earned wisdom from struggle, and the closing editor-comparison edges toward overt theme statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV maintained throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—her way of noticing privileges acoustic ("A-flat," "harmonics") and textural metaphor ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated; elevated register ("recusant," "phoneme," "ordinance") fits a poet focalizer. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (repeated noun-verb inversions, lyric parallelism) are taught early and held to closure. No filter-verb stacks or dialogue to judge; psychic distance remains stable, and the prose rhythm modulates from contemplative opening to accelerated crossing without register breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative density is high but coherent within lyric mode. Minor loop: "tremor of certainty" recurs four times without reweighting; late mentions feel like reminders rather than pressure shifts. Paraphrase slippage: "law into suggestion" and "ordinance" versus "environment" restate the same transformation within adjacent lines (−0.2). Some lines do double duty (e.g., "She recited…her version sang" advances action and theme), but sustained metaphor strings in middle paragraphs ("membrane became mist, mist became chorus") risk decorative drift. No grammar breaks; propulsion is steady but occasionally slowed by ornamental layering in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of poet-as-legal-editor and language-as-ice-rewriting offers a non-obvious angle. The "horizon"/"my reason" rhyme breach and resulting mirror-crack provide specific backstory that grounds the concept. However, the emotional truth is thin—success arrives without surprise or self-revision—and the final editor metaphor borders on overt thesis. Transformation test concern: swap "poet" for "musician" or "dancer" and the arc holds with surface edits, suggesting the freshness relies more on diction than irreplaceable character or stakes. No close echoes of famous work detected; the piece commits to its premise but hedges risk by ensuring the protagonist never stumbles.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Cloud-shadow poet is present throughout and her choices (pressing palm, walking the ellipse, forming the final couplet) create beats. She signals the method early, applies it at mid-scene, and her stride into the lake is the closure action. However, her decisions do not narrow options or face visible friction—she executes a plan without alteration. Two gates (setup, closure) are met; middle development is observational rather than constrained. Causal pressure is modest; the lake responds to her will rather than testing it. Swappability concern: another artist-type (dancer, singer) could perform similar functions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Humming quartz colonnade is handled in three beats: initial greeting (A-flat hum), palm-press recognition that sings louder, and mid-scene paraphrasing (A-flat to G-sharp). It enables her method (lattice rewriting) and the harmonics braid with her heartbeat, constraining her timing. The pillars' satisfaction and dimming at closure provide charged reprise. All three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are solid. Cost connection is indirect (she must listen and let them teach) but present. Specificity is high; no generic "wall" or "monument" could replicate the acoustic constraint. Strong integration across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core concept "tremor of certainty" appears five times but operates more as theme label than stake-shaping force. It is stated to mark her pulse as recusant and to name the final ripple, yet it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. Middle development is ornamental: "certainty returned…as warmth inside her ribs" recounts an internal shift without dramatized cost. Setup and closure presence earn minimal gates, but the concept remains swappable with "pulse of defiance" or "rhythm of change" without structural loss. Decorative mention deduction applies.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Attribute "aesthetically driven" appears twice as label: opening assertion and late callback ("aesthetically driven to follow"). It does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost; her choices (dissolving margins, listening to moths) are motivated by the artistic goal, but the trait itself is told rather than shown through a trade-off or error. Setup gate met (first paragraph), but middle and closure participation are absent—she does not sacrifice practical safety for aesthetic purity in a dramatized beat. Swappability high; "artistically motivated" or "creatively compelled" would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Action "paraphrase" is signaled early ("paraphrase the boundary law"), executed at mid-scene ("where the original read 'None shall pass,' her version sang 'None shall stay'"), and the pillars "paraphrase themselves" in response, driving the ice transformation. The climax—her final couplet and lake crossing—hinges on this exact action; removing "paraphrase" and substituting "rewrite" or "translate" would alter the thematic register and weaken the poet's method. All three gates met; two distinct beats (decree shift, pillar response); causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Cost is conceptual (she risks mispronunciation) but legible. High irreplaceability and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Method "through dissolving boundaries" is announced in the opening third ("unseal it through dissolving boundaries of perception") and governs her tactics: walking the ellipse to braid harmonies, speaking into lattice to rewrite it, stepping onto ice that becomes membrane. The method shapes two middle beats (quartz slide, ice fissure) and is implicit in the closure crossing. All three gates met. Causal pressure is present but modest—no failed attempt or adaptation under resistance. Specificity concern: "blurring edges" or "melting limits" could substitute with minor rewording, suggesting mid-band irreplaceability. Solid integration with room for tighter mechanical demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting "cobalt atrium by a frozen lake" anchors opening, supplies the quartz resource she uses (lattice for rewriting), and the frozen lake's state—declared "moral surface" by Custodians—is the pressure she must alter. The atrium's ellipse guides her walk; the ice's transformation from solid to membrane to mist is the climax's physical register. All three gates met; two beats (colonnade engagement, lake crossing); closure is the far-shore arrival. The setting constrains her method (she cannot bypass the quartz or ignore the ice's density) and charges the final image (atrium dimming, lake rehearsing wave). Cost is environmental transformation with implied social consequence. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the ban lifts" is stated in the opening line and frames the enabling condition (she is allowed entry). However, it does not tighten decisions—no countdown, no risk of re-closure, no rival arriving. The "tonight" marker and "before morning" at the end suggest duration but do not constrain her pace or tactics. Setup gate met; middle and closure participation absent. The ban's lifting is a static backdrop rather than a live clock. Swappability high: "during a festival" or "at dusk" would serve identical plot function. Functional but replaceable; ornamental timeframe with no pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is stated in paragraph four and her actions (walking ellipse, speaking into quartz, crossing lake) align with it. The motivation frames her goal and her stride into liquid water literalizes the desire. Setup and closure gates met. Friction is told ("if she mispronounced, the lake could re-freeze") but never dramatized; no on-page moment where wanting to cross conflicts with cost or error. Middle development is observational—she listens and adjusts—but no visible trade-off (e.g., ignoring safety for speed) enacts the motivation under pressure. Lyric reprise (first third to final crossing) supports thematic charge but lacks felt cost in choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tone "lantern-moth hush" is introduced in the opening sentence, recurs at closure ("the lantern-moth hush regathered, richer now"), and modulates subtly—from post-proclamation quiet to charged silence after transformation. The moths' green glow and timing lessons appear in two middle beats, and the hush's return bookends the piece with a cadence shift that reweights the silence (now "richer…with possibility's tremor"). Setup and closure gates met; middle presence via moth imagery. The tone is coherent and purposeful but does not constrain a choice—she does not, for instance, stay quiet to preserve the hush or risk breaking it. Charged reprise elevates into mid-6s; lacks causal pressure for higher bands.</comment>
