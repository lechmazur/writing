<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mapkeeper's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (reading ice, wrapping the stone, completing the circle), though her internal contradiction remains largely implicit. Jalen exists primarily to receive instruction and mirror the keeper's stakes without applying independent pressure. The final act of releasing the stone's stored voices feels somewhat declared rather than earned through prior struggle with a clear personal cost—the keeper's renunciation of the maps is present but the emotional weight of losing her life's work could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story layers density through recurring images (echo chamber stone, bloom of hush, crack patterns) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mapkeeper releases the stored voices in the dome, creating a sigh "that carried no sound, only meaning." The cost is legible—she leaves the caves carrying "nothing but the hush"—and the final image reweights the opening's survival-through-silence into an act of preservation. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the beings' stolen voices flicker, confused by the carved silence, forcing the final choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain choices throughout: stalactites that chime if you breathe too hard, mineral lace that trembles at a heartbeat, and the Abyssal Gate's frequency too old to swallow all shape the mapkeeper's tactics. The echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting, handled multiple times and directly enabling the closure by absorbing sound and later releasing it. "Gently luminous" appears as a recurring sensory anchor (veins, lichen lantern, runes) that tracks the energy beings' feeding cycles. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent to the dome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the maps and stories before the energy beings consume all sound—is signaled in the opening paragraphs and tightens when the ice augury reveals a one-hour bloom of hush. The mapkeeper's agency drives the escalation: she reads the ice, wraps the stone to prevent leakage, projects silence to pass the Warden, and completes the circle to sever sound pathways. The final act of laying the map on the altar and releasing the stone's voices forecloses the path of carrying the physical maps out, a visible trade-off, though the beings' defeat feels somewhat convenient once the circle closes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, preservation, and survival without overt statement. The recurring crack patterns, the echo chamber stone's absorption and release, and the final whisper "We were here" cohere into a meditation on memory outlasting voice. The mapkeeper's act of completing the circle and releasing meaning without sound offers a resonant answer to the story's implicit question—how to preserve humanity when expression itself is lethal—without moralizing. The "bloom of hush" functions as a non-literal yet concrete motif that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third throughout, filtered through the mapkeeper's professional lens (reading crack patterns, conjuring stillness "the way an old potter coaxes clay"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices ice fissures, mineral formations, and vibrational cues that others miss. Jalen's single line of dialogue is absorbed by the stone, a purposeful elision that dramatizes the threat. Psychic distance tightens under pressure in the dome. Some figurative density ("gently luminous" recurs five times, "hammered repose" twice) risks ornament, but the diction remains within the keeper's contemplative register and does not obscure clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most sentences advancing setting, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies and accelerates during the dome sequence. However, "gently luminous" appears five times across the text, creating a minor loop that dulls specificity; "bloom of hush" recurs in a way that occasionally feels stock rather than reweighted. Template cadence emerges in adjacent beats: "She knelt, exhaling slowly... She lifted a shard of ice... She wrapped the echo chamber stone..." applies a repetitive stem structure that flattens propulsion mid-story (−0.4). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "hammered repose" as both noun phrase and descriptor borders on strained. No causality breaks or paraphrase loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-as-threat, silent augury via ice-reading, and the echo chamber stone as storage device creates a coherent speculative ecology that feels internally consistent. The premise—energy beings feed on sound, forcing a culture of silence—is executed with specificity (batwing leather, deaf crickets, fossilized chords) rather than generic post-apocalypse shorthand. The "bloom of hush" concept and the method of carving mute canyons into the dome to starve the beings offer a non-obvious tactical angle. However, the central image of voice-devouring entities and the mapkeeper's role as lone preserver echo familiar templates; the story's freshness rests more on textural density than on a transformed emotional core or subverted expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ripple-mark mapkeeper drives at least three key beats: reading the ice augury to time the bloom of hush, projecting silence to pass the Warden, and completing the circle in the dome to sever sound pathways. Her final choice to lay the map on the altar and release the stone's voices forecloses the path of physical preservation in favor of immaterial transmission, a visible trade-off. Early setup (first paragraph), middle development (ice-reading, Warden passage), and closure participation (circle completion, stone release) all present. Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability high—removing her would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in beat one (traced on stone), is pressed to Jalen's lips to absorb his words, is wrapped in moon-moth silk to prevent leakage, is projected to pass the Warden, is laid on the dome floor to complete the circle, and cracks open to release stored voices at closure. Six distinct beats with evolving function: storage, concealment, projection, inscription anchor, and final transmission. Early signal, causal pressure (enables tactics and closure), closure linkage (the release is the final act), and irreplaceability (no other object performs this role) all strong. Cost connection: the keeper sacrifices the physical maps to release the stone's immaterial cargo.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "bloom of hush" is signaled in the ice augury (paragraph four) as a one-hour window when even stone's heartbeat pauses, directly shaping the keeper's timing and tactics. It reappears when she projects it to the Warden and again when Jalen sprinkles powdered silence to "blossom fully" the circle. The concept constrains choices (narrow time window) and enables the final act (carving mute canyons). Present in setup, development, and closure. However, its mechanics remain somewhat abstract—why this hour, how the circle "blooms" the hush—and it functions more as a thematic anchor than a concrete tool with visible cost or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" appears five times: the veins on the echo chamber stone, a lichen lantern, and the runes in the dome. It functions as atmospheric descriptor and tracks the beings' feeding cycles (runes flicker when they feed outside), but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The mapkeeper uses the lichen lantern to examine the ice shard, but "gently luminous" is the quality of the light, not a tradeable resource. Present in setup and closure participation (dome runes), but largely ornamental—swappable with "soft glow" or "faint light" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Conjure" is attributed to the mapkeeper twice: she "learned to conjure stillness the way an old potter coaxes clay" (setup, paragraph three) and later "conjured an image of silence" to pass the Warden (middle beat). The final circle-carving and powdered-silence sprinkling enact conjuration without the verb. The action shapes two turns (Warden passage, dome climax) and connects to closure, but the verb itself is semi-replaceable—"project," "summon," "craft" could substitute with minor tonal shift. Functional across beats, not indispensable as written.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is signaled early (paragraph three: "reading futures in frozen fractures"), demonstrated on-page when the keeper lifts an ice shard and interprets the spiral/fork/circle geometry (paragraphs twelve–thirteen), and its result (the circle, almost closed) directly informs the tactic of completing the circle in the dome. The method shapes the central choice and the closure image. Present in setup, development (augury scene), and closure participation (circle completion). Causal pressure strong; cost connection indirect but present (the reading reveals the narrow time window). Specificity high—ice-crack augury is not easily swapped.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The harmonic caves supply multiple micro-constraints: stalactites that chime if you breathe too hard, mineral lace that trembles at a heartbeat, the Mirror Pool's unbroken surface, and the Abyssal Gate's deep note all pressure the keeper's tactics (silence, breath control, conjured stillness). The Great Resonance Dome's scalloped walls and gently luminous runes frame the climax, and the cave's tuned-water centuries create the conditions the beings exploit. Early signal (paragraph two), pervasive middle pressure, and closure participation (dome as stage for circle-carving). Irreplaceable—removing the caves' acoustic sensitivity would eliminate the central threat and all derived tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrived" is established in paragraph two and motivates the culture of silence and the keeper's preservation mission. The ice augury reveals a one-hour bloom of hush (paragraph four), creating a live clock that tightens the descent to the dome. However, the passage of time within that hour is not tracked on the page—no mid-descent pressure from a shrinking window, no moment when the keeper checks the clock or feels it closing. The timeframe shapes setup and stakes but does not visibly alter tactics in the middle or charge the final image with temporal cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the quiet in the storm, preserve the stories that proved people once laughed here" is stated in paragraph ten and dramatized through the keeper's actions: carrying the tidal-ridge scrolls, wrapping the stone to prevent betrayal, and choosing to release immaterial meaning over physical maps at closure. The final whisper "We were here" enacts the motivation. However, the friction between preserving (keeping) and releasing (letting go) could be more visibly conflicted on the page—the keeper's interior does not wrestle with the cost of releasing the maps until the act itself. Present in setup, development (carrying the satchel), and closure; causal pressure moderate; cost visible but somewhat muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" appears twice: once describing the keeper's footsteps (paragraph six) and again when the dome waits in that state after the circle closes (paragraph twenty-seven). The phrase coheres a tonal throughline of cultivated, hard-won stillness that modulates from tactical silence under threat to the achieved quiet at closure. The tone charges the final image and reflects the story's accumulative design. However, "hammered repose" as a phrase borders on strained (repose is typically gentle, not hammered), and the tone does not modulate visibly under pressure—the diction remains elevated and contemplative even in the dome's high-stakes beats, missing an opportunity to tighten syntax or fragment under stress.</comment>
