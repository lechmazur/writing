<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's arc from student to keeper is traceable, and the decision to extend the cycle to Mrs. Chen shows agency. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"understood then that my motivation had never been" reads as retrospective epiphany without the micro-choices that would earn it. The tutor's reveal ("never been alive in the way I assumed") arrives without prior behavioral hints that would make her ontological status feel earned rather than declared. Emotional progression is more conceptual than viscerally contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece teaches its pattern early (meteor shower as metaphor, agreed-upon lies as motif) and the final beat reweights "stay" and the cycle of teaching/becoming. Orientation is delayed but deliberate: who/where/when coalesce by the gargoyle interaction (~25%), and the effect charges the ending. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator inherits the seal and the building acknowledges the shift. Cost is conceptual and relational (becoming the new keeper, extending the lie to Mrs. Chen), legible in the final image of the word "stay" on the window.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden, gargoyle, and desk seal constrain the narrator's final choice and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (rosemary, meteor shower as dactyls, steam spelling "stay"), filtered through the narrator's emerging role as linguist. Spatial choreography is clean across the fire escape, roof, and Mrs. Chen's door. The micro-setting (seal pressed to gargoyle, thermos labeled "sugar") functions as constraint and metaphor without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: becoming fluent in the language of buildings, which braids with loneliness and the tutor's ontological need. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tutor reveals her nature and dissipates, forcing the narrator to step into the keeper role. The choice to approach Mrs. Chen with the first "agreed upon lie" narrows options with visible cost (perpetuating the cycle). Agency is decision and acceptance; the narrator's final stance crystallizes in the act of waiting "for the roof to call me teacher." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through motif repetition (seal, "stay," sugar-borrowing) that reweights meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—agreed-upon lies as both loneliness management and architectural memory—emerges organically from the seal, sugar ritual, and the tutor's dissipation. The final image (steam spelling "stay," the building "conjugated in the present continuous") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to solitude and belonging without moralizing. Subtext operates in the thermos labeled "sugar," the gargoyle's delayed speech, and the tutor's transparency. The motif of "stay" recurs with shifting meaning (limestone confession, final window word) and charges the closure without feeling forced. No thematic echo or diagnostic interiority mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>First-person POV remains stable; psychic distance contracts appropriately during the tutor's reveal and the gargoyle's speech. Perceptual signature is consistent (linguist's eye for conjugations, stress fractures, "grammar of cracked brick") and the prose carries a singular texture—lyric compression without opacity. Free indirect style is clean when the narrator channels the building's voice. The tutor's dialogue ("Language tutors...are only ever summoned by need") and Mrs. Chen's brief exchange feel natural and distinct. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, though the elevated diction ("patiently nimble," "dactyls of fire") occasionally hovers at the edge of the narrator's plausible lexicon without breaking it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths modulate with scene pressure (short bursts during the tutor's vanishing, longer accumulative beats in the final paragraph). Information density is high—most lines do double or triple duty (e.g., "steam rose like incense" anchors setting, mood, and ritual). Minor scaffold appears in parallel stems ("She taught me," "I told her," "I understood") but reads as purposeful anaphora rather than template cadence. One paraphrase loop: the "agreed upon lie" formula repeats across paragraphs 3, 9, and 25 without always adding new pressure. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "meteor shower...dactyls of fire spelling out conjugations" risks overwrought but stays voice-motivated. No pronoun ambiguity or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead-language tutoring, architectural memory, and ontological impermanence feels specific and non-obvious. The "agreed upon lies" frame transforms a familiar loneliness arc through the gargoyle's speech and the tutor's dissipation—details grounded in the narrator's emerging fluency. The meteor shower as Latin hexameter and the desk seal's owl blinking are fresh inflections that grow from prior particulars (Tuesday ritual, interrogation of stone). Risk-taking (the tutor's reveal, the building speaking) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending avoids both tidy closure and empty ambiguity; the cycle's extension to Mrs. Chen feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tutor appears in the opening beat, drives the interrogation of the gargoyle (pressing the seal into the narrator's hand, pouring tea), and her dissipation forces the narrator's transformation into the new keeper. Her ontological reveal ("never been alive") reshapes prior interactions and charges the closure. Three beats (arrival, teaching, vanishing) and causal pressure (her need summons her; when it changes, she dissipates) make her indispensable. Cost is visible: her disappearance forecloses the narrator's student role and compels the inheritance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The desk seal is handled in four beats: pressed into the narrator's palm (paragraph 6), used to interrogate the gargoyle (paragraph 10), placed in the narrator's hand a second time with "the weight of every story" (paragraph 17), and set beside two cups in the final scene (paragraph 27). Its engraved owl blinks at the end, signaling transformation. The seal enables the interrogation action, charges the closure image, and its "stay" imprint recurs as the window word. Removing it would break the inheritance logic and the gargoyle's recognition ("Welcome, new linguist").</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is introduced in paragraph 3, drives the sugar-borrowing ritual (paragraph 4, 9), and reappears at closure when the narrator tells Mrs. Chen "the first agreed upon lie" (paragraph 25) and the final line declares the cycle "conjugated in the present continuous." The concept constrains the narrator's social tactics (borrowing sugar as pretext) and reweights the tutor's existence and the building's weariness. It shapes at least three beats and is causally active in the ending, making the inheritance of falsehoods the story's conceptual spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" appears twice (paragraph 5, describing the tutor's teaching; paragraph 27, describing the narrator "in the grammar of becoming") but functions primarily as a descriptive label rather than constraining action. It does not enable or foreclose a choice with visible cost on the page. The trait's reprise in the final beat attempts thematic resonance but the mechanics of "patient nimbleness" do not alter tactics or closure logic in a way that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Interrogate" is signaled in paragraph 6 ("asked me to interrogate the stone gargoyle"), executed in paragraphs 10–11 (pressing the seal, receiving "stay"), and its result drives the tutor's dissipation and the narrator's inheritance. The action is causally central to one major turn (the gargoyle speaking, confirming the narrator's new role). However, it could be replaced with a near-synonym ("question," "consult") without breaking story logic, keeping it in the solid mid-band rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sugar-borrowing ritual is introduced in paragraph 4 ("began as neighborly necessity and calcified into weekly tea sessions"), recurs in the tutor's thermos labeled "sugar" (paragraph 9), and reappears at closure when the narrator borrows sugar from Mrs. Chen (paragraph 22) to begin a new cycle. The method shapes the social pretext for connection and is causally active in extending the pattern to Mrs. Chen. Two beats (setup, closure reprise) and causal linkage place it solidly, but its mechanics (weekly rhythm, shared tea) do not constrain mid-story choices, limiting deeper integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower frame the entire piece (opening and closing images), supply the gargoyle and rosemary as tactile anchors, and the meteors "spelling out conjugations" charge the tutor's teaching. The setting pressures the narrator's final choice by making the roof a stage for transformation and the gargoyle's speech the validation. Micro-setting elements (wrought-iron railing, potted rosemary, fire escape) are handled and constrain movement. The meteor shower's end marks the transition to the new cycle. Removing the rooftop would break the gargoyle encounter and the spatial logic of descent to Mrs. Chen.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to learn the language of buildings is declared in paragraph 3, drives the weekly lessons (paragraph 5), and is dramatized in the interrogation of the gargoyle (paragraphs 10–11). The narrator's realization (paragraph 19, "my motivation had never been to learn...but to become the next keeper") reweights the initial desire with cost (inheriting the keeper role, perpetuating lies). The motivation is conflicted (wanting company without admitting loneliness) and the friction surfaces in the final choice to extend the cycle to Mrs. Chen. Present in setup, middle, and closure, with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is established early (the tutor's arrival "precisely when," the antique seal, the "agreed upon lie" ritual) and sustained through the gargoyle's delayed speech, the tutor's ontological reveal, and the final image of steam spelling "stay." Tone modulates with pressure: intimate and conspiratorial during tea, heightened during the meteor shower and dissipation, then quietly ritualistic in the descent to Mrs. Chen. The coherence holds across turns and the final image charges the tone with both mystery (the building's voice) and earned familiarity (the narrator now fluent in the building's language).</comment>
