<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The advisor remains an abstract cipher throughout—no interior contradiction, no embodied micro-choices under pressure, only performative gestures described from outside. His "motivation, carried like a lantern beneath the ribs" is pure lyric assertion without any on-page conflict or cost that would make the choice to "translate silence into music" feel earned. The townspeople react but never become agents; they are passive receivers of the advisor's gift, and their tears of "joyful sorrow" arrive as emotional summary rather than dramatized consequence. "Quietly charismatic" is demonstrated through external reverence (dogs, drunks) but never tested or constrained by an on-page choice with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines, and the timeframe "when no one remembers you" is taught as a recurring motif. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the advisor moves counterclockwise, subtracting noises in sequence, culminating in a final chord that reweights the harbor's silence into music. However, the closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration via the collective note and the camera left on the capstan—lacks visible cost: the advisor simply walks away, and the townspeople's new awareness of silence is asserted rather than shown to foreclose a prior option or demand a trade-off. The story teaches a pattern (subtract, gather, release) but the final image does not make a felt price legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The luminous harbor is vividly anchored with selective, POV-filtered detail: "moonlight painted silver ladders across the black water," "corrugated iron," "capstan where sailors once wound anchor chain." The vintage camera, the cannery roof, and the capstan all appear in multiple beats and the advisor's movement around the harbor structures his subtractive process. The setting's spatial choreography remains clean and the moonlight motif charges the final image when "the water itself arranged into slow-moving sheet music, crests and troughs forming whole and half notes under the moon." While the harbor does not constrain a choice in the strict sense, it supplies the medium (water, masts, buildings) that vibrates in the climactic note, narrowly reaching the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating silence into music for the town—is signaled early and pursued through the advisor's counterclockwise mapping. The pressure accumulates via the subtractive sequence (cleat, generator, heartbeat) and culminates in the harbor's note. However, escalation is largely textural: each deletion is described as making "the world grow lighter" without an on-page cost or obstacle that narrows the advisor's options. The boy and old woman feel relief, but these are passive effects rather than protagonist-driven turns. The advisor's final gesture succeeds without visible trade-off or failure, rendering the stakes abstract. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the lack of felt price or friction lowers the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely from the advisor's subtractive mapping and the camera as a vessel for "improvised symphony." The final insight—"silence, properly mapped, is only music waiting for permission"—arises from the townspeople's new rehearsal of gestures and their pauses mid-sentence, avoiding overt thesis statement. The closing image of the capstan turning by itself and the camera clicking with no film reweights the premise without moral didacticism. Yet the theme occasionally leans on lyric assertion ("sorrow itself were ballast being tossed overboard") rather than embodied particulars, and the advisor's arc feels more allegorical than psychologically earned. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, but the emotional honesty is diluted by the advisor's cipher-like remove.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient POV maintains stable distance and a distinct lyric register throughout: "that slippery hour between last call and first gull, when even the barges forget their own names." The prose carries a consistent perceptual signature (poetic compression, metaphor-dense, archaic diction like "capstan" and "cleat") that never breaks into head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Psychic distance remains far enough to avoid filter-verb stacks and close enough to render the advisor's gestures with sensory immediacy. The narrator's certainty about collective interiority ("people now paused mid-sentence, palms half-raised") stretches plausibility but reads as intentional omniscient sweep. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The voice is distinctive and purposeful, though the lyricism occasionally obscures micro-choices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but largely coherent: "moonlight painted silver ladders," "silence the way cartographers once traced coastlines," "phosphor trail only visible where moonlight kissed salt." Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm modulates with the advisor's movement. However, several lines repeat structure without added pressure: "the clank of a loosened cleat, then the low throb of a generator, then the heartbeat he borrowed" is efficient, but the pattern recurs in "part whale, part church organ, part lullaby" without functional escalation. The final third introduces minor paraphrase loops ("the note lingered, decaying slowly, teaching the town how to listen for what had been removed" restates earlier "silence…is only music waiting"). No filter-verb stacks or register drift appear. The overwriting in peak beats (closure paragraph) is controlled but the density leans ornamental rather than propulsive, applying a −0.6 deduction in Q7 for figurative saturation without pattern-taught payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—mapping silence via sign language and a filmless camera—offers a fresh synthesis of lyric concept and tactile detail (corrugated iron, capstan, phosphor trails). The advisor's counterclockwise subtractive process and the harbor's collective note feel specific to this story's logic. However, the emotional arc and allegorical frame echo familiar templates: the wandering mystic who gifts transformation and disappears. The townspeople's new rehearsal of gestures at sunrise provides a fresh inflection, but the advisor's cipher-like remove and the lack of on-page cost limit the piece's ability to feel inevitable in hindsight. The transformation test: swap "advisor" for "musician" and "camera" for "instrument" and the arc holds, signaling mid-band originality. The lyric voice and micro-setting details elevate but do not fully escape the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The whispering advisor is present throughout and his actions (signing, subtracting noises, gathering silence into a chord) drive the sequence. However, his choices are performative demonstrations rather than decisions that alter his own tactics or foreclose a path with cost. He observes, maps, and gifts without on-page obstacle or trade-off, functioning more as catalyst than protagonist. Setup and development are present, but closure participation is passive (he walks away, the camera is left). The character is essential to the premise but does not undergo a change or renunciation, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vintage camera with no film appears early ("In his gloved hands he cradled a vintage camera with no film"), is handled at the dock's end ("opened the camera's empty back, held it to the sky"), hums during the subtractive sequence ("the empty spools turning like twin turbines powered by evaporated grief"), snaps shut at closure ("the camera's back snapped shut on nothing, sealing the improvised symphony"), and is left on the capstan as a charged final image. The object's filmless state and its role as a vessel for "evaporated grief" and "improvised symphony" are irreplaceable: remove the camera and the closure image collapses. It constrains the advisor's method (no recording, only mapping) and charges the ending when the capstan turns by itself and "the camera clicks though it has no film." All three gates are met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage, placing the score solidly in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sign language is introduced early ("began to sign. Not the harbor's crude finger-spelling...but the old sign language sailors invented") and shapes the advisor's method: "His fingers fluttered, describing the shape of fog, the taste of rust, the weight of a daughter's unspoken name." It reappears at closure when "people now paused mid-sentence, palms half-raised, rehearsing the shapes of things they could not say aloud." However, the mechanics of sign language do not constrain or enable a tactical choice under pressure; it functions more as thematic motif than causal tool. The concept is present in setup, development (one beat), and payoff (townspeople's rehearsal), meeting all three gates but without the irreplaceable causal pressure needed for higher scores. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, placing the score at the low end of the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is demonstrated via external effects: "stray dogs lowered their heads in reverence and drunks straightened as if remembering childhood hymns." The trait is present in setup but never constrains or enables an on-page choice with visible cost. It remains label-plus-observation without friction or trade-off. The advisor's charisma does not face a test or force a tactical adjustment, and no cost is tied to it at closure. The element is ornamental, present but not essential, scoring in the functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is signaled early ("Tonight he would disrupt the town's long hush") and executed through the subtractive mapping that culminates in the harbor's note, which disrupts the townspeople's relationship to silence. The action shapes the arc and is present at closure when "people now paused mid-sentence, palms half-raised" and "they understood that silence, properly mapped, is only music." However, "disrupt" is broad enough that swapping it for "transform" or "awaken" would require only minor edits. The action is essential to the premise but not uniquely irreplaceable, placing it in the shapes-one-key-turn band with strong closure linkage but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is signaled early ("by mapping silence the way cartographers once traced coastlines") and its mechanics are shown in the middle beats: the advisor moves counterclockwise, subtracting noises ("first the clank of a loosened cleat, then the low throb of a generator, then the heartbeat he borrowed from a sleeping watchman"). The method is irreplaceable: remove the subtractive mapping and the advisor's process collapses into generic mysticism. It appears at closure when the camera "seals the improvised symphony" and when "they understood that silence, properly mapped, is only music waiting for permission." All three gates are met with strong causal pressure and specificity, placing the score in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is established in the opening line and remains the spatial frame throughout. Moonlight charges the advisor's phosphor trails ("a faint afterglow…only visible where moonlight kissed salt") and the final transformation when "the water itself arranged into slow-moving sheet music, crests and troughs forming whole and half notes under the moon." The harbor supplies the medium (water, masts, buildings) that vibrates in the climactic note. However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice in the strict sense; it functions more as canvas than obstacle. Setup, development (multiple beats), and payoff are all present, and the moonlight reprise reweights the ending image, placing the score at the low end of the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" is introduced early and recurs at closure ("On certain moonlit nights, when no one remembers you, the capstan turns by itself"). The timeframe is poetic rather than tactical: it signals liminality but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. The advisor's actions proceed without time pressure or deadline. Setup and payoff are present, but the middle development is thematic rather than causal—no choice is forced by the timeframe. The element shapes tone and frames the premise but is replaceable with "dawn" or "midnight" without structural loss, scoring in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate silence into music" is declared early ("His motivation, carried like a lantern beneath the ribs, was to translate silence into music for the people who lived here") and executed through the subtractive mapping. It appears at closure when the harbor exhales its note and "people now paused mid-sentence, palms half-raised, rehearsing the shapes of things they could not say aloud." However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices: the advisor pursues it without obstacle, friction, or visible cost. Setup, development (one beat), and payoff are present, but the lack of on-page friction between want and cost caps the score in the shapes-one-key-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is established early ("tears shining with joyful sorrow") and modulates through the advisor's subtractive process: relief (boy, old woman) blends with loss (the town's "long hush" ending). The tone charges the final image when "the note lingered, decaying slowly" and the townspeople understand silence as "music waiting for permission." The tone is coherent across beats and supports the closure effect. However, it remains somewhat static—no clear modulation under pressure or tonal shift that redefines stakes. Setup, development, and payoff are present with moderate closure linkage, placing the score in the shapes-one-key-turn band with solid but not indispensable integration.</comment>
