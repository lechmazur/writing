<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aera's motivation is clear and her micro-choices during the inversion hour show agency under pressure. However, interiority often reads as elevated poetic abstraction rather than character-particular thought ("the willing transfer of endurance across years" feels like theme-speak). The moment she "understood: this was the gathering of echoes" and later realizes "the source of resilience was not a place but a process" edges toward authorial explanation rather than embodied discovery. The final choice to keep the arrow and share its meaning has causal grounding but lacks visible internal conflict or cost that would elevate it into high bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: orchard pilot, skiff, twin suns, inversion hour. The piece follows a single continuous ascent structured around the inversion event, and closure lands on-page when Aera pulls the arrow free and descends with new understanding—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis blended with thematic repricing). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered echoes, the sapling sequence, and the final image of synchronized blossoms. Cost is somewhat abstract ("her own memories drawn outward") but the final image of recognition and the arrow fusion suggests a durable shift. One meaningful deepening is present; the piece does not require multiple reversals under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock arches, inverted gravity, luminous fruit, and water-flow navigation create a vivid, coherent world. Sensory detail is purposeful: "mossy bark," "silver threads of water climbing the arches," "leaves that now served as stepping-stones in the sky." The arrow tip constrains choice (she must press it into the hollow) and the setting charges the final image (boughs bending, fruit ripening). Spatial choreography remains clear through the ascent and inversion. The micro-setting (the hollow in the apex arch) drives the climactic beat, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering resilience's source—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The inversion hour provides a ticking constraint and Aera's ascent tightens options as she follows water flow to the Silent Core. The sapling sequence accelerates generations in a compressed beat, deepening understanding. However, external opposition is minimal; Aera's journey reads as exploration rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt interpersonal or survival cost. The final decision to share the arrow carries thematic weight but lacks a visible trade-off or price that would anchor high-band conflict scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the echoes, the accelerated plant cycles, and the reciprocal graft image. The final moment ("resilience is the echo we decide to keep speaking") borders on a stated moral but is grounded in the physical arrow and the orchard's response. The sapling as "a prism of every hardship outlived" and the "willing transfer of endurance" offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Some phrasing ("the willing transfer," "giving and taking are the same motion seen from opposite gravities") reads slightly abstract and prompt-aligned, preventing full entry into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Aera with a lyric, elevated register. Psychic distance is consistent and filter verbs ("felt," "realized") are voice-motivated. However, diction often rises into poetic abstraction ("the whirling silence swallowed every sound," "a cathedral of unheard choir," "they spoke pressure, the way roots speak to soil") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Peak-pressure beats (arrow insertion, sapling emergence) maintain clarity but the uniform elevation across calm and crisis flattens voice modulation. No dialogue appears; solo-POV interiority is the only lens, and it reads more as narrative essay than lived perception under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and free of major loops or grammatical errors. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("roots were rays of light," "rivers loosened into spirals"). However, several beats stack elevated metaphors without breathing room: "a cathedral of unheard choir," "the willing transfer of endurance across years, across voices, across the inversion of all certainties," "giving and taking are the same motion seen from opposite gravities." These constructions read as ornamental in high-pressure moments (arrow insertion, sapling emergence) where concrete action would sharpen impact. Template-cadence check: "she leapt branch to branch," "each contact guided by cool currents" shows minor repetition but not egregious. Overall density is high but figurative saturation in key beats triggers a −0.3 to −0.5 deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The floating orchard planet, gravity inversion, and echo-archive premise offer a fresh synthesis. Water-flow navigation and the accelerated plant cycles during inversion are specific and purposeful. The arrow-as-tuning-fork and the sapling sequence transform familiar resilience themes through grounded world logic. However, the core arc—lone explorer ascends to mystical apex, receives wisdom, returns to share—follows a recognizable quest template. The final insight ("resilience is the echo we decide to keep speaking") is thematically solid but not conceptually surprising. Risk-taking in structure and imagery elevates the piece within its band without reaching the inevitability threshold for 9+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aera is present throughout, her choices (following water flow, landing on the shelf, grasping the arrow, pressing it into the hollow, pulling it free) drive every major beat. Her intrepid nature is shown through solo navigation into the Silent Core. She shapes the discovery, the sapling emergence, and the final sharing. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is moderate; her decisions enable rather than constrain under crisis, and no on-page cost (injury, loss, sacrifice) visibly alters her state. The final choice to share the arrow is thematic rather than high-stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip is handled in multiple beats: discovered lodged in the trunk, grasped to trigger echoes, vibrates like a tuning fork during inversion, pressed into the hollow to summon the sapling, pulled free glowing jade, and fused to living wood by the end. It constrains the climax (exact fit in the hollow) and charges the closure image (mended arrow as symbol). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost is conceptual (offering memories) rather than physical, preventing full 9+ score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "gathering of echoes" is introduced when Aera touches the arrow and hears past growers. It reappears at the apex arch ("echoes were densest") and converges on the sapling, each lending a trait. The concept shapes the climax: echoes must gather for the sapling to form. It frames the central question (resilience source) and is present in the ending when "echoes quieted, satisfied." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The concept enables rather than constrains with visible cost, and its function is somewhat abstract (voices that "spoke pressure").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The acceleration trait appears mid-story when the arrow tip vibrates during inversion, causing buds to unfurl, blossom, fruit, wither, and seed in a heartbeat. This beat dramatizes the "rehearsal" of survival and is essential to Aera's understanding. The trait is used once with clear on-page effect and shapes the thematic revelation. Setup is late (~40% mark), limiting upward range. Development and payoff gates are met; the trait is indispensable to the survival-dance visualization that anchors the resilience theme.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Aera's discovery drive structures the entire arc: she seeks the Silent Core, follows water flow, lands, grasps the arrow to unlock echoes, ascends during inversion, finds the hollow, presses the arrow to summon the sapling, and pulls it free with new knowledge. Every major turn traces to this action. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met with strong causal involvement across beats. The discovery is earned rather than convenient, and the final sharing extends it. Swappability is low; the specific sequence (echoes → sapling → reciprocal graft) is tightly bound to discovery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Water-flow navigation is introduced early ("she read the irrigation streams that ribboned the air") and guides her route to the Silent Core. It reappears during inversion ("trusting the water flow that now braided itself through the air, she leapt branch to branch") and at the ending ("the water flow had etched the route into her reflexes"). Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the mechanics are not tested under pressure; she follows the flow without error or visible alternative. Development gate is weak (no failed attempt or constraint). The method enables rather than complicates, and its specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is present from the opening line and structures every beat: Aera throttles beneath arches, lands on bark jutting from an arch, ascends past spinning orchards, reaches the apex arch with the hollow. The arches supply the spatial logic for the inversion sequence and the Silent Core location. The setting constrains choice (she must reach the apex arch) and charges the final image (boughs bending, synchronized blossoms). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met with strong causal and atmospheric pressure. The micro-setting (the hollow) is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The inversion hour is signaled early ("only minutes away") and structures urgency. The inversion occurs on-page ("Then gravity let go"), enabling the ascent and accelerated plant cycles. Time pressure is implicit (she must act within the hour) and the return of gravity ("The hour waned; weight began to remember its usual direction") closes the window. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the clock is not explicitly tracked during the ascent; no moment shows her racing against seconds or forced to choose due to time scarcity. The timeframe enables rather than tightly constrains.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aera's motivation to find resilience's source is stated early ("she meant to discover the answer") and drives every choice: navigating to the Silent Core, grasping the arrow, ascending during inversion, pressing the arrow into the hollow. The final realization ("resilience is the echo we decide to keep speaking") and her choice to share the arrow fulfill the motivation. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the motivation is told more than shown through conflicted micro-choices; no visible cost (fear, doubt, competing desire) complicates her pursuit on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The phrase "whirling silence" appears twice: when Aera cuts the engine ("the whirling silence swallowed every sound") and in the ending when the pickers listen ("in the whirling silence that followed, every tree...exhaled"). The tone is contemplative and lyric throughout, modulating slightly during the inversion (kinetic imagery) but maintaining a consistent elevated register. Setup and payoff gates are met through reprise. However, the tone does not charge the final image with new pressure; it remains stable rather than reconfiguring meaning. The effect is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>
