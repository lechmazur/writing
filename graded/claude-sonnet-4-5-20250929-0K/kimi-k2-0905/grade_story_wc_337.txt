<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation to give voices back to the voiceless is clear and shapes his actions throughout. Interiority leans poetic but remains character-specific ("fracture lines like fault lines in his own chest"). The fisherman's spirit materializes and thanks him, providing relationship pressure, but the arc feels more illustrative than internally conflicted—Elian succeeds without meaningful obstruction or cost that tests competing impulses. The final realization about broken things letting light through borders on epiphany-speak but stays tied to his craft.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through density and pattern (knots → stories → singing masks) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence lifts and Elian understands his true calling. Orientation is clear early (Elian, prism sanctuary, starlight). The closure unit—last knot surrendered, fisherman freed, masks singing—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the accumulated silence that "lifted like fog"). One meaningful deepening occurs as each knot releases a story, narrowing toward resolution. The cost is felt but remains largely atmospheric rather than a hard trade-off that forecloses a visible path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's crystalline walls refracting starlight into spectral colors and the net's tactile knots create vivid, purpose-driven anchors. Sensory selection—"sigh that tasted of salt," "phosphorescence in the net's fibers"—is filtered through Elian's restorer POV and accumulates symbolic charge. The sanctuary's altered time ("sharing a secret could stretch for hours or collapse into moments") subtly pressures the unraveling work. The tapestry needle and net function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: freeing the fisherman's spirit by unraveling the net. Pressure accumulates via the textural lens as each knot releases a story, building toward the fisherman stepping free. The tightening is more additive than conflicted—Elian faces no meaningful obstruction or competing pull that tests his commitment. The fisherman's confession ("I've been drowning in what I never said") provides emotional depth, but the resolution arrives without visible cost to Elian beyond effort. Agency is present (Elian's needle work) but the escalation lacks a moment where success is genuinely in doubt or a painful trade-off is required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—giving voice to the silenced, brokenness as readiness for light—emerges organically from the net-unraveling and mask-mending particulars. The final image ("fracture lines that no longer seemed like failures but like maps") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the fisherman's "man-shaped absence" and the "interlaced hush" that "accumulated in his lungs like water." The piece resists easy answers and invites reflection on repair and expression. Minor thematic echo: "broken things weren't ruined—they were simply ready to let the light through" leans slightly declarative but remains tied to Elian's craft-specific realization rather than prompt-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a lyric, slightly elevated register ("interlaced hush," "man-shaped absence") that remains coherent throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elian notices fracture lines, knots, phosphorescence through a restorer's lens. One dialogue exchange ("You're grounding me" / nod) feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext of gratitude and shared understanding. No head-hopping; the fisherman's interiority is accessed only via his spoken confession. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (closer during needle work, wider during the spirit's materialization). Diction stays within an artisan-mystic register without unmotivated leaps.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences ("Each mask he touched carried an interlaced hush, a silence so complete it accumulated in his lungs like water") alternating with shorter beats at key turns. Information density is generally high, but some lines loop conceptually: "accumulated silence" appears multiple times without fresh inflection, and "interlaced hush" / "silence pooled" / "accumulated silence lifted" feel like synonym churn on the same motif. Metaphor density in peak beats (net unraveling, spirit materializing) occasionally stacks without full coherence—"waves retreating from shore" voice, "phosphorescence," "man-shaped absence" cluster without clear linkage. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the repeated "broken mask restorer" epithet across multiple paragraphs becomes scaffolding. Overall clarity remains intact, with no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—mask restorer freeing spirits by unraveling a fisherman's net—synthesizes repair craft, ghost story, and metaphor of voice in a non-obvious way. The prism sanctuary and tapestry needle threaded with moonlight add specific, non-generic texture. The transformation test mostly passes: plot and arc depend on the restorer's particular skill and the net's knotted stories. Minor derivative friction: the "broken healer" archetype and the epiphany that brokenness lets light through echo familiar templates without full reinvention. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, non-confrontational closure) heightens thematic resonance but doesn't obscure clarity, earning modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elian appears in the opening line, drives the central action (unraveling knots), and his realization charges the final image ("fracture lines...like maps"). His choices—kneeling before the net, working through the night, understanding his calling—create key turns and shape the resolution. Present in setup, middle work, and closure; causal pressure and closure linkage both strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears early ("glinted in Elian's palm, its eye threaded with moonlight"), is used actively to untie knots across multiple beats, and reappears in the penultimate line ("warm in his practiced hand") with reweighted meaning as a tool for future exhumations. Three beats, causal involvement, closure linkage. Specific property (moonlight thread) matters to the mystical tone and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" appears early, names the conceptual stake (silence that must be broken), and accumulates pressure as "silence pooled around his feet" and then "lifted like fog." It shapes the central problem (spirits bound by unsaid words) and is paid off when masks "stopped humming and began to sing." Present in setup, pressures middle action, resolved at closure. Moderately causal; the concept frames the emotional logic of unraveling but could be restated with near-synonyms (accumulated quiet, tangled silence) without breaking structure. Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" is closely tied to 9C (interlaced hush). The attribute is dramatized early ("accumulated in his lungs like water"), shapes the middle stakes ("silence pooled around his feet"), and is resolved at closure ("accumulated silence lifted"). It constrains Elian's emotional state and enables the final release. One on-page cost: the weight of silence as a physical burden that must be lifted. Setup, development, closure all present; causal work visible but overlaps heavily with the core concept, reducing unique integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Exhume" is named explicitly ("to exhume the dead, you must first unravel what binds them") and structures the entire arc: Elian exhumes the fisherman by unraveling his net-bound stories. The action is not easily swappable—replacing "exhume" with "release" or "free" would require only minor edits, but the mortuary/archaeological connotation charges the restorer's work with specific gravity. Present in setup (mentor's teaching), drives all middle beats, and defines closure (spirit steps free). Causal pressure high; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method—unraveling knots in the fisherman's net—is signaled early ("net...its knots dark with age"), demonstrated across multiple beats ("first knot gave way," "each knot he untied," "last knot surrendered"), and its mechanics shape the entire middle arc. Each knot releases a story, making the method causally essential. The specificity (centuries-old fisherman's net, not a generic binding) is irreplaceable. Setup, development, closure all hinge on this exact method. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary appears in the opening, supplies the crystalline walls that refract starlight into "war paint" on Elian's face, and houses the masks that hum and later sing. Its altered time ("sharing a secret could stretch for hours") subtly pressures the night-long work. The sanctuary is named in setup, referenced across middle beats, and participates in closure ("prism sanctuary held its breath"). Micro-setting (body, needle, net) also constrains choices. Environment shapes tactics and charges the final image, meeting strong integration tests.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" as timeframe is invoked once ("time moved differently—across sharing a secret could stretch for hours or collapse into moments") but functions more as thematic color than tactical constraint. The story spans "through the night" to "dawn," a clear duration, but the "sharing a secret" frame doesn't visibly tighten decisions or alter Elian's moves—he works steadily regardless. Present in middle but not setup or closure; no causal pressure tied to this specific phrasing. Replaceable with "through the night" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to ground restless spirits"—is stated explicitly ("You're grounding me") and dramatized throughout: Elian comes to the sanctuary because the masks hum with voices, works to free the fisherman, and realizes his calling is "to give voices back to those who'd lost them." The desire drives setup, middle action, and closure realization. Friction between effort and the weight of accumulated silence provides visible cost. No competing want muddles the arc, but the single-minded focus reads as authentic commitment rather than flatness.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" as tone is invoked in the penultimate line ("In the lucid unrest of his new understanding") and coheres with the story's poetic, slightly eerie atmosphere—spirits materializing, silence pooling, phosphorescence. The tone modulates from hushed tension (opening) through intensifying work (middle) to quiet resolution (singing masks). However, "lucid unrest" as a phrase arrives late and feels more like a thematic label than an active tonal constraint throughout. The story demonstrates the tone more than it names it, but the late explicit mention lowers integration credit.</comment>
