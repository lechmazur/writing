<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to notice drift and sanctify absence drives purposeful moves, but the character remains observational rather than decisively tested. The gathering of "fragments no one missed" and their placement around the compass shows agency, yet the stakes feel conceptual rather than personal—we never see what she risks or loses. The final covenant gesture and her refined mission suggest change, but it reads more as clarification than transformation with visible cost. Internal contradiction and embodied struggle are minimal; she proceeds smoothly from problem to solution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara gathers sensory data and displaced objects until the compass ritual reweights the bay's "alive-ness" into a legible grammar of absence. The closure—houses sighing in unison, curtains breathing, streetlights concluding—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the world is restored to balance) with conceptual cost (some absences remain unfilled). Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the orris shard reveals the double-exposure interior, teaching the rule that drives the ending. Causality under the accumulative mode holds: collection → ritual → systemic sigh. The cost is felt in the decision to leave the compass needle-less, though the emotional or relational price to Elara herself remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The quiet bay, net-drying shack, and crawlspace are vividly rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail: "sodium glow thinning against the dawn like memory against bone," "wallpaper hung in petrified waves," "floorboards had curled into the shape of a spiral." The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining her sensory anchor and charging the final ritual. The Forsythe place's motionless curtains and swallowing windows pressure her investigation. Spatial choreography—tide line, sill, crawlspace descent—tracks cleanly. The setting's salt-and-cedar vocabulary remains consistent and purposeful, and the final image of houses standing "a fraction straighter" grounds the thematic resolution in physical change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive and restoring their balance—is signaled early and tightens when the double-exposure vision teaches the displacement rule. The compass discovery and ritual constitute one meaningful deepening that narrows her mission and forecloses aimless noticing. Agency is present in the gathering and sanctification, yet the escalation is smooth rather than contested; no genuine obstacle or competing pressure tests her commitment. The houses' sigh and her refined covenant at road's end deliver resolution, but the visible price—leaving the compass needle-less, accepting incompleteness—is more conceptual than visceral. Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern of arrhythmia → ritual → unison exhale works, but the lack of friction or misstep keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from image and action: displaced objects leave cavities that widen into living absences, and sanctifying the overlooked restores balance. The orris shard, compass, and collected trifles ground the abstraction in sensory particulars. The final image—houses breathing in restored time, streetlights nodding—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Some absences, once named, need no filling" reweights the premise with restraint. The piece resists easy binaries (presence/absence, alive/inert) and lets ambiguity linger without confusion. One minor slip: "inadvertently profound" in paragraph nine edges toward self-congratulation, though it's framed as perception rather than Elara's own claim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—she notices "shingles bleaching from cedar to the color of old photographs," reads house heartbeats—anchoring voice in her profession. Diction is elevated and lyric, consistent with the hushed tone: "violet flare that did not illuminate but deepened the shadows, making them tender." One register slip: "inadvertently profound, like assembling a confession from pronouns" reads meta-commentarial rather than Elara's lived thought. Psychic distance stays controlled. The prose modulates well under pressure, tightening in the crawlspace and opening at the covenant. No dialogue to judge. Free indirect is clean, tense stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images anchor well. However, density suffers from paraphrase loops and decorative layering. Paragraph 2 ("world's slow mutations—porches leaning one degree closer to the sea, shingles bleaching") restates drift without new pressure. Paragraph 9 recycles "inadvertently profound" and "loose bouquet of insignificance" in adjacent clauses. Figurative language clusters heavily—"memory against bone," "petrified waves," "cedar blood," "violet flare," "tender shadows"—without always clarifying or advancing. The metaphor "assembling a confession from pronouns" is strained. Template stems appear: "She felt… she understood… she saw." These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull momentum and disqualify 9+ globally. Proofreading is clean; no grammar breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—displaced objects leave cavities that a "creeping normality noticer" sanctifies with scent—offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The orris root as grounding tool and the compass without needle are fresh particulars. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact details. Elara's role avoids the stock "sensitive medium" by grounding her gift in perfumery and observation rather than mysticism. One derivative note: the "woman who restores balance through ritual objects" echoes familiar templates, though the execution through scent and violet dust personalizes it. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the quiet, open ending elevate without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its hush-and-sanctification logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's noticing drives every beat: she spots arrhythmia, tests the sill, follows streetlight Morse, descends to the compass, performs the ritual, and refines her mission. Her choices create the key turn (orris-shard ritual) and the closure (covenant at road's end). Setup early, development throughout, payoff in the ending paragraph. However, observation dominates decision; she encounters no resistance or misstep that forces tactic alteration. The role is essential but more vehicle than crucible. Causal pressure is present but smooth, limiting score below 7.0 despite full integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orris root appears in at least four beats: grounding in paragraph 2, pressed to the Forsythe sill (paragraph 6), wrapping collected objects (paragraph 9), and crushed over the compass (paragraph 14). Its violet scent enables the double-exposure vision and the final ritual, directly shaping the closure. Setup early, development across beats, payoff decisive. The shard's "hush" label and its powder's tenderness are specific and irreplaceable. Constraint: without it, the sanctification fails. One friction: the shard arrives anonymously and is accepted without question, reducing earned discovery. Still, causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" frames the orris root's label and the compass's scratching sound, which "sounded exactly like hush." The concept charges the ending: Elara restores "the hush that keeps the world from shaking itself apart." Setup in paragraph 4, payoff in paragraphs 14 and 19–20. It shapes stakes (what is hush? why does it matter?) and the final image. However, mid-development is thin—hush is named but not tested or explored through conflicting choices. The concept reads more thematic than tactical. Lyric resonance (early seed → final reprise) qualifies it for mid-band, but causal pressure is limited. No felt cost ties directly to hush itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears once in paragraph 9 as a descriptor of the bouquet's feel. It neither constrains nor enables an on-page action; it's a thematic label rather than a trait that alters Elara's choices or tactics. No cost, no friction. Mentioned after the midpoint, ornamental, swappable with "unexpectedly meaningful" without structural loss. Does not meet setup, development, or payoff gates. Score trends low per rubric.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Sanctify" drives the major turn: Elara gathers fragments, wraps them in orris-stained tissue, and crushes the shard to "sanctify such absence" (paragraphs 8, 14). The ritual is the pivotal action that stills the compass and triggers the houses' sigh. Setup in paragraph 8, development in collection, payoff in paragraph 14–15. The action is specific and irreplaceable—swapping it for "bless" or "cleanse" would weaken thematic coherence. Causal pressure is present: without sanctification, the absences remain unacknowledged. One friction: the mechanics are slightly opaque (why does scent and powder work?), limiting felt cost. Still, the action is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method—working through displaced objects (marble, hinge, puzzle piece, compass)—is signaled in paragraph 8 and executed in paragraphs 9–14. Elara's gathering and placement shape her attempts and the ritual's success. Setup early, development in collection, payoff when objects "drank the scent" and the compass stilled. The method is specific: objects displaced leave cavities; returning fragments restores balance. One friction: the logic is poetic rather than mechanical, making the method feel thematic rather than constraining in a problem-solving sense. Still, it's irreplaceable—without displaced objects, the story's premise collapses. Causal role across beats qualifies it for mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring supplies atmosphere and the tide line as a spatial track for Elara's walk. The net-drying shack and crawlspace provide the discovery location. Setting is vivid and consistent: sodium lights, dune grass, lace curtains, salt-and-cedar smell. Setup early, present throughout, part of the ending image (bay sparkles, houses stand straighter). However, the setting does not pressure choices or constrain tactics; it's backdrop rather than obstacle or resource. Micro-setting (the orris shard, the compass) does more causal work. The bay's spring timing and quiet tone fit thematically but don't tighten decisions. Lyric reprise (bay in paragraph 1 and 20) reweights meaning slightly, qualifying for low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" appears in the opening and recurs when they flicker Morse at noon and blink off at the end (paragraphs 1, 10, 17, 22). The timeframe is evocative but vague—dawn to afternoon to road's end—without tightening decisions. The streetlights function more as chorus or witness than clock. No urgency or deadline pressures Elara's moves. Setup early, present in three beats, payoff in the nod. The element is memorable and thematically coherent (daydream/hush), but it doesn't constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Functional but replaceable with "dawn walk" or "morning mission" without structural loss. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Understanding why houses feel alive motivates Elara's noticing and sanctification throughout. Setup in paragraph 3 (gift to spot drift, read heartbeats), development in paragraphs 7–8 (displacement rule learned), payoff in paragraph 20 ("why some houses feel alive: because they are, if someone remembers to listen"). The desire is clear and drives action. However, it's never conflicted—no competing want, no cost to her pursuit. The motivation is told and restated rather than tested through friction. No visible trade-off (time, safety, relationship) pressures her. Lyric payoff reweights the question, but lack of dramatized cost limits the score. Functional across beats, but smooth rather than contested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" anchors tone from the opening ("sodium glow thinning") through the ritual ("violet flare that did not illuminate but deepened the shadows, making them tender") to the ending ("hushed blaze of recognition"). The oxymoron coheres: quiet intensity, restrained power. Tone modulates subtly—hushed observation, tender ritual, quiet covenant—without breaking. The final image charges the phrase with meaning earned from prior particulars. Setup early, development through diction and rhythm, payoff in paragraph 20. The tone is irreplaceable; swapping for "quiet wonder" or "gentle power" would flatten the specific paradox. Strong closure linkage and specificity qualify it for mid-7s.</comment>
