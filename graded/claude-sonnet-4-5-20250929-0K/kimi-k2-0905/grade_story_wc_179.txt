<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to release war-ghosts through cellular memory is clear and consistent, though her interior contradiction arrives late when the shadow-self appears. The soldier and girl lack distinct individual traits beyond their death moments; they function more as vessels than characters with conflicting impulses. The final acceptance of her own anger earns the closure choice, but the embodied emotion often slips into abstract phrasing ("calculus of vengeance solved itself into zero") rather than concrete sensation under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through the sanctuary's shifting properties and cellular-memory motif, holding it through closure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the first 120 words. The shadow-Lira reversal deepens pressure and the final act—accepting her own resentment—reconfigures the stake with visible cost (she metabolizes her anger, disperse the shadow, leaves the broken box behind). One meaningful tightening is present and the closure lands on the page with felt cost under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sanctuary's breathing walls, shifting angles, and transformation from stone to silk constrain Lira's approach and charge the final stillness. The music box is handled across multiple beats and its broken state matters tactically. Spatial choreography remains abstract but legible (floor becoming lake, ceiling becoming sky). The final image—three silhouettes against a forgetting horizon—uses the environment to reinforce closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—convincing war-ghosts to release resentment—is signaled immediately and pressure tightens when the shadow-self forces Lira to confront her own unopened anger. The broken pin's failure creates escalation (the music box falters, "rhythm stumbling like a heart in arrest") and her acceptance of the shadow forecloses the path of unexamined rage. The cost is visible: she metabolizes her own anger and leaves the box behind, unable to continue her scheme unchanged. Agency is clear and the closure choice alters tactics with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the broken music box, cellular memory, and the sanctuary's transformations rather than statement. The shadow-self complication avoids easy resolution; Lira must accept her own resentment before teaching release. The final image—sitting together as the sanctuary stills, leaving the broken box for the next person—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "calculus of vengeance solved itself into zero" edges toward thematic declaration in place of scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Lira throughout; no head-hopping. Distance control is mostly clean, though some elevated diction ("fascia and vein," "metabolize into the same carbon") reads as authorial rather than character-filtered during peak stress. The perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic—Lira notices transformation and memory but her syntax doesn't shift under pressure in character-specific ways. No dialogue appears; all pressure runs through action and interior reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching, creating density that occasionally obscures rather than propels ("shifting grace accepted the currency of recalled tenderness," "flood their biology with pre-war joy"). Two paraphrase loops: the sanctuary's transformations are restated across multiple beats without new pressure, and "cellular memory" is invoked repeatedly in similar phrasing. The closure image is clean, but mid-story artifacts dull momentum. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cellular-memory mechanism and the shadow-self confrontation offer a fresh angle on war-ghost reconciliation, avoiding simple catharsis or combat. The broken music box that produces no sound yet vibrates with memory is a specific, non-obvious image. The scheme's reversal—Lira must first release her own resentment—feels earned rather than convenient. Minor swappability: the war-ghosts could be other trauma-holders without major structural change, and the sanctuary's mechanics remain somewhat generic "magic space" logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's scheme drives all major turns: she opens the music box, angles it for the girl, sets it down to confront the shadow, and leaves it behind at closure. Her pacifist stance is tested when forced to accept her own anger. Present early, active in at least three beats, and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The broken cylinder pin is handled in five distinct beats: arrival (clicked against palm), first ghost (scraped, no note), second ghost (snapped pin struck same bar), shadow confrontation (fragment skittering, rhythm stumbling), and closure (broken beyond any future song). Its brokenness constrains Lira's method and charges the final lesson. Removing it would collapse the story's central mechanism and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is named once in paragraph three and governs the sanctuary's behavior throughout (walls breathe, floors forget angles, objects reappear). It shapes the environment's response to Lira's actions (walls soften from stone to silk, ceiling becomes sky) and the final stillness. Present across beats but not irreplaceable—"transformation magic" or similar could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Reappears when needed" is named once and demonstrated twice on-page: the soldier and girl materialize when Lira's music box calls them, and the final line promises the box will reappear for the next person. It enables the encounter but doesn't constrain Lira's choices mid-scene. Lyric reprise from setup to closure with thematic weight, but middling causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Convince" structures every beat: Lira attempts to convince the ghosts through the music box, the shadow challenges her right to convince without self-examination, and the final act convinces by example rather than argument. Removing this action would require a fundamentally different premise. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Cellular memory" is signaled in paragraph four and drives three beats: the soldier's bandaging memory rises through fascia and vein, the girl's strawberry memory washes away gunpowder, and Lira accepts the burn and metabolizes it. The mechanism matters tactically and shapes Lira's final realization. Could be swapped for "somatic memory" or similar with modest edits, but its specific biology-rooted phrasing charges the piece.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary frames the entire encounter, its transformations (walls breathing, floors forgetting angles, stone to silk, ceiling to sky) respond to emotional shifts, and the final stillness marks closure. It constrains Lira's approach (she cannot use conventional speech) and provides the mechanic for objects reappearing. Strong setup, development, and payoff with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" governs the piece's ongoing present tense and the sanctuary's continuous transformation. Time is unmarked but the shifting itself creates a live pressure that mirrors emotional escalation. The timeframe is less a ticking clock than a sustained condition, functional but somewhat generic—"during the encounter" could replace it with minimal loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to teach resentment to release is stated in paragraph four, tested when the shadow asks if she has learned release herself, and fulfilled when she accepts her own anger and sits with the ghosts. The motivation faces direct friction (her unopened crates of anger) and the cost is visible (she must release before teaching). Drives setup, complication, and closure with clear stakes.</comment>
