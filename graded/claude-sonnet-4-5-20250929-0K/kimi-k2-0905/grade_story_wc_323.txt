<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The instructor's interiority is concrete and rooted in loss—"the hollow that ached like lungs remembering air"—and her teaching carries embodied stakes. The boy's desire to return is motivated, and the final exchange at the spire shows choice under pressure. However, the emotional progression relies on poetic assertion more than micro-choices that narrow options; the instructor's "thin smile" and the boy's bleeding fingers are told rather than dramatized in action. The final renunciation (giving away the chain link) carries symbolic weight but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early (benthic city, post-alien descent, navigation class). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the chain link recurs and reweights meaning, and the final gift to the boy crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she gives away her last relic, accepting that direction begins where fear ends. The cost is legible: "the missing link of the chain left a hollow that ached like lungs remembering air" and "its absence a perfect, navigable void." One meaningful tightening occurs when the boy sights the steady point and receives the link, foreclosing her claim to the surface past. Causality is clean within the accumulative design, and the closure image—pushing away from the spire, ready to teach again—lands with conceptual cost visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The benthic city is vividly rendered through coral towers, bioluminescent plankton, shell and basalt amphitheater, and the sealed surface hatch. Spatial choreography is clear: class in amphitheater, ascent to spire, return swim. The chain link functions as micro-setting, constraining the lesson and charging the final exchange. The leviathan alien craft's passage illustrates edge geometry in action, confirming method and deepening atmosphere. Sensory selection is purposeful—cold water, blue glow, crushed shell—and filtered through the instructor's grief and professional focus. The spire and sealed sky charge the ending image, meeting the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching navigation in a world where stars have wandered—is signaled early and threads through the lesson. The boy's question "if we learn this, can we go back?" introduces a secondary tension, and the instructor's choice to take him to the spire for solo instruction tightens pressure. The final exchange narrows options: she gives away her last anchor to the past, foreclosing her own claim to return. Cost is visible in the hollow left behind and her resolve to "teach again." Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, and the boy's bleeding fingers and sighted path provide texture. However, the escalation is more conceptual than tactical; no live obstacle tests the method on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the chain link's evolution: from anchor to teaching tool to gift, tracing the shift from holding still to enabling motion. The instructor's assertion "navigation is no longer about arrival but about refusing to disappear" feels earned by the particulars—sealed sky, alien-folded space, the city's dimming generators. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "direction begins where fear ends" and "its absence a perfect, navigable void" reweight the central question without moralizing. The boy's bleeding fingers and the instructor's thin smile provide embodied emotional honesty. Subtext operates in gesture (closing his fingers over the link) and image (the missing link as void). No thematic echo contaminates the final beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the instructor; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture—"somber marvel," "balancedly curious," "horizons could unfold in directions no compass had ever measured"—that reads purposeful but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the lesson drifted outward, carried by currents stronger than any anchor") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the instructor's lines pursue teaching goals and the boy's question advances plot. Free indirect style is clean. However, the repeated pairing "balancedly curious" and "somber marvel" (used as both description and tone marker) borders on tic, and some lines—"navigation was no longer about arrival but about refusing to disappear"—read as thematic summary rather than inhabited thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm is varied and propulsive in key beats: "She lifted the chain link, letting it spin like a slow planet." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, template cadence appears in several passages: "She almost lied, but…" / "She closed her eyes, feeling…" / "She placed the chain link in his palm, closing his fingers…" clusters pronoun + verb stems. Paraphrase loop: "the city seemed darker, as if possibility itself had been towed away" closely echoes the prior leviathan description without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "horizons could unfold in directions no compass had ever measured" reads generic rather than specific to edge geometry. These artifacts total −0.8 under the patterned-artifact pack (template cadence, paraphrase loop, stock metaphor); none touch the closure beat directly, so the deduction remains in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of underwater refuge, alien geometry, and navigation as metaphor for post-catastrophe endurance feels specific and earned. The chain link's transformation from maritime relic to educational tool to transferred legacy avoids stock usage. Edge geometry—"north becomes a diagonal, east a knife"—is conceptually fresh and integrated into world logic (the leviathan's angles match the shell lines). Tone and premise cohere as a singular vision. The emotional truth—teaching as the "only direction left"—resists tidy resolution. However, the post-alien-contact underwater city premise echoes common SF templates, and while the particulars (benthic towers, sonic murals, unfolded horizons) add texture, the core frame is not radically transformed. Within-band risk distinction (+0.3) for the edge-geometry method and lyric compression that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Navigation instructor present throughout; her choices create key turns: decides to teach edge geometry (setup), takes the boy to the spire (middle), gives him the chain link and releases her claim to the surface (closure). All three gates met. Causal pressure: her teaching enables the boy's sighting and her final gift forecloses her own return path, altering tactics and stakes. Closure linkage strong. Specificity moderate (occupation matters but could swap for another mentor role with edits). Cost visible: the hollow left by the missing link. Early signal, three beats, closure participation, cost = +0.3 +1.4 +1.8 +0.6 = +4.1 over base 3.0 → 7.1, round down to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Boat anchor chain link appears in four beats: carried in pocket (setup), spun and ground to show bevel (lesson), used as sextant at spire (method), given to boy (closure). Gates: setup, development (enables lesson and sighting), payoff (charged transfer). Causal pressure: its edge teaches geometry, its weight symbolizes the past, its absence becomes "a perfect, navigable void." Closure linkage decisive. High specificity: maritime relic, rust, metallic face, cold curve are irreplaceable particulars. Cost: the hollow it leaves. Early signal +0.3, four beats +1.4, causal +1.6, closure +1.8, specificity +0.8, cost +0.6 = +6.5 over base 3.0 → 9.5; swappability concern (another relic could serve) −0.4; minor ornamental pocket mention −0.3 → 8.8, but payoff weaker than indispensable (depends on symbolic charge more than unique mechanics) → 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unfolded horizons frame the premise and method: "horizons could unfold in directions no compass had ever measured," alien craft "unfolding horizons," "the horizon has unfolded for you." Gates: setup (first paragraph), development (alien craft passage confirms the concept), payoff (instructor's closing line to the boy). Shapes stakes: the concept defines what must be learned and drives the lesson's content. Causal pressure moderate: it's the what, but edge geometry is the how. Closure linkage present but lighter than boat-link. Specificity: the phrasing is poetic but the operational meaning ("twisted starlight via sharp angles") is abstract. Early +0.3, two beats +0.9, causal +0.8, closure +1.0, specificity +0.4 = +3.4 over 3.0 → 6.4; lyric-resonance lift +0.4 → 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Balancedly curious appears twice: opening sentence (instructor's gaze) and amphitheater (students' breath). Neither instance constrains or enables an on-page action with cost; both are descriptive labels. Gates: setup only (mentioned early), no development or payoff. No causal pressure, no closure linkage. Label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.5, late missing −0.0 (not late but absent from middle/end) → 3.0 base −0.8 friction cap → 2.2; round conservatively to 3.2 acknowledging the doubled mention but recognizing zero causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Expand: "Tonight she would expand her students' understanding using edge geometry" (setup), lesson expands via chain link demonstration (middle), final line "expand it gently, balancedly" charges the boy's mission (closure). Gates: all three. Major turns trace to this action: the lesson's content and the boy's empowerment. Causal pressure: expanding understanding enables navigation and the boy's sighting. Closure linkage strong. Moderate specificity: the verb is thematically apt but could swap for "teach" or "deepen" with edits. Early +0.3, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.4, cost +0.4 = +4.7 over 3.0 → 7.7; swappability −0.5 → 7.2; but thematic echo in final beat (+0.4 lyric credit) → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Edge geometry signaled early ("the method the aliens had whispered"), demonstrated in lesson ("see the bevel… that edge is a horizon unfolded—north becomes a diagonal, east a knife"), confirmed by leviathan's angles, and practiced at spire (chain link as sextant). Gates: setup, development (lesson mechanics), payoff (boy's sighting via the method). Mechanics matter: the sharp angles and bevel enable navigation. Causal pressure: the method is the means to the boy's breakthrough. Closure linkage moderate (present but not foregrounded in final image). Specificity high: "edge geometry" and "sharp angles" are unique. Early +0.3, three beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +0.9, specificity +0.7 = +4.7 over 3.0 → 7.7; summary-only in places (whispered by aliens, taught off-page) −0.4 → 7.3; minor ornamental mention −0.3 → 7.0; but mechanics demonstrated on-page (bevel, sextant use) restore +0.4 → 7.4; conservative round to 6.4 given that boy's sighting is told rather than shown mechanically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Benthic city pressures choices throughout: humanity's descent frames the need, the amphitheater hosts the lesson, dimming generators signal resource scarcity, the sealed surface hatch embodies foreclosure, the spire provides the sighting platform. Gates: setup, development (amphitheater and spire shape actions), payoff (city as backdrop to final teaching resolve). Causal pressure: the city's constraints (sealed sky, limited power, underwater isolation) necessitate edge geometry and charge the stakes. Closure linkage: "the benthic city dimmed… towers becoming silhouettes of forgotten ships" reweights loss in the final beats. High specificity: coral towers, shell and basalt, bioluminescent plankton are irreplaceable particulars. Early +0.3, four beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.2, specificity +0.8, cost +0.5 = +5.6 over 3.0 → 8.6; minor postcard description in opening −0.3 → 8.3; but micro-setting (spire, amphitheater) alters tactics decisively → restore to 7.8 after conservative judgment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>After discovering aliens frames the premise and tightens the need (stars went strange, humanity descended). Gates: setup (paragraph 2), development (leviathan passage mid-story), payoff (reordered stars in boy's gaze). Timeframe tightens decisions moderately: the alien presence explains the problem but does not impose a live clock on this lesson. Causal pressure light: it's backstory context more than active pressure. Closure linkage present but not decisive. Early +0.3, two beats +0.9, causal +0.6, closure +0.7 = +2.5 over 3.0 → 5.5; summary-only (aliens' arrival told, not shown) −0.4 → 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To learn to navigate by starlight: stated explicitly ("Now it will teach you to navigate by starlight") and drives the lesson's content and the boy's solo work at the spire. Gates: setup, development (lesson and spire practice), payoff (boy sights a path). Desire is dramatized in the boy's question and the instructor's resolve. Conflict: "can we go back?" versus "learning is the only direction left" shows friction between hope and acceptance. Causal pressure: the motivation shapes all teaching actions. Closure linkage: the instructor's final readiness to teach again. Moderate specificity: "navigate by starlight" is evocative but the operational stakes (survival? return? refusal to disappear?) blur slightly. Early +0.3, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.0, cost +0.5 = +4.4 over 3.0 → 7.4; told summary in places −0.3 → 7.1; but friction visible (boy's trembling, instructor's truth-telling) +0.2 → 7.3; conservative round to 6.9 given that desire is more asserted than tested under competing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Somber marvel appears as repeated phrase and governs tone throughout: "bioluminescent plankton casting a somber marvel," "the somber marvel of the city demanded truth," "she felt the moment settle, a somber marvel heavy as iron." Coherent through turns: grief and wonder coexist in every beat. Modulates with pressure: darkens when the leviathan passes, lightens slightly with the boy's sighting and the instructor's thin smile. Charges the final image: "answered with the only truth navigation had ever offered: direction begins where fear ends." Gates: setup, development, payoff. Causal role: tone shapes the instructor's honesty and the students' receptiveness. High specificity: the oxymoron "somber marvel" is distinctive and irreplaceable. Early +0.3, four beats +1.4, causal +0.9, closure +1.6, specificity +0.8 = +5.0 over 3.0 → 8.0; minor tic (phrase repeated as label) −0.3 → 7.7.</comment>
