<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The janitor's journey from grief to reopened vulnerability is conceptually present, but the transformation relies heavily on labeled emotion ("grief he carried," "strength in vulnerability") rather than embodied contradiction. The vision sequence provides a catalyst, yet the protagonist remains largely receptive rather than making conflicted choices under pressure. The meteor's question about bravery is delivered as wisdom rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and the final trade—lantern for "reopened chest"—is asserted more than shown through micro-choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through the nightly ritual of speaking to meteors until the vision catalyzes understanding. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the janitor walks away having traded the lantern's glow for internalized openness), and the felt cost—leaving the station, abandoning the physical light—is legible on the page. However, orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening paragraph's cosmic framing, and the vision's mechanics (touching the fleck, folding into "black water") introduce a supernatural turn without prior rule-teaching, weakening causal coherence even under an accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting—dome, telescope, brass instruments, rotating sigh—provides concrete sensory anchors and the mirrors' final arrangement directly enables the closure gesture of welcome. The yellow lantern glass recurs with specificity (cracked, warm, transparent transformation) and charges the ending through the afterimage discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear across the station's interior and mountain road, and the setting's abandonment pressures the janitor's solitary ritual, meeting the 9+ gate of constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding connection or meaning in the overlooked era—is signaled early and accumulates through the nightly empathy practice. The vision sequence provides one meaningful deepening that reweights the janitor's grief into actionable understanding, and the final choice to leave the dome open and walk away forecloses the path of passive tending. Yet the escalation is largely internal and receptive; the meteor's question arrives as catalyst rather than protagonist-driven turn, and the price paid (abandoning the lantern, leaving the station) feels more symbolic than tactically constrained.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability as atmosphere rather than armor emerges from the lantern's transformation and the janitor's chest-opening metaphor, cohering in the final image of yellow afterimages shaped like a heart. The meteor's question about being "small enough to burn" versus "brave enough to change" anchors the thematic inquiry in a specific moment. However, the closing paragraphs veer toward overt thematic summary ("strength in vulnerability," "confession still echoed") rather than letting the reopened dome and warm glass shard speak without gloss, and the "primal elegance of shared orbit" phrase drifts into abstract poeticism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric-omniscient register with elevated, image-dense syntax ("dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies," "primal elegance of shared orbit") that matches the cosmic-intimate tone. POV distance remains stable in third-person-limited focused on the janitor, and the perceptual signature—spiritual curiosity filtering meteors as confidants—is character-specific. However, the prose occasionally slides into sermonic phrasing ("understanding that strength in vulnerability was not armor but atmosphere") and the final two paragraphs shift toward a distanced retrospective voice ("They assumed," "Sometimes, on nights") that blurs the earlier tight focalization without a taught pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often purposeful ("soft meteor of grief," "dark dialects of iron and ice"), but several beats stack metaphors without clear payoff: "black water" for the vision-space, "flourishing stillness" repeated without evolving stakes, and "strength in vulnerability" becoming a thesis statement rather than image. Paraphrase loops appear in the ending: "hush of an overlooked era" recurs three times, and the final two paragraphs restate the afterimage motif and the janitor's transformation in near-synonyms. Template cadence is present in repeated "he [verb]" openings across the middle third, and the closing "And if you hike" direct-address pivot feels like scaffolding for thematic closure rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The cosmic-janitor-as-empathy-conduit premise offers a fresh synthesis of labor, grief, and cosmology, and the yellow lantern glass functioning as a memory-repository for meteors is a specific, non-obvious object choice. The vision sequence's trajectory—meteor birth, lonely cruise, singing in dark dialects—provides vivid particulars. However, the emotional arc (grief → empathy → reopened vulnerability) follows a familiar redemption-through-connection template, and the final images (heart-shaped afterimage, warm glass shard humming in pine needles) lean toward symbolic convenience rather than transformation of existing tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor is introduced in the opening line, drives the nightly ritual of speaking to meteors (middle development), and makes the final choice to leave the dome open and walk away (closure participation). His decisions—arranging mirrors, removing lens caps, walking without the lantern—alter the station's state and foreclose his role as keeper. However, many key turns are receptive: the vision arrives when he touches the fleck, and the meteor's question prompts understanding rather than emerging from the janitor's conflicted choice under pressure. The character shapes the ending but does not create the central reversal through agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The yellow lantern glass appears in the opening line (setup), is handled across multiple beats (tracing reflections, discovering the charcoal fleck, touching it to trigger the vision, finding it transparent afterward), and its absence in the final walk and its afterimage presence in the ending both charge the closure. The glass's transformation from cracked and glowing to transparent maps the janitor's internal shift, and its warmth recurs in the final shard image. The object enables the vision catalyst and its evolving state (hoarding reflections → transparent) carries thematic weight, meeting the multi-beat and closure-linkage tests for high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Flourishing stillness" is named in the opening ("hush of the overlooked era") and closing paragraphs but functions primarily as atmospheric description rather than a stake that constrains choices. The janitor's practice occurs within stillness, yet the concept does not shape tactics or present a dilemma; it remains a thematic backdrop. The phrase is repeated ("flourishing stillness they now breathed") as label rather than dramatized pressure, trending ornamental despite early and final mentions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is stated once in paragraph three and motivates the janitor's nightly kneeling beside the telescope, a choice that seeds the empathy ritual. However, the trait is label-only; it does not constrain a decision or create visible tradeoff. The janitor's actions (speaking to meteors, touching the fleck) flow from this curiosity, but the cost tied to curiosity versus duty or safety is never dramatized, leaving the attribute functional but replaceable with "drawn to" or "compelled."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Empathize" is introduced in paragraph six ("practiced empathize with the spent meteors"), directly drives the middle sequence of nightly rituals, and enables the vision that reweights the janitor's grief into understanding. The action is specific to the premise and shapes the closure gesture (leaving the dome open as welcome). However, "empathize" could be substituted with "commune" or "listen" without major structural change, and the empathy itself is more receptive than a conflicted action with on-page cost, capping the score below indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Tracing the path of falling stars" is introduced in paragraph four (tracing reflections across the lantern glass), recurs in the vision sequence (the ribbon of starlight stretching backward), and echoes in the final paragraphs ("a cosmic janitor had once traced the path"). The method seeds the empathy ritual and shapes the lyric closure image. However, the mechanics are never constrained or tested under pressure; tracing is an observational habit rather than a means that alters tactics or fails under stakes, making it purposeful but not causally essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station is anchored in the opening paragraph, provides the telescope and mirrors as tools the janitor uses (middle beats), and the dome's final state—open, lenses uncapped, mirrors arranged—directly embodies the closure gesture of welcome. The station's abandonment and obsolescence pressure the janitor's solitary role, and the instruments' alignment in the ending surprises the returning scientists, proving the setting's transformation. The station is integral to the character's function and the ending's physical manifestation, meeting the essential-across-beats test.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through the hush of an overlooked era" frames the opening and recurs in paragraph seven and the ending, establishing a liminal temporal backdrop. However, the timeframe remains vague—no on-page clock tightens decisions, and the "years later" epilogue leaps without causal pressure from duration. The era's "end" (new scientists arrive) happens off-page, and the nightly ritual's span is unspecified. The phrase functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than a constraint that alters tactics, trending ornamental despite recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To find strength in vulnerability" is explicitly named in paragraph twelve ("understanding that strength in vulnerability was not armor but atmosphere") and the meteor's question about being "small enough to burn" dramatizes the same inquiry. The motivation drives the janitor's empathy practice and his final choice to walk without the lantern, trading protection for openness. However, the desire is largely told in thesis-like language rather than shown through conflicted wants; the janitor never resists vulnerability or pays a visible price for choosing it over self-protection, making the motivation thematic rather than dramatized with friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Primal elegance" is named once (paragraph eleven: "the primal elegance of shared orbit") and the tone—lyric, elevated, cosmic-intimate—coheres across the piece with modulating intensity from the reflective opening through the vision's sensory immersion to the quieter closing retrospective. The prose maintains a consistent register of poetic specificity ("dark dialects of iron and ice," "thin, necessary layer that lets light bruise you") that charges the final images. However, the tone remains largely static in mood rather than escalating with pressure; the vision's intensity does not sharply contrast the frame, and the closing shift to direct address ("And if you hike") feels like a tonal seam rather than purposeful modulation.</comment>
