<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to preserve names is clear and her sacrifice structure tracks, but the piece leans heavily on labeled emotions ("foxglove regret") rather than embodied contradiction. The memory-for-name trade creates a mechanical progression without genuine internal conflict—she accepts each payment too smoothly. The final self-sacrifice reads as predetermined rather than earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her particular psychology never emerges beyond the curator archetype.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through lyric patterning and density increase, holding it through the chandelier sequence to a Conceptual Repricing at closure where Lira becomes the "final extinct feeling." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. However, the cost—though conceptually present—remains abstract: we see memories listed but never feel their loss reshape her stance or tactics in subsequent beats. The causal chain (cracked tube → light → payment → preservation) functions but the escalation is additive rather than transformative until the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The opal library, glass-orchid petals, and chandelier-of-hollow-bulbs create a cohesive micro-world with consistent internal logic. The cracked bamboo tube constrains her method (she must amplify through the tuning fork and quill), and the drawer system (Serenity/Wrath) supplies the tools that enable the climactic lighting. The setting charges the final image effectively: the tube falling through cloud decks to a valley grounds the conceptual sacrifice in spatial consequence. Sensory detail remains heavily visual and occasionally generic ("colorless breath," "phosphorescent plankton") but the architecture matters to her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve extinct names or let them vanish—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chandelier demands memory-for-name payment, forcing serial forfeiture. Yet the escalation is mechanical: each name costs one memory in identical transactions, no complication or resistance. The final self-erasure deepens thematically but arrives as logical extension rather than a pressured choice that narrows live options. Agency is present (she selects which memories) but the cost never alters her tactics or creates friction between want and capability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely from the preservation-versus-erasure action and the final image—"the caretaker must become the final extinct feeling"—reweights the premise without stating a moral. The glass-orchid and foxglove motifs recur purposefully, charging the ending when the tube's note carries "part lullaby, part Lira" to teach the living. Subtext operates in the chandelier's "gently systematic cruelty" and the child's curiosity at the close. One slip: "foxglove regret sweet on her tongue" edges toward overt thematic labeling, but the image of her becoming translucent silhouette and the tube landing in a valley earn the conceptual resonance without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric-archival register with purposeful elevation ("diaphragms of sky and memory," "reading lectern carved from fossilized sighs") that matches the museum-of-extinct-feelings frame. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into generic poetic stock ("silk scarves pulled through needle eyes," "phosphorescent plankton") and syntactic patterns repeat: "she [verb], [result]" structures dominate the middle third. The perceptual signature is more conceptual than character-particular—Lira notices in abstractions (emotions, light, echoes) rather than through a specific sensory hierarchy. Compression and patterned elision (emotion drawers, memory transactions) are taught early and remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats, but figurative language saturates the text without relief: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated simile, creating a uniform poetic texture that dulls peak moments. Paraphrase loops appear: "hollow bulbs where every extinct name was once stored as vibration" then "bulbs guttered, starved for resonance" restates the same concept. Template cadence ("she [verb], [noun]; she [verb], [noun]") runs through the memory-payment sequence. The final image (tube falling, child lifting it, note escaping) propels cleanly, but earlier beats stack modifiers and mixed vehicles ("foxglove chambers of her heart," "translucent silhouette, a glass-orchid paper cutout") that obscure rather than clarify under pressure. No major causality break, so penalties remain in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of curator-as-sacrifice and sound-preservation via organic resonance offers a fresh angle on archive/memory premises. The specific mechanics (cracked tube, tuning fork, emotion drawers, memory-for-name barter) avoid generic fantasy-museum tropes. However, the emotional arc—dutiful caretaker sacrifices self to preserve heritage—follows a recognizable template without sharp moral friction or a non-obvious counter-pressure. The child-receives-music coda, though elegantly executed, echoes familiar torch-passing endings. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation, abstract setting) is present but the closure effect remains safely poignant rather than troubling or multi-valent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira drives all major beats: she carries the tube, strikes the tuning fork, selects memories, and offers her silhouette. Setup immediate, middle choices (which memories to feed) constrain tactics, and her final self-sacrifice is the closure hinge. Causal pressure is strong; without her specific choices the chandelier fails. Minor cap: the choices feel too smooth—no hesitation dramatized—but the element is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube appears in setup (carried up the spiral), is handled in two distinct beats (placed on lectern, lashed with quill), and its fissure widening into a mouth delivers the closure image when her name escapes and the tube falls. The crack's dual function—leaking chords, then exhaling light—makes it irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement. Slight swappability concern: "cracked vessel" could substitute with minor edits, preventing top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" frames the setting (tear-cities, apology-gardens) and the stakes (if bulbs darken, marvels sink to white nothing). Middle beat references marvels stirring when names are saved. Closure beat: "the museum exulted" and marvels bloom. Setup and payoff present; middle participation is thin (one line). Causal role is secondary—Lira's goal centers on names, marvels are consequence. Functional but not driving; lyric reprise present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is assigned twice as trait and once at closure ("gently systematic cruelty of preservation"). It labels her method but does not visibly constrain action—she could be methodical, deliberate, or precise with identical moves. The closure phrase reweights it thematically but does not tie a visible cost to the trait itself. Present across beats but remains label-level; no on-page tradeoff where being systematic (vs. impulsive) alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Light" is the central action: her duty is to light the chandelier, the tuning fork/quill create audible light, the bulbs inhale it, and lighting completes when she pays the final memory. Setup, middle (striking fork, converting fracture to reed), and closure (bulbs flared, "brightened to sunrise") all hinge on this verb. Strongly causal. Minor swappability: "illuminate" or "restore" could replace with edits, and the act itself is static (no variation under pressure), keeping it mid-high rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lullaby echo is seeded early (tube leaking chords, echo from mothers), becomes the amplification method (she catches syllables with glass-orchid petals, strikes tuning fork to meet the lullaby), and the closure note is "part lullaby, part Lira." Setup, middle causal work (without the echo she cannot extract names), and payoff all present. Mechanics matter: the song's faint state forces her to use the fork and quill. Strong integration; slight abstraction (we never hear the melody's content) prevents top score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The opal library supplies the emotion drawers (Serenity/Wrath) that provide the tuning fork and quill, enabling her solution. The mezzanine and dome structure her movement. Setup immediate, middle beat (walking mezzanine, opening drawers) alters tactics, and closure references the opal railing echo. The library's "above clouds" isolation supports theme. Solid involvement across all three gates and one clear tactical constraint (drawers as resource). Not highest band because the specific opal/cloud details are decorative—"archive above the world" would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Museum of extinct feelings" frames the setting conceptually and bookends the piece (opening "the hour was twilight" and closing "at twilight you can hear"). The temporal phrase recurs but does not tighten decisions—no countdown or urgency tied to "tonight" versus any other night. Setup and closure present; middle has no time pressure. The museum locale matters more than the timeframe itself. Functional framing but replaceable with minor edits; no live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lira's desire to preserve names drives every choice: she climbs to light the chandelier, amplifies the lullaby, and sacrifices memories. The motivation is dramatized across all three gates and tested by the chandelier's escalating price. The final cost (offering herself) directly fulfills and transforms the want. Strong causal and closure linkage. Slight friction: the motivation is never conflicted—she wants preservation and pays without hesitation—so the cost is structural rather than internally contested, capping it below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named twice (Lira's heart "shaped like a foxglove" closes in regret for Por; "foxglove regret sweet on her tongue" at the final sacrifice) and the closing image calls it "a foxglove regret that keeps the sky from forgetting." The tone is coherent—melancholy, sacrificial—and modulates with the memory payments. Setup metaphor, closure reprise. However, "foxglove" functions more as recurring symbol than tonal modulation; the regret itself remains one static note (elegiac acceptance) rather than charging under pressure. Lyric resonance present but not dynamically tonal.</comment>
