<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is clear and her final choice—pressing the charm to the porthole despite the risk—shows agency with visible cost. However, her interior voice carries elevated diagnostic phrasing ("uncertain alchemist's hands," "quilts memories together into a sigil") that reads as imposed rather than felt under pressure. The embodied contradiction is present (terror versus salvation impulse) but the emotional progression relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("meaning, a reason," "grief") rather than concrete sensory particulars during the peak beats. The workshop's sinking forecloses her life with legible cost, meeting the closure threshold for this category.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure—Lira pressing the charm, the statue healing, the workshop sinking—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with visible cost (her life) and reads as Resonant Reconfiguration under a Causal lens: her action triggers the statue's healing, which transfers weight and destroys the chains. The sequence is motivated and traceable, with one meaningful tightening when she counts chains down and chooses to proceed. The Orientation Test waiver applies: the opening anchors who (Lira), where (workshop on acid sea), and what (studying the statue) by the second paragraph. Minor slip: the logic of "transferred weight of every restored memory" causing chain breakage is thematically resonant but mechanically vague—does memory have mass in this world, or is it symbolic pressure? The ambiguity does not break causality but softens the causal precision slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is vividly anchored early and constrains Lira's choices: the rebreather mask dictates her thirteen-second breath cycles, the porthole frames her view of the statue, and the dissolving anchor-chains create the ticking-clock pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—acid hissing, chains fizzing, the charm glinting—and the workshop's mechanical rhythm ("master gear clanked, timing her exhalations") embodies the setting as a lived constraint. The final image of the charm drifting upward while the workshop sinks charges the closure with environmental consequence. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to press the charm and risk the workshop sinking to heal the statue—is signaled early and tightens through the chain countdown, creating coherent escalation under a Causal lens. Lira's final choice to proceed despite terror forecloses survival with on-page cost (the workshop slides into the sea, the rebreather floods). The reversal when "meaning had answered" but "meaning was not mercy" narrows her options to a forced trade-off. Minor issue: the internal conflict between "salvation and suicide" is told rather than enacted through micro-choices in prior beats; the decision arrives abruptly at chain four without visible intermediate wavering that would deepen the dilemma.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the kintsugi metaphor—repairing brokenness with gold, preserving memory at cost—and the final image of the charm carrying stitched memories upward offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of meaning-making. However, the closing narration ("Damage accepted. Meaning achieved. Memory endures beyond the vessel") edges into overt thematic statement, and the phrase "quilts her into the greater story" abstracts the moment when image alone could carry it. The statue's healing and Lira's sinking enact the theme without needing the summary. The recurring charm constrains her choice and reweights prior material, but the explicit "meaning" language in the second half borders on sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close on Lira with consistent focalization and no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—technical alchemist diction mixed with grief-laden imagery—is present but uneven: phrases like "quilts memories together into a sigil" and "kintsugi intentions" read as concept-first rather than Lira's organic thought under pressure. The rebreather mask and thirteen-second breath cycle anchor physicality well, and the narration of pockmarks as "a star map of ruin" fits her analytic lens. However, at peak stress (final chains snapping), the voice escalates into elevated register ("witness," "quilt her into the greater story") rather than compressing or fracturing under duress, which softens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats carry overwriting and mixed metaphor: "Between breaths held underwater" recurs as a refrain four times, becoming template cadence rather than pressure escalation. "Tectonic teeth grinding" mixes geological and biological imagery without coherence. "A tiny sun sinking with her" at closure is vivid but contradicts the earlier "star reversing gravity" in adjacent lines, creating figurative muddle. The final third stacks filter verbs ("saw," "felt") and abstract summaries ("meaning achieved") where concrete image would sharpen. Minor paraphrase loop: "Acid poured through the seams, yet the charm's light persisted" immediately follows "The workshop slid into the sea with a hiss," restating sinking without added detail. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and figurative contradictions touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of kintsugi philosophy, alchemist protagonist, floating workshop, and memory-as-weight creates a specific premise that avoids stock genre templates. The statue-pockmark-to-charm-constellation mechanic is inventive and causally grounded. However, the "golden lacquer holding memories" and "statue commemorating lost people" tropes draw from familiar post-apocalyptic memory-preservation motifs without a non-obvious moral calculus—Lira's choice to save the statue at the cost of her life reads as noble sacrifice without complicating friction. The "acid sea" and "corroded world" setting, while vivid, lean on genre shorthand. The final reversal of the charm rising while Lira sinks offers a fresh inflection on the "meaning persists" theme, lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her uncertain hands and wavering heart are labeled early. Her key choice—pressing the charm at chain four—creates the story's decisive turn and closure. However, "uncertain alchemist" functions more as thematic label than trait with visible cost; her actions (tracing pockmarks, aligning the charm) proceed methodically without on-page mistakes or hesitation that dramatize uncertainty. The attribute appears in setup and closure but does not constrain middle choices, capping score under the two-of-three gate model near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The charm is handled in three distinct beats: Lira worries it at her workstation, unscrews the tray to trace coordinates, and presses it to the porthole at closure. Its golden seams and trapped mercury heartbeat anchor both her grief and her method. The charm's mechanics—matching fracture lines to pockmarks—enable the statue's healing and trigger the climax. Its final ascent reweights prior use as carrier of memory. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (the mother's heartbeat is unique) push the score into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Kintsugi—repairing with gold—is signaled early ("the first successful kintsugi intentions she had ever managed") and the charm's golden seams are central to the statue-healing mechanic. The concept shapes the ending when the statue's pockmarks knit with "luminous scars." However, "kintsugi intentions" as phrasing is abstract and unexplained; the story does not dramatize what "intentions" means mechanically or how Lira learned to apply it. The concept reweights theme at closure but does not constrain middle tactics beyond "match patterns," placing it near the 6.0 threshold with all three gates barely met.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quilts memories together" is stated as Lira's goal ("if she could match the statue's scars to the charm's veins, she might quilt memories together into a sigil") and the verb recurs at closure ("felt it quilt her into the greater story"). The attribute enables the plot mechanic but is told rather than shown through intermediate action—Lira traces dots on velvet, but the quilting itself is declared outcome, not process. It returns with reweighted meaning at the end (lyric reprise) but lacks middle development where the trait constrains a choice with visible cost, landing near 5.5 under the two-gates allowance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Narration frames the story structurally: Lira "narrated their pattern aloud" in the opening, traces and dots as "liturgy" in the middle, and delivers the "final tally aloud" at closure. The action shapes her method (speaking patterns into being) and her role shift from alchemist to witness. However, the narration is more ritual than plot engine—swapping it for silent work would alter tone but not core causality. It appears in all three gates and charges the ending, but the mechanical stakes (breath cycles, chain countdown) drive pressure more than the speech act itself, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—matching pockmarks to charm veins—is signaled early ("If she could match the statue's scars to the charm's veins") and demonstrated in the middle beat: "With a copper stylus she traced the largest pockmark… then dotted the velvet at the corresponding coordinate." The forty-three-dot constellation and alignment trigger the statue's healing, making the method causally essential. However, the jump from "aligned its golden fracture lines over the velvet star-field" to "recognition passed through metal, acid, and grief" elides the mechanism—does alignment alone activate the magic, or does Lira's intention or breath matter? The method is irreplaceable but its exact mechanics remain vague, holding the score in mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The workshop is anchored immediately ("gears-and-cogs workshop groaned against its anchor-chains") and its features—porthole, rebreather requirement, master gear timing breaths, dissolving chains—constrain every beat. The thirteen-second breath cycle and chain countdown create the ticking clock. The workshop's sinking is the story's decisive cost and consequence. The acid sea pressures choices (rebreather use, chain corrosion) and supplies the threat. Environment is indispensable to structure and closure, meeting all integration criteria for high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Between breaths held underwater" recurs as refrain and the thirteen-second cycle is specified early: "She had thirteen seconds before the next intake." The timeframe tightens decisions (forty-three dots mapped within breath cycles) and the chain countdown accelerates pressure. However, the breath mechanic is more atmospheric constraint than lived urgency—Lira completes all tasks without on-page struggle against the clock, and the refrain becomes template cadence rather than escalating timer. The element shapes setup and middle texture and charges closure mood but does not force a time-based trade-off, landing near 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation—to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion—is stated early and her final choice dramatizes it: she presses the charm knowing the workshop will sink, trading her life for restored meaning. The motivation flares into terror ("meaning was not mercy") at chain four, creating friction between desire and cost. However, the motivation is largely told ("a reason to keep the workshop aloft one more day") rather than enacted through failed prior attempts or visible desperation in micro-choices. It appears in all three gates, drives the closure, and carries legible cost, placing it solidly in the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone blends peril (acid sea, dissolving chains, rebreather flooding) with lyric enchantment (golden seams glinting "like desperate sunrise," the charm as "a tiny sun," the statue's eyes opening "calm, ancient, forgiving"). The diction sustains the register through turns, and the final image of the charm rising "toward whatever sky waited" maintains the dire-yet-luminous balance. Minor slips: phrases like "tectonic teeth grinding" and "grateful hiss" anthropomorphize mechanics in ways that tilt toward whimsy rather than dread. The tone modulates with pressure and charges the ending, but occasional figurative mismatch keeps it from highest band, landing near 7.4.</comment>
