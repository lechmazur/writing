<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's progression from crisis actor to nomadic archivist demonstrates motivated interiority, though her choices often feel choreographed rather than earned through visible internal conflict. The relationship with Kestrel arrives late and resolves too smoothly—his immediate transformation from potential threat to co-conspirator bypasses the friction needed to charge their alliance. The final gesture of wrapping the chessboard lacks the visible cost that would make her renunciation feel weighty rather than symbolic. Embodied emotion is present but frequently abstracted through elevated metaphor rather than visceral particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered gesture (walking-as-writing, chess pieces, gallery whispers) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara and Kestrel collaborate to extend the game "until dawn." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (palace, whispering gallery, interregnum context). The closure qualifies as Charged Poise—options crystallize around preserving "small gestures" with the next ruler's arrival imminent—though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kestrel's arrival shifts Mara's solitary archiving into a shared act of resistance, narrowing her tactics and reweighting the stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering gallery functions as both spatial container and active participant, its "stone mouths" shaping the central metaphor and constraining Mara's method of archiving through footsteps. The chessboard's missing pawns concretely mirror the city's evacuated commoners, charging the final image when Mara wraps it to preserve. Spatial choreography remains clear (gallery, lantern circles, squares) and sensory detail is purposefully filtered through Mara's archival attention. The gallery's recurring presence—opening whisper, mid-scene echo, closing satisfaction—supplies the constraint that makes her walking-pattern method legible and necessary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory before the next king "rewrites" history—signals early and tightens once when Kestrel's patrol forces Mara to choose collaboration over solitary archiving. However, the escalation lacks a second reversal or visible loss; Kestrel's immediate acquiescence ("Tell me the name of the maid") deflates the pressure his rifle promised. The story opts for lyric deepening over causal tightening, which fits the Accumulative lens but leaves the final image's cost more implied than dramatized. Agency exists in Mara's choice to share the method, but the foreclosed path (solitary control) is not charged with sufficient on-page friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the chessboard's missing pawns, Mara's walking alphabet, and the interregnum's suspended authority—memory preservation as resistance gains resonance without overt statement. The phrase "benevolently ruthless" operates thematically when Mara ties lace around the queen's neck, enacting the paradox of preserving softness through severance. The final image of the wrapped chessboard and overlapping footsteps offers a non-literal answer to "who owns history," though the conceptual cost (loss of individual authorship, dependence on followers reading "at the exact angle") could press harder. No moralizing intrudes; the piece trusts particulars to carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance, and the elevated register ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") reads as intentional voice rather than drift. However, the diction frequently prioritizes lyric beauty over character-specific perception—phrases like "vowels of air that tasted like iron and lilac" feel authorial rather than filtered through a former crisis actor's sensibility. Kestrel's single line of dialogue carries subtext but arrives too late to establish voice distinction. The prose texture is controlled and purposeful, yet the perceptual signature lacks the idiosyncratic particularity that would ground this voice in Mara's lived experience rather than elegant observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively and information density is high, with most lines advancing image, character, or thematic pattern. However, elevated metaphors cluster densely in high-pressure beats without always serving clarity—"nomadic penumbra drifting just outside the circles of lantern light" and "luminous absence" feel ornamental rather than functional. Paraphrase loops appear: the chessboard's missing pawns are explained twice (paragraph 2 and 10), and the "small gestures" motif recurs without meaningful pressure variation. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "she/they [verb]" structures. Figurative language in most sentences of key beats (Kestrel's entrance, final collaboration) triggers density penalties. No filter-verb stacks or severe artifacts touch closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of walking-as-alphabet, missing chess pawns, and whispering gallery offers a fresh angle on memory-preservation narratives, avoiding stock interregnum tropes. The "benevolently ruthless" paradox is specific and well-realized in the lace-around-the-queen gesture. However, the crisis-actor background, while intriguing, remains underutilized—Mara's rehearsed-versus-real dichotomy does not constrain her present choices in ways that feel narratively necessary. The final image of wrapped chessboard and overlapping shadows feels earned in retrospect but lacks the bold risk that would elevate from competent execution to indispensable vision. The piece transforms its material through lyric density but stops short of full conceptual surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (crisis actor/real survivor) is present throughout and her dual history seeds the theme of rehearsed versus authentic response. However, the trait functions more as backstory texture than active constraint—her choices to walk patterns, tie lace, and collaborate with Kestrel do not demonstrably trace to her actor training or trauma survival in ways that would break if the backstory changed. Setup clear, development indirect, closure participation via thematic echo but not causal necessity. Mid-band for thematic presence without on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The chessboard (missing pawns) appears in paragraph 2, is handled when Mara places lace on the queen (paragraph 9), returned to when she and Kestrel move pieces through the night (paragraph 16), and wrapped in her cloak at closure (paragraph 18). Its missing pawns concretely mirror the evacuated city and charge the final image of "gaps only the living could fill." Three distinct beats plus closure linkage with felt thematic cost. Strong integration; irreplaceability high because the pawn metaphor is load-bearing for stakes and ending resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" is named in paragraph 4 and reprised in the final paragraph as something Mara "carried inside her." The phrase operates as metaphor for her evasive movement and archival method, but it does not constrain a specific choice or alter tactics—Mara's walking pattern would function identically without this label. Setup present, thematic echo at closure, but no middle development where the concept narrows options or enables a turn. Lyric reprise without causal work. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is introduced in paragraph 8 as Mara's archival stance and immediately enacted when she ties lace around the queen's neck (paragraph 9)—preserving memory by "cutting it free of context." This action has conceptual cost (selective truth) and charges the closure's wrapped board. Setup and one key beat with cost; closure participation via the preserved board. Two gates met with visible tradeoff. Solid integration; eligible for mid-6s. Not indispensable because the choice could function without the label, but the label sharpens the moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears three times: Mara unbinds her bootlace to tie the queen (paragraph 9, enabling her vow gesture), the gallery asks to be unbound from imposed silence (implicit in paragraph 7's "rewrite us"), and she is "ready to unbind the next small truth" in the final line. The bootlace unbinding enables the queen-as-vow beat, a causal choice with cost. Setup, middle action that constrains choice, and thematic reprise at closure. Three gates with causal pressure. Strong mid-7s; not indispensable because the vow could use another object, but the action is specific and purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Walking-to-spell-words is introduced in paragraph 5 ("each footstep was a letter"), demonstrated when Mara spells "remember" (paragraph 11) to encircle herself and Kestrel, used again to spell "Adel" (paragraph 15), and culminates in the overlapping final walk where the word "could only be read by someone following them at the exact angle" (paragraph 19). Four beats with escalating specificity; the method enables the collaboration with Kestrel and charges the closure by making memory preservation conditional on precise shared stance. Setup, two middle developments, closure integration with visible constraint. Essential across beats and ending; high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is anchored in paragraph 2, actively speaks to Mara in paragraph 7 ("Record us"), its acoustics enable the footstep-alphabet method (paragraph 5 "carried the name outward"), and it "closed its stone mouths behind them, satisfied" at closure (paragraph 20), already planning its next whisper. Four beats; the setting supplies the acoustic constraint that makes Mara's walking method legible and necessary. Setup, middle pressure (speaking, carrying names), closure participation. Strong integration; the story's stakes depend on this specific spatial property. High-7s; not quite indispensable because another echo-space could substitute, but the gallery's agency elevates it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The interregnum is named in the opening line, contextualizes the power vacuum that makes archiving urgent, and the dawn arrival of "the next ruler's heralds" (paragraph 16) establishes a live deadline that motivates Mara and Kestrel to extend the game through the night. Setup clear, deadline pressure in climax, closure anchored to the threshold moment ("when the first bird outside called the hour that no clock measured," paragraph 17). Two gates; causal role in escalation. Mid-5s to low-6s for shaping one turn without tight on-page clock mechanics. The timeframe enables urgency but does not visibly constrain minute-to-minute tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "become the historian of small gestures" is named in paragraph 8, enacted through her walking alphabet and the choice to spell "Adel" for Kestrel (paragraph 15, a specific memory), and fulfilled when she wraps the chessboard at closure (paragraph 18, preserving the archive). Setup, one key dramatized choice (naming Adel), closure linkage. The motivation drives the central action but faces minimal friction—Kestrel's immediate cooperation deflates the tension between solitary control and shared archive. Two gates with one cost-bearing beat. Mid-6s for clear motivation with modest on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is introduced in paragraph 10 (chessboard mirroring the city), echoed in paragraph 14 ("luminous absence of gunfire"), and reprised in the final paragraph as Mara's carried "nomadic penumbra... a moving eclipse that revealed by hiding." The tone coheres as elegiac restraint and modulates subtly when Kestrel's threat dissolves into collaboration. Setup, middle modulation, thematic closure reprise. Lyric consistency throughout with one key tonal shift. Mid-6s for coherent execution; the tone charges the final image but does not drive a causal turn. Additive guidance for closure linkage and rhythmic control; subtractive for swappability (other paradoxical elegiac phrases could substitute).</comment>
