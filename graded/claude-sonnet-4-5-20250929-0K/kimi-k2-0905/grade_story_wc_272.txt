<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is heavily stylized and abstract, leaning on rhetorical questions rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice—stepping through the mirror—feels more like yielding to a symbolic logic than a dramatized internal conflict with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is declared through metaphor ("luminescent ache") rather than shown through bodily reaction or micro-choice under pressure. The endurance reads more as narrative inevitability than earned renunciation with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode with clear anchors (lighthouse, library, Elian) established early. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: Elian completes the "redesign" by stepping through the mirror into the sea, accepting fragmentation as a "truer fracture." However, the cost is more asserted than demonstrated—what specific option or relationship is foreclosed on the page remains vague. The final image reweights prior material but the felt price is diffuse, limiting high-band access.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: sinking nightly, contracting shelves, spilling atlases create spatial pressure that mirrors Elian's descent. The tarot box and mirror function as micro-setting objects that constrain his final choice. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (mildewed breath, salt-stained ledgers, candle "the color of low tide"), filtered through a lyric lens. The environment charges the final image—stepping through into "black water"—meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—painting a face that no longer exists, completing the "redesign"—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through environmental tightening (walls closing, shelves collapsing) and the fragmentary tarot reconstruction. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; Elian's agency reads as following a symbolic script rather than forcing trade-offs with visible alternatives. The final step through the mirror forecloses life but the cost feels conceptual rather than dramatically tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through image and action: fragmentation, memory as coastline, the impossibility of wholeness. The tarot reconstruction and mirror passage embody the central question without thesis-stating. The final image—"a truer fracture, a face the tides would never erase"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the closing rhetorical question from future villagers edges toward overt thematic statement, and the preceding lines risk moralizing the redesign as "complete," slightly undermining earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-close throughout with a lyric, elevated register that suits the tone. Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphor-dense, question-driven, abstract. The repeated rhetorical questions feel character-particular rather than generic. However, psychic distance occasionally drifts omniscient ("villagers will find," "the question will be answered by the waves") in the final paragraph without clear temporal shift, and the diction ("luminescent ache," "negative space") risks over-poeticizing at peak beats where concrete sensation would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, creating density but also slowing momentum—"pulse like a dying heart," "margins bled contradictory coastlines," "paper wings flutter" pile without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear: "fragmented reality" is restated multiple times across paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs in rhetorical questions ("Is a prophecy still sacred," "Does a line know," "Is absence the purest pigment") cluster in high-pressure beats without dramatized answers, triggering −0.6. Register remains elevated but consistent; no grammatical errors. The overwriting and loops prevent high-band access despite local vividness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of portrait artist, fragmented tarot, and sinking lighthouse creates a fresh frame for grief and memory. The notion of "redesign by untangling threads" and stepping through absence as a door offers non-obvious turns. However, the emotional arc—artist seeking lost beloved, descending into symbolic death—follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The lyric execution elevates familiar material but does not fundamentally reinvent it. Risk-taking in voice and image is present but the core emotional journey trends archetypal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elian makes the key choice to step through the mirror at closure, altering outcome. However, most beats show him observing, reflecting, or following symbolic cues rather than deciding between live options with visible cost. His agency reads more as yielding to the lighthouse's logic than forcing tactical trade-offs. Present in setup, middle (reconstructing tarot), and ending (stepping through), meeting two gates, but causal pressure is diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tarot box appears early (setup), is used in the reconstruction middle beat (development), and the reconstructed card shapes the mirror passage (payoff). It returns with reweighted meaning—from broken prophecy to "chimera of strength and innocence" that paints the door. However, its mechanics (how ink "squirms" or "transfers") remain abstract, limiting irreplaceability. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage but swappability (another symbolic object could serve) caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fragmented reality shapes the setting (contracting lighthouse, splintered tarot, cracked mirror) and the dominant stake (painting a fragmented face). It constrains Elian's method—he must work with shards—and charges the final image of "truer fracture." Present across all beats and thematically central. However, it functions more as pervasive atmosphere than a rule that narrows specific tactical choices with visible cost, preventing scores above mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions recur throughout but function as voice texture rather than a trait that constrains action. Elian's habit of asking unanswered questions does not visibly enable or prevent a choice with cost. The pattern is consistent but ornamental—removing it would not break plot logic or alter closure. Present but replaceable with another meditative tic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Redesign" is signaled early ("redesign the very grammar of seeing"), enacted in the tarot reconstruction middle beat, and completed at closure when Elian transfers the image onto the mirror and steps through. The action is irreplaceable—plot hinges on this act of reassembly and transformation. It drives two key turns and the ending would fail without it. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the mechanics remain somewhat abstract, limiting top-band access.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is named as the method taught by Elian's mentor and enacted in the tarot reconstruction beat where he touches scraps and feels ink "squirm, eager to rejoin." It appears in setup (named), development (used), and shapes the closure image (threads join "into a truer fracture"). However, the mechanics are vague—what does "untangling" look like as a procedure?—limiting how much it constrains or enables specific choices. Present across beats but under-specified.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is established early and continuously pressures Elian: sinking nightly, contracting walls, collapsing shelves, narrowing corridors. It forces descent, supplies the tarot box and mirror, and its foundation is where closure occurs. The setting is irreplaceable—removal would erase plot logic and stakes. It drives at least three beats (library exploration, descent, mirror chamber) and charges the final image ("black water"). Strong causal work and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is realized literally and continuously: the lighthouse contracts each night, shelves lean inward, the structure will collapse "before sunrise." Time pressure is legible and shapes Elian's urgency to complete the redesign. However, the ticking clock does not force a specific tactical trade-off or deadline choice—Elian proceeds at a lyric pace without visible racing against minutes. Present across beats and thematically integrated but not tight enough on decision points for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "descend into necessary darkness" is named explicitly and enacted: Elian follows the spiral down, steps through the mirror into the sea. It drives the closure action and is thematically central. However, it is more declared than dramatized through conflicting wants—there is no visible pull between safety and descent, only resolve. Friction between cost and desire is abstract rather than embodied in a choice with visible alternatives. Present in setup, middle, and ending but lacks on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is established early (candle glow, tarot card glow) and recurs at closure ("luminescent ache migrate from card to chest"). The tone is coherent—melancholy, lyric, charged with loss—and modulates with spatial descent. It charges the final image but remains somewhat static; no sharp tonal shift marks escalation. The phrase itself appears twice, bracketing the arc, but its role is more atmospheric than tactical. Solid reprise but not indispensable to plot mechanics.</comment>
