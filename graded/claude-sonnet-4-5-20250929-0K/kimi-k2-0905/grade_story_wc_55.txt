<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arlen's interiority is vivid and embodied—"mainsprings inside his chest, now slack," frost feathering across the clock case—but his motivation lacks genuine internal contradiction. The decision to surrender the dream arrives pre-formed; we never see him struggle against the impulse or weigh alternatives. The final change feels more like enacting a resolved choice than forging one under pressure, limiting agency at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates symbolic density around the clock, forecourt, and petrichor through recurrence and intensification, landing on a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Arlen leaves the clock and "inherited stillness." The cost is legible—he forecloses ambition and accepts emptiness—and the final image of the corroded gears fused to crystal reweights prior material. Orientation is clear early. Minor weakness: the middle section layers reflection heavily without crisp micro-choices that alter present tactics, slightly flattening the tightening expected even in accumulative designs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt constrains movement (the bead of water rolling into gloom, kneeling, placing the clock) and charges the closure (gears fusing to crystal). Sensory detail is purposeful: petrichor, wet slate, moss and iron all anchor the POV's nostalgic filter. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The observatory dome and mountain descent provide coherent pressure on Arlen's solitary ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—making peace with the abandoned dream—is clear early and tightens through the act of placing the clock and pendulum. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than causal reversal: each reflection and gesture reweights the cost of letting go. Visible price: Arlen walks away with "emptiness he once feared," a path foreclosed. The middle leans reflective, slightly softening pressure, but the final ritual earns its weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the clock that listens versus the clock that ticks loudly, the tension between ambition and stillness. The ending offers a resonant answer—"peace, once earned, keeps its own soft ticking"—without overt moralizing, though the final paragraph edges toward summary. Petrichor and the glacial hush recur with reweighted meaning. Minor slip: "excruciatingly gentle" as a phrase is invoked too often as a thematic label rather than left to gather from image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close, distance controlled, and the perceptual signature is consistent: Arlen notices moss, iron, and the planet's pulse. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, fitting the reflective mode. Weakness: the prose does not modulate under peak emotional pressure; the same ornate cadence persists whether Arlen is remembering investors' laughter or placing the pendulum. Key phrase "excruciatingly gentle" recurs as authorial motif rather than character-specific idiom, slightly diluting voice ownership.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is very high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile. In isolation, many are vivid ("dome lay cracked like a skull forgetting its own name"), but the accumulation blurs propulsion and creates tonal monotony. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with subject + past-tense verb in similar rhythm. Key phrases loop: "excruciatingly gentle" appears three times, "glacial hush" five times, "petrichor nostalgia" three times. The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing the years-later frame, dulling closure momentum. These artifacts cluster throughout, triggering line-level debt that disallows 9+ globally and caps this category per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—clockmaker seeking a device to measure gentle time—is fresh and the emotional arc (surrender as gain) avoids template resolution. Specificity in the brass hatch, verdigris, and crystal tesserae anchors the world. Weakness: the piece leans heavily on well-worn lyric tropes (rain-washed stone, hidden sunrise, corroded artifact as relic) without transforming them through action. The final twist (apprentices inventing saint stories) is elegant but decorative; it does not grow from Arlen's on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlen (introverted clock scribe) appears throughout and his choice to leave the clock shapes the closure. Setup clear, development present (kneeling, removing pendulum), closure linkage strong (walking away, inheriting stillness). Cost is legible. Weakness: observation dominates over decision-making in the middle; the choice feels pre-resolved rather than forged under pressure. Two gates firmly met, closure participation present, but causal pressure is moderate. Band guidance and lyric-resonance allowance lift this above functional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Crystal forecourt anchors early (first paragraph), reappears in multiple beats (kneeling, placing clock, feeling planet's pulse), and charges the ending (gears fusing to crystal). Three gates met. Specificity strong: "crystal tesserae," violet fractures, silver mist. Weakness: the forecourt is described more than used; Arlen does not navigate it tactically or encounter obstacles tied to its properties. It functions as charged backdrop rather than tool or constraint that alters a choice mid-scene. Strong closure linkage and reprise lift it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Glacial hush" is seeded early, recurs across beats, shapes Arlen's perceptual filter, and anchors the closure realization ("the clock he sought had always been ticking inside this hush"). It alters his understanding on the page—he shifts from seeking a device to recognizing the hush itself as the answer—reweighting the stake with conceptual cost (abandoning the prototype). Three gates met, causal pressure present, closure linkage strong. Phrase recurs five times, risking decorative overuse, but each reprise intensifies meaning rather than merely echoing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Excruciatingly gentle" appears three times as a descriptor (hands, pressure of time, breathing of the world) but does not constrain a choice or create visible tradeoff. It colors tone and motif but remains label-only. Early signal present, but no middle development where gentleness forces a tactical decision or costs Arlen an alternative. Closure participation weak; the phrase accompanies the ending but does not drive it. Swappability moderate; "tender" or "careful" could substitute with minor edits. Two gates marginal, lyric reprise insufficient to reach 6.0 without demonstrated cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Bear" (to endure, to carry) threads through: Arlen bears the prototype, bears accusation, bears emptiness, bears the courage to let go. Setup clear, development present (carrying the sack, cradling the clock), closure strong ("bear the emptiness he once feared"). The verb shapes his arc from physical burden to emotional capacity. Causal pressure moderate; the act of bearing is more metaphorical than a distinct plot turn. Specificity high; removing "bear" would require rewriting the emotional logic. Three gates met, closure linkage strong, irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Soundless sanctuary" (the ruined observatory) frames the piece, pressures Arlen's choice (he returns there to make peace), and absorbs the clock at closure ("sanctuary accepted the offering"). Setup immediate, development strong (the forecourt ritual occurs within it), closure explicit. The sanctuary's silence contrasts with the investors' demand for "louder ticks," sharpening the thematic stakes. Specificity high: cracked dome, altitude cold, isolation all matter. Irreplaceability strong; no generic "quiet place" would carry the same weight. Three gates met, causal and thematic pressure both present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" anchors the opening and the time-of-day frame (dawn light striking brass at the end). Setup clear, closure reprise present. Weakness: the sunrise does not tighten decisions; Arlen's ritual unfolds at a contemplative pace without time pressure. The dawn functions as atmospheric marker rather than a live clock altering tactics. Two gates met (setup, closure cameo), but causal pressure absent and middle development weak. Lyric reprise (newborn light → first ray of sun) reweights tone but not stakes, lifting score slightly above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To make peace with an abandoned dream" is stated early and drives the entire arc. Arlen's motivation is embodied in concrete choices: carrying the prototype, removing the pendulum, leaving it behind. The friction between wanting validation (investors) and seeking stillness (sanctuary) creates internal cost. Setup immediate, development strong (ritual enactment), closure explicit (he "made peace," "inherited stillness"). Weakness: the desire is more resolved than conflicted on the page; we see the aftermath of internal struggle rather than the struggle itself. Three gates met, causal pressure present, cost legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Petrichor nostalgia" is seeded early (second paragraph), recurs three times, and colors the ending ("petrichor nostalgia never left him"). Tone is coherent and elegiac throughout, modulating slightly at closure when "ordinary sounds returned" and Arlen smiles at market bells. The scent functions as emotional anchor and reprise. Weakness: tone does not shift under peak pressure; the same wistful register persists whether Arlen remembers childhood or places the clock. Closure linkage present but not transformative; the final mention summarizes rather than charges a new image. Three gates met, lyric resonance moderate.</comment>
