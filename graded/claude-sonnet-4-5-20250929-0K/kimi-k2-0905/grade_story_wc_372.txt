<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orderly records chief's trait of being "gently meticulous" is embodied through her measurement actions and recording on frozen mercury, showing character-particular interiority. Her motivation to "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" drives concrete choices under pressure—quickening measurements as the lantern fails, pressing the tablet to the tree trunk. Internal contradiction surfaces when she understands she is "translating grief into data," acknowledging futility yet persisting with methodical care. No change occurs; she descends with the same stance, which reads as Earned Stasis but lacks a visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page—her pocket still holds the frequencies, the data transfers to the tree, and no cost prevents her return.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening lines. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural under a lyric lens: vows flicker and dissolve in sequence, building density through spectral layering and measurement beats. The closure image—data warming into sap, "sweet and meaningless"—offers Conceptual Repricing by reweighting preservation into futility, but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than viscerally felt on the page. One tightening occurs when the lantern fuel dwindles and she quickens her work, narrowing time, yet no causal because/therefore linkage forces a trade-off or alters her options—she completes every measurement and retains the tablet, so escalation lacks bite.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library, quartz hush, and copper fittings "warm to the touch" create vivid, POV-filtered sensory grounding. The magic lantern slide's hairline fracture and the tuning fork carved from glacier ice function as micro-setting objects that constrain the measurement process and charge the final shattering beat. The tree trunk at the end provides a physical anchor for the data transfer, altering tactics from preservation-in-archive to biological dispersal. Spatial choreography (spiraling brass railing, projection alcove, descent through cloud layer) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—measuring the last frequencies of human virtues before they vanish—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates as fuel dwindles and vows dissolve in sequence (loyalty snaps, mercy collapses, stewardship already gone, wonder fights longest), creating a tightening time constraint. However, the protagonist's agency does not drive escalation; the lantern's depletion is external coincidence, and her response is to work faster without facing a trade-off or renunciation. The shattering of the slide and her choice to leave it behind offer a micro-turn, but no on-page cost visibly forecloses a path—she completes all measurements and retains the data, so resolution feels observational rather than earned by sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: vows as spectral layers, frozen mercury as preservation medium, and data absorbed into tree sap reweights human aspiration into "sweet and meaningless" nourishment. The final image—leaves drinking "the last measured dreams of their makers"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how meaning persists at oblivion's edge. No overt moralizing; the piece trusts particulars (tuning fork, frost on eyelashes, lead box lined with feathers) to carry weight. A slight thematic echo surfaces in "translating grief into data," which edges toward articulating the premise, but the phrase is embedded in sensory action (scratching symbols on frozen mercury) and does not overwhelm the scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and apt; the narration maintains a heightened, lyric register consistent with the library's "quartz hush" and the protagonist's archival role. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices "hairline fracture," "copper fittings green with age yet still warm," and translates sensory data into symbolic meaning (loyalty as "silver thread," wonder as "golden chord"). Diction remains within an elevated but consistent lexicon; phrases like "drowning in reverse" and "dandruff from a dying god" are metaphorically dense yet voice-coherent. One brief register slip: "converting the death of meaning into numbers that might outlast their significance" reads slightly over-articulated for a moment of action, edging toward thematic summary, but recovers quickly into embodied beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("breath crystallized into tiny alphabets," "jellyfish in the subzero air," "silver thread vibrating in the quartz hush") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating ornamental texture that slows momentum in a piece already light on causal pressure. Mixed metaphors appear: "dandriff from a dying god" jars against the established ice/light/measurement motif. Several paraphrase loops: "she was not preserving knowledge so much as translating grief into data, converting the death of meaning into numbers" restates the same idea across adjacent clauses. Template cadence in the vow-dissolution sequence: "Loyalty snapped first... Mercy's twin tones collapsed... Stewardship had already gone... Wonder fought the longest" creates rhythmic monotony. Information density is high, but propulsion suffers under decorative load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of archival duty, spectral measurement, and biological data-transfer (frozen mercury → tree sap) feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock "last librarian" tropes. The tuning fork carved from glacier ice and the lantern slide's "wound matching a wound" offer fresh, grounded particulars. Risk is present in the lyric, accumulative structure and the quiet ending, which heightens thematic resonance without gimmickry. However, the protagonist's passivity—observing virtue-decay rather than choosing between competing goods—limits ingenuity in the emotional and moral calculus; the transformation test suggests the arc could transplant to other "last keeper" frames without fundamental change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The orderly records chief is present throughout and her trait (gently meticulous) constrains her method of measurement. She makes on-page micro-choices: striking the tuning fork, quickening her work as fuel dwindles, placing the tablet in a lead box, pressing it to the tree trunk. However, none of these choices creates a key turn or foreclosed option—she completes all intended measurements and retains the data. Her role is more observational witness than decision-maker facing trade-offs. Setup is immediate, middle beats involve her actions, and closure shows her descent with the data, so all three gates are present but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is handled in multiple beats: slipped into the carriage, aligned with the lamp's filament, projects spectral layers, and shatters at the climax when wonder's chord cracks it. The hairline fracture is signaled early ("cracked like winter itself") and returns with reweighted meaning when it becomes the breaking point. The shattering alters the scene—she leaves the lantern behind—though it does not foreclose her larger goal (she has already recorded the data). Strong setup, clear middle involvement, and charged closure participation, but the consequence of its loss is muted since her mission succeeds.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Luminous vows shape the story's stakes—they are the subject of measurement, project as spectral layers, and dissolve in sequence (loyalty, mercy, stewardship, wonder). The concept is dramatized through tuning-fork resonance and visual color (silver, gold, ultraviolet), not merely thematic. However, the vows do not constrain the protagonist's options; she measures them as they decay passively, without needing to choose which to save or sacrifice. Setup is strong, middle beats elaborate their dissolution, and the ending reconfigures them into sap, but they function more as setting/atmosphere than as a force that narrows her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is shown on the page: she aligns the slide with precision, strikes the tuning fork methodically, scratches symbols carefully, and places the mercury tablet in a lead box lined with feathers. The trait enables her survival ("had kept her alive when the great forgetting began") and constrains her response under time pressure—she quickens her measurements in "shorter intervals" rather than abandoning rigor. However, no visible trade-off occurs where meticulousness costs her something else (speed, safety, emotional release). Setup is explicit in the opening, middle beats embody it through action, and the ending maintains it (pressing the tablet "against its trunk"), but on-page cost tied specifically to this trait is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Measurement drives the story's structure: she measures loyalty, mercy, stewardship, and wonder by sampling frequencies with the tuning fork, recording results on frozen mercury. The action is repeated across multiple beats and escalates as she quickens intervals when the lantern dims. The shattering of the slide interrupts further measurement, and her final act (pressing the tablet to the tree) is a form of data transfer. However, the action does not create major turns—it unfolds as a linear process of documentation rather than a choice that redefines her options. Setup is clear, middle beats repeat the method with rising pressure, and closure involves preserving the measured data, so all gates are met, but the action is more procedural than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sampling frequencies is the mechanical method: she uses a tuning fork carved from glacier ice, strikes it against her boot heel, and listens for which colors resonate. The method is signaled in the opening ("measure what remained of truth by sampling frequencies of light") and demonstrated across multiple beats (loyalty holds, mercy splits, stewardship decays, wonder warms the alcove). The specificity of the tool and technique matters—the tuning fork must be ice to work in the frozen library, and each vow produces a distinct tone. However, the method does not shape her attempts or force adaptation; she applies it uniformly without needing to alter tactics. Setup is clear, middle beats employ it repeatedly, and closure references the "exact frequencies" she carries, so all gates are met, but the method is more procedural backdrop than plot-shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds supplies essential resources and constraints: the projection alcove with copper fittings, the sub-zero air that makes breath crystallize and preserves the frozen mercury tablet, and the spatial progression from upper stacks to descent through cloud layer to the first living tree. The setting's extreme cold dictates the materials (glacier-ice tuning fork, frozen mercury) and the urgency (data legible "only as long as the temperature never rises"). The quartz hush creates atmosphere and the tree trunk at the end provides the medium for data transfer. Setup is vivid and immediate, middle beats use the environment's properties (cold, silence, altitude), and the ending's tree marks a shift from archive to biology. The setting constrains her tools and shapes her final choice, though it does not force a trade-off between competing tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"While illusions of the lower world faded to memory" frames the opening, and "each step erasing another color from the sky she would never see again" suggests an ongoing temporal process. The lantern's dwindling fuel creates a ticking clock that forces her to quicken measurements. However, the timeframe is vague—no clear sense of how long the climb took, how much fuel remains at the start, or how long the descent will take. The "by morning" reference in the ending is the only concrete anchor, but it does not tighten earlier decisions. Setup hints at an irreversible passage, middle escalation involves fuel depletion, and the ending shows her descent, so all gates are loosely present, but the time pressure is more atmospheric than mechanically tracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated in the opening and dramatized through her climb, measurement process, and final data transfer to the tree. Internal friction surfaces when she acknowledges she is "translating grief into data, converting the death of meaning into numbers that might outlast their significance," recognizing the futility yet persisting. However, the motivation does not face a choice-point where she must weigh it against a competing desire or cost—she completes her task without renunciation. Setup is explicit, middle beats enact the motivation through repeated measurement, and the ending fulfills it (data preserved in sap), but the lack of on-page conflict between want and cost limits its integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" is introduced early as "a silence so complete it felt like drowning in reverse" and recurs at key beats: the silver thread of loyalty vibrates "in the quartz hush," and the final paragraph invokes it as the force that will "swallow even her footsteps by morning." The tone—cold, silent, crystalline—remains coherent through all turns and modulates with pressure: warming when wonder resonates, stilling after the lantern shatters. The hush functions as both atmosphere and thematic undertone, suggesting erasure and the fragility of meaning. Setup anchors it vividly, middle beats reinforce it through sensory detail (breath crystallizing, silence pressing on eardrums), and the ending explicitly names it as the closing image's dominant note, reweighting the entire piece with the inevitability of oblivion.</comment>
