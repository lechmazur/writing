<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The traveler's profession and backstory are vividly established, but her interiority remains abstract—"understanding the geography of healing" never crystallizes into specific, contradictory impulses acting in scene. The kneeling ritual and final realization feel more like thematic declaration than embodied choice under pressure. Emotional states are labeled ("lonesome splendor," "intimate work") rather than shown through contradictory action. The final transformation into "someone who no longer needed to explain absences" reads as convenient epiphany rather than a decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a lyric/accumulative lens but struggles with causality: the weft thread's transformation from object to "extracted presence" is asserted rather than dramatized, and the clients' post-obituary fates (vanishing, appearing in the garden) lack on-page mechanism. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the planted thread and empty notebook, but the "geography of healing" remains abstract—what options have changed? The cost (seven years of work ending) is told but not felt in a specific forfeiture or trade-off at the moment of planting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is anchored early with selective detail (bare branches, dried fountain, fallen leaves in patterns), and the autumn motif recurs at closure to charge the final image. The physical act of kneeling and winding thread grounds the ritual in space. However, the garden does not meaningfully constrain a choice—she could perform this work anywhere—and the "portals" through which she sees clients are visual metaphor rather than setting-as-pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The winding of the thread offers one beat of physical action, but no reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off: she completes the work without obstacle, and the clients' transformations happen passively in her vision. The cost (her own past self as "last client") is conceptually interesting but lacks on-page consequence that alters her present tactics or future path beyond the assertion that her notebook is now empty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of "explained absences" and choosing one's ending emerges through particulars (Mrs. Chen, Mr. Patel, little Elsie) rather than sermon, and the piece resists tidy moral. The final paragraph's "lonesome splendor of lives fully lived" edges toward thematic summary but is anchored in the image of falling leaves spelling new names. However, the traveler's epiphany—that she wrote her own obituary in reverse—is articulated rather than resonating through image, and "explaining absence before it could be questioned" becomes thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction ("lonesome splendor," "intimate work of projecting presence") aims for a heightened register. However, the prose relies heavily on abstract concepts ("extracted presence," "geography of healing") that float above concrete perception, and the narrator's perceptual signature is not character-particular—the traveler's way of noticing does not feel distinct from the authorial voice. Phrases like "whatever force collected explained absences" and "purposeful effect" read as explaining rather than inhabiting the world through her eyes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose favors elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "intimate work," "shadowed garden") and layered metaphor, but density becomes overwriting: nearly every sentence in the ritual sequence (paragraphs 7–12) stacks figurative language without breathing room or physical grounding. Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" stems and adjacent sentences that restate concepts (paragraphs 11–13 loop "understanding," "explaining absence," "presence/absence"). The final two paragraphs contain paraphrase loops: "her work here was complete because she'd finally written the only obituary that mattered" followed immediately by restating the same insight with "someone who no longer needed to explain absences because she'd learned to inhabit them fully."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—writing obituaries for the living—offers a fresh angle, and the weft thread as "extracted presence" is a non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc (self-discovery through helping others) and the garden as liminal space follow familiar templates. The resolution's specificity (planting the thread, empty notebook) partially transforms the material, but "geography of healing" and "explained absences" remain abstract enough to feel like thematic placeholders rather than lived particulars that only this traveler in this garden could discover.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The traveler is present throughout and her profession shapes the backstory, but her on-page choices are limited: she kneels, winds thread, writes names in dirt. These actions are ritualistic rather than decision points that alter tactics under pressure. The major "choice"—recognizing herself as her own first client—is realization rather than agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The weft thread appears in setup (carried across continents), is handled physically in the middle ritual (winding around fingers, writing with its end), and is planted at closure. However, its transformation from thread to "extracted presence" is asserted rather than earned through on-page mechanics, and its properties do not constrain her actions—it shortens conveniently as she works. The ending depends on it, but swapping it for another symbolic object (a vial, a map) would require only surface edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Explained absences" frames her profession (writing obituaries before death) and recurs thematically in the penultimate paragraph ("explaining her own absence from ordinary life"). It shapes her backstory and motivates the journey, but on the page it functions as theme rather than a force that narrows her options or creates tactical friction. The clients' absences (vanishing after obituaries) are told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is attributed to her obituary-writing in paragraph 3 and recurs as a label in the final paragraph ("vivid descriptive language of lives fully lived"). However, the attribute itself does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost—she does not write anything on the page, and her descriptive skill is claimed rather than demonstrated through prose that shows her particular style.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intimate" appears as a label for her work ("the intimate work of projecting presence") in paragraph 7 and again in the recognition scene (paragraph 12). The word colors the tone but does not drive a turn; the winding ritual would function similarly if described as careful, deliberate, or sacred. The concept of intimacy with absence is thematic rather than plot-structural.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is named once in paragraph 7 as she begins winding the thread, and the mechanics are gestured at (faces emerge, thread shortens) but not specified in a way that creates friction or cost. The method is announced rather than developed through trial, and it succeeds without complication. Swapping "projecting presence" for "releasing souls" or "unweaving fates" would require minimal revision.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is anchored in the opening line, returns with purpose (dried fountain, fallen leaves in patterns), and the autumn motif charges the final image (leaves falling in new patterns, garden's autumn work of letting go). The garden provides atmosphere and a physical location for the ritual. However, it does not constrain her choices—she could perform this work elsewhere—and the "portals" are metaphorical rather than setting-as-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"After the last ship sailed" appears in the opening line and recurs in the final departure ("a new ship waited"). The timeframe creates mood and a sense of liminality but does not function as a ticking clock that alters her tactics. The ritual unfolds across one night without time pressure, and the ship's return is convenient rather than earned by her completing the work before a deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Understanding the geography of healing" is stated in paragraph 2, drives her journey to the garden, and is reprised in the resolution (paragraph 14: "the geography of healing she'd sought"). The desire motivates her presence but remains abstract—what healing looks like, why this place offers it, and what cost she pays to achieve it are asserted rather than tested in conflicting choices. The "geography" itself is told to be "a process of carrying absence" without showing her struggle to learn that.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears in paragraph 11 and again in the final paragraph as "lonesomely, splendidly lived." The diction aims for a coherent tone of melancholy grandeur, and autumn imagery (bare branches, fallen leaves, shadows deepening and lifting) supports the mood. However, the tone remains static—no modulation under pressure—and the phrase is repeated as a label rather than emerging from scene texture.</comment>
