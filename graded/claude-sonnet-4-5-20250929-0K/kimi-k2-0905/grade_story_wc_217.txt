<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet's interior is present through embodied attention ("warmly attentive"), but his choices lack meaningful conflict or cost. The woman arrives as a second character, but her role amounts to accompaniment rather than pressure. The final gesture—placing the feather, walking the spiral outward—reads as enacted symbolism rather than a decision that forecloses a path. The piece offers meditative observation but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (poet), where (lagoon), and when (morning after storm) within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers fragments and images toward a resonant final statement. However, the closure—"Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use"—functions as a thematic declaration rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The woman's arrival and departure, the spiral's dissolution, and the feather's transfer are gestures that accumulate but do not crystallize a before/after with visible stakes or forfeited options. No meaningful tightening narrows the poet's choices; the horizon "felt wounded" at the start and remains a meditative object at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon, wet sand, tideline debris, and dunes provide vivid sensory grounding filtered through the poet's attention. The drake feather and the spiral drawn in sand constrain on-page actions: he kneels, presses the feather, speaks the line. The final image—tide erasing the sand-writing—charges the ending with a concrete cost (impermanence made literal). Micro-setting qualifies here: the feather, tin, sand, and tide all participate in choices and the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and sustained. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options under pressure. The woman's arrival and the shared performance with the zither are additions rather than complications; the poet's internal stance does not shift in response to opposition or cost. The spiral's dissolution by tide is a natural consequence, not a choice that forecloses a path. Escalation reads as accretion of images rather than mounting pressure that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of incompleteness as doorway emerges organically from the torn feather, crescent shell, broken zither string, and frayed kite tail. The final sand-written line—"Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use"—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the poet articulates the thesis in prompt-like language in the final third, reducing resonance. Subtext operates in the woman's chipped tooth and the zither's buzz, but the piece borders on sermonizing when it declares its own meaning rather than trusting the images to carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close on the poet; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation and reflective remove. Diction is consistent and literary without register mismatch: "burnished hush," "vane was torn," "lunar" smile. The woman's single laugh and lack of greeting distinguish her minimally; no dialogue tests subtext or goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is present in the poet's "warmly attentive" filter, and the prose rhythms support the meditative tone. Minor slip: "its seam pulled loose by the storm" risks mixed metaphor (horizon as fabric), but clarity holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. However, overwriting accumulates: "the burnished hush of morning deepened, as though the sky itself had exhaled and chosen not to inhale again" stacks metaphor without clear vehicle, and "a chord so tense it trembled" is stock phrasing. Paraphrase loop: "tended the horizon with words" in paragraph six echoes "tended the fracture" in paragraph seventeen without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences begin "The poet..." or "He..." across the middle third. These artifacts dull momentum and trigger −0.6 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—a poet and musician collaboratively performing incompleteness—offers a modest inflection on the artist-as-contemplative trope. The drake feather, spiral, and tide-erasure sequence feels purposeful but not irreplaceable; similar objects (gull feather, driftwood mark) could serve with minor edits. The woman's arrival and the shared ritual add texture but do not transform the core arc in hindsight. Emotional specificity is present in the chipped tooth and the twisted sleeve-strip repair, lifting the piece above generic abstraction, but the final thesis statement reduces surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The quiet shoreline poet is present throughout and frames all action. He makes micro-choices—lifting the feather, drawing the spiral, speaking the line, placing the feather in the woman's palm—but none alters tactics or narrows options under pressure. His role is observer and enactor of symbolic gestures rather than decision-maker facing a live dilemma. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development is descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drake's tail feather appears in paragraph two, is tucked in the tin (paragraph five), pressed into sand to anchor the spiral (paragraph ten), and placed in the woman's palm near the end (paragraph twenty-three). It returns in the final image obliquely ("the hollow of the feather" in paragraph twenty-four) and is last seen tucked behind the woman's ear. The feather shapes three beats and charges the closure by traveling from found object to gift to question. Its torn vane matters on the page: "caught light only at the fractured edges."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" appears twice as a phrase (paragraphs seventeen and twenty-eight) but remains metaphorical rather than operational. The concept does not constrain on-page choices or shape tactics; it functions as thematic echo. The chord-weaving between poet and musician enacts a version of the concept, but the story would hold if "woven dawns" were replaced with "layered moments" or "braided light."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" is stated twice (paragraphs seven and fifteen) as a trait label. It colors the poet's perceptual filter—his gathering of fragments, his listening to the zither—but does not enable or constrain a choice with visible cost. The attribute fits tone but remains ornamental; removing it would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tend" appears in paragraph six ("tend the horizon with words") and paragraph seventeen ("tended the fracture between sound and sense"). The action organizes the poet's vocation and his collaboration with the woman. It shapes two beats and aligns with the closure gesture of letting the tide erase the spiral. However, the verb is easily swappable with "mend," "gather," or "honor" without structural loss, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" is stated explicitly in paragraph nine: "to discover beauty in the incomplete by harmonizing discord into a loom of almost." The method is then enacted when the poet and woman perform together—his line riding the gull's cry, her discordant zither, his twisting a strip through the split string. The mechanics matter on the page in paragraph eighteen, and the final chord "remained, humming in the shells" (paragraph twenty-four). Setup and middle development are present; closure participation is indirect but legible.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain is named in the opening line and supplies the wet sand for the spiral, the tideline debris, and the tide that erases the poet's inscription. It constrains the action spatially and provides the resources (sand, water, shells) that the poet uses. The rain's aftermath charges the visual palette. The setting shapes two beats (drawing the spiral, tide erasure) and participates in closure when "the water took the sand."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As a kite string snapped" appears in paragraph four as a sensory marker and the kite returns in paragraphs nineteen and twenty-five, gliding and touching the surface. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than causal; it does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. The kite's reappearance adds resonance but does not alter the poet's choices or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover beauty in the incomplete" is articulated in paragraph nine and dramatized through the poet's gathering of broken things, his spiral gesture, and his final sand-writing. The desire shapes his actions across multiple beats and aligns with the closure statement. However, the motivation is declared more than conflicted; no competing want or cost tests his commitment on the page. Friction is conceptual rather than felt in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" is named in paragraphs four and twenty-seven, and the tone—quiet, meditative, elegiac—holds coherent across the piece. Diction ("cobalt," "vane," "lunar," "gyre") and sentence rhythm support the stillness. The tone modulates subtly when the woman laughs (paragraph twenty) and when the kite's torn tail braids into sunrise (paragraph twenty-five), but the shifts serve the dominant mood rather than breaking it. The final image of erasure charges the hush with impermanence, elevating the tone's function at closure.</comment>
