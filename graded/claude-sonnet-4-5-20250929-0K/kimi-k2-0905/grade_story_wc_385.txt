<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's dominant motive (learning why some echo) is established early and drives the descent, but her internal contradiction remains thin—perceptiveness as curse is asserted more than embodied in simultaneous impulses. The mother-recognition beat delivers emotional weight, yet the final choice (singing farewell) feels more thematic obligation than a decision wrestling contradictory wants. Embodiment is sporadic: "iron in a stranger's blood memory" offers specificity, but much interiority drifts into elevated summary ("understanding struck like cold water") without the messy irrationality pressure would create. The weaver encounter and shell-fusion closure provide a credible arc, but the lack of on-page mistakes or blind spots that complicate her path keeps the grade mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—motifs (echo, shell, song, moths) layer toward a final reweighting. The nexus descent functions as a single continuous pressure window with clear spatial progression. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lira completes her mother's unfinished departure, dissolving the cocoon and hearing no rebound—a legible before/after with conceptual cost (she must leave echo behind to avoid looping). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. However, cost at closure feels more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page; the "finished sentence carried by wind" image is resonant but lacks the sharp sting of visible sacrifice or forfeited option that would lift this into higher bands. One meaningful deepening (discovering her mother's voice, realizing unfinished departures loop) narrows understanding, satisfying the lens, but escalation remains gentle rather than tightening with urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The canyon, nexus, and moths supply vivid spatial grounding: "corkscrew cavern," "transparent moths wove strands of sound into luminous threads," "switchback trail" all anchor movement. The seashell constrains the quest (coordinates, used to complete the cocoon cadence) and charges the final image (fused whole, warm as heartbeat). Sensory detail is selective and layered—scent of wet copper, glyphs, breathing gallery—though POV filtering is light; Lira's professional lens as "echo singer" shapes what she notices, yet the narration sometimes drifts into neutral catalog. The nexus functions as micro-setting that alters tactics (she must descend, follow the shell's hush), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is clean. A few descriptions ("raw slit in the plateau") feel ornamental rather than pressure-driven, and the "universe hums its secret song" frame recurs without evolving to constrain a choice, keeping the score just above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning why some echo to ensure her life won't loop) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: recognizing her mother's voice in the cocoon and realizing "unfinished departures loop, while complete goodbyes travel on" reweights her understanding and narrows options to one—sing the missing cadence. Agency is present: Lira chooses to press the shell and sing farewell, forecloses the path of endless echo. Cost is conceptual (she must leave echo behind, accept endings) and legible in the final image ("ensuring her life would travel rather than reverberate"), but the felt price on the page is muted—no visible sacrifice of a resource, relationship, or tactical option that would sharpen escalation. The weaver's cooperation and the cocoon's dissolution occur smoothly without resistance or complication, softening pressure. No antagonist or reversal; accumulative lens permits this, but the single tightening lacks the visceral trade-off or visible loss that would enter higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of unfinished departures, the necessity of closure) emerges organically from the mother's trapped voice and Lira's quest, avoiding overt thesis. The final image—whole seashell at her neck, "finished sentence carried by wind," offering "progressive disclosure of goodbye" to others—resonates without moralizing and reweights prior material (the shell's spiral, the canyon's looped histories). Subtext operates in the moth-silk weaver's identity reveal and the quiet dissolution of the cocoon. The ending refuses tidy satisfaction: Lira's future is open, her method portable, complexity intact. However, "endings are portable" and "she would offer the method she knew" drift toward abstract articulation in the final third, a minor thematic echo that slightly dulls the resonance. The piece invites reflection through the echo/travel binary and succeeds in charging the closure image with earned weight, lifting it into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"taste the iron in a stranger's blood memory," "reed-blown melancholy"—and diction carries a lyric, slightly elevated register consistent with the "echo singer" role. Purposeful compression and sentence fragments ("Tonight's echo differed") serve voice. However, the vocabulary occasionally drifts into stock poetic phrases ("webs of intrigue that tightened around her lungs," "understanding struck like cold water") that flatten specificity under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled, though some lines ("She needed to learn why") tell motive rather than showing it in choice. No dialogue appears; the weaver's single line ("My daughter learned to listen, but you learned to finish") is functional but brief. The prose modulates with emotional beats (descent narrows syntax, closure opens it), yet the narrator's internal texture sometimes smooths into neutral lyricism rather than remaining character-particular. Rhythmic control is solid, and no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage occur, keeping this in the mid-to-upper 6 band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in the descent sequence ("scent of wet copper, then flicker of glyphs, finally breathing gallery"). However, paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "The canyon echo singer pressed…" / "The canyon echo singer steadied…" / "canyon echo singer no longer trapped" recycles the full title as a sentence stem without variation, triggering −0.4. "Echoed because I never finished leaving" / "I echoed because…" and "she would echo by choice, not by accident" / "people echo… while others vanish" loop the "echo" motif mechanically in adjacent lines without added pressure, a further −0.2 for synonym churn. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; "webs of intrigue that tightened around her lungs" borders on mixed metaphor (webs tighten?), −0.2. Stock phrases ("understanding struck like cold water," "threads drifting like thistledown") appear in peak beats, reducing specificity. No major causality breaks or opacity, but cumulative artifact debt (−0.8 total) and the pattern touching mid-story keep this mid-6.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—sound as residue woven by moths, unfinished departures as loops—offers a fresh cosmology. "Transparent moths wove strands of sound into luminous threads, feeding on the residue of human yearning" is specific and non-obvious. The echo-singer premise and the seashell-as-coordinate device feel purposeful. However, the core emotional arc (protagonist descends to find lost parent, completes their unfinished business, gains wisdom) follows a widely used template; the "finishing what the parent could not" beat is familiar in quest fantasy. Transformation is present in the moth-weaver mechanics and the "progressive disclosure of goodbye" method, but the closure hinges on a conventional reconciliation-and-release structure. The weaver's identity reveal (grandmother) and the shell-fusion moment add specificity, yet the final paragraphs ("she would travel… singing stories that knew when to close") drift into mission-statement abstraction. Risk is moderate—lyric mode and the non-linear cosmology elevate—but the emotional throughline remains within genre comfort. Mid-5 reflects functional originality with derivative emotional scaffolding not fully overcome by world detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira (canyon echo singer) is introduced in the opening line and drives the descent, recognition, and farewell-song choices. She appears in setup, middle (descent and cocoon discovery), and closure (singing the cadence, receiving the whole shell). Her choices create two key turns: deciding to descend following the shell's coordinates, and pressing the shell to sing farewell, which dissolves the cocoon and completes her mother's departure. However, many beats are observational or responsive (hearing the canyon's question, recognizing her mother's voice) rather than driven by protagonist agency under competing pressures. The weaver's cooperation and the cocoon's dissolution occur without resistance, softening causal involvement. Cost is conceptual (leaving echo behind) but not a visible trade-off between wants. Setup +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure (narrows to one choice) +0.8, closure linkage (final image of her traveling with the whole shell) +1.0, specificity +0.4 = base ~6.7; observational dominance in key beats −0.3 final; late-middle escalation (weaver encounter past midpoint) −0.1. Rounded: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half is introduced early (first paragraph), guides the descent via coordinates from childhood dreams (beat 1), is pressed against the cocoon to complete the farewell song (beat 2), and returns fused whole in the closure image ("warm as a heartbeat," carried as reminder). Setup +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure (enables the quest and the farewell action) +1.0, closure linkage (final image) +1.2, specificity (cracked spiral, dream-origin, fusion) +0.6 = base ~7.9. However, the shell's mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized—how it whispers coordinates or completes the cadence is told, not shown in action pressure; swappability is moderate (any guiding artifact with a completion function could substitute with edits) −0.5. The dream-origin and fusion add irreplaceability, preventing deeper cuts. Rounded: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" appears once in paragraph 4 ("overlapping voices braided into webs of intrigue that tightened around her lungs") as metaphor for the canyon's layered histories. It does not return, does not shape a tactical choice, and does not constrain options. The concept is ornamental—present as atmospheric description but replaceable with "tangled memories" or "layered grief" without structural impact. No setup in first third as a rule or stake, no middle development, no closure participation. Ornamental use −0.8, absent from closure −1.0, swappability −0.6 = base ~1.6; the single vivid line prevents a lower floor +0.5. Rounded: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is stated in paragraph 2 ("She was richly perceptive, able to taste the iron in a stranger's blood memory") and recurs as a label in the final lines ("richly perceptive to the moment a note should end"). The trait is illustrated once (tasting iron in blood memory, hearing older footsteps) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost—she does not choose between listening and acting, nor does perceptiveness force a trade-off. Setup (early mention) +0.4, one illustrative beat +0.4, closure mention (final paragraph) +0.3 = base ~3.1; label-only in closure (no dramatized cost) −0.3, swappability (any sensory gift could substitute) −0.5, mid-story absence (no middle beat where it alters tactics) −0.4 final. Rounded: 3.8, capped by swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears in paragraph 10 ("to ensure her own life would not become a hollow vibration") as motivation, recurs in the ending sequence ("to ensure her own future would not knot itself into these walls"), and structures the closure decision (singing farewell to finish the departure and avoid looping). Setup (first third) +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure (the need to ensure non-echo drives the descent and farewell choice) +1.1, closure linkage (final image of traveling rather than reverberating) +1.0, specificity (tied to echo/loop cosmology) +0.5 = base ~7.1. However, "ensure" as verb is generic—other verbs (prevent, secure, guarantee) could substitute with minimal edits −0.6; the action is the farewell-song, "ensure" is the motive label rather than the enacted beat, making it partly swappable. Rounded: 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" is named once in paragraph 14 ("Progressive disclosure guided her method: first the scent of wet copper, then the flicker of glyphs, finally the breathing gallery") and recurs as a method she will offer others in the final paragraph. The technique is illustrated in the descent sequence (layered revelations: scent, glyphs, gallery) but does not shape a contested choice or alter tactics under pressure—it describes the narrative's own structure rather than a tool Lira wields to solve a problem. Setup (mid-story mention) −0.3, one illustrative beat +0.4, closure reprise (offered to others) +0.5, causal pressure (does not narrow options or enable a turn; the descent would proceed regardless) +0.2 = base ~4.3. The method is more thematic echo than actionable mechanic; swappability is high (any revelatory structure could replace it) −0.4. Late first appearance (past 40%) caps at 4.6; actual integration slightly below. Rounded: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "serpentine nexus under starlight" is introduced in the opening line, becomes the quest destination in paragraph 12 (coordinates revealed by starlight), and is the physical site of the closure action (descent, gallery, cocoon, farewell). Setup (first line) +0.8, three-beat involvement (quest target, descent, closure gallery) +1.4, causal pressure (she must enter the nexus to find her mother's voice and complete the farewell) +1.2, closure linkage (the nexus is where the dissolution and shell-fusion occur) +1.4, specificity (corkscrew cavern, breathing gallery, moth-weavers) +0.7 = base ~8.5. However, the nexus supplies access rather than constraint—no environmental obstacle or resource scarcity alters her tactics within it; the descent is linear and cooperative. The "starlight" component is used once (to reveal coordinates) and does not recur, reducing irreplaceability slightly −0.6. The setting's vivid detail and closure centrality keep it high; the lack of tactical friction prevents 8+. Rounded: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" appears in the opening line and closing paragraph as a framing refrain. It does not function as a timeframe—no clock, deadline, or duration constraint shapes Lira's choices. The phrase is atmospheric and thematic (cosmic continuity versus individual closure) but does not tighten decisions or tactics. Setup (first line) +0.5, closure reprise (final third) +0.5, no middle development (does not affect pacing or urgency) 0.0, ornamental use (description without pressure) −0.8, swappability (any cosmic constant could replace it) −0.6, absent causal role −0.8 = base ~1.8. The lyric reprise prevents a lower floor but cannot lift it past ornamental. Rounded: 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lira's motivation "to learn why some people echo" is stated in paragraph 10, dramatized in the cocoon-recognition beat (paragraph 17: her mother echoed because she never finished leaving), and resolved at closure (she completes the farewell to avoid looping, then offers the method to others). Setup (first third, slightly delayed) +0.5, three-beat involvement (stated motive, cocoon discovery, closure application) +1.4, causal pressure (the need to learn drives the quest and the farewell choice) +1.3, closure linkage (final image of traveling rather than reverberating directly answers the motive) +1.5, cost connection (she must leave echo behind, visible in "no rebound") +0.5 = base ~8.2. However, internal friction between wanting to echo and fearing it is told rather than shown in contradictory on-page impulses; the motive is pursued linearly without competing desires slowing her −0.6. Rounded: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is introduced in paragraph 5 as the song Lira chooses, recurs when she announces herself to the weaver (paragraph 18), and modulates in the closure ("reed-blown but forward-leaning"). Tone is sustained through descent and encounter, dips into elegiac register at the cocoon beat, and shifts cadence at the end. Setup +0.6, three-beat involvement (initial song, weaver announcement, closure modulation) +1.4, tone modulation with pressure +0.8, closure linkage (the shift to "forward-leaning" charges the final image) +1.0 = base ~7.8. However, "melancholy" is a label applied from outside rather than embodied in syntax and image throughout—some beats drift into neutral lyricism or elevated summary rather than maintaining the reedy, slow-bend texture −0.8. The modulation at closure is noted rather than felt in rhythm −0.4. Rounded: 6.3.</comment>
