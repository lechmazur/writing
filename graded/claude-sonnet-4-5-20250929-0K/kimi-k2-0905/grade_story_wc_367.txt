<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lirael's motivation ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows…was not a private desire but a geas soldered to her laughter centuries before") arrives as declaration rather than dramatized contradiction under pressure. The piece leans heavily on abstract labeling—"shadowed elation," "accidentally prophetic"—without embodying these states through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Her actions (climbing, laughing, pressing the wick) follow a ritual logic but never face a genuine fork where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The ending lands her "barefoot on dew," but the cost of her transformation reads conceptual rather than felt; no prior relationship or capability is visibly forfeited on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: "Lirael, the laughing storm herald" and "emerald lighthouse" anchor character and place within the opening lines; waive penalty. Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density of image (emerald light, black flame, reversed text, dark sail) and cadence shift rather than because/therefore linkage. Closure form: the lighthouse "dissolved, leaving Lirael barefoot on dew" and "she heard distant presses starting up…of light, printing dawn directly onto the retina of the planet" reads as Conceptual Repricing—the premise (print is dead, beacon dark) is reweighted into a new mode of dawn-making. Cost is conceptual but legible: the lighthouse and old routine vanish, replaced by "portable lighthouse" internalized. However, the middle sequence (sail, navigation, auroras) loops through metaphor without a clear tightening that narrows Lirael's options; the lens holds but escalation within it remains diffuse until the final dissolve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern wick, and lens function as micro-setting that constrains choice: Lirael must "press the wick against the lens" to thin the membrane, and the wick's consumption charts the course. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the metaphorical frame (salt air, porcelain echo, granite groaning). Spatial choreography tracks across the spiral climb, lantern room, and the prow position. The post-newsprint ocean and canvas beyond the rim anchor the altered world without catalog tourism. The ending grounds her on "dew that had never known ink," a tactile particular that charges the closure image and satisfies the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: shape a new dawn using ancient shadows, signaled in the motivation line. One meaningful tightening occurs when "her third laugh split into seven echoes that arranged themselves as directions," forcing navigation choices. However, the sequence from black flame ignition through sail deployment to lighthouse dissolution reads as accumulative metaphor rather than a decision point where live options are forfeited with visible cost. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency remains atmospheric—Lirael's laughter triggers transformations without a dramatized trade-off or price that alters her later tactics. The cost (lighthouse and routine vanish) is legible at closure but not tested by a mid-story reversal that narrows her path under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of print's death, shadow as ink, and dawn as unprinted light rather than thesis statement. The recurring wick and laughter motifs reweight at the ending: "her shadow the first letter of the first story that would never need to be recycled." The final image offers a resonant answer—stories born from shadow rather than paper—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "geas soldered to her laughter centuries before" and the implicit contrast between obsolete type and living headlines. However, the piece skirts close to Thematic Echo when it declares "Ancient shadows are the ink of unborn mornings" as reversed text; the line feels prompt-adjacent, though it is framed as discovered rather than asserted by the narrator.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is poetic and metaphor-dense ("porcelain echo that sliced the salt air and bled silver notes"), consistent but teetering on uniform elevation throughout rather than modulating with urgency. Diction ("geas," "total internal reflection," "membrane between epochs") mixes archaic, technical, and abstract registers; the blend reads voice-motivated for a mythic storm herald but risks register drift during peak pressure (the sail and navigation sequence). No dialogue present. The prose maintains rhythmic control, but the constant figurative density flattens rather than varies psychic distance, preventing the syntactic shifts that would reflect Lirael's escalating stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across long, layered sentences and brief declaratives ("She laughed once more, softer…"). Information density is high: most lines layer image, action, and thematic charge. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in the middle third (membrane, jellyfish, sail, keel scraping constellations, auroras spelling tomorrow) without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering the Overwriting density check (−0.5). Mixed metaphor near-miss: "dark sail that ballooned…towing the lighthouse off its foundation; granite blocks groaned, then glided like ships" yokes balloon, tow, and ship in close quarters without clarifying the vehicle's physics. Template-cadence runs appear in the navigation beat: "Port past regret, starboard through unprinted apology, straight into the blank page" reads list-like. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, and the final image is clean. Apply −0.6 total for density and coherence frictions; artifacts do not obscure closure but dull mid-story propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-ship, print extinction, and shadow-as-ink is specific and non-obvious. "Total internal reflection" as both optical phenomenon and thematic method shows ingenuity. The frame (post-newsprint world, dawn printed on retinas) avoids generic everywhere settings. However, the storm herald fulfilling an ancient ritual echoes familiar chosen-one and lighthouse-keeper templates; the piece does not transform these enough through lived friction or a moral calculus that resists the expected arc. The ending's "portable lighthouse" and "stories born laughing" feel earned in hindsight, and the risk of sustained metaphorical density without conventional scene pressure elevates slightly within the band (+0.2). Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lirael climbs, laughs three times (each triggering escalation: echo-prophecy, sail deployment, directional split), presses the wick, and walks inland sowing prophecies. Setup: named and active in opening. Development: her laughter and wick-press drive the sail and navigation beats. Payoff: the closure places her "barefoot on dew" with "portable lighthouse" internalized. Two beats (laugh-prophecy, wick-press) show decision; the third laugh arranges directions. Swappability: "storm herald" could be replaced with another mythic guide role with minor edits. Cost: visible (lighthouse dissolves, routine ends). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.5, cost +0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, round down to 5.9 for modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick is cradled in the opening, ignites without oil (black flame), is pressed against the lens to thin the membrane, consumes itself to translate shadow into light, and vanishes at closure when the lighthouse touches the canvas. Setup: first paragraph. Development: ignition, lens-press, navigation charting. Payoff: "When the wick finally vanished, the lighthouse touched that canvas and dissolved." Four distinct beats with evolving use. Early signal +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables membrane-thinning, charts course) +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity (glass, consumable, black flame) +0.6, cost (vanishes) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.7 = 8.7, modest swappability friction −0.2 (could be another consumable talisman), lands 8.5, round conservatively to 7.8 given that its final vanishing is simultaneous with the lighthouse rather than driving a separate cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "otherworldly routine older than headlines: ascend at moonset, laugh once, trim the absent flame, descend before the tide remembered her name" is established in paragraph three and recurs in the final paragraph ("repeating the otherworldly routine that kept time from folding"). Setup: present. Development: the routine's break (laughing three times, not descending) drives the transformation but is not explicitly framed as transgression with cost on the page. Payoff: the final paragraph restates the routine as continuing for "whoever next climbed the absent stairs." The concept shapes atmosphere but does not tightly constrain a mid-story choice; the transgression is implicit rather than dramatized as a fork. Early signal +0.5, one beat (implicit break) +0.4, lyric reprise +0.6, ornamental late restatement −0.6, swappability −0.4 (could be another ritual). Base 3.0 + 0.5 = 3.5, round to 4.2 for lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" appears when "the sound rebounded, multiplying…until it shaped words no throat had uttered" and again when "Accidentally prophetic again, her third laugh split into seven echoes that arranged themselves as directions." Setup: signaled early (first laugh). Development: second laugh arranges directions, enabling navigation. Payoff: the ending notes she will walk "sowing accidental prophecies like seeds." Two beats of prophecy-generation with causal consequence (directions chart the course). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, label-only in final paragraph −0.3, swappability (another oracular trait) −0.5, cost (implicit: prophecies constrain) +0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, round to 6.3 for dual-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Steer" is introduced when Lirael has "come only to steer the night," recurs when she must "laugh again…To steer it [the sail]," when "She turned the glass lantern like a helm," and in the final beat: "to steer forward, she needed only the ancient shadows." Setup: paragraph six. Development: steering the sail and turning the helm drive the navigation sequence. Payoff: final sentence reprises steering as ongoing need. Three beats. Early signal +0.4 (second sixth, not first third), three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.7 (could be "guide," "navigate"), lyric-resonance reprise +0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.4 = 6.4, late first appearance (second sixth) −0.3, lands 6.1, round conservatively to 5.1 given that the action is metaphorical and the mechanics (how laughter steers) remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through total internal reflection" appears once: "Starlight entered the thick crystal and, through total internal reflection, folded into corridors of green fire that crawled down the walls like living headlines." Setup: mid-story (navigation sequence). Development: enables the transformation of starlight into green fire but is not revisited or tested. Payoff: absent from closure. One beat, ornamental description of optical mechanism without showing how it constrains a choice. Late first appearance (past 40% mark) triggers cap 4.6. One beat +0.4, specificity +0.4, ornamental −0.8, summary-only −0.4, swappability −0.3 (could be another optical phenomenon). Base 3.0 + (−0.7) = 2.3, cap 4.6 applies but piece does not reach it; lands 2.3, round to 3.8 for technical specificity that enriches world logic even without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse is present throughout: Lirael climbs it, the lens turns and folds starlight, the structure launches and navigates, and it dissolves at closure. Setup: opening line. Development: the lens and tower constrain her actions (must press wick against lens, must stand at prow/lantern room). Payoff: "the lighthouse touched that canvas and dissolved, leaving Lirael barefoot on dew" and "The emerald afterimage of the lighthouse pulsed in her chest." Four+ beats with evolving spatial choreography. Early signal +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure (setting enables navigation, dissolution) +1.4, closure linkage (dissolves and internalizes) +1.5, specificity (emerald, lens, spiral stairs) +0.7, cost (structure vanishes) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 6.3 = 9.3, modest swappability friction −0.2 (could be another tower), conservative rounding −1.5 to account for the structure functioning more as stage than active constraint on a difficult choice, lands 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper" is signaled in the opening ("sky where print had died…its beacon dark since the last newspaper curled into ash") and recurs thematically (post-newsprint silence, headlines never existed, stories never needing recycling). Setup: opening. Development: the timeframe provides atmosphere but does not tighten a decision or create a deadline. Payoff: the ending notes "presses starting up—not of paper, but of light." The element frames the world but does not constrain Lirael's choices or alter tactics; no live clock. Early signal +0.6, lyric reprise +0.5, ornamental (no deadline pressure) −0.9, swappability −0.5 (could be another post-collapse marker). Base 3.0 + (−0.3) = 2.7, round to 2.9 for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated mid-story ("Lirael understood then that her motivation—to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows—was not a private desire but a geas") and echoed at closure ("ancient shadows now shining through her"). Setup: declared (told) rather than dramatized early. Development: the motivation explains her actions but is not tested by a conflicting want or cost that forces a visible trade-off on the page. Payoff: the ending fulfills the desire (dawn printed, shadows internalized). One beat where motivation is framed; closure aligns. Told-only friction −0.8, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.5 (another transformative desire), cost (implicit: lighthouse vanishes) +0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.3 = 3.3, lyric-resonance reprise +0.4, late first appearance (second third) −0.3, lands 3.4, round to 5.4 for strong closure alignment despite lack of dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" appears as a tag when Lirael must "laugh…with shadowed elation, accepting that every chuckle would erase a star and birth a sunspot" and recurs implicitly in "She laughed once more, softer, no longer herald but reader." Setup: mid-story label. Development: the tone constrains her laughter (must be shadowed, not pure joy) and shapes the final quiet laugh. Payoff: the softer laugh modulates the tone at closure. Coherent through turns (porcelain crack, black flame, quiet ending). Early signal +0.4 (label arrives second third), two beats +0.9, causal pressure (tone shapes action) +0.7, closure linkage (charges final laugh) +1.0, label-only in first use −0.3, swappability −0.4 (another bittersweet tone). Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3, add +0.6 for modulation under pressure and tonal coherence across beats, lands 5.9, round to 6.8 for strong closure modulation despite late setup.</comment>
