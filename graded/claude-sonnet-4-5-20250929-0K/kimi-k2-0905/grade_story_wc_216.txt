<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timekeeper's motivation to understand texture over measurement is clear and embodied through concrete actions (rubbing the urn shard, climbing the silo, reading tags). Interior life shows genuine curiosity rather than stock sentiment. The final exchange where he trades the fragment "felt the texture shift inside his ribs" demonstrates embodied emotion. However, the character's choices feel more observational than decisional—he descends, reads, asks, offers—without meaningful internal conflict or a foreclosed path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece teaches a pattern of sensory accumulation (dust motes, light tasting like iron, footsteps as Braille) that reweights the central question by the ending. Orientation anchors are present early (timekeeper, emerald silo, dawn, post-number world). The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "to rediscover time was not to measure but to exchange sensations, each narrative heartbeat a coin." The cost reads as conceptual—abandoning quantification for ephemeral exchange—and the dispersal at dusk signals passage without claiming decisive change. One tightening occurs when the boy rewrites the urn fragment's tag, shifting the timekeeper's stance from collector to participant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo functions as more than backdrop: its internal ladder offers "each rung a sentence he could feel in his palms," the rim provides the noon-light experiment, and the base hosts the garage sale that enables the final exchange. The urn fragment's "crazed glaze looked like cracked hourglass glass" and the price tags' evolving descriptions create a micro-setting of objects that constrain and charge choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (metallic dust on the tongue, unnamed color of noon light). The silo's verticality structures the arc—ascent for solitary discovery, descent for communal exchange.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding time's texture in a post-numerical world. Pressure accumulates through textural discoveries (motes, light, metallic taste) and deepens when the timekeeper encounters the garage sale tradition—others have already begun the work he seeks. The trade of the urn fragment narrows his stance from passive collector to active participant, and the woman's footsteps "typing Braille against his sternum" registers as felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (the sale encounter) reweights his solitary quest. However, agency leans observational; the coincidental discovery of the time capsule and the fortuitous arrival of the teen with a sale reduce protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—time as exchange rather than accounting—emerges organically from the garage sale descriptions, the urn fragment's reweighting, and the final realization about "circulating through palms and pockets." The piece resists moralizing; the ending image of dispersal offers a non-literal answer without thesis statement. Subtext operates in the price-tag prose ("Fragment of final container, carries the echo of last exhalation, trades for one genuine shiver") and the sensory substitutions (color tasting like iron). The urn fragment's journey from museum relic to tradeable sensation enacts the theme without announcing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric compression ("borrowed-time timekeeper, whose ledger once ticked in neat columns"), purposeful syntactic density, and a consistent perceptual filter (everything becomes textural metaphor). POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the focalizer's immediacy ("each narrative heartbeat a coin minted in the emerald silo's shadow"). Dialogue, when present, feels natural and advances plot (the boy's explanation, the trade negotiation). The prose serves the Accumulative lens but risks over-ornamentation in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: dust motes as "former digits," light tasting "like blood from a bitten minute," footsteps "typing Braille against his sternum." While purposeful for the Accumulative mode, the relentless metaphor load slows momentum in several beats ("steel skin peeled back like a tin flower" immediately followed by another extended image). Sentence openings show variety, but some adjacent lines paraphrase without adding pressure ("He realized townsfolk must have begun embedding messages" / "He understood then that to rediscover time was not to measure"). No major loops or scaffold, but density occasionally substitutes for propulsion. Information clarity remains high despite the ornamentation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—post-numerical timekeeping via garage-sale narratives—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative constraint and accumulative texture. The urn fragment as currency and the price tags as proto-ledger transform the timekeeper's occupation into embodied metaphor. Emotional specificity (the "metallic dust that settled on the tongue") avoids generic templates. The piece commits fully to its concept and follows implications (numbers as shapes, tags as new measurement). However, the protagonist's passive discovery arc and the convenient teen's arrival lean toward familiar beats. The ending's thematic realization feels earned but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timekeeper is present throughout and frames the arc, but his choices trend observational (climbing, reading, asking) rather than decisional with cost. He offers the urn fragment in trade, which enables the ending exchange, and his realization about exchange-as-texture shapes closure. Early presence, two beats (cairn-building, trading), and thematic centrality earn mid-range. However, he does not constrain options or force a turn; the sale and teen arrive by coincidence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The urn fragment appears in four beats: pocket rubbing for comfort, cairn anchor, trade offer, and conceptual payoff when the woman walks away with it. Its "crazed glaze looked like cracked hourglass glass" ties it to the time theme, and the boy's rewritten tag ("carries the echo of last exhalation, trades for one genuine shiver") reweights it from relic to active currency. The final sensation—footsteps as Braille—charges the closure. Essential across beats and ending, with evolving symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule triggers the discovery of price tags, which lead to the garage sale tradition and the final trade. Its "steel skin peeled back like a tin flower" and bleached contents (VHS, newspaper) contrast with the intact tags, foregrounding narrative over number. Present early, enables the middle revelation, and the tags participate in closure (the timekeeper's own entry, the trade). Causal role in two beats and thematic resonance, but not indispensable—another discovery mechanism could serve.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" frames the inciting condition (numbers lose meaning at dawn) and constrains every action: the timekeeper must find non-numerical texture, townsfolk embed messages in descriptions, the garage sale operates without prices. It enables the core premise and shapes the final realization about exchange. Present from the opening and active in the ending's conceptual repricing. However, it functions more as premise than as a trait that forces a visible tradeoff in a single beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is the protagonist's explicit goal ("to rediscover what measurement felt like") and drives the silo ascent, the noon-light experiment, and the descent to the sale. The final line "to rediscover time was not to measure but to exchange sensations" directly answers the quest. Present early, structures the arc, and articulates closure. However, the action itself is passive observation until the trade; swapping "rediscover" for "understand" would require only minor edits. Causal across beats, but not uniquely irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage sale descriptions is discovered via the time-capsule tags, explained by the teen ("numbers went on strike, so we let objects speak"), demonstrated through multiple examples ("Alarm clock that rang only on birthdays"), and executed by the timekeeper (his own tag for the urn fragment) and the boy (rewriting the fragment's tag). The method shapes the middle revelation, the trade mechanics, and the thematic closure ("stories became the currency"). Present across three beats with mechanical specificity and closure linkage. Essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo provides spatial structure (exterior → interior ladder → rim → base) that tracks the protagonist's arc from solitary seeking to communal exchange. The rim's horizon "spilled green wheat like an unabridged novel" enables the noon-light experiment; the base hosts the garage sale that precipitates the trade. The silo's verticality literalizes the shift from observation to participation. Present in four beats, constrains movement, and charges the ending by framing the sale. Could not be replaced by a generic structure without losing the ascent/descent metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After numbers change meaning" establishes the inciting condition and frames every action: the timekeeper seeks new texture, townsfolk adopt narrative currency, the garage sale operates description-only. Dawn-to-dusk progression is tracked (dawn opening, noon experiment, dusk dispersal) and the temporal arc mirrors the thematic shift. Present early, constrains premise, and participates in closure pacing. However, the timeframe functions as backdrop rather than live pressure; no countdown or deadline forces decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Understanding time's texture is stated early ("to rediscover what measurement felt like"), pursued through the silo climb and noon experiment, tested by the garage sale encounter, and answered in the final realization ("to exchange sensations"). The motivation drives choices and is dramatized in the metallic-dust discovery and the urn trade. However, friction between want and cost is muted—he seeks, finds, and integrates without significant resistance or foreclosed path. Present across beats and resolved at closure, but the quest unfolds more smoothly than conflict typically demands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Anticipated mysteries" coheres through the opening's "timeless hush," the time capsule discovery ("heart knocking with anticipated mysteries"), the price-tag descriptions as puzzles, and the noon-light color "he had no name for." Tone modulates from solitary wonder (silo climb) to communal exchange (garage sale) while maintaining lyric curiosity. The final dispersal sustains the anticipatory mood rather than resolving into certainty. Coherent through turns and present in the final image's open texture. However, the tone remains relatively static—wonder throughout—without a decisive pressure shift at closure.</comment>
