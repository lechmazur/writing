<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist lacks concrete micro-choices under pressure; she moves through the archive in a dreamlike procession without internal contradiction or visceral struggle. Interiority consists largely of abstract assertions ("anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia") rather than embodied emotion. The final shift from lone historian to community teacher is narrated in summary across multiple paragraphs without a dramatized turning point that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague throughout—who, where, and when are never anchored concretely by ~120 words; the archive's geography and the protagonist's physical journey are abstract. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no single meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; instead, thematic assertions recur without escalation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she removes the veil, shares the pagoda, builds community), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sensory details are vivid but generic ("copper tears," "luminous dust") and never constrain a choice or alter tactics. The archive's layout is never mapped; the protagonist moves through "corridors" and finds a "memory chamber" without spatial coherence or consequence. The bronze prism pagoda recurs frequently but remains an ornamental symbol rather than a tool that shapes action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—purifying the archive—is signaled early but never tested; no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options. Pressure is asserted ("the task felt like trying to hold starlight") but never dramatized through escalation. The shift from lone quest to community teaching happens off-page in summary; no visible price is paid, no path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly from images and motifs: memory as beautiful contamination, the impossibility of erasure, the need for shared witness. The final insight—"purification meant telling the truth slant, letting memory remain beautifully broken"—is earned by the journey's particulars. However, the piece relies on direct thematic statements ("she understood now") rather than letting the final image carry resonance without authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable, but psychic distance is uniformly far; the narrator's perceptual signature is ornate and interchangeable rather than character-specific. Diction remains elevated throughout ("anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia," "steadily unpredictable") without modulation under stress. No dialogue appears. The prose reads as a single authorial voice describing the historian rather than inhabiting her mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density overload: "atoms of nostalgia drifted like luminous dust," "air tasted of copper tears," "freckles that would map constellations." Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]" openers recur across a dozen paragraphs. Paraphrase loops are pervasive—paragraphs 12–13, 20–21, and 24–26 restate the same thematic content. Information density is low; many lines do decorative work without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The core concept—a historian navigating a sentient archive of lost memories—is fresh, and the combination of elements (saffron veil, bronze prism, atoms of nostalgia) is specific. However, the emotional arc is familiar: lone seeker realizes truth must be shared, removes symbolic veil, teaches community. The piece avoids bold risks; every thematic assertion is cushioned by safety-hedging ("anguished joy," "surrender and victory").</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The saffron-veil historian is present throughout and frames the narrative, but her choices are narrated in summary rather than dramatized. She "pursued forbidden knowledge," "found the memory chamber," "discovered the exit," "removed her veil"—all recounted without on-page decision beats that narrow options. She appears in the closure image teaching the next generation, but the shift from solitary quest to communal sharing happens off-page. Early signal (+0.5), closure participation (+0.4), but minimal beat involvement and no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda appears in five distinct beats: opening tactile contact, showing parents' faces, multiplying reflections, shrinking to locket size, and final teaching tool. It recurs with reweighted meaning (guilt → lantern → compass → teaching tool), satisfying lyric resonance. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics; its transformations are asserted rather than dramatized. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.0), closure linkage (+0.5), but no causal pressure and high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atoms of nostalgia appear in seven paragraphs, forming a recurring motif. They "drifted," "clustered around her throat," "settled into her skin," became "wings." However, they never shape stakes or tactics—they are purely metaphorical, never constraining or enabling an action. The protagonist does not choose or refuse them; they are backdrop. Early signal (+0.5), closure participation (+0.3), but ornamental use and no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" appears three times: as teacher's warning, as method of evading algorithms, and as descriptor of the future. It never constrains or enables a specific on-page action with visible cost. The protagonist "avoiding patterns" (element F) is closer to the action, but "steadily unpredictable" remains a thematic label. Late first appearance in paragraph 4 (−0.3), label-only use (−0.6), no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Purify" is the stated mission in paragraph 3 and recurs in five paragraphs as the protagonist's goal. However, no major turn traces to this action—she never dramatizes an attempt to purify, never faces a cost for succeeding or failing. The resolution redefines purification as "telling the truth slant," but this insight is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle. Early signal (+0.5), thematic presence, but no causal pressure and high swappability (the story could function with "understand" or "preserve").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"By avoiding patterns" appears in paragraphs 7 and 14, once as evasion tactic and once as teaching method. The mechanics are never shown—what patterns, how they are avoided, what cost is paid. The protagonist "moved like a moth refusing the moon's geometry" and "discovered the exit hidden in plain sight," but these are metaphorical assertions. Mid-story first appearance (−0.3), summary-only (−0.5), no visible mechanism or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is the story's primary setting, named in paragraph 2 and recurring across a dozen beats. It supplies the memory chamber, defensive algorithms, and the exit, but these never constrain choices—the protagonist finds what she seeks without obstacle. Geography is never mapped; the archive is abstraction rather than place. Early signal (+0.6), extensive presence (+1.0), closure participation (+0.4), but no spatial pressure or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" appears in paragraphs 1, 16, and 26 as a thematic frame. It never tightens decisions or creates a live clock; time is vague throughout. The phrase functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. Swappable with "after the fall" or similar. Early signal (+0.4), closure participation (+0.3), but ornamental use and no temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Pursue forbidden knowledge" is stated in paragraph 6 and echoed in paragraph 25 ("She had pursued forbidden knowledge only to find it wasn't forbidden"). The desire is declared but never dramatized through conflicted choice—no moment where she weighs the cost of seeking versus turning back. The resolution undercuts the premise (knowledge "wasn't forbidden") without on-page friction. Early signal (+0.5), closure linkage (+0.4), but told-only and no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" appears once in paragraph 13 as a label. Tone throughout is elevated and lyric, but it does not modulate with pressure—the register remains uniformly ornate from opening to close. No coherent emotional arc; the protagonist's affect is asserted ("laughed with anguished joy," "smiled") rather than embodied. Single mention, label-only (−0.6), no tonal shift or closure charge.</comment>
