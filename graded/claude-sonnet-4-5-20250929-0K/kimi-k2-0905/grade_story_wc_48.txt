<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied contradictions: "she began to want these fragments to weigh her down rather than lift her." The micro-choices (speaking the deleted sentence, offering the shell back, typing "The sea remembers") track a visible arc from evasion to commitment. Internal conflict is enacted rather than summarized: her cynicism meets her hope without therapy-speak. Minor slip: the boy and pianist are functionally passive cameos; secondary pressure comes entirely from Lira, who works well but arrives late.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered encounters and recursive motifs until the final writing act reweights the premise. Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the act of finishing the novel, the shell as lighthouse, and Lira's resolution create a before/after with conceptual cost (no more evasion). Orientation is taught early (nexus, three channels, mist, mother's shell). One micro-penalty: the nexus's mechanics (fog-to-solid transformation) are asserted more than dramatized, and the middle transitions feel slightly compressed without full causal handoff between encounters.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The feral nexus functions as micro-setting: mist tasting of "salt and wet paper," fog curling into "quotation marks around her ankles," and the shell accumulating weight constrain Mara's choices and charge the final lighthouse image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through a writer's perception (marginalia, proofs, pages). Spatial choreography is clean across beats. The setting reappears in the ending ("street that smelled of salt and wet paper"), anchoring closure without becoming a static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: complete the novel and redeem abandoned characters, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Lira's accusation ("You left me mid-knock") crystallizes the cost of evasion, and Mara's choice to offer the shell back narrows her options from hoarding to releasing. The reversal—wanting fragments to weigh her down—demonstrates agency under pressure. Cost is legible: she walks away "pockets empty" but writes through dawn. Escalation fits the Accumulative lens; no requirement for multiple turns at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: collecting hopes is releasing them, finishing is an act of courage against evasion. The shell's transformation (ear trumpet → lighthouse), recurring salt-and-paper imagery, and the line "The sea remembers every name you refuse to carry" constrain choices and accumulate toward the ending's conceptual repricing. The final paragraph avoids moralizing; instead, the pianist's resolved chord and Lira walking forward deliver resonance through image. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats. Minor note: "against the current" as motif recurs but could press harder on tactics mid-story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "fog curled into quotation marks," "voice like pages rubbed together," "sentences rearranging beneath her sternum." Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight at Lira's appearance, wider at dawn). Dialogue is brief and goal-driven ("Take your shapes, but give me the courage to finish"). One slip: "lucidly watchful, counting heartbeats" repeats the prompt attribute without fully integrating it into micro-choices; it reads slightly ornamental in the opening beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor well. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character or atmosphere. Three friction points lower the score: (1) "swirling hush" recurs four times without pattern-teaching or payoff variation (minor loop); (2) "against the current" appears three times in similar constructions, creating a template cadence; (3) elevated diction ("solemnized," "ephemeral cameo," "translucent") clusters densely in the nexus beats, occasionally clashing with the urgency of those moments. Clarity remains intact, so artifacts do not touch closure, but propulsion stutters slightly in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of writer's block as literal ghost-summoning, hope as "angular, something that scraped," and the shell-as-lighthouse transformation feels specific and earned in hindsight. The nexus premise is fresh, and the final image (shell on windowsill guiding "tomorrow's unread stories") avoids abstraction. Risk-taking in the metaphysical frame heightens stakes without obscuring causality. One minor friction: the boy-and-pianist cameos feel slightly stock (refugee child, elderly musician) before Lira arrives with sharper particularity. Overall, the piece commits fully to its premise and delivers a non-obvious angle on creative paralysis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara appears in setup, middle (offering shell, receiving Lira's dissolution), and ending (typing, setting shell on windowsill). Her choices (speaking the deleted sentence, offering the shell, typing through dawn) create all major turns. Conflict between evasion and courage is dramatized in micro-decisions with visible cost (emptied pockets, exhaustion implied). High causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Shell appears in four distinct beats: opening (mother's ear trumpet), boy's solemnization (freckle on lip), pianist's chord (quartz grain), and ending (miniature lighthouse on windowsill). Each touch adds weight and reweights meaning. The shell constrains Mara's choice to offer it back and charges the final image. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity; the exact object is indispensable to the story's logic and final resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Against the current" is signaled early (opening line, refusing instincts), recurs mid-story ("against the current of her cynicism," "against the current of morning commuters"), and frames the ending ("releasing them, against the current, into the living world"). It shapes tactics (Mara's choice to stop hoarding) and charges the theme. Two gates met solidly; payoff is thematic and perceptual rather than forcing a single decisive turn. Specificity is good; cost connection is clear but could press harder on moment-to-moment choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears in two beats: opening ("Mara was lucidly watchful, counting heartbeats") and mid-story ("Lucidly watchful, Mara saw the choice"). Setup is present, but development is label-only; the trait does not constrain or enable a concrete action with visible cost. Payoff is absent—it does not reappear or reweight at closure. Functional but replaceable; swappable with "attentive" or "deliberate" without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Solemnize" appears in three beats: the boy's solemnization (fragment folded into shell), the pianist's chord becoming quartz, and the final paragraph ("each sentence a solemnization of the ephemeral cameos"). The action drives the transformation mechanic, enables Mara's agency, and is causally active at closure. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage. Slightly elevated diction creates minor register drift in peak beats (−0.2), but the action is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Ephemeral cameos appear across four beats: boy (setup), pianist (development), Lira (climax), and ending (writing "solemnization of the ephemeral cameos"). The method is taught early, shapes every middle encounter, and provides the mechanics for Mara's transformation. Strong causal pressure: each cameo narrows options and accumulates weight. Closure linkage is direct (Lira's dissolution and final writing act). The exact method is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The feral nexus is established in the opening line, pressures all middle encounters (delivers cameos, responds to Mara's choice by inhaling fog), and reappears obliquely at closure (desk street "smelled of salt and wet paper"). The setting supplies the transformation mechanic and constrains Mara's tactics (she must come here to collect hopes). Causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is present but indirect. Good beat involvement and specificity; one friction: the nexus could press harder on physical constraint (e.g., tide timing, danger) to elevate from thematic anchor to tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" appears in the third paragraph and recurs once near the end ("the swirling hush of new pages turning"). Setup is present but late (~15% in); development is absent—the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics mid-story. Payoff is thematic (pages turning after she finishes) but does not impose a live clock. Functional as atmosphere but swappable with "before the deadline" or similar without structural impact. Missing middle development caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to collect the shapes of different hopes" is signaled in paragraph five, dramatized through three collection beats (boy, pianist, Lira), and inverted at closure (collecting becomes releasing). The motivation drives every middle choice and is causally active in the ending (writing as release). Strong beat involvement and causal pressure. One friction: the motivation is stated abstractly before being embodied in action; earlier micro-choice signaling would tighten setup. Closure linkage is strong; cost is clear (emptied pockets, exhaustion, commitment).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Swirling hush" recurs in four beats: opening mist, "swirling hush deepened" (pianist), "swirling hush tightened into a vortex" (Lira), and ending ("swirling hush of new pages turning"). The tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (deepens → tightens → resolves), and charges the final image. Good beat involvement and closure linkage. One friction: the exact phrase recurs without variation, creating minor loop debt (−0.3 per Q7 routing); slight rephrasing in middle beats would preserve tone without repetition. Still, tone is indispensable to atmosphere and ending resonance.</comment>
