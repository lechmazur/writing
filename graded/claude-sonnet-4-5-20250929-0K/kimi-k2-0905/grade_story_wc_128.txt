<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marisol's waiving of demurrage fees and her view of "compassion, like tide, must return" establishes interiority, though key motivations remain asserted rather than tested under pressure. The locket photo and her mother's legacy provide backstory depth, but the final act—pressing the photo into Beto's hand—feels more symbolic than a choice forged by internal contradiction. Beto's recognition of the mother adds coincidence that enriches texture but doesn't sharpen conflict. Minor embodiment gaps: "cautious exuberance" is named rather than shown through micro-choices in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrative follows an accumulative/textural lens: the mistaken envelope initiates a discovery chain, and the closure reconfigures the meaning of Marisol's cyclical kindness through the locket exchange and ledger notation. Cost is present but muted—Marisol loans the photo "until the next cycle demands it," a gesture more poetic than a visible foreclosure of options. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (who, where, when anchored by the second paragraph). One meaningful deepening occurs when the envelope's contents reveal Dalia Cruz's legacy, reweighting Marisol's private acts within a larger network of care, but the final image leans heavily on metaphor ("value immeasurable") rather than a dramatized price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The breezy library with clerestory windows, card catalog flapping "like gull wings," and constellations on the ceiling creates vivid sensory anchoring that filters through Marisol's maritime world. The derelict Wharf of the Lanterns and the moored research vessel provide specificity that shapes the discovery beat. Setting elements—salt wind, seawall, shuttered kiosks—are woven into action and perception without catalog bloat. The library's constellation (Lyra) and Beto's reflective coat patches contribute atmospheric texture, though neither directly constrains a choice at closure, keeping this high in the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring cycles of compassion and uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation remains gentle: Marisol agrees to deliver the envelope, they decipher the address, and she drafts a receipt. No reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the locket exchange is framed as continuation rather than sacrifice. The accumulative lens allows for deepening rather than causal tightening, and the story achieves one meaningful reweighting when the envelope's purpose is revealed, yet the protagonist's agency at closure is more symbolic gesture than constrained choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through recurring images—ledgers, tides, cargo, the locket as "freight that must change carriers"—and the narrative resists overt moralizing until the final ledger entry ("value immeasurable"), which leans close to thematic summary. The concept of cyclical compassion is developed through specific events (the waived fees, the envelope delivery, the photo exchange) rather than abstract philosophizing. The ending offers a resonant image of Marisol walking against headlights "ready to initiate another quiet waiver," suggesting perpetual motion without a decisive repricing of the cycle itself. Minor deduction for the phrase "proof that compassion, like cargo, is only ever on loan" in the penultimate paragraph, which states rather than dramatizes the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV narration with stable third-person distance and a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Marisol's maritime vocabulary ("demurrage," "cargo manifest," "relief supplies"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, with phrases like "whimsically attentive to each shelf he dusted, as though books were sleeping birds" and "starlight into confetti" providing texture. Minor slips: "cautious exuberance" and "the way strangers sometimes become necessary mirrors" drift toward generalized insight rather than character-specific idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Miss, this came to the branch address…"), avoiding forced subtext but also not advancing pressure through speech. Free indirect style is clean throughout, with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and selective sensory detail ("salt wind flapped the card catalog drawers like gull wings"), but suffers from scattered overwriting and metaphor density in non-peak beats: "necessary mirrors," "compassion, like tide, must return," "freight that must change carriers to stay afloat," and "the symphony, though ended, still reverberated in the hush between heartbeats" accumulate without clear payoff at closure. Template cadence appears in the opening sequence: "locked her ledger...followed the music...felt the familiar tug...crossed the plaza." Paraphrase loop: the final paragraph restates the cyclical premise already established ("another quiet waiver, another disguised return, another cycle beginning exactly where the last one resolved"). Information density is moderate; several beats compress transit efficiently, but the locket and envelope mechanics are somewhat expository. No clarity breaks, and figurative language remains coherent within vehicle logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The frame—a cargo broker as compassion practitioner, mistaken-address envelope as plot engine, library under stars as meeting point—synthesizes familiar elements with specificity of setting and occupation. The locket photo of Marisol's mother towing Beto's nephew's trawler provides a coincidence that feels earned in a small maritime community, avoiding pure contrivance. However, the "cycles of compassion" premise and the kindness-ledger metaphor trend toward writing-prompt templates without a sharp moral complication or cost that would elevate the synthesis. The transformation test is marginal: swapping cargo broker for another service profession and library for another civic space would leave the emotional arc largely intact. Risk-taking is modest; the accumulative structure and quiet ending are executed competently but do not venture into unconventional territory that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marisol waives demurrage fees (beat 1, disguised as clerical error), agrees to deliver the envelope (beat 2), drafts the receipt (beat 3), and presses the locket into Beto's hand (beat 4). Her shrewdness is asserted via "broker authority" but not demonstrated under pressure—no negotiation, no trade-off that tests her professional versus personal loyalties. The cargo-broker identity provides occupational texture and vocabulary but does not constrain a key choice; her decisions feel consistent with general benevolence rather than a specifically shrewd calculus. Early signal present; beat involvement across four moments; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage via the ledger notation and photo exchange. Swappability moderate: another service professional could perform similar acts with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in beat 1 (Marisol studies it "the way others pray"), beat 2 (Beto taps the glass and recognizes her mother), and beat 4 (Marisol presses it into Beto's hand, Beto tucks it into the envelope sleeve). The object is handled physically and its meaning evolves from private anchor to shared memory to transferred "freight." However, the locket does not constrain a choice under pressure; Marisol's decision to loan it feels symbolic rather than costly—she retains "the locket's imprint warming her palm" and expects its return, so the sacrifice is deferred. Early signal strong; three-beat involvement; specificity high (photo of mother steering skiff through storm); closure linkage moderate (present in final third but not the ultimate image). The gate model shows setup, middle touch, and payoff, but causal pressure remains modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept is explicitly named ("compassion, like tide, must return," "cyclical ledger of kindness," "another cycle beginning exactly where the last one resolved") and shapes Marisol's framing of events, but on-page choices do not test or complicate the cycle—she enacts compassion without friction or cost that would challenge the premise. The waived fees, envelope delivery, and locket exchange all affirm the cycle rather than interrogate it. The concept guides tactics (Marisol "exercises broker authority" to draft a receipt, ensuring funds reach laborers) but does not narrow options or impose a visible trade-off. Early signal present; thematic coherence high; causal pressure low; closure linkage moderate (the ledger notation restates the cycle). The concept remains more thematic frame than on-page stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute "whimsically attentive" is assigned to Beto ("whimsically attentive to each shelf he dusted, as though books were sleeping birds") and echoed in his reflective coat patches and lantern gesture, but it does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. The trait colors his characterization and supports tone but remains decorative. Beto's actions (offering the envelope, accompanying Marisol, clipping the lantern) are cooperative rather than tests of whimsy versus practicality. Label-only mention without on-page tradeoff. Late first appearance (Beto introduced mid-story); one-beat involvement; no causal pressure; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears three times: Marisol initiates the envelope's return (beat 2), the intern logs funds to "uplift those silent contributors who load relief supplies under tomorrow's sunrise" (beat 3, though not explicitly "initiated" by Marisol), and the closing line promises Marisol will "initiate another quiet waiver, another disguised return, another cycle beginning." The action frames the story's motor but is broadly defined—Marisol's agreement to deliver, her drafting of the receipt, and her symbolic ledger notation all qualify as "initiating," making the action more thematic gesture than singular plot engine. Early signal moderate (first explicit use mid-story); beat involvement across three moments; swappability moderate (other verbs like "begin" or "commence" could substitute without structural loss). The action shapes the accumulative pattern but does not drive a single irreplaceable turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mistaken-address envelope is the central mechanism: Beto presents it in beat 2, they decipher "Señora Dalia Cruz, Wharf of the Lanterns" together, and the journey to deliver it structures the middle and ending. The error (swapped digits) is specific and plausible, and the envelope's contents (foreign currency for dock laborers) reweight Marisol's private acts within a larger network. The friendship between Marisol and Beto kindles through their collaboration—shared stories "without surnames," Beto's recognition of Marisol's mother, the locket exchange—and the envelope serves as both plot device and thematic vehicle. Early signal (envelope introduced ~30% in); two-beat involvement (offer and delivery); causal pressure moderate (the envelope motivates the journey but does not impose a dilemma); closure linkage strong (the receipt and locket exchange occur because of the envelope). Swappability low: the mistaken address and Dalia Cruz's legacy are load-bearing particulars.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The library appears in beats 1–2 (Marisol studies the locket under Lyra, Beto offers the envelope) and is anchored with vivid detail (clerestory windows, card catalog flapping, constellations on ceiling), but it functions primarily as atmospheric container rather than constraint. The setting does not pressure choices—Marisol could study the locket and receive the envelope elsewhere without altering the story's logic. The seawall, kiosks, and derelict wharf in beat 3 add specificity but again do not shape tactics. Early signal strong; sensory richness high; causal pressure low; closure linkage absent (ending occurs on the walk back, not in the library). Micro-setting note: the locket and envelope function more as "setting" (objects that organize space and choice) than the library itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the symphony ends" anchors the opening (Marisol hears the last brass note, crosses the plaza) and Beto hums the finale, but the night's duration and any urgency tied to time remain vague. Marisol proposes delivery "tonight, while the city's pulse remained high from music and crowds," suggesting social cover rather than a deadline. The narrative moves from dusk to "dawn trucks rumbl[ing] toward the piers" in the final paragraph, establishing a nocturnal window, but no ticking clock tightens decisions—Beto "accepted" without hesitation, and the delivery proceeds without time pressure. Early signal present; one-beat involvement (the proposal); no causal constraint (time does not narrow options or escalate stakes); swappable with "after the market closes" or similar without loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marisol's desire to "uplift silent contributors" is demonstrated through the waived demurrage fees (beat 1, for dockhands whose children are ill) and culminates in her drafting a receipt so the foreign currency can "uplift those silent contributors who load relief supplies" (beat 3). The motivation is signaled early and enacted twice, but without friction—no competing desire or cost that tests her commitment. The locket exchange and ledger notation extend the pattern but do not complicate it. Early signal strong; two-beat involvement; no internal conflict or trade-off; closure linkage moderate (the final walk promises "another quiet waiver"). The motivation guides choices but is not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone is established through diction ("cautious exuberance sealed with a smile no spreadsheet could audit," "whimsically attentive," "the symphony, though ended, still reverberated") and modulates subtly—restraint in Marisol's disguised fees and private ritual, warmth in her collaboration with Beto, quiet satisfaction in the closing ledger notation. However, the tone remains relatively static; no moment of peak pressure tests whether caution or exuberance dominates. The final image ("ready to initiate another quiet waiver") sustains the opening register without a decisive shift or charge. Coherence high; modulation under pressure low; closure linkage moderate (tone persists but does not transform).</comment>
