<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The locksmith operates almost entirely in metaphor without concrete internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation ("free an idea trapped behind fear") remains abstract throughout; we never see her wrestle with competing impulses in scene. The transformation at closure—speaking her first sentence of the new life—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as declarative rather than earned through prior causality. Interiority relies on elevated poetic register ("improbable longing," "sympathetic code") that distances rather than embodies emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of starlight/locks/freeing), but the closure unit lacks visible cost. The protagonist walks to the mirror, cuts the air, the cub leaps into her mouth, and she speaks—a sequence of symbolic gestures without a legible before/after in options or knowledge. Orientation is delayed (who/where established, but "what she's doing" remains vague past the opening third), though the delay doesn't fully pay off at closure. The story teaches its lyric pattern early, but the final reconfiguration substitutes assertion ("I am no longer the locksmith of what frightens me") for dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "ruined arcade" supply vivid mood but remain postcard detail; neither constrains a choice. The ivy-shaped-like-keys and ear-shaped keyhole are inventive but function as symbolic waypoints rather than tactical obstacles. Spatial choreography across the spiral corridor and mirror is legible, and the recurring starlight anchors the lyric frame, but setting does not pressure the protagonist's moves—she walks unimpeded through each threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("free an idea trapped behind fear") is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or live cost. The locksmith faces no meaningful opposition; the gates lean passively, the ivy reveals the keyhole, the mirror shatters "soundlessly," and the cub leaps into her mouth without resistance. Agency reads as ritual performance rather than decision under pressure. The single tightening moment—cutting the reflection—occurs without foreclosing an alternative or dramatizing a price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of self-censorship and voice emerges clearly through recurring images (muzzled cub, swallowed words, scar as collar), and the final constellation image offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the closing sentences drift into thesis statement ("freedom is not silence but chosen noise") and over-explain the legacy rather than trusting the image. The story's symbolic vocabulary is consistent, but the lack of on-page cost prevents the theme from landing with full weight—transformation is asserted more than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose maintains a distinct lyric register with purposeful compression and strong perceptual signature ("flavor of regret," "city's buried heartbeat"). Psychic distance remains stable, and the elevated diction is voice-motivated throughout. However, the narrative certainty exceeds what the focalizer can plausibly know in real time ("future travelers would call the Keybearer, though they would never know her name"), and several beats lean on stock metaphor strings ("caged behind her sternum, pecking at bone") that reduce specificity under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching a payoff; metaphors stack ("velvet pouch," "hush of cosmic possibility," "flavor of regret," "sympathetic code," "improbable longing") in ways that blur rather than sharpen the moment. Mixed vehicles appear: ribbon "threads itself" (mechanical) yet "stiffens" (organic), and the cub becomes "torrent of black ink" that "pours" yet also fills her with "words she had swallowed"—liquid, solid, and abstract simultaneously. Template cadence runs cluster in the final third ("She walked… She spoke… She lifted…"), and paraphrase loops recur (e.g., "improbable longing" appears five times). Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the Q7 cap and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact-penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lyric frame (locksmith as metaphor for self-liberation, starlight as guide, cub as muzzled voice) synthesizes familiar elements with atmospheric specificity. The ear-shaped keyhole and DNA-passport ribbon offer fresh inflections, and the scar-as-tuning-string is a strong final image. However, the core premise—artist unlocking creative voice through symbolic quest—follows a widely used template without transforming it through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The middle-ground hedging (no genuine obstacle, no trade-off) and the explain-everything final paragraphs retreat from bold commitment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The locksmith is present throughout and her actions (kneeling, winding ribbon, pressing hair to keyhole, cutting the mirror) drive the sequence. However, these actions read as ritual steps rather than decisions that narrow options or alter tactics. Early setup is strong, and she participates in the closure beat by speaking, but the final choice—to speak—arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lock of hair appears in three beats: drawn from the pouch, wound around fingers while counting knots, and pressed to the ear-shaped hole where the ribbon threads into the mechanism. Early signal is clear, and the object's DNA-as-passport function is specific. It participates in the closure sequence (ribbon becomes scar around throat), reweighting its meaning from oath-token to permanent reminder. However, the middle beat (counting knots) is primarily symbolic rather than causal, and the scar's final presence is asserted rather than shown to constrain a subsequent choice, limiting higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Enveloped secrets" frames the premise (idea trapped behind fear, muzzled cub, swallowed words) and is present across beats, but it functions as thematic coating rather than a force that narrows options. The concept is established early and recurs, yet the locksmith's tactics do not shift because of it—she follows the prescribed ritual without friction. At closure, the unsealing is described but does not create visible cost or alter a subsequent choice, keeping the score in the functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unassumingly bold" appears twice as a label: opening sentence ("unassumingly bold conviction") and final paragraph ("unassumingly bold lanterns"). Neither instance shows the trait constraining or enabling an on-page action with cost; the locksmith proceeds through each threshold without hesitation or tactical adjustment. The label does not shape her choices or the story's pressure, placing it in the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disorient" is dramatized when the metal "began to disorient, folding space so the arcade became a spiral corridor," a clear mid-story turn that alters the spatial frame. The corridor causes her to walk through "flickers of moments" where "each step erased a year," linking the action to both setting transformation and emotional excavation. However, this disorientation does not create a subsequent tactical problem or cost—she continues unimpeded to the mirror—and the action could be replaced with another metaphor for memory-walk without breaking the plot, limiting higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The hint mechanism is established early: "a lock that opened only when the first star seen at twilight whispered its hint." Vega delivers the hint ("not as word but as temperature… third gate from the left"), which directs her to the ivy-covered gate. The method shapes one key beat (gate selection) and reappears at closure ("Vega's hint repeated, warmer now"). However, the hint's mechanics are passive—Vega simply tells her where to go—and do not impose cost or require the locksmith to interpret under pressure, capping the score in the functional range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" is anchored early and provides atmospheric continuity (gates, ivy, spiral corridor, mirror). The setting transforms across beats (arcade → corridor → nexus again), but these shifts are cosmetic rather than tactical. The environment does not constrain her choices—gates lean passively, ivy reveals the keyhole without resistance, the corridor simply unfolds. At closure, she returns to the nexus and "the gates now gone," a spatial change asserted rather than earned, keeping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Across the hush of cosmic possibility" appears in the opening, final paragraph, and twice more as atmospheric phrase. The timeframe is vague and untethered; "three seasons" of travel is mentioned but does not create urgency, and the in-scene clock ("tonight") is static—no countdown or tightening. The phrase functions as tonal marker rather than a pressure device, and no decision is shaped by time scarcity, placing it in the ornamental-to-functional range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To free an idea trapped behind fear" is established in the opening sentence, repeated across beats (cub muzzled, words swallowed, oath of silence), and directly addressed at closure ("I am no longer the locksmith of what frightens me"). The motivation drives the quest structure and shapes her ritual actions. However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted—no moment where she hesitates or weighs the cost of freeing the idea versus keeping it caged—and the final speech arrives without visible friction between want and sacrifice, capping the score at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Improbable longing" appears five times and anchors the emotional texture throughout (opening conviction, city's heartbeat, cub's eyes, Vega's hint, scar's hum). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly as pressure builds—warmer at the mirror, tighter when the ribbon becomes scar. The final image (scar glowing, growl-now-song) charges the longing with earned resonance. However, the repetition of the exact phrase "improbable longing" without variation or earned synonyms reads as templated, and the tone does not shift decisively at the closure beat to reflect cost paid, limiting higher-band entry.</comment>
