<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are clear and rooted in duty, her micro-choices (pressing warmth-ghosts, timing her breath, crushing the nut-kernel) are goal-driven and embodied. The piece avoids therapy-speak and maintains POV discipline. Internal conflict is present but could deepen—her hatred of the orchard and graceless beauty are told more than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice (walking back to the orchard) feels earned but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational/Accumulative hybrid—pressure accumulates through the ticking frost-clock and Mara's sequential warm-ghost trail, resolving in Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she saves strangers but returns to her prison). Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (the cycle will repeat tomorrow). Orientation is clear early (cliffside, labyrinth, mechanical birds, frost deadline). One meaningful tightening occurs when the travelers hesitate at the final fork and Mara uses the nut-kernel handprint. The lens holds; cost is legible in the final walk back and the line "the same graceless beauty of saving strangers she would never meet again."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setting elements—cliff, labyrinth, mechanical birds, frost, cursed orchard—constrain Mara's choices throughout: she cannot enter the labyrinth (razor feathers), must work from the rim, and races the frost-clock. The handprint trail is a micro-setting solution that charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (frost-brittle grass, brass wings clicking, sap-formed faces). The mechanical birds' lens-eye and gear-song create tangible threat. The environment drives tactics and the final image (crystal fossils, folded wings) reconfigures the opening stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: guide the travelers out before frost forms. Pressure coheres under the situational lens via the ticking clock, the seven-fork junction, and the deceptive moonlight at the final choice. One meaningful tightening when Mara crushes the nut-kernel to make a glowing handprint, escalating her method. The travelers' response to the handprint narrows options and alters tactics. Cost is conceptual (her ongoing imprisonment) rather than a live forfeiture in the closure beat; the resolution is earned by Mara's agency but the price feels more thematic than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of "graceless beauty" emerges from Mara's duty-bound acts (warming the ground, spitting the kernel) and the contradiction between her hatred of the orchard and her role as savior. The final image—crystal fossils, folded wings, the walk back—resonates without stating a moral. However, the phrase "graceless beauty" is declared twice rather than fully embodied, and the nut's "forgotten blueprint" remains more symbolic than causally integrated. The ending offers a conceptual answer (cycles of sacrifice) but leans on told assertion ("the only graceless beauty allowed her") where a sharper image could carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature (Mara's attention to frost, warmth, mechanical rhythms). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("offhandedly exact," "ghost of warmth," "graceless beauty"). No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("saw," "watched") appear but fit the reflective stance. The prose modulates well under pressure (short bursts when the bird hovers, longer cadence at the final walk). One minor slip: "offhandedly exact, Mara recited" feels like an author cue rather than organic demonstration of the trait in action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; no major loops or scaffold. Figurative language is vivid ("white nooses," "lullaby of grinding teeth") but occasionally overwritten in non-peak beats ("candle left too close to the edge" stretches the vehicle). Minor template cadence in the middle third (repeated "She + verb" openers across four lines). The closing image is strong and propulsive. Clarity is maintained throughout; no causality breaks. Deduct −0.4 for density cluster and stem repetition that does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cursed-orchard-caretaker and mechanical-sentinel setup are familiar genre elements; the story transforms them through Mara's warmth-ghost method and the nut's tactile integration. The "forgotten blueprint" and "graceless beauty" feel more asserted than organically discovered. The final image (crystal fossils, wings folding "like prayers nobody taught them") offers a fresh inflection. The piece commits to its premise but does not take bold structural risks; the emotional arc and closure are earned yet predictable within the fantasy-duty tradition.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as reluctant caretaker frames expectation early, drives every beat (choosing vantage points, timing warmth-ghosts, crushing the kernel), and her final walk back to the orchard is the closure image. Her reluctance is embodied in "she hated the orchard" and "the only graceless beauty allowed her," and her choices narrow options (cannot enter, must use warmth). Present in setup, middle development, and payoff; causal pressure is strong. Cost is conceptual (ongoing imprisonment) rather than a new forfeiture, preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nut appears in four distinct beats: clenched in pocket (setup), shell description with blueprint ridges, cracked between molars (tasting iron/pine, blueprint vision), and crushed kernel smeared for the handprint. It enables the climactic tactic (glowing handprint) and reappears in the final paragraph as empty shell halves "sharp enough to cut regret." Causal, irreplaceable, and charges closure. High specificity and cost connection (the last gift from her mother, the blueprint, the final memory). All three gates met; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "forgotten blueprint" is introduced mid-story when Mara cracks the nut and sees "a spiral within a spiral" etched in microscopic ridges. It informs her path guidance (the exit location) and is thematically present in "offhandedly exact" recitation. However, the blueprint itself does not constrain a visible choice or create on-page friction; Mara already knows the maze's shifting map. It shapes one turn (identifying the hidden exit) but is more symbolic than mechanically decisive. Setup and payoff present; middle development is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" is declared in one line ("Offhandedly exact, Mara recited the maze's shifting map aloud") but not dramatized through contradictory costs or tactical trade-offs. The trait fits her role and the nut's blueprint detail, but it reads as a label rather than an embodied constraint that alters a choice. No clear cost tied to this exactness; it could be removed without breaking story logic. Present in setup, absent in middle pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Assemble" structures the entire middle: Mara moves along the rim, presses handprints, and assembles "a trail of warmth-ghosts." The final handprint (crushed kernel, glowing constellation) is the decisive assembly that the travelers follow. The action is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the rescue mechanism. Present in setup (moving to first vantage), development (repeated gesture), and payoff (final handprint that the traveler sees). Causal pressure is strong; cost is the expenditure of the nut-kernel and the ongoing cycle of duty.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The method—"leaving impressions without touching"—is signaled early ("she could not enter... but she could leave impressions without touching") and demonstrated across multiple beats: pressed palm → warmth-ghost arrow, repeated gestures, final handprint with crushed kernel. The mechanics matter (cannot step on stones, must use warmth that bleeds through glove/ground). The method shapes every attempt and is indispensable to the rescue. All three gates met; high specificity and causal involvement. Cost is visible (using the kernel, the impressions sealed in crystal).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds is established in the opening lines and pressures every choice: Mara cannot enter (razor feathers), must freeze when a bird swoops (lens-eye whirring, scent detection), and works from the rim. The birds constrain tactics throughout and their final settling ("wings folding like prayers") charges the closure image. The labyrinth's seven-fork junction is the key middle obstacle. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal and irreplaceable. The setting directly alters Mara's method and the travelers' survival.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frost deadline is signaled early ("less than an hour") and tracked across the story: "Time thinned; frost began to lace the grass blades," "the night frost formed, sealing her warm handprints into crystal fossils." The clock tightens Mara's choices (moving to the final vantage, crushing the kernel quickly). Present in setup, drives urgency in middle beats, and payoff is the frost's arrival that seals the impressions. The timeframe is visible and shapes tactics, though exact elapsed minutes are not granular. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to guide lost travelers to safety—is dramatized through every action (pressing warmth-ghosts, freezing to avoid the bird, crushing the nut-kernel for the handprint) and frames the story's opening and closing. Friction is present in her hatred of the orchard versus her duty, though the internal conflict could deepen. The motivation is tested on the page when the travelers hesitate and she must improvise the glowing handprint. Closure explicitly references the cycle ("new travelers, new frost"). Setup, development, payoff all met; cost is conceptual (ongoing imprisonment).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone "graceless beauty" is declared twice ("the only graceless beauty allowed her," "the same graceless beauty of saving strangers") and embodied in Mara's utilitarian gestures (kneeling, spitting the kernel, popping knees). The orchard's sap-faces and the mechanical birds' gear-song support the tone. It modulates from urgency (bird hover, frost forming) to resignation (final walk back). The tone charges the closure image (crystal fossils, wings folding) but leans on explicit naming where sharper imagery alone could carry the effect. Coherent but not fully woven into every beat without author assertion.</comment>
