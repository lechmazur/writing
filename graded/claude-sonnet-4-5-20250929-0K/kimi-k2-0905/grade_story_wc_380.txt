<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miren's motivation to recover her sister's memories drives the arc, and her actions are consistent with established traits. However, interiority leans heavily on lyric abstraction ("weight of a hand on her shoulder") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final moment—releasing the dust, walking home with "laughter settle into her bones"—reads as acceptance but lacks visible internal conflict during the choice itself. Embodied emotion is present but the peak beat skews toward poetic summary over dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the whale's gravity, the salt chamber, and the memory-recovery ritual build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the dispersal of memories into the city). Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost—Miren releases her sister's memories to strangers, accepting distribution over possession. Orientation anchors early (dock, dawn, whale carcass, Miren's role). The tightening is the ritual sequence itself, which narrows from search to recovery to release; one meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: gravity pockets force "strange arcs," the chamber's mist and crystals crack to release memories. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Miren's professional lens (lantern pole, tide codes). The whale's carcass and the dock pier are anchored with concrete specifics—steam, iron railing, wooden planks—that shape her movements. The environment charges the final image: lanterns casting her sister's silhouette, the dispersing dust.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: retrieve sister's deleted memories. Pressure accumulates through the ritual sequence—flowers, mist, gravity collapse, memory emergence—ending in a trade-off: release the memories city-wide rather than keep them. The cost is legible on the page: "her fingers passed through," the flowers crumble, she folds the dust and disperses it. One meaningful tightening (ritual to release) fits the Accumulative lens. Agency is renunciation with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: deletion does not erase, it displaces; memory sinks like whale bones into thin places. The salt chamber, gravity pockets, and dispersed dust cohere without thesis statements. The final image—lanterns marking safe paths, flower dust in the city's lungs—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: preservation through distribution. The sister's laughter as "ballast" avoids sentimentality by grounding it in physical metaphor. No overt moralizing; complexity held through the choice to release rather than hoard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization. Perceptual signature is consistent: Miren notices gravity shifts, lantern mechanics, sailor coffee grounds. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity ("gleaming silence," "breathing rainbows"). Brief compression in the peak ritual sequence—"memories emerged like minnows"—is purposeful and pattern-taught. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tighter during the ritual, broader during the final walk home. Voice remains distinct and embodied throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings differ. Information density is high during the ritual sequence. However, minor scaffold appears: "She descended... She knelt... She whispered... She reached..." in quick succession shows template cadence. The phrase "gleaming silence" recurs three times, once in setup, twice near closure—purposeful but borders on over-reliance. Figurative language is dense in middle paragraphs ("salt crystal growing chamber... translucent formations that bent light into slow, breathing rainbows") without obscuring clarity. No paraphrase loops. Momentum is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—deleted memories preserved in a whale's gravity shadow, recovered through coffee-ground divination and a salt-chamber ritual—synthesizes speculative elements into a coherent logic. Miren's role as lantern lighter is specific and integrated (lantern pole as tool, lighting as closure act). The choice to release memories city-wide rather than hoard them is a non-obvious moral calculus. Tropes (loss, recovery) are transformed through the gravity/salt mechanics. Risk-taking in the lyric-dense middle sequence heightens texture without gimmickry. One fresh inflection: memory as dispersed sensation rather than narrative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miren (dock-side lantern lighter) is present throughout; her occupation shapes her final act (lighting lanterns as closure gesture). She makes key decisions: descend to the chamber, perform the ritual, release the dust. Her professional tool (lantern pole) carries the dust home and lights the path. Removing her specific role would weaken the closure image. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in at least three beats: Miren withdraws them from the tide-table book, lays them on the whale's shadow, they absorb light and regain color, then crumble. Their pigment is "spent," dust is folded into the lantern pole, dispersed in the final act. The flowers enable the memory recovery and their destruction marks the cost. Irreplaceable: the sister hid them; their transformation (colorless → purple → dust) charges the ritual and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity are introduced in paragraph two, recur throughout (lifted an inch, boots sink, thickened in the chamber, pull steps into arcs, collapse to a single point, dissolve, fluctuate at the end). They constrain movement, enable the memory-release mechanism (gravity collapse forms the point from which memories emerge), and charge the final line. The whale's gravity remains after the body is gone. Removing this concept breaks the story's physics and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" describes the gravity behavior throughout. Early: "sometimes lifted, sometimes sank." In the chamber: "thickened, pulling steps into strange arcs." The unpredictability is felt—Miren's boots sink "without leaving a mark"—and the fluctuation drives the collapse-and-release mechanism. The mystery is not resolved, which fits tone. Trait is embodied in multiple beats and affects tactics (she must navigate unstable footing). Cost: the gravity's persistence after the whale is gone.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Exhume" appears explicitly in paragraph four as Miren's goal and is enacted on the page: she enters the chamber, finds the whale's shadow, performs the ritual, and the memories emerge. The action redefines the opening premise (search → recovery → release). Major turn: exhumation succeeds but requires dispersal. Removing "exhume" and its enacted ritual breaks the causal spine. Setup, middle execution, closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coffee grounds divination is mentioned in paragraph five: Miren "tracked [the whale's] migratory patterns through patterns in coffee grounds left by sailors." The method is signaled early and shapes her off-page preparation (how she knew to come to this harbor). However, the on-page ritual does not use coffee grounds; the method enabled arrival but does not constrain the peak action. Functional but not indispensable to the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber is introduced in paragraph seven and occupies the entire ritual sequence. Its properties—walls encrusted with formations, hummed silence, thickened gravity, cracking crystals that release memories—are specific and irreplaceable. The chamber's mechanics enable the memory recovery and constrain Miren's movements. Removing this setting breaks the story's causal logic. Present in setup (descent), middle (ritual), and implicit in closure (the memories now dispersed originated here).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the whale beaches" is established in paragraph two (breached at midnight, Miren arrives at dawn) and bookends the piece (final paragraphs note the whale's body is gone, dragged by tides). The beaching creates the gravity disruption and makes the shadow accessible. The timing—dawn, morning shift arriving—tightens the window: she acts before full daylight when dockworkers return. The whale's removal by tides closes the opportunity. Present in setup, implicit pressure throughout, and noted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Miren's motivation—"to exhume something [the whale] had swallowed years ago: her sister's memories, deleted by the city archivists for treason"—is stated in paragraph four and drives every on-page choice: descent, ritual, release. The friction between want (recover memories) and cost (must release them to others) is dramatized in the ritual sequence. Her final act (dispersing the dust) and the closing lines ("she knew where to look") show the motivation transformed but persistent. Shapes setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" recurs three times: chamber description (paragraph eight), final memory residue (paragraph eighteen), and penultimate paragraph. The phrase is seeded early, modulates through the ritual (silence "hums," "exhales mist"), and charges the final image (silence "between flame and dawn" holding her sister's laughter). Tone is coherent—hushed, luminous, liminal—and intensifies at closure. Removing this tonal anchor would flatten the ending's resonance.</comment>
