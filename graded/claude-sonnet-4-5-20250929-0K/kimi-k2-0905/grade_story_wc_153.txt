<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to apologize to the brother is present and drives the journey, but interiority remains largely abstract and poetic rather than embodied. The medium makes no meaningful choices—she guides but does not face pressure or change. Emotional states are declared through metaphor ("pulse answered before I could") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final release of moths and the protagonist's walk home suggest change, but the cost feels symbolic rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—imagery and metaphor accumulate toward a reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the protagonist speaks the apology, letters transform to moths, path home appears), but cost remains largely metaphorical rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture or choice with visible consequence. Orientation anchors (mangrove labyrinth, protagonist + medium) arrive early. The Orientation Test penalty is waived; the pattern is taught and sustained. However, the accumulative pressure does not tighten meaningfully—beats feel like variations on a theme rather than escalation that narrows options or raises stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vivid and specific ("roots that never quite touched," "water that healed in moonlight"), and sensory detail is purposeful throughout. The gargoyle shard functions as a recurring object that charges the closure (transforms into mirror, then breath). Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff—it serves as backdrop and mood rather than shaping the protagonist's options under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (delivering the apology) is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate meaningfully—the journey proceeds without resistance, and the protagonist simply arrives, speaks, and is released. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the medium's guidance is smooth rather than contested. Agency at closure is minimal: the protagonist kneels and speaks, but the act feels granted rather than earned through struggle or sacrifice. Cost is symbolic (moths, healed lip) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters future options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (the cost and grace of delayed apology, the space before deciding) emerges organically from image and event without overt statement. The gargoyle shard, condensation messages, and moths form a coherent symbolic field. The final image—moths carrying syllables, brother waking to "come back whole"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the piece leans heavily on metaphor rather than grounding theme in a concrete moral calculus or choice with ambiguity. No competing interpretation or counter-reading is invited; the resolution feels emotionally tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and imagistic with a consistent elevated register. POV remains stable (single first-person). However, diction frequently inflates into decorative density that distances reader from immediacy ("fierce tenderness wrapped in barnacle," "syllable of the apology now spoken"). Filter verbs are minimal. Perceptual signature is poetic but not character-specific—the narrator's way of noticing reads as authorial lyricism rather than a mind under pressure. The medium has no distinct voice; she speaks in the same register as narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that obscures rather than propels. Mixed metaphors appear ("voice fierce tenderness wrapped in barnacle"). Paraphrase loops are frequent: "roots that never quite touched" echoed by "roots shifting like fingers letting go"; "healing in moonlight" repeated across beats without added pressure. Template cadence runs: several paragraphs open with "The medium [verb]" or "I [verb]." Clarity suffers under the decorative load, though grammar and tense remain consistent. These artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), triggering the upper penalty range and disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The frame (journeying to speak an unsent apology in a liminal space) is familiar; the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived specificity. Imagery (moths, condensation messages, moonlight) feels orchestrated for symbolic effect rather than arising from character need. The transformation test fails: the emotional arc and resolution would work with different setting tokens. The gargoyle shard is handled purposefully, but its mechanics (limestone-to-mirror) read as convenient rather than causally rooted. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece chooses median lyricism and avoids confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The medium appears early and recurs across beats, but makes no choices that create turns—she guides, instructs, gestures, and dissolves. Her actions enable the protagonist's journey but do not alter her own options or face pressure. She is functional but replaceable with any mystic guide archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gargoyle shard is introduced early, handled in multiple beats (pressed to sternum, becomes mirror, transforms into breath), and charges the final corridor sequence. Its transformation drives the peak moment. Removing it would require substantial rewrite. However, its mechanics (limestone-to-glass-to-breath) feel convenient rather than constrained by established rules, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unsent letters are present early (twenty-seven in pockets), return as transformed moths at closure, and frame the protagonist's goal. The concept shapes the dominant stake. However, the letters themselves are not handled on the page—they remain in pockets until they vanish and reappear as moths. The transformation is symbolic rather than causal; the letters do not constrain a middle choice or force a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" recurs (water, lip cut) but functions as atmospheric description rather than constraint. It does not enable or foreclose an action with visible cost. The phrase is lyric texture, not a mechanical trait that alters tactics. Swappable with other poetic motifs without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Evoke" appears in the condensation message and names the method of accessing the apology-space, but the protagonist does not perform an evocation ritual or make choices about how to evoke. The action is gestural (holding the shard toward the moon) rather than a multi-step process that shapes beats. Present and thematically resonant, but not causally indispensable—other verbs (summon, reveal) would function equivalently.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Messages in condensation appear twice: on the air-window ("evoke the instant you almost stayed") and in the brother's future waking moment ("come back whole"). The method is signaled and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. However, it does not shape the protagonist's attempts or constrain a middle choice. The condensation is atmospheric effect rather than mechanics that matter to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is established early, sustained across beats (singing spirits, roots, water), and supplies the corridor for the apology. Spatial detail is vivid and the setting charges the mood. However, it does not pressure choices—no path blocked, no danger, no tradeoff between routes. The labyrinth is postcard-plus-lyricism rather than an environment that alters tactics or constrains the protagonist's approach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"The space where an apology waits unspoken—the moment before deciding" frames the entire journey and is named explicitly in the medium's dialogue. The temporal concept is present early, recurs, and defines the closure beat (the protagonist enters that moment and speaks). The timeframe does not tighten decisions (no clock, no urgency), but it structures the narrative logic and makes the final act legible. Removing it would collapse thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The protagonist's desire to apologize is established immediately (pockets full of unsent letters, "could not name" the crime) and sustained through every beat. Motivation drives the journey and is tested in the kneeling moment. However, internal conflict is minimal—no dramatized friction between wanting forgiveness and fearing vulnerability. The protagonist proceeds without hesitation once the medium leads. Cost (moths, healed lip) is symbolic rather than a felt tradeoff between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is named twice (medium's voice, kiss to forehead) and modulates the tone throughout—both the mystical harshness and the emotional softness are present. The tone charges the final image (moths rising, brother waking). However, the phrase itself feels inserted rather than organic; the prose enacts lyricism and softness but does not consistently embody fierceness. The tonal balance is more declared than demonstrated through syntactic or imagistic pressure.</comment>
