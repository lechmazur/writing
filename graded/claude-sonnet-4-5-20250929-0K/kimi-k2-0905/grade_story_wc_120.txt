<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is dense with metaphor but lacks embodied micro-choices under pressure; she climbs, scratches, and conducts without visible internal conflict or trade-offs that foreclose paths. "Chronologically homesick" remains a poetic label rather than a dramatized contradiction that shapes on-page decisions. Emotions are asserted through ornate imagery ("ache," "exhaustion") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final collapse reads as exhaustion arriving on schedule, not a choice or renunciation earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test applied: who/where/when anchors arrive by line 2 (fortune cookie writer, glass spire, dawn, frozen lake), so no penalty. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—five memories scored onto glass accumulate toward a symphony—but the closure unit lacks legible cost: the nautilus crumbles, the horizon folds, and a child will someday hear the music, yet no on-page decision or renunciation forecloses a path with felt price. The piece offers a Conceptual Repricing gesture (home = the map she drew), but the cost remains conceptual shimmer rather than undeniable pressure. Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence in the final beat where a visible or felt price is paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass spire and frozen lake anchor the piece with vivid, selective detail (transparent stairs, mirrored horizon, frost feathers), and the spire functions as organ pipe in the final movement, charging the closure image. The nautilus shell serves as stylus and baton, constraining her method across beats. Micro-setting (body, shell, glass) drives the ritual, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography wavers—her position on the spire (climbing versus kneeling at apex) and the mechanics of "mapping" memories onto glass remain impressionistic rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conducting unheard symphonies by mapping childhood memories before exhaustion hits—is signaled early and the timeframe tightens (thirty minutes, fifteen minutes left). One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirrored horizon reflects tomorrow's exhausted face, urging her to hurry. Yet escalation relies on the clock and memory accumulation rather than protagonist agency narrowing options; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off with visible cost. The resolution (nautilus crumbles, horizon folds, symphony waits) lands as lyric inevitability rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—home as self-made map, unheard music as refuge from chronological homesickness—emerges from the spire ritual and memory motifs without overt moralizing. The fifth memory's fortune ("The mirror you seek is the memory you refuse") and the burned piano anchor thematic material in concrete particulars. The ending image (child finding the nautilus, hearing the dawn symphony) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the piece leans heavily on prompt-like abstractions ("conductor of unheard symphonies," "chronologically homesick") that hover at the edge of thematic echo; the final paragraph avoids explicit thesis but comes close with "the home she missed, folded inside the spiral."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a poetic, compression-heavy voice ("upturned hush," "palimpsest of birthdays," "sub-audible B-flat"). Perceptual signature is lyric and metaphor-dense but consistent. Distance control holds, though the narration occasionally drifts into convenient omniscience (claiming the lake "proved" it was a score, or that the nautilus "had waited since Devonian tides"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early, yet the density of figurative language in nearly every sentence flattens propulsion during high-pressure beats. Register remains elevated throughout; no filter-verb stacks or voice convergence, but also no modulation under stress—syntax stays ornate even when exhaustion hits.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "tuning fork," "palimpsest," "Devonian tides," "speaker cone," "tie-rod loosening," "batonless," stacked within beats without breathing room. Mixed metaphors cluster (the spire as tuning fork, organ pipe, speaker cone; the horizon as score, halo, and letter). Template-cadence runs appear in the memory sequence ("First memory...Second memory...Third memory...Fourth memory...Fifth memory") and movement structure ("First movement...Second movement...Third movement...Fourth movement"), reducing propulsion to checklist. Paraphrase loops: "the mirrored horizon" repeats seven times; "chronologically homesick" appears twice as ornament. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("batonless," "chronologically brave"), triggering the global 9+ disqualifier and high-band cap at 8.8 per Q7 artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—fortune cookie writer as conductor, nautilus as baton/stylus, glass spire as instrument, frozen lake as soundboard—offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The mirrored horizon device and the five-memory scoring ritual show structural ingenuity. However, the core frame echoes lyric-quest templates (artist climbs symbolic structure, performs ritual, leaves legacy for next generation) without transforming it through lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional specificity is present in the burned piano and fortune-loop motifs, yet the ornate diction and stacked metaphors tip toward decorative quirk rather than inevitable character logic. Transformation test borderline: swap "fortune cookie writer" for "composer" or "cartographer" and the arc holds with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cryptic fortune cookie writer is present in setup (opening line), middle (etching memories), and closure (conductor gesture, nautilus crumbling). Her occupation primes the fortune motif and the distillation method. However, her choices—climb, scratch, conduct—feel ritualistic rather than decision-driven; no on-page turn shows her altering tactics under pressure or paying a visible cost tied to being a fortune writer. The role shapes atmosphere but remains swappable with "composer" or "scribe" without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nautilus shell segment appears in setup (carried up), etches the clef, scores the chord, sings against crystal, serves as baton, and crumbles into sand in the closure beat—meeting the ≥2-beat test and closure participation gate. Its fractured edge and spiral chambers supply specific mechanics (stylus, conductor's tool). Causal pressure is moderate: the shell enables the ritual but does not constrain a difficult choice or impose visible cost. Irreplaceability is high—removing it breaks the scored-music device—but the shell's role remains instrumental rather than transformative of prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The mirrored horizon is present in setup ("the lake became...a mirrored horizon"), middle (reflects the clef upside-down, ripples showing tomorrow's face, parabolic curves as staff lines), and closure (folds into a line etched on her eyelids). It supplies the score metaphor and pressures her to hurry when it shows exhaustion. The concept shapes tactics (mapping faster) and charges the final image (portable horizon she can conduct anywhere). However, its mechanics remain metaphorical rather than constraint-driven; "mirrored" could swap for "translucent" or "resonant" horizon with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Chronologically homesick appears in the opening line (setup) and dissolves near closure ("the chronologically homesick ache dissolved"). The attribute is asserted as mood but does not constrain an on-page action or force a trade-off with visible cost. The label recurs without dramatized friction—no scene shows her rejecting present anchors or paying a price for temporal longing. Swappable with "nostalgic" or "displaced" without altering story logic. Cap at 4.6 for late (~80%) resolution of a problem it did not help create on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dawn anchors the timeframe (setup), provides the light that turns the lake into a mirrored horizon (middle), plays through the spire as the first movement (climax), and embeds in the child's future hearing (closure). The action shapes stakes (thirty minutes before exhaustion) and supplies the spire-as-organ-pipe mechanics. Major turns trace to dawn: the mirrored effect requires skimming sun, the dawnlight vibrates the glass. Irreplaceability is strong—swap for "sunset" or "noon" and the mirrored horizon and temporal urgency both weaken. Visible cost is indirect (exhaustion arrives as dawn completes) but the element drives two beats and anchors closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mapping childhood memories is signaled in the opening beat (setup: "thirty minutes to map childhood memories"), enacted across five etched memories (middle development), and resolved when "the map she had drawn was the home she missed" (closure). The method supplies the five-beat structure and the scored-glass mechanics. However, the "mapping" metaphor remains abstract—scratching images onto glass reads more as inscription than cartography—and the mechanics (how memories become music) stay impressionistic. The method enables the ritual but does not impose a difficult choice or visible cost tied to its specific constraints.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glass spire by a frozen lake is present in setup (opening line), middle (transparent stairs print ghosts, spire resonates, becomes organ pipe), and closure (spire dims, lake resumes reflection). The setting supplies spatial constraint (climbing under time pressure), the mirrored-horizon device (lake surface), and the acoustic payoff (spire as instrument, lake as soundboard). The glass material enables the etching ritual and the vibrational closure. Irreplaceability is high—remove the spire or lake and the scored-music conceit collapses. Causal pressure: the spire's apex is the target, the climb drains stamina, the glass conducts sound. Visible cost: exhaustion hits as the ritual completes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "before exhaustion hits" is signaled in setup ("thirty minutes before exhaustion hit"), tracked at midpoint ("Fifteen minutes left"), and arrives on-page at closure ("Exhaustion hit; she lay on the glass floor"). The clock tightens decisions (she hurries after seeing tomorrow's exhausted face) and shapes the five-memory pacing. However, the time pressure remains atmospheric rather than forcing a visible trade-off—no beat shows her cutting a memory short or sacrificing detail to beat the deadline. The timeframe is coherent and tracked but does not alter tactics with legible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to become the conductor of unheard symphonies appears in setup (fourth memory: "the reason she wanted to become"), middle (she raises her hands as conductor), and closure ("a new symphony waited, batonless"). The desire primes the glass-organ ritual and the music motifs. However, the want is told-only in the fourth memory and not dramatized as a conflicted choice—no beat shows her sacrificing an alternative path or paying a relational/opportunity cost to pursue conducting. The motivation frames the ritual but remains swappable with "to compose" or "to preserve" without structural impact. Cap at 4.6 for no middle-beat constraint with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Upturned hush appears in setup ("the upturned hush of the sky urged her on"), recurs at closure ("inside the upturned hush a new symphony waited"), and modulates subtly (held breath, silence so complete it rang, fourth movement's ringing silence). The tone is coherent through memory accumulation and supports the quiet, lyric register. However, the phrase remains ornamental—"upturned" does not constrain action or shift meaning under pressure. The hush charges the final image but could swap for "suspended quiet" or "expectant stillness" with minor loss. Lyric reprise (first third → last line) elevates the score into the 6.0–6.3 range per the allowance, but no middle-beat pressure tied to tone.</comment>
