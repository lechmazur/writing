<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and embodied (the wincing gull, the spatula work), and her professional pivot to "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" motivates the note-insertion ritual. The two embedded confessions hint at personal history but never dramatize the prior relationship on-page, so the emotional cost remains asserted rather than tested. Her final act of walking away "already imagining future scholars" reads as anticipation rather than renunciation with visible sacrifice. Internal contradiction is present (certifying what will stand versus cataloging what was abandoned) but does not force a choice that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara descends, inserts notes into three locations (fissure, altar hollow, dome void), and ascends, with each insertion deepening the ritual's symbolic weight. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of future scholars "coring through repaired stone" reweights her surveyor role from diagnostic to memorial—and the cost is conceptual (her professional report now smuggles grief). Orientation anchors quickly (granite coping, drawbridge, lagoon). One meaningful tightening occurs at the dome's "circular void" where she writes directly on stone, and the walk inland without looking back closes the arc. The cost is felt but oblique; the report she owes the engineers is mentioned but never shown altering her tactics or creating friction on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered (slick granite, rusted chandelier chains, Corinthian columns, porous stone) and the water lapping her ankles constrains movement. The descending ladder, wet marble steps, and spatial choreography remain coherent throughout. The central dome's "circular void where the keystone should have been" directly enables the climactic inscription and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's professional attention (hydraulic lime, steel spatula) and her emotional state (censers that "forgot their prayers").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting the pavilion while smuggling personal memory into its repairs—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the ritual's three stages (fissure, altar, dome), each location accepting a deeper confession. The scheduled tide and engineers' expectation create external constraint, though no on-page moment dramatizes a conflict between her official duty and her clandestine method. The final ascent forecloses the ritual (she caps the inkwell "lighter by exactly the amount of a confession") with visible symbolic cost, and her decision to walk without looking back completes the renunciation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (the dome inscription written directly on stone) is sufficient, but the absence of a live choice between competing goods holds the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: separation as foundation, absence as presence, and the act of memorializing what others abandon. The pavilion's missing keystone becomes an "eye staring upward," the confession notes are "sutures," and the final image of future scholars discovering her fragments answers the central question without stating a moral. The interlaced absence motif drives the method (placing words in cracks) and the ending reweights her surveyor role from certifier to elegist. No thematic echo or label-speak in the final paragraph; the piece trusts image and ritual to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: professional vocabulary (hydraulic lime, coring, steel spatula) blends with lyric compression ("constellations," "censers that had forgotten their prayers"). Diction remains within Mara's plausible register, though occasional elevated metaphors ("thread made of light," "anxious tessellations") edge toward ornament without undermining voice coherence. No dialogue present. Under peak moments (the dome inscription, the final walk) syntax compresses appropriately and the narrator's texture stays consistent. Brief register drift into abstract lyricism ("interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") is pattern-taught and legible, though the metaphor density in the middle third risks slowing the beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere and ritual. However, figurative language saturates many lines without consistent payoff: "blaze so hushed it burned only in the mind," "anxious tessellations," "bittersweet lozenge," "thread made of light" cluster in the middle third, creating ornamental drag. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the metaphor stack in high-pressure beats (the dome scene) applies −0.5. Sentence openings vary, spatial choreography is clean, and the final line recharges the opening image economically. Grammar and tense are consistent; pronoun references clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—surveyor as elegist, inscribing confessions into structural repairs—offers a fresh synthesis of occupation and ritual. The interlaced absence concept is specific to this world (submerged pavilion, missing tiles revealing "the ghost of the next") and the note-insertion method transforms the surveyor trope into memorial act. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality; the confessions ("You loved me only when the band played waltzes") are particular rather than generic. Risk-taking in lyric density and the circular structure (coping to coping) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on Mara's specific role and the pavilion's literal and symbolic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, and her decisions drive all three note-placements (fissure, altar, dome) plus the final walk inland. Setup: paragraph one. Development: each insertion is a micro-choice that narrows options (sealing words into stone forecloses retrieval). Payoff: the final walk and the image of future scholars discovering her work depend on her agency. Causal pressure is strong; the ritual would not exist without her surveyor expertise repurposed. Cost: she risks her professional reputation and walks away from the pavilion without documenting its official condition. All three gates present; beat involvement across three distinct locations; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The inkwell is clipped inside her coat (paragraph two), uncapped to release one drop into the lagoon (paragraph six), fully uncapped at the dome for direct inscription (paragraph seventeen), and closed "lighter by exactly the amount of a confession" (final paragraph). Setup early; development in the lagoon offering and dome inscription; payoff in the final weight metaphor. Specificity: "antique," "silver cap blackened by generations," "midnight ink"—irreplaceable properties. Beat involvement: three distinct uses. Closure linkage: the lightness metaphor charges the final walk. Cost: the spent ink literalizes the confessions' permanence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Interlaced absence is named explicitly (paragraph three: "absence was not empty but interlaced: every missing tile or vanished balcony revealed the ghost of the next") and structures Mara's method—she reads hollows as code, inserts notes into cracks, and finds the dome's missing keystone. Setup: paragraph three. Development: the three insertions enact the concept (placing presence into absence). Payoff: the final image of scholars "coring through repaired stone" and the pavilion's "circular void" eye. The concept shapes her interpretive lens and the ritual's logic, though it is articulated more as theme than as a tactical constraint that alters her moves on the page. Cost connection: oblique; the concept justifies the method but does not impose a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stoically sensitive is stated in paragraph four ("spoke little, yet when a gull cried she winced as if the sound had come from inside her own chest") and enacted in the communion moment (paragraph eighteen: "stoically sensitive communion" when she presses her palm to stone). Setup present; the trait appears again at closure, but it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost—it colors perception without forcing a tradeoff. The wincing and the palm-press are embodied but do not narrow options. Mid-band placement: functional reprise but no visible leverage or price tied to the trait's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Wrest appears three times: paragraph ten ("wrest from its socket a clot of lake-grass"), paragraph thirteen ("wrested abandoned dreams into permanence"), and implicitly in the prying/sealing ritual. Setup: paragraph ten. Development: the action is the method by which she opens fissures and inserts notes—physical force that literalizes excavation of memory. Payoff: paragraph twenty-one's "wrested" charges the final image of future scholars. The verb is specific and action-linked, but it is shared with the broader repair method; removing "wrest" and substituting "extracted" or "pried" would not break story logic. Two beats; closure linkage via echo; causal role moderate. Cost: the physical effort and the permanence of sealing carry symbolic weight but are not foregrounded as a tactical price.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Placing notes in foundation repairs is named in paragraph ten ("method she had chosen for this clandestine survey was placing notes in foundation repairs, smuggling memory into the very wounds she documented") and executed in three beats: fissure (paragraph eleven), altar hollow (paragraph thirteen), and dome direct inscription (paragraph seventeen). Setup: paragraph ten. Development: the method shapes all three insertions and the hydraulic lime sealing. Payoff: the final image of scholars "coring through repaired stone, finding her fragments" depends entirely on this method. Irreplaceable: no substitute method (e.g., leaving loose papers, surface graffiti) would create the same permanence and discovery stakes. All three gates; strong causal pressure; closure indispensable. Cost: she violates her surveyor's duty and risks future misinterpretation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is present from paragraph one (drawbridge, lagoon skin, arches, moonlit ribs) and supplies all spatial resources: the service ladder descent (paragraph five), wet marble steps, the nave with rusted chains (paragraph nine), Corinthian columns for the fissure (paragraph ten), the altar (paragraph twelve), and the central dome with the missing keystone (paragraph sixteen). Setup: paragraph one. Development: each architectural feature enables a note-insertion beat; the water lapping her ankles constrains movement. Payoff: the dome's "circular void" is the climactic inscription site, and the final ascent depends on the ladder and coping. Specificity: "lovers' rotunda," "chandeliers once sparkled," porous stone that "absorbs the heat of her skin." All three gates; irreplaceable setting; multiple beats; closure linkage clear. Cost: the scheduled tide and her clandestine survey risk the pavilion's official assessment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe is anchored in paragraph one ("the moment after the drawbridge rose") and bookended in paragraph nineteen ("Before the bridge could lower again"). Setup: early. Development: the scheduled tide (paragraph eight: "Tonight's tide was a scheduled betrayal") creates urgency, but elapsed time is not tracked beat-by-beat and no on-page choice is accelerated or altered by the ticking clock. Payoff: Mara emerges "before the bridge could lower," satisfying the frame. The timeframe is present and coherent but does not tighten decisions or force tradeoffs; swapping "after the drawbridge rises" for "during low tide" would require only minor edits. Functional but replaceable; no visible cost tied to the timeframe's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is stated in paragraph seven ("she wanted instead to become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams, to catalog the hopes people left behind when they fled sinking districts") and dramatized through the three note-insertions and the final walk. Setup: paragraph seven. Development: each confession she inserts (waltzes, swimming) enacts the archaeology of loss. Payoff: the final image of future scholars discovering her fragments completes the role transformation. The desire is coherent and contested (she was "the city's most trusted recorder" but "grew weary of certifying what would stand"), though the friction between her official duty and her clandestine method is told more than tested on the page. Two beats; closure linkage strong; cost oblique (professional reputation at risk). All three gates; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hushed blaze appears explicitly in paragraph fourteen ("each sealed fissure a blaze so hushed it burned only in the mind") and tonally throughout: quiet ritual (crouching, prying, sealing) charged with emotional intensity (midnight ink, bittersweet lozenge, communion). Setup: paragraph five's "echoing like a dropped coin" and the canal's "hushed" arches. Development: the oxymoron governs diction—restrained action with lyric metaphor density. Payoff: paragraph twenty-one's "hushed blaze of a drowned pavilion" reprises the phrase and charges the final image. The tone modulates with pressure (calm descent, intensifying confessions, resolute walk) without breaking coherence. Closure linkage clear; specificity high. Cost: the tone's compression risks ornamental drift (see Q7), but it does not obscure clarity. All three gates; strong reprise; irreplaceable tonal signature.</comment>
