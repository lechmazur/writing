<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's characterization relies heavily on her role as "quietly deliberate budding rune scholar" but her interiority remains thin—most beats show her performing scholarly actions rather than revealing contradictory impulses under pressure. The key moment where she trades her wandering silhouette feels unmotivated; we never see her wrestle with the cost of this choice on the page, only a retrospective summary. The embodied emotion is sparse: "holding her breath" and lifting her hand are the primary physical anchors across the entire arc. Her final choice to seal the awakening reads as plot-dictated rather than character-driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The closure unit—shadows rushing back and Lyra's trade—lands on the page with cost, and the piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens through its layered imagery and spiraling structure. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when coalesce only after the opening's world-rule exposition, but the mosaic pattern excuses some drift. The causal chain is present but diffuse: the automaton's activation triggers the resolution, yet Lyra's agency in "closing loops" reads more metaphorical than mechanically clear, softening the escalation. The cost—her wandering silhouette exchanged—is stated but not felt in a decisive beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory, orrery floor, and automaton are vividly rendered and constrain Lyra's choices: she must align celestial rings and physically engage the key. The sundial casting moonshadows charges the closure image with purposeful impossibility. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through scholarly attention—brass, glass, mirrors—though the piece leans visual and neglects sound, touch, and temperature during high-pressure beats. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where shadows go—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation under the accumulative lens is gentle rather than tightening: Lyra's moves (setting rings, inserting key, winding backward) are sequential steps without visible friction or forced trade-offs. The reversal when her shadow waves goodbye and vanishes is evocative but does not narrow her options; she proceeds methodically. The cost of trading her shadow is declared in summary ("traded her wandering silhouette") rather than dramatized as a live choice with on-page hesitation or loss.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through imagery—sealed awakenings, loops, shadows as "love bent into shape by light"—and the final note about remembering what absence teaches offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The recurring motif of closing loops accumulates pressure and reweights at the ending. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic statement ("every shadow is only love bent…") and "relearn the world, first close the circle of your own leaving" risks sermonizing. The core question about loss and return is earned through scene work, but the articulation at closure flirts with abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lyra; psychic distance is consistent and the narrative voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into stock lyricism—"star-threaded dome," "silk scarves pulled by invisible hands," "looms"—that flatten rather than individuate her scholarly perspective. The prose under pressure remains ornate rather than compressing: "State epoch" / "Third cycle after spoons bent reality" is crisp, but surrounding beats layer metaphor without acceleration. No dialogue beyond the automaton's single exchange, so voice distinction is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose is polished and largely free of grammatical errors, but figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence in the opening third carries metaphor or ornament, blurring momentum. "Spoons had bent reality, leaving time creased like crumpled parchment" and "the angle of a shadow disappearing at noon" stack without breathing room. Template cadence appears in the closure sequence: "The automaton slumped… Lyra stepped… She lifted… In the hush, she whispered…" uses parallel stems across four consecutive beats. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the overwriting and ornamental layering dull propulsion in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—spoons bending reality, shadows fleeing at noon—is inventive and the floating observatory orrery is a fresh synthesis. The "sealed awakening" rune and Möbius-band dome offer non-obvious detail. However, the resolution relies on late-introduced metaphysics (mirrors reflecting nothing, automaton chest as void) that feel convenient rather than inevitable. The emotional truth—losing part of oneself unknowingly—is universal but rendered through fantastical abstractions that keep it at arm's length. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but the final image's conceptual leap (trading her shadow to restore others') arrives without prior dramatic groundwork.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and her choices—setting rings, inserting the key, winding backward, placing the key in her shadow's hands—drive the sequence. She appears in the setup, enacts the middle investigation, and completes the closure. However, her choices feel procedural rather than conflicted: each step follows logically without visible cost or hesitation until the retrospective summary of her trade. The character shapes the arc but does not create turns through internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key is introduced early (first paragraph), used in at least three distinct beats (wedged in astrolabe, inserted into automaton, wound backward, placed in shadow's hands), and its rune ᚦ charges the closure when it flares and fuses. The key's function—unlocking the automaton and sealing the awakening—is causally essential. Removing it would break the mechanics of the resolution. It qualifies for high integration, though its exact properties (why this key, why ᚦ) remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" is named in the rune ᚦ and frames the ending ("some awakenings must be sealed before they can be safely opened"), shaping Lyra's method and the story's thematic closure. However, the concept is more thematic than tactical: it does not constrain her choices in the middle beats or force trade-offs on the page. It reweights the ending image but does not alter her options during escalation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is stated in the opening paragraph and echoed in the final lines ("their shadows would be waiting, patient… quietly deliberate"). On the page, Lyra's actions are methodical but the trait is not tested: no moment forces her to choose between haste and care, and no cost is tied to her deliberation. The attribute is label-only and does not constrain an on-page choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Relearn" appears in the opening ("to relearn what the bending of spoons had unlearned") and in the visitor's note ("To relearn the world, first close the circle"). It frames the quest and thematic arc, but the actual mechanics—closing loops, winding the key—could proceed without the "relearn" frame with minor edits. The action is thematic rather than causal; it shapes interpretation more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is signaled in the orrery's interlocking rings, demonstrated when Lyra sets them to rotate backward, and articulated explicitly ("by closing loops she must walk the circumference of the twist"). The method shapes her approach—aligning rings, winding the key backward—and the ending depends on the loop closure ("the loops closed: island, scholar, automaton, shadow"). The mechanics are somewhat abstract (what "closing" means operationally is vague), but the method drives the resolution and is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle provides the orrery floor that Lyra manipulates, the dome shutters that form the Möbius band, and the spatial anchor for the entire sequence. It is introduced immediately, used throughout, and shapes the ending ("the floating isle began to descend"). The setting is causally active rather than decorative. However, many of the specific details—star-threaded dome, transit telescope—are ornamental; the core functionality (orrery + dome spiral) is what matters.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After spoons bent reality" is the explicit timeframe and "thirty days" of missing shadows is named, but the temporal pressure is retrospective rather than live. Lyra is not racing a clock; the shadows have been gone, and her investigation proceeds without urgency. The timeframe provides world-context but does not tighten her decisions or alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation—to find where shadows go at noon—is stated early and drives her presence at the observatory and her engagement with the automaton. The quest is dramatized through her actions (tracing the key, setting the rings, following her shadow into the void). However, internal conflict is minimal: we do not see her wrestle with the cost of the search or friction between this desire and another need. The motivation is clear and sustained but not conflicted on the page.</comment>
