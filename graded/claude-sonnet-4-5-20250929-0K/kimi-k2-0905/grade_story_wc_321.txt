<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arden's motivation to anchor the ferry and save the passengers is clear, but interiority leans heavily on metaphoric declaration ("slipping sideways," "resiliently positive grin") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to merge timelines arrives through the hourglass mechanism rather than dramatized internal conflict between competing impulses. Micro-choices exist (steering patterns, flipping the hourglass twice) but the renunciation or cost feels more asserted than felt—"the pourer must choose which" is told, not shown through a visible forfeiture that narrows his options. The character reads consistent and the arc lands, but the peak beat lacks the visceral trade-off that would elevate it into high 7s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph; the grotto arrival and radio contact establish clear before/after markers. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the ferry solidifies, passengers return, and Arden steps into "one coherent tomorrow" with brass caps as a token of saved possibilities—visible cost in the crumbled hourglass and the weight of choosing which timeline to pour. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: patterns (barnacle coordinates, radio rhythms, hourglass mechanics) build density until the final image reweights the transient life as a permanent, coherent choice. One meaningful deepening occurs when the radio voice warns "only half here" and Arden acts on that cue. Minor causality slip: the grotto's closing pressure and the hourglass's heat arrive suddenly without prior signal, slightly softening the turn's motivation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The spectral grotto—phosphorescent barnacles, knitting stalactites, two skies stitched by auroral thread—constrains Arden's steering choices and charges the closure when it parts to reveal the merged sky. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (chrome radio ice-cold, coffee machine gurgling, glass dust settling like frost), filtered through Arden's urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear: ferry rail flickering starboard/portside, passengers on benches, Arden at helm then bow. The grotto functions as micro-setting that alters tactics (steering via barnacle patterns) and directly shapes the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor slip: the dock and open water at the end lack the same textural density, softening the landing slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the vanishing ferry and its passengers—is signaled early and tightens when the radio warns "only half here" and the grotto begins closing. Arden's agency drives escalation: he speaks coordinates, steers via patterns, and flips the hourglass twice to reverse the flow, each move narrowing options under accumulative pressure. The cost is legible on-page: the hourglass crumbles, the grotto closes, and Arden must pour one timeline into the other, forgoing the alternate path. One meaningful deepening occurs when passengers flicker and Arden's motivation crystallizes: "if he could anchor the ferry... he could step off at a dock that remembered his name." The resolution hinges on protagonist choice with visible consequence (solidified ferry, crumbled hourglass), meeting the lens and cost tests cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—embracing transience as permanence, choosing coherence over multiplicity—emerges from the ferry's flickering state, the hourglass's mechanics, and Arden's final acceptance of "permanent transient life." The brass caps in his pocket carry the weight of saved possibilities without stating a moral; the image of two skies stitched together and the phrase "every rotation of the earth was now another ferry ride between what was and what still could be" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the radio's layered heartbeats, the spectral commuters, and Arden's refusal-laughter that multiplies off grotto walls. Minor slip: "slipping sideways" and "resiliently positive" are slightly over-articulated as thematic flags in the opening, reducing the work's implicit charge. The ending reweights prior material (hourglass dust, radio silence, dawn lifting) without summary, meeting the 9+ test with a hairline proximity to prompt language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; Arden's perceptual signature—humming off-key, grinning sideways, pocketing the brass caps—remains consistent and character-particular. Diction is purposeful and distinct: "the wake spread in slow motion spirals," "the moon dripped like melting silver," "a choir of refusal." No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during hourglass handling, slightly pulled back for the final image). Minor register drift: "Morse of lives almost lived" and "auroral thread" read slightly elevated for a deckhand's internal texture, though they remain legible and voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or quote mechanic issues. The prose rhythm tightens during the steering sequence and breathes at the bow, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid, but figurative density is high across most beats—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile (moon dripping, barnacles spelling coordinates, hourglass filling with constellation, frost that chose to stay). In the grotto climax, "stalactites knitting together like fingers after prayer" and "starlight thinned to a wire" stack within two lines, slightly dulling immediacy. Paraphrase loop: "the ferry felt entire, a single arrow pointing toward one coherent tomorrow" followed by "the grotto was gone; only open water and a horizon that kept its promises remained" restates closure satisfaction without advancing image. No scaffold or template cadence; information density is high. Clarity remains intact, but the cumulative figurative load in peak beats triggers a −0.4 penalty under the Overwriting Check (density test). Propulsion is steady; no loops obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—vanishing ferry + timeline-merging hourglass + spectral grotto navigation—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock portal-fantasy mechanics by grounding choice in steering patterns and radio feedback. The "resiliently positive" deckhand choosing permanence within transience offers fresh emotional calculus. The hourglass mechanics (empty yet filling with constellation, crumbling to frost-like dust) and the radio broadcasting his own voice are distinct inflections. Minor proximity concern: the hourglass-as-timeline-tool and "merge parallel timelines" motivation read close to familiar time-travel templates; transformation arises from the ferry's half-solid state and Arden's navigational agency rather than mere discovery. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (passengers solidify, engines catch, brass caps remain) without retreat. Risk-taking in the lyric density and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a +0.2 within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Arden drives all key turns: speaks barnacle coordinates, steers via patterns, flips the hourglass twice, and broadcasts the merge command. Present from the opening and active in the closure (steps to bow, pockets brass caps, tightens cap). His choices narrow options under pressure and carry visible cost (crumbled hourglass, forfeited alternate timeline). Setup + development + payoff all present; causal pressure and closure linkage strong; irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hourglass appears in paragraph 4 (found floating after engines failed), is handled/flipped in paragraphs 13 and 21, burns hot in paragraph 18, crumbles in paragraph 23, and its brass caps are pocketed in paragraph 27. It enables the timeline merge and its destruction marks the cost. Setup + development + payoff; three distinct beats; causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Highly specific (empty but filling with constellation; crumbles to frost-like dust), approaching indispensable but not quite—another mechanism could theoretically serve, so capped just below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry ("slipping sideways," hull flickering, passengers guttering out) frames the dominant stake and shapes all tactics: Arden must anchor it before it fully disappears. Present from paragraph 2, pressures every beat (half-transparent rail, grotto closing, timeline knitting), and resolves at closure (engines catch, passengers solidify, ferry feels entire). Setup + development + payoff; irreplaceability high—removing the vanishing premise collapses the story's logic and Arden's motivation entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arden's "resiliently positive" trait appears early (paragraph 3 grin, paragraph 20 laughter as "choir of refusal," paragraph 29 "smiled sideways") and arguably enables his persistence through the merge attempt. However, it functions more as character coloring than a constraint with visible cost—no moment shows the trait forcing a costly trade-off or limiting his options under pressure. Setup + payoff present (opening grin, closing sideways smile), but middle development is thin. Lyric reprise reweights slightly, but lack of dramatized friction keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The radio surfaces in paragraph 8 (Arden speaks coordinates), paragraph 9 (static resolves to his own voice warning), paragraph 14 (broadcasts layered heartbeats), paragraph 21 (Arden broadcasts merge command), paragraph 26 (whispers thanks, falls silent). It enables the key turn (warning "only half here"), guides tactics (heartbeat rhythm steering), and participates in closure (whispers thanks). Setup + development + payoff; three beats; causal pressure and closure linkage solid. Specific (chrome ice-cold, Arden's own voice from three months ago), but theoretically another device could serve, so just below indispensable threshold.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Interconnected patterns—barnacle coordinates, radio heartbeat rhythm, hourglass constellation—are signaled in paragraph 7 ("phosphorescent barnacles traced interconnected patterns") and shape tactics throughout: steering via patterns (paragraph 15), rhythm-based maneuvers (paragraph 15), timeline knitting like cables (paragraph 22). The method is present at setup, drives middle attempts, and contributes to closure (timelines knit, two skies stitch). Causal pressure solid; specificity high (hard port for two beats, steady for three). Development could be slightly clearer—mechanics are poetic rather than legible—but the method is integral to how Arden succeeds.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The spectral grotto (paragraph 6 arrival, paragraph 7 barnacle patterns, paragraph 17 stalactites knitting, paragraph 22 roof parting, paragraph 27 gone) supplies the coordinates Arden needs, closes to impose time pressure, and parts at closure to reveal the merged sky. Setup + development + payoff; two distinct pressure beats; closure linkage strong (parting reveals two skies stitched). Micro-setting that alters tactics (steering via barnacle language) and charges the final image. Highly specific (phosphorescent barnacles, knitting stalactites, auroral thread), approaching indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Clocks running sideways appears in paragraph 3 and is reprised in paragraph 28 ("clocks righted themselves"). The timeframe colors the atmosphere and marks the before/after transition, but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page—Arden's choices are driven by grotto closure and hourglass mechanics, not a ticking clock. Setup + payoff present, but no middle development that constrains action. Lyric reprise reweights slightly (sideways → righted), but lacks the live-clock pressure that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Arden's motivation to merge parallel timelines is stated in paragraph 12 ("if he could anchor the ferry in both timelines at once... he could step off at a dock that remembered his name"), drives all subsequent choices (flipping hourglass, steering, broadcasting merge), and resolves at closure (ferry solidifies, timelines merge, Arden steps to bow). Setup + development + payoff; causal pressure strong; closure linkage undeniable. Friction exists (must choose which timeline to pour, hourglass burns hot), though cost is more felt than dramatized in dialogue or internal conflict. Desire is clear and shapes every beat, meeting high integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Permanent transient tone—humming off-key on an empty ferry, "slipping sideways," "permanent transient life," "another ferry ride between what was and what still could be"—is introduced early and charges the final image when Arden accepts coherence within flux. Tone modulates appropriately (urgency in grotto, calm at bow) and supports the theme without stasis. Setup + payoff strong; middle development is atmospheric rather than pressure-driving. The phrase "permanent transient" recurs explicitly in paragraph 25, reweighting the stake, but the tone itself does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off, keeping it mid-6s rather than higher.</comment>
