<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is concrete and embodied—"heart tugged harder than gravity," the scrimshaw heating against her skin—and her final choice to release the carving carries visible cost. However, the motivational arc leans heavily on Brine Jack's abstracted legacy and the whale's call rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The shift from guarded to open feels more declared than earned through on-page friction between competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the island detaching, the whale's call, and Lira's sung response build density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the community chooses to follow the whale-song rather than anchor to violent ground. The cost—releasing the old ground and Brine Jack's legacy—is legible in the sinking scrimshaw and the dissolution of "the old ground." Orientation is clear early (Lira at the pier, post-gunpowder transformation), and the closure reweights prior material without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail—"breathing rocks," "starved lichens," barnacled ladder—and the whale's call vibrates "through sole and soul," constraining Lira's final choice to engage the ocean on embodied terms. The scrimshaw as micro-object charges the closure image when she releases it. Spatial choreography remains clear across the raft assembly, and the setting subtly mirrors the thematic shift from violence to tenderness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the island and its people will vanish into the sea or find a new form—is signaled early and tightens when Lira realizes "the island would only stay for those who chose its next shape." Her sung declaration and the community's choice to push the fragments into a raft spiral narrows options and forecloses the path of decay. The whale's arrival complicates rather than resolves, and Lira's agency (singing, releasing the scrimshaw) drives the turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the scrimshaw's carved lovers, the detaching timbers, the sung refrain that bridges lullaby and war cry. The final act—releasing bone back to bone—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to live after violence without stating a moral. The image of "combative tenderness made audible" avoids abstraction and charges the closure with earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable and the perceptual signature is strong—Lira filters the world through dock-worker physicality ("coiling hawsers instead of fists") and the scrimshaw's tactile charge. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with her background: "impotent," "cetacean choir," and "unmarked map the whale etched" read more literary than lived-in. Free indirect style is clean, and the voice modulates purposefully under pressure, but the register drift in peak beats nudges the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated image—which risks overwriting in a high-pressure narrative. Mixed metaphors appear: "houses creaked free, drifting like swans bred from violence now impotent" conflates breeding, impotence, and swan-flight incoherently. Paraphrase loops surface: "detach," she urged, not from land but from the myth" closely restates the prior line's meaning. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("She thought of... of... of...") and the final third's exposition ("Around her, others laughed, argued, kissed—freedom raw and alive") stalls momentum. Information density is strong, but clarity suffers under the figurative load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-violence island detachment and whale-song navigation is specific and non-obvious, transforming the "leaving home" trope through the scrimshaw's dual symbolism and the community's participatory raft-building. The final image—bone returned to bone—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and the lack of a set-piece confrontation heightens stakes without obscuring closure, earning a modest within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout, and her choices—descending to the fringe, singing, releasing the scrimshaw—create key turns. Her decision to "teach them to dive" and guide the raft assembly drives the middle and closure beats. Removing her agency would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears early, heats during Lira's descent, unlocks memories in the middle beat, and is released into the sea at closure with visible cost ("offering bone back to bone"). Its carved imagery ("lovers embracing inside a whale's rib") charges the thematic resolution and its physical release finalizes the detachment from Brine Jack's legacy.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The disappearing island is the engine of stakes: "the island itself began to detach, one street at a time" forces Lira's choice, and the community's decision to guide the floating fragments into a raft spiral resolves the central conflict. The island's final root-snap and ground dissolution directly shape the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unlocking guarded hearts" is present in the scrimshaw's function ("unlocking memories she never lived") and Lira's declaration ("I'm your exit wound"), but it remains more thematic claim than on-page constraint with visible cost. The final line—"unlocking the final guarded heart—the ocean's"—is asserted rather than dramatized, weakening causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Detach" is signaled early as the island begins to lift, recurs in Lira's urging ("Detach... not from land but from the myth"), and drives the raft assembly. The final root-snap completes the detachment with visible consequence. Swapping "detach" for "release" or "let go" would require substantial rewrites of the thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whale's call is foreshadowed through the scrimshaw's whale motif, arrives at the midpoint ("low, ancient, mournful"), and shapes Lira's sung response and the community's participation. The call's mechanics—vibration through sole and soul—matter on the page, and the raft follows "the cetacean choir" at closure. Removing the whale-call would eliminate the story's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is anchored early with specific detail ("tide barely high enough to cover the scars") and pressures Lira's embodied descent ("waves slapping her calves like impatient trainers"). The setting's tidal threshold enables the community's choice to step into the shallows and constrains the raft assembly. Micro-setting detail (barnacled ladder, breathing rocks) alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after violence becomes impossible"—is established in the opening line ("the morning after the last gunpowder fizzled into salt") and frames the entire premise. However, it functions more as static backdrop than live clock; no tightening countdown or escalating urgency directly tied to "after violence" shapes Lira's decisions in real time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to "find freedom in embracing one's true nature" is present in her refusal to let the island leave her and her final declaration of "true nature no longer a destination but a horizon." However, it is more told than dramatized through conflicted choices; the friction between guarded past and open future is asserted ("tenderness without danger felt foreign") rather than tested on the page with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is coherent throughout: Lira's voice is "pitched between lullaby and war cry," the scrimshaw's lovers embrace inside a whale's rib (violence framing gentleness), and the community's final laughter and argument embody "freedom raw and alive." The tone modulates with pressure—initially guarded, then sung open—and charges the closure image without flattening into static lyricism.</comment>
