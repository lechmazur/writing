<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are clear and layered—grief over her brother and career pressures drive her to seek silence and validation. Her internal contradiction between cosmic detachment and personal pain is embodied through concrete actions (the forceps, the slide, the refusal to flee the storm). The protagonist's agency is visible: she chooses to stay, to work, to let the storm wait, and by the end accepts rather than outruns change. Minor issue: the brother's death is mentioned only once without subsequent friction, reducing its weight on present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing: Mara relinquishes her "frantic pulses of grief" and chooses to watch the storm arrive "minute by minute, scale by scale," forecloses the flight impulse with visible cost (acceptance of ongoing loss), and the final image ("drama is optional; change is not") reweights the premise. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through repeated imagery (dust, scales, decay, storm) until the convergence ping and rain-shift crystallize the stance. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when the algorithm validates her "heresy," narrowing her emotional options and enabling the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse constrains Mara's work (humidity, glass shards, failing lights, encroaching rain) and charges the closure: the "slow collapse" of metal and mold mirrors her acceptance of gradual change. The butterfly wing fragment, forceps, and synchrotron function as micro-setting that shapes tactical choices (kneeling, headlamp work, sealing the slide). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (rotting orchids, galvanized steel, cobalt fire through storm holes). Minor note: the upland lab is named but not used, a small anchor without payoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: validate the algorithm to translate cosmic and human timescales, which Mara frames as "strip needless drama." One meaningful tightening occurs when the synchrotron pings convergence, narrowing her emotional options and forcing the choice to accept rather than outrun grief. The storm and failing equipment raise external pressure; her decision to ignore imminent danger and continue working demonstrates agency under stress. The cost is legible: she relinquishes the urge to escape and accepts "ongoing becoming" with its attendant vulnerability. No reversals, but the Accumulative lens accommodates this as a deepening rather than a turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—gradual change as patient, universal process—emerges through butterfly-wing accretion, neutron-star decay, greenhouse collapse, and Mara's grief, never stated as thesis. The final image ("drama is optional; change is not") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the title "Strip Needless Drama" and Mara's laugh at 03:17 ("more exhale than emotion"). The convergence of local and cosmic timelines reweights the premise with conceptual cost: her professional heresy becomes personal acceptance, and the greenhouse's "courtesy" reframes decay as neither punishment nor blessing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; narrative certainty matches Mara's expertise (synchrotron mechanics, PSR notation) and grief-colored perception ("kindled humility," "guilty conscience" humidity). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices molecular accretion, pulsar curves, and "dust patterns" while filtering out human drama. Diction remains controlled except for one slip: "strip needless drama" in the proposal context reads slightly meta, though it recovers as her private title. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the convergence ping, pulled back for the greenhouse's patient collapse). No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies effectively ("At 03:17 the synchrotron pinged: convergence achieved" breaks longer cadences). Minor loop: "kindled humility" appears twice without reweighting. Template stem appears in mid-section ("She breathed... She lifted... She brushed... She watched") across four consecutive actions, creating a brief monotony (−0.4). Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled; "dance partners moving so slowly no one notices the music" and "miniature galaxy in decay" serve thematic coherence. Clarity and propulsion remain strong despite the cluster.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—mapping butterfly-wing scales onto neutron-star decay to measure catastrophe as gradual change—is specific and non-obvious, emerging from Mara's dual expertise. The greenhouse's "slow collapse" paralleling her emotional arc feels earned rather than imposed. Risk-taking: the piece commits fully to its scientific-lyric premise without retreat, using synchrotron convergence as the turning image. Minor derivativeness: the "scientist finds personal meaning in professional work" frame is familiar, but the butterfly-dust calibration and the PSR J1748-2446ad overlay provide fresh texture. Transformation test passes: swap names or fields and the story loses its specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's researcher role drives setup (field kit, sterile slide, algorithm), middle beats (forceps work, synchrotron operation), and closure (acceptance of gradual change as professional and personal truth). Her decision to ignore the storm and later to stop fleeing storms shapes the emotional arc. Removing "neutron star researcher" would collapse the causal bridge between cosmic and human timescales.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Butterfly wing dust appears in setup (fern frond fragment), development (titanium forceps lift, slide prep, synchrotron analysis), and closure (the "quiet thesis" reweights her grief). The dust's molecular accretion encodes time, enabling the algorithm convergence that validates Mara's heresy and triggers her emotional shift. Specificity is high: iridescent scales from Morpho menelaus, cobalt fire, dust mapped as fractals. Cost is tied directly to this object—without it, no convergence, no acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Gradual change" shapes the dominant stake (calibrating the algorithm), tactical choices (mapping laminations, synchrotron analysis), and closure image ("change is not" optional, arrives "minute by minute, scale by scale"). The concept is dramatized through butterfly growth, neutron-star decay, greenhouse collapse, and Mara's grief trajectory. Removing it would erase the thematic and causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" appears in the opening ("preprocess reality without the static of academic committees") and recurs when Mara "learned to preprocess reality by letting imminent danger wait its turn." The trait enables her decision to ignore the storm and work through the night, a visible cost (risk). However, the term feels slightly labeled rather than fully embodied in action; the concept is more told than shown in micro-choices. Setup and closure gates are met, middle development is implied but not sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Decay drives every beat: butterfly-wing dust decay, neutron-star magnetic-field decay, greenhouse structural decay, and Mara's emotional "frantic pulses" reframed as iteration rather than catastrophe. The overlay of decay curves at convergence is the story's turning image. The final paragraph's "slow collapse" and "decay, like growth, is a courtesy" charge the closure. Swapping "decay" for another process (e.g., growth alone) would break the thematic and causal architecture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dust-pattern accumulation is signaled in setup ("each scale grew by molecular accretion, layer upon layer"), developed through synchrotron fractals and timeline mapping, and pays off at convergence when the overlay matches within 0.003%. The method shapes Mara's tactical choices (slide prep, data collection, headlamp persistence) and the closure realization ("stand still inside the accumulating dust patterns"). However, the mechanics are somewhat abstract; the reader trusts rather than visualizes the process.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse constrains every choice: glass shards, humidity, failing lights, encroaching rain, and the imminent fifth storm. Mara kneels on shattered panes, works by headlamp when power fails, seals the slide against cold water. The setting's "slow collapse" becomes the story's closing metaphor, directly charging the final image of decay as courtesy. The greenhouse provides both tactical obstacles and thematic resonance; removing it would collapse the spatial pressure and symbolic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the temporal frame (brother lost, preserve ruined, fifth storm approaching) and creates urgency: Mara's work occurs in a narrow window before the next storm. The post-disaster setting motivates her search for silence and the butterfly fragment's scarcity. However, the clock is not tightly tracked beat-by-beat (03:17 is the only timestamp), and "hours compressed" abstracts elapsed time. Setup and closure gates are met; middle pressure is present but not sharply tightened by minutes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Strip needless drama" is named in Mara's private title for the project and dramatized through her choices: ignoring the storm, refusing to outrun grief, choosing calm publication over exclamation. The motivation is tested when convergence validates her "heresy," and she laughs—a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. The final realization ("drama is optional") completes the arc. Friction between professional and personal stakes is visible (career pressure versus brother's loss), and the cost of acceptance is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Kindled humility" modulates coherently: Mara feels it when the greenhouse's "ruined splendor dwarfed her instruments," again when the universe "does not need her drama to keep expanding," and finally when she accepts "the faint, kindled heartbeat of ongoing becoming." The tone charges the closure image—the dry paper offering "release" rather than triumph. The diction ("kindled") recurs with purpose, and the tone's restraint supports the theme of patient, unglamorous change. One minor note: the phrase appears twice without full reweighting in between, but the final use pays off.</comment>
