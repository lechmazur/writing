<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle's interiority is consistently embodied through visceral detail—"tasting iron and pine resin," the seed becoming "a polished stone of knowing" in her throat—and her peripheral-vision talent shapes micro-choices throughout. Internal contradiction emerges between her protective impulse and the mounting physical cost, driving the smudging action and final expulsion. The swallowing decision and its consequences feel earned, with visible cost (the rootlet piercing her diaphragm, the evacuation) that forecloses the protection she initially offered. Minor slip: the stranger's arrival is told rather than shown, weakening the inciting motivation slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (weather station, post-fever, mountain setting). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (botanical illustration, aurora, smudged leaves morphing into maps) that converge at the expulsion beat. Closure lands on-page with visible cost—the stone evacuated, the illustration blank except one torn leaf, "valley temporarily innocent"—and the final logbook entry crystallizes the price paid. One meaningful deepening occurs when the oracle connects the smudged laurel to the mountain's topography, reweighting the swallowed truth as geographical/communal burden rather than personal burden alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The weather station is concretely realized (cot, barograph, anemometer, rain gauge) and constrains key choices: the oracle uses station tools (logbook, illustration, instruments) to externalize and measure the internal weight. The botanical illustration—decades-old, cloud-damp, foxed edges—functions as both object and micro-setting, its smudging action directly shaping the climax. The auroral light and snowfield become tactile pressure points where the expulsion occurs. Sensory hierarchy filters through the oracle's professional lens (barograph's trembling hairline, mercury's shyness) without tourist cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: finding the weight of the swallowed truth before it sprouts. Pressure tightens through accumulation—sketches warping, rootlet piercing diaphragm, aurora arrival—forcing the oracle outside to smudge the illustration deliberately. The agency is clear: she chooses to erase leaf by leaf, sacrificing external images to surface the internal stone, then expels it with visible cost (4.7 grams of sorrow, sky clearing, temporary innocence). The final act forecloses her protective role with felt consequence. One causal slip: the stranger's seed-offering is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly weakening the initial turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: truth as physical burden, protection as unsustainable weight, the cost of brokering silence. The botanical illustration's transformation (laurel → topographic map → blank page with torn silhouette) reweights the premise without stating a moral. The final logbook entry—"valley temporarily innocent"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: innocence is cyclical and purchased with the oracle's body. The swaying certainties/peripheral awareness motif charges the closure image (fault circuits quiet, peripherally aware innocence will return). No thematic echo or moralizing; the auroral sorrow and externalization-by-erasure cohere into conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature consistent: the oracle filters through her oracular talent (peripheral vision, swaying certainties, instruments' whispered names). Diction stays within her register—"chlorophyll sorrow," "auroral light," "rosary beads counting down"—mixing botanical, meteorological, and mystical vocabularies without jarring shifts. Purposeful compression in the fever-memory and stranger-arrival beats serves closure momentum. Minor filter-verb accumulation ("she felt," "she remembered") in early paragraphs slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure focalization. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with the expulsion's physical intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or pressure. Figurative language is controlled and specific ("green pigment smudged beneath her thumb, releasing a ghost of chlorophyll sorrow") with vehicles that cohere. Minor overwriting in the aurora description ("green ropes dragging violet scars") and one paraphrase loop (paragraph 7 restates the stranger's arrival without adding pressure). Template cadence appears briefly in mid-section ("She touched... She moved... She wrapped") but breaks before becoming pervasive. The final logbook entry provides efficient closure without summarizing emotion. No clarity-breaking artifacts touch the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle framing is fresh, blending meteorological profession with oracular capacity in non-obvious ways (barograph readings, peripheral forecasts). The botanical illustration as externalization tool and the smudging-as-expulsion mechanic feel specific and inevitable in hindsight. The swallowed-truth-as-seed premise transforms familiar burden metaphors through embodied consequence (rootlet piercing diaphragm, stone's measured weight). Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric compression heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor proximity concern: "auroral sorrow" and "truth shaped like a seed" echo recent literary fantasy conventions, though the weather-station grounding and specific meteorological detail provide transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle's choices drive key turns: deciding to transcribe echoes, walking outside during the aurora, deliberately smudging the illustration leaf by leaf, and expelling the stone. These decisions alter tactics and foreclose her protective role with visible cost. Present in setup (waking, remembering the swallowing), development (sketching/smudging to externalize), and payoff (expulsion and logbook entry). Causal pressure is strong; the character's agency shapes the ending directly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in setup (desk, smudged pigment), development (drawing leaves in logbook margins, watching them warp), and payoff (held up to aurora, deliberately smudged/erased outside, wrapped around expelled stone). Used in three distinct beats with evolving function: diagnostic tool, externalization canvas, burial shroud. Its transformation (laurel → topographic map → blank with torn leaf) charges the final image. Irreplaceable; no generic object could carry the layered botanical/cartographic/memorial meanings.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is introduced early as the oracle's talent and method, shaping her peripheral-vision approach to forecasts and the instruments' ambiguous messages. It constrains her tactics (occupying margins, reading discarded data) and returns in the final line ("the swaying certainties had stilled"), reweighting the closure as temporary stasis. However, it functions more as thematic frame than active pressure point; the core conflict hinges on the physical seed/weight rather than uncertainty per se. Present in setup and payoff with moderate causal role in one beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" defines the oracle's method throughout: she reads forecasts others discard, becomes aware of shadows peeling from the tree line, and ends "peripherally aware that innocence... would return." The trait enables specific actions (interpreting barograph trembles, radio static names) and constrains her approach (margins, not certainties). It charges the final image by framing her knowledge as provisional and oblique. Present in setup, development (instrument readings), and payoff, with visible cost (she cannot claim full knowledge, only swaying forecasts). Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Smudge" is the climactic action: the oracle smudges the botanical illustration's green pigment early (releasing chlorophyll sorrow), then deliberately smudges/erases it outside leaf by leaf to externalize the internal weight. This action is irreplaceable; it transforms the illustration into a topographic map, then into a blank burial shroud. The smudging directly enables the stone's expulsion and charges the closure (ink bleeding into snow, forming black petals). Present in setup, drives the turning point, and shapes the ending image with indispensable specificity. Major turns trace directly to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Occupying margins" is introduced early as the oracle's talent and method (reading peripheral vision, swaying certainties, discarded forecasts). It shapes her tactics: transcribing echoes in logbook margins, drawing leaves in blank corners, interpreting instruments others ignore. However, its mechanics remain somewhat abstract; the piece tells us she works this way more than showing the margin-occupation constraining a specific choice. Present in setup and development, with thematic payoff in the final "peripherally aware" line. Functional but could be more concretely dramatized in the turning beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies essential resources (logbook, illustration, instruments, quilt, rain gauge) and pressures choices (isolation forces the oracle to solve the problem alone; tools shape her externalization method). The setting is embodied through tactile detail (cot, ceiling boards, shutters, anemometer, rime on boots) and micro-objects that enable the climax (rain gauge as burial site). The station's function as observatory/record-keeper mirrors the oracle's role. Present across all beats, constrains tactics, and participates in closure (rain gauge, logbook entry). Strong integration; not merely postcard backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" anchors the timeframe at the opening and implies recent vulnerability, priming the swallowing memory. However, the clock is not actively tracked; the aurora's arrival at 03:17 provides one temporal marker, but urgency derives more from the seed's sprouting threat than elapsed time pressure. The timeframe functions as setup/context rather than tightening constraint. It enables the oracle's weakened state (tasting iron, needing to find weight before sprouting) but does not visibly narrow her decision window in the middle beats. Present in setup, minor causal role, absent from payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire to find the weight of the swallowed truth is signaled immediately and dramatized through concrete actions: transcribing echoes, drawing/pressing leaves to emboss paper, walking outside to smudge deliberately, weighing the stone against memory before expulsion. Friction between the protective impulse (taking the seed to protect the valley) and mounting physical cost (rootlet piercing diaphragm, climbing weight) drives choices with visible consequence. The motivation shapes setup, development, and payoff; the final logbook entry crystallizes the cost ("4.7 grams of sorrow"). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is established early (chlorophyll sorrow tasting of auroral light) and modulates coherently: the aurora spills over the ridge at the turning point, the oracle lets "auroral sorrow pool in her footprints," and it dims instantly when the stone is expelled. Tone remains elegiac and precise through pressure, charging the final image (sky clearing, valley innocent, circuits quiet). The tone integrates with sensory and thematic layers (green pigment, violet scars, botanical grief) without static repetition. Present in setup, intensifies at climax, and resolves in payoff with clear cadence shift. Strong coherence and closure participation.</comment>
