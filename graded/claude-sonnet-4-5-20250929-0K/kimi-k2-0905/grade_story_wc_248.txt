<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ember's motivation is asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses. The "analytically intuitive mind" remains a label without on-page demonstration of how this trait constrains or enables choices under pressure. Interior life consists of abstract declarations ("understanding destruction's dual nature") rather than embodied contradiction. The final transformation from "broken arsonist" to "keeper of truth" is told, not earned through visible cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Ember is and what she seeks emerges gradually through exposition rather than anchored action. The drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward causal (following clues) but resolves through summary revelation rather than on-page discovery. Closure occurs as explained transformation ("understood then") without a decisive beat where options narrow or cost becomes legible. The archive collapse and her emergence are recounted, not dramatized, so no felt price lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The archive is described (crumbling archway, soot-stained walls, stone) but does not constrain Ember's descent or choices. Spatial choreography is vague—she "descended deeper" and found the tapestry "behind a false wall" without tactile navigation or obstacle. The collapsing archive at the end is asserted ("began to collapse") without sensory specificity or impact on her exit. The tapestry fragment's warmth is the sole detail that recurs with slight charge at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing her grandmother's promise—is declared early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page obstacle tests Ember's commitment; she descends, finds the fragment, translates it, and ascends without reversal or tightening. The revelation ("fire remembers," reweaving threads) is given to her rather than earned through a choice that forecloses another path. Coincidence (the archive collapses exactly when she exits) resolves the sequence without protagonist agency or visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—destruction as revelation—is stated repeatedly ("pyromania had always been her way," "sometimes we must destroy to truly save") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The tapestry fragment and artistic trail function as symbols announced in narration instead of images that accumulate pressure and reweight at closure. The final paragraph moralizes the premise directly: "volcanic tenderness had transformed…sometimes we must destroy to truly save what matters most." No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the piece instructs rather than resonates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("corporeal," "analytically intuitive," "the greater revelation") inconsistent with a character in crisis. Ember's perceptual signature is generic—she traces, finds, understands—without idiosyncratic filtering. Phrase recycling is pervasive: "volcanic tenderness" appears five times, "artistic creations" four times, "hidden message" / "forgotten promise" / "analytically intuitive" recur without variation. Free indirect style blurs with summary exposition, especially in the final third where nearly every paragraph begins with declarative insight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate: paragraphs 2–3 restate Ember's artistic trail, paragraphs 15–16 re-explain her arson's true purpose, and the final three paragraphs cycle through the same transformation claim. Template cadence runs throughout: "She had gone…She had come…Ember's grandmother had been…Ember's fingers found…Ember understood…Ember pressed…" Stock metaphors accumulate without specificity: "burning bright," "flames licking," "consumed by light." Information density is low—many sentences restate prior content rather than advance knowledge or pressure. The closure beat is scaffolded with explanation rather than image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—arsonist seeking truth in ashes—echoes familiar "destruction as creation" templates without fresh synthesis. Key story furniture (grandmother's deathbed whisper, hidden archive, self-portrait cipher, collapsing vault) follows adventure-puzzle conventions. The "volcanic tenderness" motif is repeated as a tag rather than explored through specific contradiction. No turn or image feels inevitable in hindsight; the resolution (tapestry reweaves, archive collapses on cue) is convenient rather than causally earned. Transformation is asserted in summary rather than demonstrated through a non-obvious choice rooted in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Ember is named and present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics. She follows the trail, descends, finds the fragment, and exits without choosing between competing options or paying a visible cost. Her role is observational; the tapestry and archive act upon her ("began to shift," "began to glow," "began to collapse") rather than her constraining or enabling key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears early (paragraph 4), is handled mid-story (paragraph 10), and recurs at closure (paragraphs 14, 18). Its properties evolve: scratched-out, then warm, then glowing and reweaving. However, Ember does not use it to make a choice—it reveals itself to her. Removing it would break the closure image but not because of protagonist agency tied to the object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is mentioned in paragraphs 4, 11, and 22 but functions as a symbolic backdrop rather than shaping on-page stakes. The scratched-out face revealing maps is told in summary (paragraph 11) without Ember interpreting or acting on that discovery in a way that narrows her options. It echoes theme but does not constrain tactics or enable a turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is a label applied twice (paragraphs 3, 16) without demonstration. No scene shows Ember analyzing clues, weighing data, or intuiting a hidden pattern through on-page thought. The trait does not enable or constrain a choice; it is asserted as character furniture. Swappable with "perceptive" or omittable without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Portray" appears in paragraphs 2, 7, 19, and 23 but is used passively: her artworks "portray," the tapestry will "portray," the story itself is a "portrayal." Ember does not perform the action of portraying at a decisive beat. The verb is descriptive rather than causal. Easily replaceable with "depict" or "show" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The artistic trail is introduced early (paragraph 2) and its mechanics explained mid-story (paragraphs 8, 12). However, Ember does not follow or interpret the trail on the page—she arrives already knowing its destination. The method is present in exposition but does not shape her attempts or force adaptation under pressure. Setup and thematic payoff are present; middle development through protagonist action is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is named early (paragraph 1) and houses the entire action. Its collapse at the end (paragraph 20) signals closure but does not constrain Ember's choices—she descends and ascends without navigating obstacles or using the environment's resources. The archive functions as container rather than pressure. The "false wall" (paragraph 10) is the sole micro-detail that affects access, but it is discovered without effort.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" is stated in paragraph 2 ("three months ago") but does not tighten decisions. No deadline, pursuit, or time-driven consequence appears. Ember's timeline is untracked; the descent and discovery occur in unspecified duration without urgency. The timeframe is setup only, with no development or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The forgotten promise is named early (paragraph 5) and recurs at closure (paragraphs 17, 20, 24). However, it remains abstract—what the promise entails is never concretized, and Ember does not face friction between fulfilling it and another want. The motivation is told ("she had come to rescue") but not dramatized through a choice where cost is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears in paragraphs 1, 9, 13, 21, and 24 but functions as a repeated phrase rather than a modulating tone. The narrative voice remains uniformly elevated and explanatory throughout; no tonal shift marks pressure changes or the final image. The phrase is ornamental—removing it would not alter the story's emotional arc or closure charge.</comment>
