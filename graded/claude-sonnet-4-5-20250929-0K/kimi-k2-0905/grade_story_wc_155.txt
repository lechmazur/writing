<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Luma's motivation to recover lost joy anchors the piece, and her micro-choices (pocketing the fragment, whispering the pass-phrase, painting with pooled light) advance pressure. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction—"joy, once lost, hides behind spectral dust"—rather than embodied contradiction. The grandfather memory provides concrete emotional content, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains more declared than dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the fresco fragment triggers layered memory-work, the Lantern Lattice sequences the reveal, and the final mural installation delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (the joy "merely waited to be developed"). Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive within the fog-orchard frame by the second paragraph. Cost is present but conceptual: each brushstroke trades "present sorrow" for past laughter, and the pocket empties while the heart "over-exposes." The cadence shift from search to display reweights the dominant stake with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district, toppled apple press, and cider-house wall provide tactile anchors that constrain Luma's choices: she kneels beside the press to retrieve the fragment, seeks the oldest ruin guided by the fresco's heartbeat, and presses palms to plaster that "smelled faintly of fermented stars." The fog operates as spatial pressure—folding time, knitting into a dome—and the wall's memory of every hand becomes the substrate for closure. Micro-setting (body, fragment, wall) charges the final image when the graft "heals two broken branches into one flowering tree."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and tightens through a clear sequence: fragment discovery, Lattice invocation, projection onto the living wall. The act of painting costs "a sigh of present sorrow" per brushstroke, and the fragment dissolves into the mural, binding past to present with visible sacrifice (empty pocket, over-exposed heart). One meaningful deepening occurs when the impossible film becomes real, reweighting memory from lost to recoverable. The tightening is gentle but legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete action: joy as latent image requiring courage to develop, memory as film sealed in pigment, and the mural as proof that what was thought lost merely awaited exposure. The final realization—"joy had never been lost; it had merely waited to be developed, exposed by risk and displayed by courage"—risks direct statement but is earned by the prior sequence of fragment-pulse, Lattice whisper, and wall-graft. The vermilion cheek recurring in the mist offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the grandfather's "conspiratorial wink" and the daydream's folding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering sensory detail through Luma's artistic perception: "the beams refused to co-operate; they scattered into bruised pewter." Perceptual signature is consistent—light as material, fog as canvas—and diction stays elevated yet legible. However, several lines drift into narrator-supplied wisdom rather than character-specific thought: "joy, once lost, hides behind spectral dust" and "every future shadow she met would recognize the light she carried" read as thematic summary rather than Luma's idiom under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "fog folded," "orchard light arrested mid-kiss," "fermented stars," "color planets," "pewter quilt." While many images are vivid, the clustering in nearly every sentence risks overwriting, especially in high-pressure beats where clarity would serve momentum better. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "folded time" recurs three times without new meaning. Template stems are minimal, and grammar is clean. Information density is strong—most lines advance atmosphere and action—but the relentless metaphoric layering occasionally dulls propulsion rather than sharpening it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of muralist, memory-as-film, and fresco-as-projector offers a specific, non-obvious premise that avoids template plots. The Lantern Lattice (ghostly painter knowledge pooled in fog) and the conceit of painting with pooled light feel fresh and grounded in the orchard-ruin setting. Emotional specificity—grandfather spraying water into prismatic laughter—anchors the universal question of recovering joy. Risk is present in the sustained lyric register and the non-linear daydream frame, though the ending's affirmation ("joy had never been lost") leans toward safety rather than ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Luma is present throughout and makes key choices: retrieving the fragment, invoking the Lattice, painting onto the cider-house wall. Her decisions drive the sequence from search to closure. She appears in setup, middle development (Lattice whisper, wall-pressing), and payoff (mural completion, departure). Causal pressure is moderate—her actions enable the projection—but the choices feel more sequential than conflicted, limiting top-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears in setup (retrieved from the apple press), middle development (pulses to project the film, offers its heartbeat as guide), and payoff (dissolves into the mural, binding the graft). It constrains tactics: Luma must find a "living wall" to develop the memory. The fragment's warmth against her ribs and its final dissolution tie it to visible cost (empty pocket at closure). Its irreplaceability—bearer of arrested orchard light, trigger of the impossible film—elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Exposed film shapes the central metaphor and stakes: the memory "rolls, frame by frame" and must be "developed" on a living wall. It appears in setup (the impossible afternoon captured), middle (Lattice projects it), and payoff (each frame landing on the wall). The concept directly alters tactics—Luma must paint to develop it—and the closure image (mural as "secret reel") reweights the premise. Swappability is low; removing "film" would require rewriting the logic of memory-as-latent-image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Paints with light" appears as label in the opening ("coaxing sunbeams out of fog"), pass-phrase ("Paints with light, drinks with shadow"), and action (painting with "light pooled in her veins"). It enables the projection onto the wall and ties to her identity as muralist. However, the trait is more thematic echo than on-page constraint with visible cost; the phrase unlocks the Lattice but does not impose a trade-off that alters later tactics. Integration is functional but borders on ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Display" drives the climactic beat: Luma must press palms to the wall and paint the projected film onto masonry, coaxing memory out of her chest. The Lattice explicitly requires display on a "living wall" to develop the film, making this action causally necessary. It appears in middle development (Lattice instruction) and payoff (the act of painting frame by frame). Removing "display" collapses the story's mechanics. Specificity and closure linkage are strong; the mural as permanent display charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Lantern Lattice is signaled early (invoked by pass-phrase, described as ghostly painter thumbprints pooled in fog) and shapes middle development: it offers pigment names and murmurs the requirement for a living wall. It appears in setup (introduced), middle (used to decode the fragment), and indirectly in payoff (the knowledge enables the mural). However, its mechanics remain abstract—faces orbit, syllables arrive—without visible cost or constraint beyond providing information. Functional but borders on convenient plot device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district supplies the fragment (apple press), the Lattice medium (fog), and the display surface (cider-house wall). It appears in setup (fog and orchard frame), middle (toppled press, fog dome), and payoff (cider house, mural glowing, fog keeping silence). The setting constrains choices—Luma must find the oldest ruin—and the wall's memory of every hand is causally necessary for the film to develop. The fog's folding and the orchard's ruin directly shape the stakes and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" frames the piece (fog folds, noon and twilight rub shoulders, daydream folds at closure) but does not impose a live clock or tighten tactics. Time is atmospheric rather than constrained; Luma's search and painting occur without urgency or deadline. The timeframe appears in setup and payoff as a thematic boundary but does not alter decisions in the middle. Ornamental rather than pressure-generating.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Luma's desire to rediscover lost joy is signaled early ("searching for a color she had misplaced"), dramatized in middle development (the projected memory of laughter with her grandfather), and resolved at closure ("joy had never been lost; it had merely waited to be developed"). The motivation drives every beat: fragment retrieval, Lattice invocation, mural painting. Visible cost accompanies pursuit—each brushstroke trades present sorrow—and the ending reweights the premise from loss to latency. Friction between want (recovery) and cost (sorrow) is present but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Pensive mirth is present in diction ("pensive mirth that tasted of cider and second chances") and tonal modulation: the opening's pewter fog and refused beams shift to the climactic laughter and vermilion smile. The tone coheres across beats without flattening, and the final image—seven-year-old laughter continuing "one sun-drop at a time"—charges the ending with bittersweet resonance. However, the tone is more consistent than modulating under pressure; it supports rather than sharpens the stakes. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>
