<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The spinner's motivation is clear and embodied—she crushes amber, swallows voice, trades speech for message-carrying—with cost legible on the page ("sealing her muteness like frost over still water"). Interior contradiction appears in the final renunciation: she surrenders her name yet continues weaving "symbols legible only to those who listen with more than ears," a paradox that grounds the ending. Micro-choices accumulate (fitting puzzle pieces, crushing the bead, stepping through) and the silent weaving afterward demonstrates earned endurance. Minor: the spinner remains somewhat archetypal; a second on-page character or sharper internal friction would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she trades voice for message-delivery and continues weaving in silence; the cost is unmistakable ("swallowed name," "without sound") and the orchard's temporal reversal ("trees grew younger") reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern break: puzzle assembly dims the orchard, final bead placement opens the portal, voice becomes thread, silence seals. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds. The closure lands on the page with felt cost and coherent accumulative pressure, but the middle stretch (puzzle assembly) could tighten—several beats describe rather than shift stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard setting ("fruit trees leaned into one another, their branches stitched by decades of moss") is vivid and selective. The loom and bamboo grove constrain the spinner's world and charge the final image: "golden beads of fresh sap, each one holding a single strand of her quiet gold thread" ties closure directly to setting. Spatial choreography is clear (loom, packed-earth floor, trees, portal between "stake and sky"). The setting subtly guides the ending—her silent weaving rewinds the orchard's clock, trees grow younger—so environment affects outcome. Minor: occupational detail (loom mechanics) remains gestural; deeper specificity of spinning technique would elevate further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: "the yarn itself wanted to speak but had forgotten the shape of words." One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes "the bargain: to carry a message across that gap she must offer the only voice still hers." Agency is clear—she crushes the bead, swallows it, winds words onto the bobbin—and the cost is visible: permanent muteness. The resolution is earned by her choices under accumulative pressure. The middle puzzle-assembly sequence lacks a second reversal or complication; escalation reads as density increase rather than a twist, which fits the accumulative lens but limits band height in Q4.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—sacrifice and the weight of message-carrying across impossible distance—emerges from image and action without direct statement. The final image (golden sap beads holding thread, "messages waiting for the next puzzle, the next sacrifice") offers a non-literal answer reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in gesture: she "pressed the petal to her chest, felt the echo of her swallowed name beat against her ribs." No overt moralizing. The orchard's temporal reversal and the recurring amber-and-thread motif layer meaning without abstraction. Slightly held back by the poetic density that occasionally borders on ornament (e.g., "stoically sparkling tears") rather than grounding every metaphor in character stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent ("moon-white bamboo fiber," "cider-scented rot," "taste was cider and copper and goodbye"). Diction remains elevated and lyric throughout, voice-appropriate for a fable register. Filter verbs are sparse. Experimental compression and patterned syntax (e.g., recursive imagery of threads, silence, spinning) teach the pattern early and pay off at closure. Minor: some figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats ("raveling silence being pulled backward through the eye of a needle") without always clarifying causality, and occasional ornamental phrases ("stoically sparkling") drift toward decoration. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening and closing images anchor voice and stakes. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity remains high in spatial choreography and action sequence. However, figurative density spikes in several high-pressure beats: "raveling silence being pulled backward through the eye of a needle," "impossible distance measured not in miles but in forgotten lullabies," "stoically sparkling"—these occasionally blur causality or rely on abstract elegance rather than concrete action. The phrase "stoically sparkling" appears twice, once mid-story and once near the end, and reads as ornamental in both instances. Apply −0.6 for density and mild register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of loom-work, puzzle-as-portal, and voice-sacrifice feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of amber bead into swallowed voice into golden thread is purposeful and grounded in the spinner's craft. The premise—trading speech to send a message across "impossible distance"—is fresh in execution. Risks include the fable/lyric register and the elliptical middle; both succeed in charging the closure. Minor: the archetypal "spinner in forgotten grove" frame is familiar; the story personalizes it through craft detail and the bead's history, but a bolder character inflection or occupational friction would distinguish further. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Wistful loom spinner: present from the opening, drives every major beat (puzzle discovery, assembly, bead-crushing, voice-winding, silent weaving after), and her choices create all key turns. Her wistfulness is embodied in "coaxing thread," "vibration she could almost read," and the phrase "carried a wistful note." The final image (silent weaving, trees growing younger) is hers. Cost is visible: she loses speech permanently. Early signal +0.5, three-plus beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.5. No major frictions. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tree sap amber bead: introduced in paragraph 10 ("a droplet of tree sap amber that once held a fossil ant and now held only the memory of wings"), used in two distinct beats (placed into puzzle cavity, crushed and swallowed), and returns with reweighted meaning in the final image ("golden beads of fresh sap, each one holding a single strand of her quiet gold thread"). The bead enables the portal opening and its destruction is the pivot that costs her voice. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.6. No frictions. Indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Raveling silence: present in opening ("the hush of time's unraveling tapestry"), reappears at puzzle discovery ("a raveling silence being pulled backward"), and the final paragraph ("a raveling silence now fully knit, sealing her muteness like frost"). It shapes stakes by framing the orchard's temporal state and the spinner's final cost. However, it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; the spinner does not navigate or resist the silence as a force, she embodies it. Early signal +0.5, three touches +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. Swappable −0.5 (could be "deepening quiet" or "gathering hush" with minor edits). Mid-band: present and resonant, but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Stoically sparkling: applied to puzzle pieces ("stoically sparkling despite mildew and age") and to tears near the end ("stoically sparkling tears catching light"). It describes rather than constrains; no on-page action hinges on this quality. The attribute is poetic but ornamental. Two mentions +0.4, closure linkage +0.7. Ornamental −0.8, swappable −0.6 (could be "quietly gleaming" or "coldly bright"). Low functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Recommence: appears once, in a pivotal sentence: "watched the portal recommence its slow rotation, puzzle edges interlocking and dissolving into pure circumference." This beat occurs after she winds her voice onto the bobbin and steps back; the portal's resumed motion signals the message has been sent. The action is not swappable (starting/resuming is thematically charged), and it enables the petal's arrival and closure. One beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.6. Late first appearance (final third) −0.7. Solid integration despite late arrival.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box: the box is discovered mid-story (paragraph 5), opened (paragraph 6), pieces spread and assembled across multiple beats (paragraphs 7–11), and the completed puzzle becomes the portal mechanism. The saw-toothed runes and the cavity for the bead are specific mechanics that matter. Early signal +0.5, three-plus beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.8. No major frictions. High integration; the puzzle's structure (edges, cavity) is indispensable to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest: present from the opening, anchors all action, and its transformation (trees growing younger, fruit sweetening) is part of the closure effect. The orchard's "cider-scented rot" and lichened trunks are vivid and purposeful. Micro-setting (loom, packed-earth floor, trees) alters tactics (she carries the box back to her wheel, works between trunks). Early signal +0.7, three-plus beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7. No frictions. Essential to structure and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry: present in opening line, evoked again when the orchard dims ("as though someone had drawn a gauze across the moon"), and the final effect (trees growing younger, "loom rewound the orchard's own clock," "Seasons turned"). Time is thematic and atmospheric but not a live ticking constraint that alters tactics beat-to-beat. The spinner does not race a deadline. Early signal +0.5, three touches +1.0, closure linkage +1.3. Vague/untracked −0.6. Mid-band: present and resonant, but does not tighten decisions as a clock would.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To carry a message across impossible distance: stated explicitly in paragraph 14 ("to carry a message across that gap she must offer the only voice still hers") and dramatized through her choices (crushing bead, winding words onto bobbin, stepping through portal). The desire is conflicted—she gains message-delivery but loses speech—and the friction between want and cost is visible. Early implicit signal (yarn "wanted to speak"), explicit mid-story, two decision beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection +0.6. No frictions. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Latent sacrifice: tone is coherent and modulates with pressure. Early beats establish wistfulness and expectancy; puzzle assembly brings dimming and hush; peak beat (bead-crushing, voice-swallowing) delivers the sacrifice; final image charges it with "stoically sparkling tears" and "messages waiting for the next puzzle, the next sacrifice." Tone does not flatten or contradict. The latent quality (sacrifice implied, then enacted) is structural. Early signal +0.6, modulation with pressure +1.2, closure charge +1.5. Minor: "latent" becomes "enacted" mid-story rather than remaining latent through the end, a small tension with the prompt term. Solid integration.</comment>
