<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher's interiority is richly textured with sensory particulars and embodied perception (pressing palms to stone, feeling the island's heartbeat), but the piece struggles with motivation clarity. Her search for the whisk is framed as mourning "invisible labor," yet this remains abstract—no on-page micro-choice dramatizes what she risks or what alternative she forecloses by continuing the search. The final descent to mend nets reads as a return to routine rather than a choice forged under pressure, limiting the sense of earned transformation or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational elements. The piece builds density through firefly imagery, moon paths, and the whisk motif, achieving a cadence shift at the discovery. However, closure validity is weakened: the protagonist finds the whisk and descends to mend nets, but no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered, and the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The ending reweights the premise thematically (hidden effort as moon paths) but lacks the on-page pressure that would distinguish Resonant Reconfiguration from mere thematic echo. Orientation is clean; one transition (parapet to harbor) is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whispering parapet after rain is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (slick stone, warm beneath chill, settling whisper) filtered through the philosopher's professional attention to nets and knots. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting, constraining her spiral walk and charging the final image when its inscription mirrors her path. Firefly season provides atmospheric cohesion. The setting enables discovery and pressures the protagonist's attention, though it does not force a choice between incompatible options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—appreciation of hidden effort—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tightens into a forced choice with legible alternatives. The whisk discovery is a fortunate find, not a reversal that narrows options or raises cost. The oarsman's changed course and the firefly synchronization read as ambient validation rather than pressure. Agency is limited: the protagonist walks a spiral, finds the object, and returns to work; no on-page decision forecloses a path or demands a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening occurs (the inscription's reveal), but it does not alter tactics or crystallize a stance with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (invisible labor creates guiding patterns) emerges organically from the whisk's craftsmanship, net-mending metaphor, and moon-path imagery. The final image—knots as moon paths guiding others—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the piece edges toward abstraction: "demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber," and the repeated equation of mending with cosmic rhythm risk token symbolic convenience. The oarsman's course change and firefly synchronization feel asserted rather than earned by prior causality, lending a faint note of wish fulfillment to the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: diction (slick stone, dark commas, coaxing of fibers) reflects the philosopher's artisan attention, and perceptual signature is consistent (noticing grain, knot, absence). Purposeful compression (elliptical construction, poetic phrasing) and elevated register suit the reflective stance. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into exposition ("the invisible labor inside it") that tells rather than dramatizes, and the line "demure audacity, the courage to feel wonder without shouting it" reads as authorial gloss rather than lived thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density suits the lyric-accumulative mode. Clarity is high; spatial choreography (stairs, parapet, harbor) tracks cleanly. However, the piece exhibits patterned overwriting: adjacent sentences recycle the moon-path motif without added pressure ("moon paths she had drawn in sound," "moon paths floated on black water"), and repeated scaffold phrases ("She understood then," "She would descend soon, return") stall momentum. Stock metaphors (fireflies as stitching light, spiral geometry) appear in most high-density beats without fresh inflection. Information density is uneven: lines often do two jobs, but some beats (fireflies forming a net, water droplets as pale fireflies) pile on figuration that blurs rather than sharpens sense.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of net-mending and hidden-pattern philosophy offers a fresh angle, and the bamboo whisk's inscription as spiral guide is a non-obvious particular. However, the core emotional arc—solitary figure finds validation through symbolic object—follows a familiar template, and the oarsman's changed course plus firefly synchronization read as convenient external affirmation rather than earned complication. The closing image (mending as moon paths) transforms the premise thematically but does not risk a bold structural or moral choice that would elevate ingenuity into the high bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The net-mender philosopher is present throughout and her occupation colors perception. However, her choices do not create key turns: she walks, finds the whisk, and returns to mend nets. The spiral walk is intuitive rather than a decision under pressure. Setup and closure participation are present, but middle development lacks a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. Functional but replaceable with a generic seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bamboo tea whisk appears early (lost at dusk, sought on parapet), is found mid-story with the inscription discovery (a beat that reweights meaning), and is carried into the closure (slipped into sleeve, pulse-close). It drives two distinct beats (search framing, inscription reveal) and the inscription's spiral mirrors the walked path, adding irreplaceability. Closure linkage is indirect: the whisk is carried down but does not causally shape the final mending choice. Strong integration across beats but falls short of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Hidden patterns frame the premise and recur (spiral walk, firefly rhythm, moon paths, inscription), but the concept functions more as thematic overlay than on-page constraint. The protagonist trusts patterns without cost; no moment forces her to choose between competing interpretations or pay a price for following hidden logic. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is descriptive rather than causal. One key reprise (inscription matching walk) reweights meaning, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Scintillatingly somber" appears twice as a label: once as "scintillatingly somber mood," once as "scintillatingly somber joy." It describes affect but does not constrain or enable an on-page action. The protagonist feels the mood settle on her shoulders, but no choice or tactic hinges on this emotional state. Label-only mention without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Whistling appears in three beats: she whistles the net-mender's lullaby (oarsman responds), whistle again softer (composite music), and the closing line frames knots as whistles the sea hears. The lullaby changes the oarsman's course (one turn), and the final reprise charges the closure image by linking mending to the whistle motif. However, the protagonist could hum, sing, or speak with similar effect; the action is not mechanically irreplaceable. Solid integration across beats but swappable at moderate edit cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moon paths are signaled early ("trusted the moon paths that silvered the puddles"), shape the spiral walk ("following moon paths she could not see"), and appear in the closure ("moon paths floated on black water, waiting for feet"). The method is referenced across setup, middle, and ending. However, the mechanics are metaphorical: the protagonist walks intuitively rather than using the moon paths as a legible constraint that alters her tactics under pressure. One key turn (the walk leading to the whisk) is loosely tied to this method. Reprise reweights but lacks causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The whispering parapet after rain is present throughout: slick stone, warm beneath chill, settling whisper, fireflies above. It supplies the search space and the discovery (whisk on stone). The parapet's residual warmth and whisper enrich atmosphere and the final moment ("practicing, rehearsing the quiet effort she would someday need to hear again") reweights the setting's role. However, the parapet does not constrain a choice between incompatible paths. Setup, middle presence, and closure reprise are strong; causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Firefly season is mentioned early and recurs (fireflies drifting, landing, forming a net, turning back as "their season almost over"), providing atmospheric cohesion and a sense of fleeting time. However, the timeframe does not tighten a decision or alter tactics. No deadline pressures the search; the protagonist has time to spiral, discover, and descend at will. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development lacks urgency. Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to appreciate hidden effort" is declared early and frames the search for the whisk. The protagonist reflects on invisible labor and lets the mood settle. However, appreciation is a passive aim: no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want, no cost paid to honor hidden effort. The final mending reads as routine rather than a choice that sacrifices an alternative. Told more than dramatized; setup and payoff are clear, but middle friction is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Demure audacity" appears once as a label ("demure audacity, the courage to feel wonder without shouting it") and is echoed in the closing phrase ("demure audacity of being small and necessary"). The tone is coherent—quiet wonder, restrained intensity—and modulates with the inscription discovery. However, the tone is asserted rather than enacted through choice under pressure: audacity implies risk, yet no bold action with visible cost appears on the page. Setup and payoff reprise are strong; middle embodiment is weak. Mid-band for coherence and charged reprise, but lacks the causal grip for higher scores.</comment>
