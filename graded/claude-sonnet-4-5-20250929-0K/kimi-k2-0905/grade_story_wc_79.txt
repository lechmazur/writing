<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cartographer's motivation is embodied through physical action (piping the whistle, climbing bridges, consulting the atlas) and internal pressure coheres around her obsession with the watchers. Her decision to alter the note and persist through seven iterations demonstrates agency under stress. The final choice—accepting the terrible knowledge and turning the city back—carries visible cost (the whistle slipping from her lips, the weight of guiding future wanderers toward rather than away). Minor deduction: the mother's survival reveal feels slightly convenient, though the emotional contradiction (recognition across a sealed crack) adds complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative texturing: the cartographer's actions (altering the whistle note, repeating the pattern seven times) directly cause the turtles to change course and the watchers to respond. Orientation anchors promptly (cartographer, Chelon, dawn ritual, closed gate). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost: she gains the answer (the gate protects children from choosing the horizon) and accepts the burden of charting toward rather than away from that knowledge; the whistle slipping is the physical marker of that cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the watchers stir and the city veers northward, narrowing her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is not mere backdrop: Grand Akmon's tremor travels up her spine and triggers atlas consultation; the turtles' simultaneous course change is the story's pivot; their subsonic understanding closes the piece. The reed whistle, spiral-shell atlas chambers, and the crack in the air all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the cartographer's professional lens (comparing tremor rhythm to pattern languages, tasting iron in harmonics). The micro-setting—her body on warm carapace, the bridge between two shells—grounds every beat and makes spatial choreography legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (charting the watchers to prevent the city from tumbling into the Crack) is signaled early and tightens when Grand Akmon shudders. The cartographer's agency drives escalation: she chooses to alter the note, persist through seven iterations despite merchant screams, and plays the final sequence as a question. The watchers' response and the glimpse of her mother create a reversal that forces the final choice. Cost is visible: she must guide future wanderers toward the crack, carrying "sunwashed dread and her new, terrible chart." Minor gap: the turtles' understanding and turnaround feel slightly convenient, though the subsonic-rumble detail grounds it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: the gate closed not to protect the city from danger but to prevent children from following parents who chose the horizon. The cartographer's question is answered through image (the crack, the geode camp, her mother's recognition) rather than statement. The final turn—guiding wanderers toward rather than away—reweights prior material (her childhood obsession, her mother's disappearance, the "Here Be Answers" blank space) without moralizing. Subtext operates in the watchers' vertical slits matching her atlas grooves, the seven-iteration ritual, and the city's subsonic understanding. The piece resists tidy resolution: families wait on the other side of silence, but reaching them means choosing the horizon over the shell.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: "quietly driven, the way a tide is quiet when it carves continents grain by grain" and "dread pooled beneath them" anchor a consistent perceptual signature. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally edges toward elevated register ("oxidized metal," "bioluminescent ink") that feels slightly outside the cartographer's immediate crisis lexicon, though it remains legible. The final image's compression ("terrible chart") and the whistle's clatter provide embodied closure. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor deduction for one or two lines where the prose leans slightly more decorative than voice-urgent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance multiple jobs (e.g., "she flipped open her spiral-shell atlas, each chamber a pressed map, and compared the tremor's rhythm to the pattern languages encoded in her mother's final log"). Clarity remains strong through complex action. However, the opening sentence runs long with multiple clauses that slightly obscure the anchor ("listening for the gate that had rusted shut" reads as an odd sensory construction). A few constructions edge toward overwriting: "heat-shivered mirages, robed in dust the color of old blood" stacks modifiers without added pressure. The phrase "sunwashed dread" recurs three times, crossing from motif into minor loop territory. No major artifacts, but density occasionally tips into decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The turtle-city premise is fresh and fully committed; watchers as "something archived" with vertical slits matching atlas grooves is specific and purposeful. The twist—gate closed to protect children from following, not to keep danger out—feels earned and non-obvious. Risk-taking in the patterned, compressed prose and the conceptual closure (families waiting "on the other side of silence") elevates without obscuring. The piece resists generic fantasy templates by grounding the fantastical in embodied choice and cost. Minor limitation: the mother's survival and the geode camp introduce late detail that slightly leans on convenience, though the emotional logic holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The spiral-shell cartographer drives all key turns: climbs the bridge to pipe the pattern (setup), alters the final note to crack it (inciting choice), loops the pattern seven times despite screams (escalation), pipes the question sequence (climax), and watches the watchers respond and the crack open. Her decision to keep playing creates the city's course change and her acceptance of the final knowledge ("her new, terrible chart") forecloses her prior path. The spiral-shell atlas she consults is physically tied to her role. Cost is visible: the whistle slips from her lips and she must now guide wanderers toward, not away from, the crack. Irreplaceable and causally central to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The reed whistle appears in setup (piping the pattern at dawn), is altered mid-story (cracking the last note into harmonics), looped seven times to force the turtles' turn, and used to ask the final question. Its fall ("slipped from her lips and clattered onto warm carapace") marks the cost and closure beat. The whistle is the primary tool that enables her interrogation of the watchers and drives the city's course change. It recurs with escalating function across at least four beats and charges the final image. Minor cap: while central, the mechanics of pattern languages remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost expedition shapes the cartographer's obsession (her mother's pattern languages, the blank map labeled "Here Be Answers"), provides the tremor-match that triggers escalation (three short, one long cadence), and is revealed in the crack as the answer to her question—alive, encamped in a geode. The expedition is the reason the gate closed and defines the stakes: will she follow or guide others to follow? It constrains her tactics (she uses her mother's sequences) and reweights the ending (families wait on the other side). Present across setup, middle pressure, and closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is demonstrated through embodied action: she climbs every dawn, persists through merchant screams, loops the pattern seven times (the sacred number), and continues piping even as dread thickens. The simile "the way a tide is quiet when it carves continents grain by grain" anchors the trait in specific image. It enables her to withstand pressure and constrain her choices (no retreat, no stopping at six iterations). The trait charges the closure—her quiet acceptance of the "terrible chart"—but could be more directly tested by a visible tradeoff or cost tied specifically to her driven nature rather than the outcome itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Crack" operates on two levels and drives the story's central pressure. The Crack (capitalized) is the abyss the city must avoid, establishing survival stakes. The cartographer cracks the reed note in half to produce harmonics, which causes the watchers to stir for the first time—the story's inciting reversal. The watcher then traces "a crack in the air itself" to reveal the lost expedition and answer her question, providing closure. The final line returns to "the crack where families waited," reweighting the term from threat to threshold. The action is irreplaceable: without the sonic crack, no response; without the spatial crack, no answer. Three distinct uses, all load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pattern languages are signaled early (her mother used them to map, the cartographer pipes them at dawn), and the method matters: she consults the atlas to match tremor rhythm, alters the pattern by cracking a note, loops it seven times (a ritual number), and shapes the final sequence as a question. The mechanics remain somewhat abstract (we don't see the specific syntax or grammar of the language), but the method enables her interrogation and drives the watchers' response. It constrains her toolkit and is present across setup, escalation, and closure. Cost: the method requires public performance that terrifies merchants and forces the city off course.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The turtle-city is indispensable. Grand Akmon's tremor provides the causal trigger (matching her mother's log). The curved bridge between carapaces is the cartographer's daily workspace. The turtles' simultaneous course change is the story's central turn, forcing escalation. Their subsonic understanding closes the piece, embodying collective decision. The warm carapace under her feet anchors physicality throughout. The setting supplies the conflict (preventing the city from wandering blind into the Crack), the stakes (survival atop living foundations), and the resolution mechanism (the turtles turn back). Spatial choreography is clear and the setting shapes every tactic and the final image. Truly irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rusted gate frames the cartographer's childhood obsession ("when she watched the gate close like a mouth that decided it had said enough") and defines present constraint: the city no longer opens to the outer desert, trapping the question inside. The timeframe tightens tactics—three seasons of silence have passed, dread has pooled, and today's tremor forces immediate decision. The revelation that the gate was closed to protect children reweights the entire timeframe: the silence has been intentional separation. The gate's closure is causally active in setup, middle pressure (it created the obsession), and closure (the answer explains why it shut). Time is tracked and pressures choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to question the watchers is embodied in daily ritual (climbing to pipe the pattern), childhood origin (watching the gate close), and inherited obsession (her mother's blank map space). It drives the inciting choice (altering the note), sustains escalation (piping seven times despite fear), and culminates in the explicit question beat. The desire conflicts with survival instinct (dread thickens, merchants scream) and professional duty (preventing the Crack), creating visible friction. Cost is paid: she receives the answer but must now guide others toward separation. The motivation shapes every major choice and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is established early ("notes fluttered out, sunwashed and bright, yet dread pooled beneath them") and recurs with escalation ("Sunwashed dread thickened"). The oxymoron captures the story's tonal texture: bright desert light over existential fear, beauty over loss. The tone modulates under pressure—brightening with the watchers' first stir, thickening as the city veers—and charges the final image ("carrying her sunwashed dread and her new, terrible chart"). The juxtaposition of light and terror is specific to this setting and voice, consistent across beats, and integral to the ending's emotional register. It reweights prior material without becoming a static label.</comment>
