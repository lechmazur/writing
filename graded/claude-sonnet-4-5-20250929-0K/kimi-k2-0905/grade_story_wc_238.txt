<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The exorcist's motivation—guilt over banishing her sister—drives the arc with embodied interiority ("apology... clung to her tongue like rosin"). Internal contradiction surfaces in "I thought banishing your ghost would stop the pain," showing contradictory impulses. However, the final reconciliation arrives without visible renunciation or trade-off; the sister simply forgives, and the exorcist walks away having "released" the soul with minimal on-page cost to her present choices or future path. The ending feels more resolved than earned by a decision that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (perfume, music notation, silence/rest) and builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the exorcist speaks the apology and the sister responds "Play the rest; that's where I live." Orientation anchors quickly (archive, exorcist, perfume bottle). Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift—chainsaws outside compress time, pages swirl, the drop finally falls—and closure reweights the dominant stake (reconnection via acknowledging silence rather than erasing it). Cost is somewhat legible: the exorcist leaves the bottle and accepts the "echo," but the sister's easy forgiveness and the closing lilac bloom soften the price, preventing a fully decisive image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The archive as setting constrains choice materially: the exorcist touches metal shelves, and induced currents guide her hand to the exact folder. The perfume bottle placed on the stave aligns "glass and ink vibrated at the same frequency," charging the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"dust motes drifted like slow arpeggios," "air tasted of iron filings"—filtered through the protagonist's musical idiom. The orchard outside provides temporal pressure (tractors idling, chainsaws). Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the final image (lilac blooming in felled orchard) grounds the ending in place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconnect with the exorcised sister—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the induced current guides the exorcist's hand, and escalation peaks when the ghost materializes and asks "Was any of it heard?" The exorcist's agency is decision (speaking the apology aloud) and renunciation (releasing the perfume drop, leaving the bottle in the folder). However, the sister's cooperative forgiveness reduces friction; no live option is truly foreclosed with visible cost. The chainsaws provide external pressure but do not complicate the protagonist's internal calculus in a way that forces a harder choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as generative space, grief as unresolved dissonance—emerges through particulars: the rest symbol, the unplayed "Orchard Suite," the perfume's "imperfect miracle" that "resurrects any memory, but never the right one." The closing image (lilac blooming "out of season—an imperfect miracle rooted in forgiven silence") reweights prior motifs without stating a moral. However, the exorcist's line "Play the rest; that's where I live" edges toward thematic echo, and the final line "left the gossip to write its own metaphors" is a meta-comment that slightly dilutes the resonance earned by the perfume-and-archive particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through the exorcist's musical idiom ("breath caught, forming a brittle chord," "bow the air until music believes you"). Diction is distinct and purposeful, with compressed syntax matching urgency. The ghost's pizzicato whispers provide brief voice differentiation. However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats—"fractured into thirty-two facets, each one a metaphor," "brutal 4/4 time"—creating slight distance where immediacy would sharpen impact. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "dust motes drifted like slow arpeggios," "headlines like a shroud," "rosin," "trill," "pizzicato whispers." In accumulative mode this can build texture, but in peak beats—sister's materialization, apology, drop falling—the metaphoric layering ("edges flickering like a piano chord struck too hard, pedals still pressed") competes with clarity. Two paraphrase loops appear: "imperfect miracle" repeats across three paragraphs without added nuance, and "induced currents" recurs in summary fashion. Template cadence in the mid-section ("She touched... She uncorked... She spoke...") flattens rhythm. No grammar errors; syntax varies purposefully outside the loops.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of exorcism, musical archive, and induced-current-as-ghost-medium is specific and non-obvious. The perfume's flaw—"could resurrect any memory, but never the right one"—inverts miracle tropes purposefully. The ending's "imperfect miracle rooted in forgiven silence" transforms rather than resolves. However, the "celebrity medium" headline and gossip-column frame feel ornamental; they prime a satirical angle that the archive scene never develops, leaving the opening feel like a quirk rather than integrated premise. The musical metaphors, while coherent, risk becoming a stylistic tic rather than discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Exorcist present from opening, drives key decisions: touches shelf (induced current guides her), speaks apology aloud, lifts bottle so drop falls, tears apology from throat, leaves bottle in folder. Three beats of active choice. Early signal, closure linkage strong, causal pressure evident. Minor friction: the ghost's cooperative forgiveness reduces the exorcist's agency slightly at peak; the sister grants resolution rather than the exorcist fully earning it through harder renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Bottle introduced early ("antique perfume bottle she carried pulsed"), handled in three beats: set on table, uncorked (drop quivers, refuses to fall), lifted so drop falls on sister's palm, archived in folder at end. Its flaw—"could resurrect any memory, but never the right one"—shapes the exorcist's tactic (she speaks instead of relying on scent alone). Closure linkage strong: final act is placing empty bottle in folder, and closing image references it indirectly. Cost tied to it: releasing the drop and keeping "the echo." High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" appears in three moments: the perfume's flaw, the bottle labeled "imperfect miracle waiting for consent," and the closing lilac "an imperfect miracle rooted in forgiven silence." It shapes the exorcist's tactic (accepting flawed rather than perfect resurrection) and charges the final image. However, the concept is more thematic echo than tactical constraint—removing the label "imperfect" would not alter the sister's forgiveness or the exorcist's choice structure. Present throughout, meaningful reprise at closure, but one step short of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Exorcist "advises clients with" the metaphor "Grief is a violin without strings; you must bow the air until music believes you," then follows her own counsel by "drawing the invisible bow across the silence." One on-page application. However, the trait appears mid-story as exposition ("she had once advised clients") rather than shaping an early choice, and the ghost's question "Was any of it heard?" does the thematic work the metaphor claims to do. The attribute is told more than dramatized, and swapping "advises through metaphors" for "musician who understands grief" would preserve the arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is the dominant stake, signaled in paragraph five ("needed to reconnect with the sister she had exorcised by mistake"), drives all major beats: finding the composition, speaking aloud, releasing the drop, sister materializing, apology exchanged. Closure hinges on it: "Play the rest; that's where I live" and the exorcist's choice to release rather than re-exorcise. Early signal, beats involvement across the arc, closure causality. Irreplaceable: swapping "reconnect" for "mourn" or "remember" would break the sister's active presence and the apology's reciprocal structure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Induced currents" signaled in paragraph eight ("fluorescent lights hummed in induced currents"), used once causally in paragraph nine ("current leapt into her wrist, guiding her hand to the exact folder"), then summarized at closure ("induced currents settled into a lullaby"). The method enables the finding but does not constrain later choices—once the folder is found, the perfume and apology do the work. Present in closure image as mood rather than mechanics. Two-gate (setup, payoff) with one causal beat; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Archive introduced in opening line, provides resources (manuscripts, shelves, the sister's composition), and its metal shelves conduct the induced current that guides the exorcist's hand. The archive "recorded every sound," motivating the exorcist to speak aloud. Setting pressures the ending: lights dim, tractors outside fall the first tree, perfume bottle rattles "against its paper cradle." Spatial choreography is clean (stacks, table, folder, shelves). The archive's function—preserving unperformed music—mirrors the story's theme (silence as presence). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe "the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down" anchors opening, mentioned again mid-story ("tractors idling at the property line like predators waiting for dawn"), and pays off at closure ("first tree fell, sounding a low E"). It tightens decisions by creating urgency (hush collapsing), and the chainsaws' "brutal 4/4 time" contrasts the sister's rest. However, the deadline does not constrain the exorcist's micro-choices inside the archive—she could complete the reconnection before or after the cutting without altering her tactics. Present in three beats, charges atmosphere and final image, but causal pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Apology motivation stated early ("apology she carried felt heavier than any hex"), drives mid-story choice (speaks aloud "I thought banishing your ghost would stop the pain"), and climaxes with "tore the apology from her throat—no longer a press release, just three naked words: 'I was wrong.'" Friction between wanting reconnection and fearing the sister's accusation is implied but not fully dramatized—ghost's eyes hold "no accusation, only the weary question," softening the cost. Desire is on the page in three beats, but the easy forgiveness undercuts the "overdue" weight. Strong setup, solid payoff, mild friction gap.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" coheres: gossip headlines juxtaposed with "iron filings and unplayed sonatas," ghost "edges flickering like a piano chord struck too hard," chainsaw "brutal 4/4 time" against "lilac and thunder." Tone modulates from contemplative archive hush to pressured materialization to quiet closing bloom. The final image—lilac blooming "out of season"—sustains the ethereal, while "felled orchard" and "rattled the perfume bottle" sustain grit. However, the gossip-column frame introduced in the opening ("headlines tomorrow would claim she'd bottled a soul") is not developed mid-story, creating a tonal seam. Tone charges the ending well but shows one early-late inconsistency.</comment>
