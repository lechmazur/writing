<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist exhibits consistent visionary traits and embodied anxiety ("lungs fizzing with anxious elation"), but internal contradiction is limited—the choice to graft feels predetermined rather than wrestling competing desires. The child-self encounter offers a gesture toward complexity but dissolves into pollen before creating friction. The final transformation reads more as mystical inevitability than a choice that forecloses a legible alternate path with visible cost scaled to the protagonist's prior wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (scars, clipping, maze, fireflies) toward a final grafting that reconfigures the protagonist's role. Orientation anchors appear by ~180 words (cobalt glade, root-bound visionary, maze clipping), meeting the test. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the protagonist becomes a rooted hedge-double to sustain the covenant), but the cost—losing mobility, joining the fireflies—is poetically asserted rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or tactical choice that narrows prior options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade supplies vivid sensory anchors ("metallic hush," "mirrored blades," "eclipsed covenant") and the maze's breathing walls create tactile pressure. The topiary clipping functions as both tool and constraint, guiding the protagonist and ultimately grafting into flesh, which charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across hedge corridors and the child encounter. The setting decisively shapes the climax: without the glade's sap-and-circuitry infrastructure, the grafting and covenant renewal cannot occur.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—keeping the covenant between city and soil alive—is signaled early and coheres. The maze tightens physically (corridors breathing, thorns threading scars) and the future-vision deepens pressure by showing both utopian towers and choked roots. However, the protagonist's agency at closure is attenuated: the maze "drinks," the clipping "feeds," and the hedge-double steps back, reading more as submission to a mystical process than a protagonist-driven decision that narrows options. One meaningful tightening occurs when thorns graft, but the felt trade-off (mobility for covenant survival) is poetically declared rather than dramatized through a renounced alternate goal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—dreams and nature require embodied sacrifice to resist monoculture encroachment—emerges through concrete images: the cobalt leaf surviving via irrigated veins, hedge-scars on city dreamers, sidewalks cracking for glades. The piece resists overt moralizing; the final image of root-bound intersection offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the skeletal fireflies (prior seekers) and the child-self's prophetic scar-marking. The ending avoids tidy closure: the protagonist remains "anxious and elated, forever at dusk," sustaining complexity without forced balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV first person maintains stable focalization with a distinct perceptual signature: "filament of my entangled feet tingle with tomorrow's memories," "lungs fizzing with anxious elation." Vocabulary is controlled and voice-motivated (root-bound, sap-and-circuitry, hedge-scars). However, elevated diction ("root-bound visionary," "eclipsed covenant," "monoculture of glass") in high-pressure beats drifts toward label-speak, slightly flattening immediacy. Free indirect thought and tense remain consistent. No dialogue appears. Under peak stress (grafting), compression is purposeful but some lines ("vegetable code into flesh") edge toward conceptual abstraction rather than embodied sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("sky itself had bruised and bled into the grass," "roots writhing like compass needles," "kite string humming before it snaps"), creating a lyric texture that supports the accumulative lens. However, metaphor vehicles occasionally clash: "maze topiary clipping" has "roots writhing like compass needles" but is carried in a shirt pocket with "tiny leaves still warm"—spatial and scale logic wobbles. Paraphrase loops appear: "the future had arrived early" / "the early future slowed" restate without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraph openings use similar constructions ("I stepped," "I carried," "I followed," "I let"). Information density is high, but some lines over-explain: "anxious elation, that trembling midpoint between discovery and disaster" defines what the phrase already conveys.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of ecological anxiety, body-horror grafting, and covenant mythos offers a specific angle rather than a stock template. The image of a protagonist becoming a living hedge-key to sustain city-nature balance is memorable and thematically coherent. However, the visionary-seeker archetype and the trial-by-transformation plot follow familiar speculative patterns without a sharp turn that redefines prior stakes. Emotional truth—loneliness of separated dreams—grounds the premise. The ending image (root-bound intersection, hedge-scars on waking dreamers) transforms the opening's bruised sky into a systemic change, earning hindsight inevitability within the piece's logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Present throughout as the POV. Introduced immediately ("root-bound visionary"). Shapes two beats: following the clipping into the maze (middle) and choosing to let the maze graft (ending). The grafting decision is central to closure, but agency reads as mystical submission rather than a choice that weighs competing wants. Cost—becoming rooted—is declared but not dramatized through a renounced alternate path. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, swappability (could be "seeker" or "dreamer" with minor edits) −0.5, summary-only final transformation −0.4. Baseline 3.0 + 2.4 − 0.9 = 4.5, round down to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced early ("maze topiary clipping inside my shirt pocket"). Appears in three beats: pocket warmth (setup), roots writhing to guide protagonist (middle), grafting into scars (ending). The clipping's compass-like behavior enables the maze entry, and its final grafting is the mechanism of covenant renewal. However, physical handling is minimal—carried in pocket, then "stirred" and "fed on my blood" without tactile detail. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4, ornamental description (tiny leaves whispering) −0.3. Baseline 3.0 + 4.4 − 0.3 = 7.1, but swappability (could be any living plant token) −0.4, round down to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Signaled early ("eclipsed covenant had been signed"). Frames the dominant stake: "To keep dreaming, I must let the maze graft… become the living key that keeps both city and soil awake." Directly shapes the protagonist's final choice—without renewing the covenant, "the future would finish its early arrival as a monoculture of glass." The covenant is not merely thematic; it changes the protagonist's options (withdraw and break it, or stay and embody it). Early signal +0.7, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9, round up for irreplaceability to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mentioned twice: "purposely curious were invited to witness" and "dreamers woke with faint hedge-scars, purposely curious." The trait is asserted as a filter for who attends the reckoning and who later receives scars, but it does not constrain an on-page action or create a visible trade-off. The protagonist's curiosity is implied by entering the maze, but no beat shows curiosity overriding caution or costing something specific. Late first clear use (final paragraph) −0.7, ornamental mentions −0.5, label-only (no demonstrated tradeoff) −0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 2.2 − 1.8 = 3.4, but lyric reprise (opening invite → ending scars) +0.7, round to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The verb "heed" appears three times: protagonist heeds the call ("Still, I heed the call, because visions root deeper than fear"), child-me draws an X and dissolves (implicit heed of prophecy), and final embedded voice ("Heed the scars, map the dusk, keep the gate"). The action of heeding the call drives maze entry (middle beat) and the final grafting (closure). However, "heed" is interchangeable with "follow" or "obey" without altering structure. Early use +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 2.4 − 0.6 = 4.8, but thematic charge in final voice +0.5, round to 5.3; revising for lyric reprise strength, 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("Linking through scars was the method my mentor taught me"). Used in two beats: protagonist presses longest scar ridge to reopen the channel (middle), enabling the clipping to guide; thorns thread through old wounds to graft vegetable code (climax). The method is mechanically specific (scars as antenna and graft sites) and irreplaceable—without it, the covenant renewal cannot occur. Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7. Baseline 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3, but summary phrasing ("let pain be antenna, let memory be map") is didactic −0.4, and the grafting is more passively received than actively performed −0.3, final 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced in opening line ("cobalt glade at dusk"). Supplies sensory anchors (mirrored blades, metallic hush) and houses the maze, whose breathing walls and cobalt core drive the protagonist's grafting. The glade's sap-and-circuitry infrastructure enables the covenant mechanism; the protagonist's footprints "root" in it. The final image ("cobalt glade dimmed, accepting the graft") confirms the setting as active participant. Early signal +0.8, three beats (entry, maze, grafting) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.7, irreplaceability +0.8. Baseline 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1, but postcard description in opening −0.5 and some ornamental repetition ("cobalt" appears four times without new function) −0.5, final 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Introduced early ("future had arrived early, three suns ahead of schedule"). The temporal anomaly frames urgency ("Tonight the debt came due") and the protagonist's final act slows the early future ("the early future slowed, pacing itself to the rhythm of growing things"). However, the timeframe does not impose a visible countdown or alter tactics mid-scene—no moment shows a decision compressed by hours or minutes. Early signal +0.6, two beats (setup, closure image) +0.9, thematic linkage to closure +0.8. Baseline 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3, but vague tracking (no specific elapsed time or live clock) −0.4 and conceptual rather than tactical pressure +0.4, final 5.7; adjusting for weak mid-development, 5.7 holds.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Stated early ("I first sought the intersection: not for power, but because dreams had grown lonely"). The desire to reunite separated dreams drives the protagonist into the maze and frames the final grafting as a means to "keep both city and soil awake." The motivation is dramatized in the choice to let the maze drink rather than withdraw. Early signal +0.7, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, cost connection (forfeiting mobility to sustain the intersection) +0.5. Baseline 3.0 + 3.6 = 6.6, but the motivation is asserted in reflection rather than tested through competing wants −0.3; revising for thematic clarity, 6.9 final.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone coheres throughout: "anxious elation" is named twice and embodied in "lungs fizzing," "kite string humming before it snaps," "trembling midpoint between discovery and disaster." The tone modulates with pressure—calm in the child encounter, spiking during the grafting ("Pain flared, bright and clean"), and resolving in the final line ("anxious and elated, forever at dusk"). The tone charges the closure by sustaining contradictory affect (fear and joy) without false resolution. Early signal +0.7, modulation across beats +1.2, closure charge +1.6, specificity in embodiment +0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1, but repeated label ("anxious elation" appears three times) reduces subtlety −0.2, adjusting for strong embodiment +0.5, final 7.4.</comment>
