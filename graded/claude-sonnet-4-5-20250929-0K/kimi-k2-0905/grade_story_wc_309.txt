<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elian's internal state is embodied through concrete actions—touching frost, stepping onto vapor despite past failure, wrapping his badge around the keystone—and these choices narrow his options with visible cost. His "underachieving" identity drives the renunciation at closure, forfeiting credentials to preserve wonder. Minor slip: the mason flashback and "sacred in the simple" confession feel slightly abstract, edging toward epiphany rather than pure dramatization. The embodied contradiction between quota-driven performance and unmeasured joy is legible throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elian, spire balcony, automated-wonder world) arrive within the first ~60 words. Causal-plus-accumulative hybrid lens: the unlocking cantrip → mist stair → algorithms notice → keystone visions → badge-wrapping → stair dissolves form a motivated chain, and the closure (Elian stranded on snow island, credentials gone, drones blind to him) reconfigures options with felt cost—no return to the guild, new invisibility as both trap and freedom. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stair wavers and he must speak to the mist. Cost is legible: "without credentials, the spire's doors would not open."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire, frost-laced balcony, garden folly columns, and mist stair all constrain Elian's movement and choices—algorithms sealing air into glass forces urgency, the folly's transparency holds "memory of vines," the drifting snow island maroons him. Sensory detail (lilacs and printer toner, cold teaching patience) is filtered through his POV and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. Minor gap: the factory cities below arrive late and feel postcard rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve unmeasured wonder versus guild quantification—is signaled early and tightens when algorithms notice the anomaly. Elian's agency drives the turn: wrapping his badge around the keystone is a renunciation with visible cost (credentialed access forfeited, doors closed, invisibility imposed). The mist-stair wavering forces a mid-beat choice (speaking to the mist) that narrows tactics. No convenience rescue; the ending leaves him marooned with a planted seed of future light.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—sacredness in small, unmeasured acts versus automated wonder—emerges from particulars: barcoded snowflakes, children's pavement suns, paper boats, the keystone's "brilliant dimness." The closure image (unbarcoded snow, unpatented spell, servers logging "rounding error") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "quantity was the same as grace" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward stated thesis, and "sacredness hides in folds too small for automation's calipers" is a shade on-the-nose.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, perceptual signature is selective (printer toner mixed with lilacs, lumens as ration units), and diction stays consistent with a bookish mage's idiom. The single line of dialogue ("I'm looking for the sacred in the simple") feels slightly thesis-y but is anchored in the on-page moment and moves the mist to respond. Minor register drift: "accommodates impossibilities the way a drunk accommodates regrets" and "quantum of patience" edge toward authorial cleverness rather than Elian's stress-state voice. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"algorithmic auroras," "ribbon of warm light," "filament of unmeasured joy"—and while most land cleanly, the sheer volume risks overwriting in a ~1,600-word piece. Two paraphrase loops: "breath a garden folly of warmth" restates prior metaphor without added pressure; "darkness felt exactly bright enough" echoes "brilliant dimness" without deepening it. Sentence variety is strong, information density high, no template cadence detected. The loop and density issues pull the score below 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of bureaucratized creativity, keystone-as-pressure-valve, and credential-renunciation is specific and non-obvious; the paper-boat callback and unbarcoded snow at closure feel earned. The "underachieving mage in metered-wonder world" frame is fresh enough, though the "sacred in small things" moral calculus is familiar territory. Risk: the lyric-accumulative structure and extended metaphor field heighten ambition, but some images (algorithmic auroras, quota shrinking) are slightly prompt-adjacent rather than discovered through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elian appears in every beat and makes three key choices: whispering the unlocking cantrip, speaking to the mist under pressure, wrapping his badge around the keystone. The badge-wrapping decision directly alters tactics (folly crumbles, stair dissolves, doors close) and forecloses return to the guild with visible cost. Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure participation. Causal pressure is clear; cost is legible. Minor cap: "underachieving" is more backstory label than on-page constraint—his failure at mist walking is dramatized, but the "underachieving" trait itself does not visibly handicap a peak choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The keystone pulses in the opening, Elian touches it mid-scene (visions inside), wraps his badge around it (major turn), and its darkness settles in his chest at closure, seeding future light. Three distinct beats; the badge-wrapping transforms its luminance into dullness, causing the folly to collapse and the stair to dissolve—high causal pressure. Closure linkage strong: "keystone's darkness settle in his chest like a seed" charges the final image. Specificity: opal block, scrap moonlight origin, the dark vein formed by melted copper.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" frames the stakes early (quota shrinking, keystone's stubborn glow) and the resolution hinges on Elian choosing to dull the luminance via his badge, making the stone "worthless" to guild metrics. The concept shapes the central trade-off: preserve wonder by hiding its glow. Present in setup (keystone pulsing), middle (visions of pre-automation joy), and closure (darkness as seed, unbarcoded snow). Causal role in the major turn. Cost tied to it: losing credentials, gaining invisibility, planting unmeasured future light.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Accommodates impossibilities" is attributed to the folly via tutor joke early, returns as thematic frame ("valve that released pressure from the impossible"), and Elian enacts it by choosing a "partial solution" rather than binary win/loss. The trait enables his tactic of reversing the badge shackle. Present in setup (tutor joke), reweighted at mid-scene realization, implicit in closure choice. Causal link is medium: the attribute names the thematic logic but does not constrain a physical action as tightly as the keystone or mist stair. Moderate specificity; could be swapped for "harbors contradictions" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elian "unstraps" his guild badge early (setup: badge as credential) and the major turn is wrapping/unstrapping it around the keystone—metal melts, luminance dims, folly collapses, stair dissolves, doors close. The action redefines his options: no return route, no guild access, new invisibility. Present in two beats (physical unstrap, conceptual reversal of shackle). High causal pressure; not easily swappable. Closure cost directly traces to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mist walking is introduced as "a discipline he had failed for lack of grace," dramatized when he steps onto the vapor ("each footfall sank inches"), and tested when the stair wavers mid-descent—forcing him to speak to the mist to stabilize it. The method shapes two beats and his survival depends on succeeding despite past failure. Present in setup (failed discipline), middle (step and waver test), and closure participation (stair dissolves after he reaches the folly). Moderate causal pressure; the mechanics (negotiation between doubt and surface tension) matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire and garden folly structure every beat: balcony perch, folly jutting below, mist stair descent, transparent columns at ground level, drifting snow island at closure. The spire's algorithms apply pressure (sealing air into glass), and the folly's architecture (four columns, hovering keystone) enables the visions and turn. Spatial choreography is clear. Present in setup, middle, and closure (marooned on snow island with no return route). Cost tied to location: physical isolation above the clouds with doors closed.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"When creativity gets automated" establishes the world state early and frames the dominant stake (wonder rationed, quota shrinking). The timeframe is static rather than ticking—no live clock tightens decisions within the scene. It provides thematic context and motivation but does not alter tactics beat-by-beat. Present in setup (opening exposition) and closure resonance (servers logging loss, continued automation). Moderate causal role: it names the pressure but does not escalate moment-to-moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's desire "to find the sacred in the simple" is stated in his confession to the mist and underlies his keystone visions (children painting, lovers folding boats) and closure choice (composing purposeless spell, valuing dim moments). The motivation is dramatized through action (touching keystone, wrapping badge, folding paper boat) with visible trade-off (credentials for unmeasured joy). Present in setup (come to feel unmeasured), middle (confession, visions), closure (unmeasured joy, unbarcoded snow). Friction between guild metrics and sacred simplicity drives the turn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" anchors tone from the opening (keystone's stubborn luminance, algorithmic auroras) through the turn (luminance drunk into darkness, stone looks dull/worthless) to closure (darkness felt "exactly bright enough," unmeasured joy as filament). The oxymoron coheres across beats and charges the final image. Tone modulates with pressure—lyric density rises at the visions, quiets at the marooned ending—without breaking. The recurring pairing of light and dimness reweights the stake at closure.</comment>
