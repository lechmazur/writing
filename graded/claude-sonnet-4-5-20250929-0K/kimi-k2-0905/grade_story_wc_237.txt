<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina's interior life is richly embodied—"heartbeat felt like a rune gone wrong," breath crystallizing into needles—and her motivation to rewrite grief through ritual is concrete and contradictory. The brother's death operates as a live constraint that shapes her present choices (timing the twelfth stroke, accepting terror as anchor). Master Jomei remains functional but thin, serving primarily as witness rather than applying independent pressure. The final agency—speaking the brother's name into the storm—earns its weight through prior embodied struggle, though the shift from crystallized silence to flight feels slightly declarative in the final line.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (floating rock, mossy underside, kettle hissing without sound) and maintains it through storm imagery and rune-work beats. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (floating platform, tatami circle, Lina at northern edge). One meaningful tightening occurs when the twelfth stroke seals and crystallized breath shatters into luminous sentences, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid) where scars become speakable words. Cost is legible: the crow-quill splits, the platform rises, and Lina leaves the tool behind as proof she no longer needs bated-breath ritual. A brief causality seam appears when motes "soaked into the fibers like ink reclaiming itself"—the mechanism of Master Jomei's exhalation pushing them feels slightly scaffolded rather than inevitably linked to prior rune logic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating rock and its mossy underside, the iron kettle's soundless hiss, and the tea-dark lake create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Lina's choices: no railing, trust or terror required, the plume's timing a live clock. The crow-quill's trimmed tip and its hairline fracture function as tool-as-setting, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (northern edge, opposite placement, knee-high rain bounce). The setting actively shapes the final turn: the platform exhales and rises when she releases her brother's name, embedding the environment in the emotional arc. Minor softness: "storm clouds stacked above like bruised shelves" leans decorative in an otherwise purposeful frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transform scars into stories by completing the rune before the kettle's plume—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Lina holds her breath (crystallizing it painfully) while racing the kettle's steam, and the twelfth stroke seals with an audible click that shatters the crystallized air into motes. The resolution is earned by her agency (completing the stroke, speaking the name) with visible cost (split quill, the platform rising as weight lifts). The youthful superstition functions as both constraint and method, lending causal pressure. Slight hedge: the typhoon's arrival "the instant her lungs refilled" reads as convenience timing rather than strictly causal, though it does not resolve the core problem.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—grief as crystallized substance that must be broken and reformed into speech—emerges organically from the rune-work, held breath, and shattered motes without overt statement. The final image (the platform rising, the broken quill left behind, "stories, unlike bodies, know how to fly") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in the kettle's questioning plume, the brother's pine-pitch laugh, and Master Jomei's silent witnessing. One minor intrusion: "scars are merely stories impatient to be read" in paragraph fifteen flirts with thesis statement, though it is attributed to Master Jomei and immediately questioned by Lina's thought, which salvages it as voiced doubt rather than authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Lina's perceptual signature: rune-scholar specificity (crow-quill, squid-ink with powdered jade), embodied metaphor (heartbeat as rune gone wrong), and grief-filtered attention (the brother's laugh as wind through pine). Diction remains character-apt throughout pressure (no register drift). Distance modulates purposefully: close during the stroke sequence, wider for the storm's arrival and Master Jomei's tea-pouring. One brief convergence: "tools that had done their job and could now rest" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward narrator commentary rather than Lina's idiom, though it does not break the stance. No dialogue clutter; Master Jomei's single line ("The storm listens now; tell it who you are") carries ceremonial weight and advances plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, memory, or weather. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (breath crystallizing, motes as luminous sentences, platform as falling moon). Two patterns approach overwriting: "the wet slap of lake water receiving a body" and "bitter leaves and lake-cold wind" stack sensory modifiers without adding pressure; "stories, unlike bodies, know how to fly" in the final sentence declares theme rather than trusting the prior image. Minor template cadence in paragraph twelve: "She remembered...how it had sounded...an echo she could still hear" cycles synonyms. No loops or scaffold elsewhere; propulsion is strong through the stroke sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—rune-magic as grief therapy performed on a floating platform during a typhoon—feels specific and non-obvious, with the breath-timing superstition and crystallization metaphor anchoring freshness. The transformation of "crystallized air" into "luminous sentences" and then into ink is a purposeful extension of the premise rather than genre decoration. Risk-taking (the held-breath clock, the soundless kettle, the tea ceremony frame for lethal stakes) heightens pressure without gimmickry. One proximity concern: "scars into stories" and "stories know how to fly" echo therapeutic-memoir idiom common in contemporary literary markets, though the ritual frame and storm choreography personalize the trope enough to avoid pure derivation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lina as budding rune scholar frames the opening (misdrawn rune since childhood, scholarly precision at twenty), drives the middle beat (completing the twelfth stroke before the plume), and delivers the closure choice (speaking her brother's name). The character's past failure and present agency create causal linkage across all three gates with visible cost (split quill, platform rising).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crow-quill appears in paragraph four (steadying the trimmed tip), paragraph nine (dipping into squid-ink), paragraph fourteen (keeping it moving during the eleventh stroke), paragraph seventeen (setting it down), and paragraph twenty-four (the split tip as proof of torn story). Its hairline fracture "resembling a lightning bolt" directly charges the closure image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; one small friction: the trimmed tip is described but its specific constraint (why trimmed? what does that enable or limit?) is never dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core concept "breath between storms" appears thematically in the held breath (paragraphs four, fourteen) and in Master Jomei's instruction: "the breath between storms when the world itself paused to listen." It constrains Lina's tactic (she must finish before the plume) and reappears in the saturated hush beneath rain impacts. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure image, but the concept itself does not alter options as directly as the youthful superstition or the quill—it functions more as atmospheric frame than as causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Crystallizes when stressed" governs the central action: Lina's held breath crystallizes into needles (paragraph fourteen), then shatters outward into motes (paragraph seventeen) that carry memory fragments. The attribute enables the transformation at closure (crystallized shards become speakable words) with visible cost (painful needles pricking from inside). Present across three beats with causal work; one friction: the verb "crystallizes" is used literally for breath but metaphorically for memories, and the shift between registers is asserted rather than earned through a single consistent physical logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The action "shed" does not appear explicitly on the page. If interpreted as shedding the crystallized breath into motes, that beat (paragraph seventeen) is pivotal but the verb itself is not foregrounded. If interpreted as leaving the broken quill halves (paragraph twenty-four), that moment supports closure but is described as "left" rather than "shed." The action is structurally present but lexically elided, limiting demonstrable integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method "revisiting youthful superstitions" is signaled in paragraph ten (the twelfth stroke timing superstition she had never shed) and paragraph twelve (she revisits it deliberately with scholarly precision). It constrains the middle tactic (racing the kettle's plume) and is paid off when the twelfth stroke seals successfully (paragraph seventeen). Present in setup, middle, and implied at closure (the superstition is proven workable or transformed). One friction: the method is told ("chasing the same timing with scholarly precision") more than shown—we do not see her adjust technique based on study.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The floating rock tea ceremony platform anchors every beat: no railing (terror or trust required), tatami circle around the kettle, tea-dark lake below. It constrains Lina's physical stance (crouched, knees aching), supplies the kettle as timing clock, and literally rises three inches at closure when relieved of weight. The setting is indispensable—remove it and the story's spatial logic, stakes, and final image collapse. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "during a held breath" is literalized: Lina holds her breath from paragraph four ("feeling the momentary pulse of her held breath—one beat, two") through paragraph fourteen ("Lina's lungs burned, the held breath crystallizing") until paragraph seventeen ("the twelfth stroke" and "her lungs refilled"). The held breath creates a ticking clock that tightens decisions and shapes the crystallization mechanic. Present across setup, middle escalation, and release at closure with visible cost (burning lungs, needle-prick pain). Strong integration; one friction: exact duration is vague (how many seconds? how many strokes per second?).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to transform scars into stories" is stated in paragraph six and dramatized through Lina's choice to revisit the superstition (paragraph twelve), complete the rune despite pain (paragraphs fourteen–seventeen), and speak her brother's name aloud (paragraph twenty-five). The motivation drives the dominant stake and is tested at closure when the motes become ink and then speech. Visible cost: split quill, weight lifted. One friction: the phrase "transform scars into stories" appears verbatim twice (paragraphs six and twenty-four), the second as a confirmation rather than a contested realization, which leans slightly declarative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tone "saturated hush" is established early (kettle hissing without sound, dew that never falls) and modulates under pressure: the "saturated hush beneath each impact" of rain (paragraph twenty-three) charges the final image. Tone coherence holds across turns (from silent dread to storm roar to post-storm calm) and the adjective "saturated" returns with reweighted meaning (from moisture-laden to emotionally drenched). Strong closure linkage and purposeful modulation; no tonal breaks or false notes.</comment>
