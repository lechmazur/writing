<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The jewelry maker's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her interior life consists largely of abstract reflection about grief and transformation without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final "understanding" arrives as summary rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the decade of solitude is told rather than shown to foreclose options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but weakens because the "work" of placing origami figures unfolds as iterative description without meaningful tightening or deepening—each placement restates the same thematic content. Closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (she will leave and change her craft), but the cost is asserted in summary ("carrying loss not as a burden") rather than made visible on the page. The coordinates mechanic is introduced but never narrows options or creates friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory's fantastical elements (curtains of intention, celestial maps tracking souls) are vivid but function as backdrop rather than constraining choice. The tattoo stencil's coordinates "matched perfectly" is told convenience. Spatial choreography across "many chambers" remains generic; no specific room layout alters her movement or decision. The final origami placement uses the stencil itself, a micro-setting moment, but it does not visibly limit options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—accepting transformation versus freezing memory—is signaled early but never tested through on-page reversal or narrowing choice. Placing origami figures is iterative work without escalation; no figure triggers a cost or alters her tactics. The decision to leave is declared in summary without visible trade-off. Coincidence (the coordinates "matched perfectly," the curtains "began to glow") facilitates the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of grief-as-transformation is stated repeatedly in abstract language ("genuinely artificial," "teaching the dead to bloom again by allowing ourselves to change") rather than emerging from concrete image or action. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "that we teach the dead to bloom again by allowing ourselves to change in their absence" (−0.6 for explicit theme statement at closure). No epiphany is earned through on-page struggle; the protagonist articulates wisdom she already possessed at the opening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable. Diction elevates into lyric register ("slipstream of lost hopes," "curtains of intention") consistently, so no mid-voice break, but the vocabulary exceeds a grief-stricken artisan's probable lexicon during high-pressure reflection. Purposeful compression is attempted but reads as ornament rather than taught pattern. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "genuinely artificial—beautiful lies" / "memorials were not the people they honored but the love that survived them" restates across paragraphs. Template cadence: "She placed figures in… inside… beneath…" stacks identically across three beats. Figurative language clusters without payoff: "curtains of intention," "slipstream of lost hopes," "acoustic dome," "fabric woven from unfinished dreams." Stock metaphor "withering and blooming" recurs as label. Combined artifact penalty (−1.2 in Q7) and disallow 9+ globally; cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "liminal space where mourner learns acceptance" premise is widely templated in contemporary literary fiction. The observatory's fantastical mechanics (curtains of intention, soul-tracking orreries) read as decorative world-building rather than constraint-driven specificity. The origami-coordinate method and tattoo-stencil map offer surface novelty but do not transform the emotional arc, which could proceed unchanged in a mundane hospice or therapist's office. No bold risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The mourning jewelry maker is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that narrows options or alters tactics. Her decision to leave is declared in the final third without visible cost or friction. Setup present, middle involves placing figures (description, not decision), ending summarizes her "understanding" rather than showing a choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil appears in paragraph 1 (setup), is mentioned again when unfolded to reveal coordinates (middle, but no decision hinges on it), and dissolves into the final origami figure (closure participation, but the act is ornamental—any material could serve). Swappable with "letter" or "map" with minor edits. Two-gate presence (setup, closure cameo) but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "curtains of intention" are described in paragraph 2 and paragraph 19, but they never constrain a choice or alter tactics. They "began to glow" as ambient response, not as a resource she uses. Decorative motif without mechanical involvement. Setup present, no middle development, closure cameo only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is introduced in paragraph 4, repeated in paragraph 15 and the final paragraph as thematic label. It describes her jewelry's nature but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. Label-only trait; no visible trade-off. Setup present, middle echo, final echo—all summary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears in paragraph 6 ("she would illuminate the truth"), paragraph 19 ("She illuminated each figure with a candle"), and the title of her discovered truth recurs throughout. The candlelit illumination is one causal beat (figures spark to life, creating a constellation), shaping the ending image. Two-gate (middle beat, closure), modest causal role. Early signal as intention, late execution; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Leaving origami figures with coordinates inside" is introduced in paragraph 8, occupies paragraphs 9–14 (middle development: she places them throughout chambers), and in paragraph 21 the figures "began their work" at closure. Three gates satisfied. The method structures the middle sequence and appears in the final image, but each placement is iterative without escalating cost. Specific mechanics matter (folding, coordinates inside), lifting above merely functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "timeless observatory" is anchored in paragraph 1 (setup) and its chambers/mechanisms are used in the middle (she places figures in telescope, clocks, orreries). It does not constrain her movement or alter tactics—she moves freely through "many chambers" without friction. Closure occurs as she "passed through the observatory's doors," a spatial exit but no environmental cost. Two-gate, replaceable with any large symbolic building.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" is stated in paragraph 3 and echoed in the final paragraph ("other lost souls who would find their way here after hitting their own rock bottom"). The timeframe is past-tense framing, not a live pressure. No urgency or deadline alters her pace of work. Told backstory anchor without present cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To teach withering to bloom again" is introduced in paragraph 8, repeated in paragraphs 12, 18, and 21. The motivation is stated but not dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page friction. She already understands the lesson at the opening (paragraph 12: "the tattoo stencil had been her daughter's final gift, a map to this place where… a mourning mother could learn…"). No internal obstacle or cost paid to reach this understanding. Told desire, no friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is present in paragraph 11 ("her subdued ardor manifested in the precise folds") and coheres with the reflective, elegiac register throughout. Tone remains stable—no modulation under pressure because pressure is minimal. The final image attempts elevation ("genuinely artificial and truly alive") but the tone does not charge or reweight prior material; it restates. Coherent, static, minimal closure charge.</comment>
