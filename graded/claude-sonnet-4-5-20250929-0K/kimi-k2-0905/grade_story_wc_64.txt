<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mercy's interiority is present but often delivered as poetic narration rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final decision to descend feels more mythic than earned by prior micro-choices; we see her "understand" rather than wrestle with competing impulses. The grandmother backstory arrives late and risks feeling convenient, though it does anchor the ending in personal history. Emotional states remain abstract—"uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs"—rather than contradictory and visceral.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece accumulates symbols and clues across beats, and the final descent offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, orientation debt is present: who Mercy is beyond "blithe gardener," where exactly we are in the cemetery, and what "after the chess clock runs down" means temporally remain unclear past 120 words. The closure reweights the opening images (spiral, tapestry, seeds) but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; we are told she is "charged to let the dead speak" rather than shown a visible foreclosure. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt and waive deeper penalty since the pattern does eventually cohere at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, tapestry, and spiral coin constrain Mercy's literal path and charge the final image. Micro-setting—ladder, drawer, iron rungs—guides the descent with tactile specificity. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "starlight drips," "scent of preserved apples," "velveteen gloom." The chess-clock motif and celestial backdrop create atmospheric pressure without tourism. No cap from Q2 orientation penalty applies here; setting work is strong enough to mitigate some narrative fog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discover the shape of intentions. Pressure accumulates through clue-solving (coin, tapestry, map) but Mercy's agency reads more as receptive decoding than agonized choice. The tightening occurs when the hidden panel reveals the map, narrowing her path to one action: dig at the lamb's feet. Cost is present but conceptual—she becomes "the next keeper of the spiral"—rather than a visible forfeiture that alters tactics. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length, but the final turn feels mythic rather than motivated by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: memory as planted message, tending as decoding, the dead speaking through arrangement. The spiral-coin cipher and seed-packet inscriptions ("hope, defiance, return") offer resonant particulars rather than thesis statements. The final image—setting the chess clock to infinite, untangling seed packets—reweights the opening without moralizing. However, "memory can outwager oblivion" flirts with overt thematic declaration. The piece resists easy answers and invites reflection through its nested mysteries.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-close. Voice is lyric and elevated: "velveteen gloom," "intentions folded," "audible chords." Diction remains consistent, though some phrases—"blithe gardener," "tenderly organized heart"—feel prompt-adjacent rather than character-specific. No dialogue on the page. Purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (chess clock, spiral, velveteen) are taught early and paid off at closure. Psychic distance is controlled; Mercy's perceptual signature emphasizes geometry, texture, and tending. Minor register drift into mythic exposition ("the next keeper of the spiral") at the end, but the effect is intentional and the closure remains legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentences open with verbs, nouns, and prepositional phrases. Information density is high—nearly every line advances symbol, space, or discovery. However, figurative language is dense throughout: "echoes flutter through her ribs," "starlight drips," "tapestry breathing," "velveteen gloom settles." In high-pressure beats (tapestry decoding, final descent), metaphor stacks without pausing for concrete action, risking opacity. A paraphrase loop appears: "the dead have been planting messages" is restated as "let the dead speak through her arrangements." Minor template cadence in the opening: "She is clipping... She lifts... She pockets... She wheels." Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues, but clarity at closure remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The nested-mystery structure (coin → tapestry → map → cellar) and the gardener-as-decoder frame offer a fresh synthesis of cemetery Gothic and WWII-resistance backstory. The spiral cipher, grandmother's seed packets, and chess-clock motif are specific and purposeful. However, the "keeper of intentions" mythology and the "tenderly organized heart" unlock feel close to quest-fantasy templates. Transformation is present in the occupational grounding (pruning, seedlings, spade work) and the WWII refugee-cellar detail. Risk-taking in lyric compression and symbol density heightens stakes without full obscurity, warranting modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mercy is present throughout and her choices (lift coin, climb ladder, decode border, dig at lamb) drive all major beats. She appears early and shapes the ending by descending and accepting the keeper role. However, her "blithe" quality is asserted rather than dramatized in action; the trait does not constrain a key choice with visible cost. Causal role is solid across setup, development, and payoff, but replaceability is moderate—another seeker-decoder could fill the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in beat one (discovery), beat two (pulses warm near tapestry), and closure (pockets it, presses coin into door). Early signal, multiple beats, and closure linkage are all present. The coin's spiral motif directly enables the tapestry unlock and map discovery. However, "antique sovereign case" itself is less active than the coin it contains; the case is half-buried, lifted, and mentioned but the coin does the causal work. Treat as integrated across three gates with moderate causal pressure; the case is a container rather than an irreplaceable agent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" appears early ("feels uncharted echoes flutter through her ribs") and returns at the map beat ("The uncharted echoes swell into audible chords"). It names the conceptual stake but does not constrain tactics or alter a choice on the page. The echoes are told-felt rather than shown as a pressure that narrows options. Present in setup and development, but payoff is thematic rather than causal. Functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears early (tools in wheelbarrow, "tenderly organized by moonlight") and at closure ("a tenderly organized heart could unlock"). It shapes the unlock condition—only someone with this trait can break the curse—giving it causal weight at the ending. However, the trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice with visible cost; we see tidy tools but no on-page tradeoff where tenderness forecloses another path. Present in setup and payoff, light in development. Moderate integration with closure linkage but limited cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Untangle" is the central action: Mercy untangles frayed threads in the tapestry border (beat two) to decode the cipher, which yields the message and unlocks the hidden panel. The final line returns to untangling ("begins to untangle packets of seeds"). Early signal, multiple beats, and closure participation are all present. The action is specific and irreplaceable—swapping to "decode" alone would lose the textile/gardening through-line. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the story would break without this exact verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method appears at beat two ("by decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border, she teases out repeating knots that mirror the spiral") and enables the message, panel, and map discovery. Setup is clear, mechanics are shown on the page (knots as letters, grandmother's sewing songs as cipher key), and the payoff drives the descent. The method is specific and irreplaceable; swapping to "reading an inscription" would collapse the textile/grandmother/sewing connection. Strong causal pressure, early signal, and closure linkage. Minor deduction for the method being solved in one beat without setback.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo appears early (paragraph five: "wheels the barrow toward the cobalt silo"), houses the tapestry and decoding action (beats two and three), and frames the descent (final beat: "hears the cobalt silo door lock"). Setting provides resources (ladder, tapestry, skylight starlight) and constrains movement (narrow drawer, iron rungs). The silo's verticality (climb ladder, descend into cellar) is causal. Early signal, multiple beats, and closure participation with moderate causal pressure. The silo is integral but the "under stars" detail is scenic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the chess clock runs down" appears in the opening line and is echoed twice ("church bells tolling one, then two, marking the hour after the chess clock runs down" and "chess clock of night moves toward endgame"). At closure Mercy "sets her chess clock to infinite." The timeframe is present in setup and payoff but does not tighten decisions or tactics in the middle beats; clocks toll but Mercy's pacing is unhurried. The metaphor charges the final image (infinite time = eternal keepership) but does not create on-page urgency. Moderate thematic integration, weak tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To discover the shape of intentions" is stated early (paragraph four: "she wants to discover the shape of intentions before dawn pruning begins") and returned at closure ("Mercy understands the shape of intentions: the dead have been planting messages"). Desire drives the investigation across beats (lift coin, decode tapestry, dig). However, motivation is more quest-driven than conflicted; no visible friction between wants and costs. The desire is told and pursued but not dramatized as a tradeoff that forecloses another path. Present across three gates with moderate causal pressure but limited cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" opens the story and sets tone; "velveteen" does not return but "gloom" modulates through "starlight drips," "moonlight," "lamplight," and "cobalt" hues across beats. Tone remains cohesive—elegiac, quiet, lyric—and charges the final image (seed packets in lamplight, clock set to infinite). The tone does not shift under pressure but deepens through layered imagery. Coherent through turns with modest closure charge. Strong setup and payoff, light middle modulation.</comment>
