<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is clear and his grief embodied through the warming prism and physical gestures (forehead to door, kneeling). The interior voice carries distinct texture ("truthful lies") and the final renunciation feels earned. However, interiority occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("aggregate sorrow baked into vinyl and steel") that reads more poetic than character-particular, and the core change—fractured grief repositioned—lacks a visible forfeiture that would charge the final image with higher cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the prism ritual accumulates pressure through layered lies and sensory intensification until the truthful admission cracks the "shifted hush" and opens a path. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the fracture knits, grief is repositioned, prism left on dashboard)—cost is felt as relinquishment. Orientation anchors early (quartz arbor, sister's car). One friction: the causal link between the lies and the environmental responses (mist freezing, hush cracking) reads more as metaphor than motivated world-rule, creating mild lens drift between lyric accumulation and implied magical causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quartz arbor, frost patterns, and the car interior are vivid and selective, filtering through Elian's grief-charged perception. The prism's use constrains his ritual and the frost "braille" charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (arbor edge → car window → dashboard → path out). One minor slip: "silicon heart" for quartz reads as a slight factual stumble (quartz is crystalline silica, not silicon), but does not break immersion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: commune with sister's absorbed sorrow to manage his grief. The ritual tightens through escalating lies and environmental responses, culminating in the truthful admission that cracks the hush. Cost is legible: he leaves the prism behind, repositioning grief rather than erasing it. However, the escalation mechanism (lies warming the prism, freezing mist) reads more as lyric correlation than agentic narrowing of options, slightly softening the felt necessity of each turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—grief as substance transferable to objects, truthful lies as passage—emerges through ritual particulars and avoids explicit moralizing. The prism's fracture mirrors Elian's internal state, and the final exchange ("Keep the colors; I'll keep the hush") reconfigures prior material. One weakness: "truthful lies" is invoked frequently as a label rather than fully dramatized through contradictory costs, and the academic heresy/pilgrimage claim feels like thematic scaffolding rather than organic discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (grief-colored, mystic idiom). Voice modulates effectively under pressure ("I need you still" breaking through the lies). Elision of the sister's exact death is purposeful and paid off through frost-braille and refracted moment. One friction: elevated diction ("aggregate sorrow," "mineral breath," "shifted hush") occasionally pulls away from embodied perception toward poetic assertion, especially in high-pressure beats, creating mild register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs (prism warming, frost as braille). Figurative language is dense but largely coherent. However, overwriting clusters appear in mid-story beats: "shifted hush bloom," "dew paused mid-air," "bruised violets and urgent reds," "frozen lightning"—metaphoric stacking that obscures concrete action. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs 6–7 restate mist tightening and quartz singing. Template cadence: several "He [verb]" openings across adjacent paragraphs. These artifacts dull momentum and trigger cumulative penalties (−0.8 in Q7, plus final-third presence disallows 9+ globally).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—objects absorb emotion, accessed through ritual—offers a fresh angle on grief processing. The quartz arbor and frost-braille specificity elevate execution. However, the "mystic communes through symbolic object" template is widely used, and the core emotional arc (bereaved sibling seeks closure at death site) follows familiar beats. The "truthful lies" conceit is striking but remains more poetic label than transformed trope with non-obvious implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elian's choices (pressing prism, whispering lies, admitting need, leaving prism) drive key beats and the final relinquishment. Present early, active in middle ritual, shapes closure. Causal pressure moderate (ritual escalates but feels more lyric than tactical), closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Prism appears early (paragraph 3), used in multiple beats (window press, light refraction, warming/fracturing), and left on dashboard at closure with reweighted meaning. Its warming/fracturing mechanic enables ritual progression and final relinquishment. High irreplaceability and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Shifted hush" invoked repeatedly as atmospheric label and tied to the moment when sound returns. It shapes the ritual's endpoint (hush cracks, path revealed) but functions more as thematic echo than a mechanic that narrows on-page options. Present early, pays off at closure, but causal pressure is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears in opening and closing lines as descriptive anchor. It frames Elian's stance but does not constrain or enable specific choices with visible cost. Label-only use without dramatized tradeoff; swappable with "steady" or "rooted."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Commune" is the central action—ritual of lies, prism use, and admission—and structures the entire arc. Signaled early, drives middle beats, culminates in final admission and relinquishment. Causal role strong, though the communing mechanic (lies → environmental response) reads more lyric than agentic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Frost patterns as "braille" of sister's fingernail scratches appears mid-story (paragraph 5), shapes one vivid beat, and charges the refracted moment. Method signaled and used but not repeated or developed tactically; closure focuses on prism and dashboard rather than frost. One strong beat, moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Quartz arbor present from opening, its mist and "glass-soft song" frame the ritual, and its clearing signals resolution. Environment pressures mood and supplies the final path. However, spatial constraint on choices is mild—arbor functions more as atmospheric backdrop than tactical resource. Early signal, closure participation, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" invoked in opening and closing paragraphs as thematic bracket. No on-page clock or temporal urgency tightens decisions; the ritual unfolds at contemplative pace. Label-only timeframe without dramatized constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to prove objects absorb emotions stated explicitly (paragraph 11) and underlies the entire ritual. Dramatized through prism use, frost reading, final relinquishment. Friction between academic proof and personal need is implicit but not fully explored as competing wants. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" invoked explicitly (paragraphs 7–8, 16, 27) and structures the ritual's escalating admissions. Tone modulates from mysticism to raw admission. However, the phrase remains more poetic assertion than fully embodied tonal shift—lies feel symbolic rather than creating distinct contradictory pressures. Present throughout, charges closure moderately, but causal texture thin.</comment>
