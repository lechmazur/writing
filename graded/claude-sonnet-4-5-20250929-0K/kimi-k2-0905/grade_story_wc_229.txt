<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The assistant lighthouse keeper's motivation is established (proving whispers travel farther), but her internal experience relies heavily on abstract claims ("screaming tenderness," "purifies intentions") rather than embodied contradictions. The mother's drowning and the protagonist's isolation are told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The final beckoning gesture and the boat's response feel more symbolic than causally earned by prior struggle, and the therapeutic language ("vibrations of intent travel farther than any voice") flattens what could be urgent grief into a concept.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: the protagonist performs a ritual sequence (climbing, adjusting the beacon, descending to the garden, floating the cork, beckoning the boat) that layers sensory and symbolic material toward a final image. However, causality is weak—each step feels inevitable by authorial design rather than arising from constrained choice or escalating pressure. The closure image (the boat changing course, the protagonist's realization about her mother) offers conceptual repricing, but the cost remains abstract and felt rather than visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt tower, garden, and dawn light provide vivid anchors, and the sensory details (night flowers, salt air, metallic taste of rain) are selective and atmospheric. The vial cork and fountain at closure create a charged micro-setting. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop and symbol rather than constraining choice—the protagonist moves freely through the lighthouse and garden without spatial friction or resource limitation. The professional duties of lighthouse-keeping (lamp mechanics, beacon pulse adjustment) are gestured at but not grounded in plausible procedure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving whispers can guide ships) is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is minimal: the protagonist performs a premeditated ritual without meaningful opposition, reversal, or cost that forecloses a live option. The boat's course change at the end feels coincidental rather than earned by her agency. The claimed cost—her mother's disappearance, ongoing grief—is backstory rather than an on-page price paid during this ritual. Under the accumulative lens, the piece layers atmosphere but does not deepen or tighten pressure through a credible turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme (softer frequencies carry truth farther than mechanical force) emerges through image and action rather than overt statement, and the recurring vial cork and night-flower scent provide purposeful motifs. The mother's transformation into "vibrations too subtle for searchlights" offers a non-literal conceptual answer. However, the final insight feels stated rather than earned: "the softest voice can travel farthest if it carries enough screaming tenderness" verges on thematic summary. The oxymoron "screaming tenderness" recurs too often as a label, reducing its resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the diction (cobalt, jasmine, mercury glass) is controlled and purposeful. However, the voice drifts into elevated, nearly allegorical register ("vibrations of intent," "purifies intentions the way fire purifies water") that feels authorial rather than filtered through the protagonist's lived grief. Phrases like "screaming tenderness" and "unbearable love" cluster in peak beats, creating a rhythm of poetic assertion that distances the reader from immediate embodied experience. The perceptual signature is more lyric than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose is imagistic, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "dawn bleeding across the horizon like a wound finally allowed to close," "hands moved to the beacon's controls with the screaming tenderness of someone who has loved a broken thing too long," "purifies intentions the way fire purifies water." Several sentences restate the same conceptual claim in adjacent lines (e.g., multiple references to "vibrations of intent" and "screaming tenderness"). The phrase "screaming tenderness" appears five times, becoming a scaffold. Clarity suffers under the metaphoric load, especially in the climactic final paragraphs where the prose prioritizes lyric texture over propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-keeping, grief, and synesthetic "vibrations of intent" offers a fresh angle, and the night-garden scent as a beckoning mechanism is specific. However, the core premise (proving gentle signals outlast harsh ones) is a familiar romantic trope, and the story does not complicate it with counter-pressure or moral calculus. The oxymoron "screaming tenderness" aims for bold juxtaposition but becomes repetitive rather than transformative. The risk-taking in lyric mode is evident, but the lack of causal friction limits the piece's capacity to surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The assistant lighthouse keeper is present throughout and makes several choices (waiting for the heat wave to break, adjusting the beacon, descending to the garden, floating the cork, beckoning the boat). However, these choices feel ritualistic and premeditated rather than reactive to on-page pressure. Her agency does not create a meaningful turn; the sequence unfolds as intended without reversal or cost that alters tactics. She is the lens but not the pivot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The vial cork appears in three beats: pressed to her lips for a whispered intention, set floating in the fountain to scatter light, and noted as "still vibrating" in the final paragraph. Its function evolves from vessel of memory to conduit of spoken intent to ongoing transmission. However, the cork does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it is a symbolic prop that the protagonist uses as planned. Its reprise at closure reweights prior material but does not decisively shape the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" is introduced early as her mother's teaching and becomes the protagonist's operating principle. It shapes her tactics (adjusting the beacon to pulse like a heartbeat, whispering into the cork, beckoning the boat) and is thematized throughout. However, it functions more as a metaphysical claim than a dramatized mechanism with visible cost or friction. The boat's course change is attributed to this concept, but the reader cannot distinguish causality from coincidence. The concept is present across beats but remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Purifies intentions" is invoked explicitly ("this specific combination…purifies intentions the way fire purifies water") and implicitly through the ritual sequence. However, it is label-only: the story does not dramatize what unpurified intentions look like or what cost purification demands. The protagonist's intentions appear already clarified before the ritual begins, so the attribute does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Beckoning appears in the garden (flowers "beckon her downward"), in her final gesture toward the boat, and thematically as the whisper "I'm still here, I still love you." The final beckoning gesture is the climactic action, and the boat's response is attributed to it. However, the protagonist planned this from the start; it does not arise from a turn or reversal. The action is present in the closure beat and shapes the ending image, but its causal force is ambiguous—coincidence could explain the boat's course change equally well.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The scent of the garden at night is signaled early ("night flowers released their perfume") and sustained through the middle (gardenia, tobacco flower, molecules of sweetness and decay). The protagonist explicitly believes the scent combination is essential to purification, and she descends to the garden to breathe it in and let it "clarify" her intentions. The method appears in closure (she is "breathing the last of the night scent"). However, the mechanics are vague—how scent transmits a beckoning across water is asserted, not demonstrated. The method is present but not tested or constrained.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is anchored in the opening line and sustained throughout. The tower's "cool iron door," spiral stairs, lamp room, and beacon provide spatial structure. The cobalt glass is invoked as part of the purification combination, and the beacon's pulse (adjusted to heartbeat rhythm) is the protagonist's first ritual act. The dawn timing is linked to the heat wave breaking and the night flowers' final scent release. The setting provides resources (beacon, garden, fountain) and atmospheric charge. However, it does not constrain choice—the protagonist moves through it freely without friction. The cobalt color and dawn light charge the final image but do not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe (after the heat wave breaks) is established in the opening sentence and motivates the protagonist's action: she has "waited three sweltering weeks for this moment, when the air would stop screaming and let subtler things be heard." The cool dawn allows the night flowers to release scent and creates the conditions for her ritual. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—the protagonist is not racing a clock or facing a narrowing window. It is a background condition rather than a live constraint that alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation (to prove that whispers travel farther than shouts) is stated explicitly and dramatized through the protagonist's ritual sequence. It is rooted in her mother's teaching and her ongoing grief. However, the motivation is not conflicted—there is no competing want or cost that forces a tradeoff. The protagonist pursues her goal without internal friction or external opposition. The desire is present and drives the plot, but it lacks the tension between want and fear or want and need that would elevate it into high integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" appears five times as an oxymoronic descriptor and thematic motif. It is present throughout and modulates slightly (applied to the protagonist's hands, the lighthouse beam learning it, the proof of whispers carrying love). However, the tone is asserted rather than enacted—the prose itself is lyric and elevated but not structurally oxymoronic. The recurrence becomes a label rather than a lived tonal effect. The tone charges the final image but does not vary meaningfully with pressure; it remains a single static mood throughout.</comment>
