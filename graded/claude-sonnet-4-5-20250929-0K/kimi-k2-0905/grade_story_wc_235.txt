<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is dense and particular—"feral nostalgia" bite, jealousy of past selves, the tension between chronicling and being chronicled by dreams. Embodied choices appear: kneeling in snow, feeding the stove, drawing the spiral. The final decision to leave the stone and turn inside forecloses rescue fantasies with quiet cost. Minor weakness: some emotional states ("jaded wonder rattling in her ribs") lean toward label-speak, but contradictory impulses (envy of corpse, bird, yesterday's self) remain active throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the piece layers prophetic scroll, dream-eagle flight, grave vision, and snow erasure into a coherent meditation on narrative as survival tool. Orientation anchors (ranger cabin, birch bark scroll, mountain) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure—laying the scroll on snow, watching it vanish, then turning inside to chronicle again—reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost (accepting the wheel, relinquishing linear rescue). One meaningful deepening: the realization that "erasure is also a form of continuation" reconfigures her stance from escape to endurance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cedar smoke, hemlock grave site, blue glass snow, and iron stove sparks are vivid and POV-filtered through her archivist lens. The cabin functions as micro-setting: the stove accepts another log at a pivotal reflection, the door frames her exit into moonlight, the beams "groan" in response. Footprints she has not yet made constrain her perception of time as non-linear. The setting charges the final image (stone monument, cabin lights dimming) but does not tighten a mid-scene choice with physical consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to continue chronicling or surrender to the recursive dream-wheel. The scroll's instruction "do not land; landing confirms the ending" tightens the tension between flight and bodily constraint. Her choice to lay the scroll in snow and watch it erase, then return inside to "keep chronicling," forecloses escape with felt cost (clinging to spokes, splinters in palms). One meaningful deepening occurs when she sees her own footprints not yet made, collapsing prophecy and memory into one pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—narrative as wheel, not ladder—emerges organically from scroll, grave, eagle flight, and snow erasure without moralizing. The final image (stone monument unrecognized by future hikers, lights dimming satisfied) offers a resonant answer: chronicling is its own recursion, valuable only to the one who clings. "Feral nostalgia" and "erosion as continuation" avoid platitude by anchoring in birch bark, soot, and moss. The piece embraces ambiguity (is she alive, dead, dreaming?) without confusion, and the protagonist's renunciation of linear rescue is inextricable from the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters the mountain through archivist idiom ("distill chaos into narrative," "columns for the forest service archive") and lyric compression ("autumn tongues," "snow into blue glass"). Psychic distance modulates cleanly from close interiority ("grief for a life she had not yet finished failing to live") to embodied action (knelt, laid, placed). No dialogue present. Diction remains within her educated, introspective lexicon. Minor slip: "jaded wonder rattling in her ribs" tilts toward abstract label in a high-pressure beat, but the perceptual texture holds under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>High information density and vivid figurative language ("edges curled like autumn tongues," "mouth open like a broken shutter," "snowflakes landed like white ink"). Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating in the eagle-flight beat and breathing in the snow-erasure closure. However, mid-story drift into overwriting: "feral nostalgia bite," "rabid dreams," "brief constellations," and "white ink" cluster without clear progression, diluting propulsion. The closure beat (scroll vanishing, stone left, lights dimming) remains clean. Small template cadence issue: "She [verb]..." stems repeat across adjacent paragraphs without taught pattern, costing −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lucid-dream archivist, time-wheel, and scroll prophecy feels specific and non-obvious. "Feral nostalgia" as homesickness for sequence rather than place is a fresh inflection. The eagle-looking-down-at-own-body image and footprints-not-yet-made reverse familiar tropes with earned causality. Minor hedge: the ranger-cabin frame and prophetic-scroll structure echo established dream-logic templates; transformation occurs through the protagonist's recursive chronicling stance and the snow-erasure closure, which reweight the premise without full structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lucid dream chronicler is named early (first paragraph), her job to "distill chaos into narrative" drives the dominant stake, and her final decision—to leave the stone and return inside to "keep chronicling"—shapes the closure with visible cost. She appears in three distinct beats: reading the scroll, soaring as eagle, kneeling in snow. The occupation constrains her perception (archivist idiom, "columns for the forest service archive") and her choice to accept the wheel rather than escape it. Cost: splinters in palms, accepting that "erasure is also a form of continuation."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears in five beats: discovery on table (paragraph 2), unrolling instructions (6–7), adding soot-knife inscription (13), drawing spiral with labeled years (20), and laying it in snow to vanish (27–28). It drives two key choices: her decision not to "land" per the scroll's dare, and her final act of releasing it to erasure. The scroll's dated "seven winters forward" signature and evolving inscriptions reweight time as wheel. Removing it would collapse the prophecy-memory confusion central to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named explicitly in paragraph 3 ("grief for a life she had not yet finished failing to live") and explained in paragraph 16 ("homesickness for a place but for a sequence"). It shapes her jealousy of past selves (paragraph 7) and her stance at closure (accepting the wheel). The concept charges the scroll's dare and the erasure image, but the mechanics remain more thematic echo than on-page constraint. Moderate integration: the concept deepens interiority and tone, yet does not force a distinct tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is signaled in paragraph 4 ("unable to decide whether the grave...was prophecy or memory") and enacted throughout: scroll dated seven winters forward, footprints not yet made, time "folded like badly stacked paper." The trait constrains her perception—she cannot sequence events linearly—and drives her recursive chronicling choice at closure. The confusion enables the snow-erasure moment (watching the scroll vanish "teaching her that erasure is also a form of continuation"). Removing this trait would collapse the time-wheel logic and the final Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Soar" is enacted twice: paragraph 9 (eagle flight, looking down at own body) and recalled in paragraph 22 (thermals like fingers). The flight dramatizes the split between dreamer and chronicler, setting up the scroll's warning "do not land; landing confirms the ending." Her choice at closure—to keep chronicling rather than escape into flight—traces to this action. Moderate integration: the soaring image charges jealousy and the wheel metaphor, but the closure turns more on snow erasure and the stone than on flight itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Getting jealous of past selves" is named in the scroll's instruction (paragraph 6), enacted in paragraph 7 ("envied yesterday's version who had not yet seen the hole"), and recurs in paragraph 22 ("Jealousy flared—of the bird, of the woman...even of the corpse"). The jealousy colors her interiority and motivates her acceptance of the wheel (she cannot return to innocence). It does not, however, constrain a distinct on-page choice or supply a tool; it remains more mood than method. The mechanics do not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin anchors setting from the opening line. The stove is fed at a key reflection (paragraph 11), the door frames her exit (paragraph 24), the beams groan (paragraph 17), and the lights dim at closure (paragraph 31). The cabin's isolation reinforces her recursive task and the snow outside supplies the erasure surface. Removing the cabin would require new spatial logic, yet the setting pressures mood more than it constrains a distinct tactical choice. Solid integration across beats; micro-setting (body, scroll, snow) does more causal work than the cabin structure itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"After seeing your own grave" is dramatized in paragraph 5 (grave at dawn, name eroding into moss) and drives the scroll discovery and her chronological confusion. The grave sighting triggers feral nostalgia and collapses prophecy/memory, shaping the dominant stake: whether chronicling can save her or is itself the wheel. The timeframe is less a ticking clock than a perceptual anchor; the grave returns thematically (jealousy of the corpse, paragraph 22) and shapes the closure's acceptance of recursive endurance. Strong thematic integration; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is named in paragraph 8 ("her job...to tame the rabid dreams") and drives the dominant stake throughout. Her choice at closure—"keep chronicling, not to escape the wheel but to map its spokes"—dramatizes the motivation under pressure. The scroll, soot inscription, and snow erasure all enact distillation attempts. Friction: the dreams "dreaming her back" (paragraph 9) complicates her control. The motivation is tested, conflicted, and earns the final Earned Stasis. Strong integration across setup, middle reflection, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is embodied in "laughed, a jaded wonder rattling in her ribs" (paragraph 11) and modulates throughout: awe at the eagle flight, bitterness at the scroll's dare, quiet acceptance at snow erasure. The tone charges key images (sparks as "brief constellations," snowflakes as "white ink") and intensifies at closure when the cabin lights dim "satisfied." The tone remains coherent under pressure, blending weariness with lyric attention. Minor label-speak ("jaded wonder rattling") in one beat, but the tonal control elevates the final image and supports the Earned Stasis.</comment>
