<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mirage painter remains conceptually abstract throughout; her motivation is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Interior life consists of generic contemplation ("eyes perceptively calm," "satisfied") without micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The heartbeat surrender feels unmotivated—no on-page struggle between keeping it and gifting it, just a smooth decision. The piece offers a symbolic figure executing a mission rather than a character wrestling with competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchored by ~120 words, waive penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (lyric accretion toward a final image). Closure unit: Resonant Reconfiguration (the heartbeat gifted, mirrors begin to respond, children sing the lullaby). Cost is asserted ("keep the pulse and paint alone forever") but not dramatized—no on-page struggle or visible forfeiture that charges the final image. The piece teaches a symbolic pattern early but the closure feels declarative rather than earned through prior causality or accumulation with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and bell tower supply vivid sensory anchors (violets, gold, wet stone, lilac scent). The blown-glass sphere is handled across beats and the terrace's spatial layout is coherent. However, setting largely functions as backdrop; no environmental constraint meaningfully narrows the painter's options. The prism parapet appears in opening and closing but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with fresh cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: persuade mirrors to show possibilities. The piece offers a tightening (third mirror refuses unless she surrenders the heartbeat) but the choice itself is frictionless—she weighs it in one sentence, then decides without visible internal cost or trade-off. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the heartbeat functions as symbolic bait rather than a resource under pressure. Escalation reads as conceptual intensification (three mirrors, increasing demand) without on-page struggle that forecloses a live option with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (transformation of perception, daring to see possibilities) emerges from the premise and repeats through mirror imagery. The final image (children singing, rain beginning, mirrors leaning forward) offers a lyric reconfiguration without overt moralizing. However, the core question is answered through assertion ("mirrors were already speaking back") rather than dramatized particulars that reweight prior material. The heartbeat-as-gift and lullaby-as-code function as symbolic shortcuts, reducing thematic resonance to conceptual elegance without earned emotional friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature reads generic (dusky harmony, bruised violets, slow gold) rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("dusky harmony," "perceptively calm") that feels authorial rather than interior. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The voice is coherent but lacks idiosyncrasy; it could describe many narrators rather than this painter's particular way of noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "borrowed heartbeat," "clock-keeper," "mirrors cruel enough," "shy prophets," "taller than grief," "moth against glass," "cadmium hope, ultramarine longing, ochre forgiveness." Mixed metaphor: mirrors "waited like a jury" then become "shy prophets." Paraphrase loop: "persuade mirrors to show possibilities" / "mirrors kept undoing her work by insisting on flat truth" / "teaching it to beat in rhythms of maybe." Template cadence in middle section: "She [verb], [participle]" repeated across four sentences. Artifacts touch closure ("weaving new futures," "cut glass into grace"). Apply −1.4 for density + coherence + loops, plus −0.3 for closure contamination = baseline ~4.6.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mirage-painter premise and mirror-persuasion mission offer lyric appeal but the emotional arc (solitary artist sacrifices talisman to teach empathy) follows a familiar template. Transformation test: swap "mirage painter" for "hope-sculptor" or "dream-weaver" and the plot holds without structural change. The blown-glass heartbeat, lullaby-as-code, and prism parapet are inventive ornaments but do not generate fresh human complexity or non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in diction (elevated, dense) does not heighten stakes; it obscures causality. No within-band bonus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present in setup (arrives at terrace), middle (presses sphere to mirrors, weighs choice), and ending (descends, melts into crowd). However, her choices are smooth and观察al rather than conflicted; the heartbeat surrender is decided in one sentence without visible cost or forfeiture that alters later tactics. Two beats (mirror interaction, descent) but minimal causal pressure. Swappable with "wandering artist" or similar archetype. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, low causal pressure +0.3, closure participation +0.4, high swappability −0.6, ornamental framing −0.4 = ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Appears in opening ("prism parapet, splitting the dusky harmony") and closing ("polishing the prism parapet, preparing the stage"). Early signal +0.6, lyric reprise +0.4. However, it remains static description; no handling, no constraint on choice. The parapet does not alter tactics or charge the ending with fresh cost—it simply recurs. Ornamental use −0.8, swappable (any reflective surface would serve) −0.5 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Present in setup (described by paragraph 3), middle (pressed to mirrors, creates visions), and ending (set inside frame, "still drumming"). Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.7, closure linkage +0.9 (heartbeat remains in mirror, teaching rhythm of maybe). Causal pressure moderate: it enables mirror persuasion but the gifting itself is frictionless. Specificity +0.5 (blown-glass sphere, infant's pulse). Cost connection weak (told she'd "paint alone forever" if kept, but no on-page struggle) −0.5. Summary-only at key turn ("weighed the choice") −0.6 = ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Label-only trait. Appears twice: "eyes perceptively calm" and "descended... perceptively calm." No on-page constraint or enabling action tied to this quality; it could be removed without altering any choice. Ornamental −0.9, label-only −0.3, no beat involvement beyond description = ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Moved with grace" (opening), "With grace she lifted the sphere" (climax). Early signal +0.5, closure participation +0.6. However, grace is asserted twice without embodied demonstration; the action itself (lifting sphere, singing louder) is generic and swappable. No causal pressure (grace does not narrow options or enable tactics under stress) −0.7, swappability −0.6, summary-only −0.5 = ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "coded lullabies... turn ordinary glass into shy prophets" (paragraph 7). Middle: she hums/sings the lullaby to mirrors; first mirror blooms, third mirror's crack seals when she "sang the lullaby louder, weaving new lines." Ending: children sing the same lullaby. Early signal +0.7, two beats (mirror persuasion, final echo) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8 (method enables mirror transformation), closure linkage +0.8 (children carry it forward). Mechanics taught and used. Specificity +0.6 (hush-a-bye = what if) = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: "echoing terrace" anchored in opening line and expanded (bell tower, spring vines, marble). Middle: terrace supplies mirrors and space for the mission. Ending: "echoing terrace in spring" recurs in final paragraph. Early signal +0.8, lyric reprise +0.5, two beats +0.9. However, terrace is backdrop; no constraint alters tactics (she could perform this ritual anywhere with mirrors). Swappability −0.6, ornamental use −0.7 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Over the hush before bells ring" appears twice (paragraph 3 setup, paragraph 13 decision moment). Bells toll after she sets the heartbeat, marking closure. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure participation +0.5. However, the timeframe is atmospheric rather than pressuring; no ticking clock alters her choices or tactics. She moves at contemplative pace throughout. Ornamental time −0.8, no tactical constraint −0.6 = ~4.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "her mission was to persuade mirrors to show possibilities" (paragraph 5). Middle: she presses heartbeat to mirrors, pursuing this goal. Ending: mirrors "leaned a fraction forward, listening," mission advancing. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0. Motivation is told and pursued but not dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between wants and costs on the page. Summary-only friction (people "began to accept only what they saw") −0.7, no on-page trade-off −0.4 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" in opening line, echoed in closing ("night's dusky harmony"). Tone is lyric, contemplative, and consistent through turns. Early signal +0.8, coherent modulation (calm → decision → children's song) +0.6, closure participation (tone charges final image of weaving futures) +0.9. However, tone is static mood rather than dynamic pressure; no tonal shift under stress. Single static mood −0.5, generic lyricism (interchangeable with many fairy-tale narrators) −0.2 = ~5.6.</comment>
