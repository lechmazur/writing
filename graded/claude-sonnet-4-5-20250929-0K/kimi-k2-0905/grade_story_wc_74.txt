<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's insomnia functions as an enabling condition rather than a motivated trait with internal contradiction. Her drive to finish the mural lacks visible internal conflict—she moves without hesitation through each beat. The addition of Jules feels ornamental; he witnesses but does not pressure her choices. The final sleep offers closure, but the arc from sleepless painter to rested one bypasses the struggle that would earn transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through imagery and the mural's expansion. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when coalesce only after the greenhouse is entered (~15% in). Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (the neighborhood exhales lost syllables, Mira sleeps) lands with thematic weight but minimal on-page cost; the ending summarizes outcomes (marigolds, smiles, sleep) rather than dramatizing a final choice or renunciation that forecloses a visible path. The waxing moon and saffron glow recur, but no persistent constraint tightens tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse supplies concrete sensory anchors—peat, saffron, marigold scent, cracked mirror, moon through glass—that shape Mira's ritual. The calligrapher's brush and indigo brew function as tools with tactile presence. Spatial choreography remains clear across fire escape, potting bench, north window, and wall. The brush's glow and orchids opening out of season charge the final third, and the smog-choked city contrasts the lace-silvered ivy, raising the setting's pressure on the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: complete the mural and release lost languages into the neighborhood. No on-page obstacle or competing pressure tests this goal; Mira paints uninterrupted, the visions pour out, Jules arrives and cooperates without friction. The wind rattles panes but does not threaten loss. Escalation reads as accumulation of imagery rather than narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The ending's cost—Mira's fatigue, the languages carried seedlike—remains atmospheric rather than a visible forfeiture that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of lost languages and remembered kindness emerges through concrete images: coins passed hand to hand, sandwiches to hitchhikers, marigolds on windshields. The mural functions as a lung, the bristles as sound, syllables as seeds—each metaphor extends the concept without reducing it to a stated moral. The final image of green footprints and drivers smiling offers resonance. Mild penalty: "remember me kindly" in the penultimate beat edges toward overt articulation, though it remains diegetic (a translated glyph) rather than authorial sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited, holds stable distance and perceptual filter. Diction carries a lyric, slightly elevated register consistent with the premise (saffron quiet, moon-tipped, rusted nails). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at peak beats (the visions, Jules's arrival). Weakness: syntactic uniformity—most sentences open with subject-verb or prepositional phrase in a recurring cadence that flattens rhythm under pressure. No dialogue present; Jules and Mira interact via gesture and silence, which fits tone but limits differentiation tests.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—every few sentences deploy metaphor or simile (match struck in library, throat learning to speak, fatigue as lantern then blanket). At the climax (bristles glow with sound, orchids open), the layered images blur causal sequence without teaching a pattern. Paraphrase loop detected: "methodically hopeful that tonight she would finish" / "she meant to coax one out before dawn" restate intent. Minor template cadence in the opening third (subject, predicate, subordinate clause). Information density is strong; momentum adequate but not propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—insomniac painter, calligrapher's brush, lost languages housed in objects, mural as lung—offers a fresh angle on art-as-transmission themes. The moon-writing ritual and indigo brewed from morning glories and rusted nails supply specific, non-obvious detail. Risk: the piece leans heavily on lush metaphor and diffuse agency (her wrist moves without her), which could read as evasion of concrete stakes, yet the commitment to the lyric frame is consistent and the ending's scattering of marigolds and green footprints earns mild surprise. Transformation test passes; swapping names would require reworking the calligrapher's brush and abolished-language premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira frames the piece, climbs the fire escape, prepares the ritual, paints the mural, descends, sleeps, and implicitly scatters marigolds (inferred from "That evening, commuters found..."). Her choices—rescuing the brush, setting the mirror, brewing indigo—enable the sequence, but no on-page reversal or competing option tests her commitment. Jules's arrival does not alter her tactics. The trait "insomniac" is stated but functions as atmospheric condition rather than constraint with cost. Present across setup, middle ritual, and closure (sleep as payoff); causal role is foundational but not pressured.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The brush appears early (potting bench, rescued from flooded thrift shop, rumored history), is used to paint the glyphs mid-story (dipped in indigo, first stroke, wrist guided), glows with sound at the climax (bristles hum, orchids open), and rests on the windowsill at the end (moon-tipped, ready to rouse). Its specific properties—ivory handle, crescent bristles, abolished-language prayers—matter on the page; removing it would eliminate the ritual's core mechanic. The glow-as-sound and the final readiness image reweight its meaning. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lost languages shape the mural's content (vines spelling no word she knew, dialects fined by city speakers, glyphs meaning "remember me kindly") and the thematic premise (languages hide inside objects). The concept drives the method (coax one out before dawn) and the ending's scattering (syllables exhaled, green prints as breadcrumbs). Weakness: the languages function more as thematic backdrop than on-page constraint—Mira does not struggle with translation, choose between dialects, or sacrifice intelligibility. Present in setup (stated goal), developed through painting beats, and echoed in closure (syllables exhaled), but swappable with "forgotten songs" or "lost stories" without major structural revision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" appears once in the opening (paragraph three) as narrative label. It colors her persistence but does not constrain a choice or generate visible cost. The trait is not tested against despair, impatience, or doubt; Mira paints without interruption or failure. No middle beat invokes the trait to enable or block an option, and the closure (sleep, completion) confirms hope fulfilled rather than examining its method or cost. Present in setup as descriptor; absent from development and closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears in the final line ("ready to rouse the next night of saffron quiet") and implicitly in Mira's goal to "coax [a language] out before dawn." The action frames the ritual but is not dramatized as a distinct on-page turn; the languages emerge during painting without requiring a separate rouse-beat. The ending's readiness suggests cyclical intent, charging the image, but the action itself is anticipatory rather than executed. Lyric reprise (goal stated early, echoed at close) with thematic reweighting; swappable with "awaken" or "call forth" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Moonlight is signaled early (waxing moon silvers the glass, moon-tipped brush, mirror set so moon could write) and recurs at the climax (moon tipped higher, bristles glow). The method—visions sparked by moonlight coating the letters—appears in one beat (paragraph twelve: "Daydreams sparked by moonlight rose from the wet letters"). Mechanics matter: without moon the ritual lacks its trigger, yet the daydreams themselves are told rather than dramatized as a pressure point. Present in setup, invoked at peak, and implicit in closure (moon sets, bristles dim); causal but not irreplaceable (lamplight or dawn could substitute with edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse anchors every beat: Mira climbs the fire escape, enters the thick air (peat, saffron, marigolds), uses the potting bench and north window, paints the wall, and the space becomes "a lung for the whole sleepless neighborhood." The smog-choked city below contrasts the moonlit ivy, raising stakes (lost languages vs. imposed silence). The greenhouse's enclosure enables the air-breathing ritual (Jules inhales, syllables slip into open windows). Spatial choreography is precise; removing the setting would collapse the mural's logic and the neighborhood-lung metaphor. Strong setup, development, and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The waxing moon signals timeframe in the opening and marks progression (moon tipped higher, moon began to set, she descended at dawn). Four nights of insomnia precede the story; the ritual spans one night. Time does not tighten tactics—no countdown or race against dawn forces a choice, and the moon's setting coincides with completion rather than interrupting it. Present as atmospheric marker across setup, middle, and closure; provides rhythm but does not constrain action or generate cost. Swappable with "under starlight" or "before sunrise" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to prove that strangers remember kindness"—is stated as Mira's belief (languages hide inside objects, birds hide inside eggs) and dramatized in the visions (coins passed hand to hand, sandwiches to hitchhikers, drivers smiling). The mural's syllables are "for lungs," intended to be carried into the streets, and the ending scatters marigolds as evidence. Weakness: the goal is pursued without conflict or doubt; no on-page friction tests whether kindness is remembered or whether the proof costs Mira anything beyond fatigue. Present in setup (coax languages out), developed through painting and visions, and paid off in closure (marigolds, smiles). Thematic rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears three times: paragraph four (air thick with peat and saffron quiet), paragraph eighteen (Jules and cardamom tea, distant sirens softened into lullabies), and the final line (next night of saffron quiet). The tone—hushed, warm, liminal—holds stable through the ritual; no modulation under pressure (the wind, the glow) tests or charges it. At closure the phrase returns with "ready to rouse," reweighting quiet as potential rather than stasis. Coherent and purposeful reprise; the tone supports the lyric lens but does not escalate or break, trending mid-band for static mood with final charge.</comment>
