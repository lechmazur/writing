<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior demonstrates coherent curiosity and a value hierarchy (choosing reclamation over forgetting), but the final pivot lacks embodied contradiction—she moves cleanly from temptation to refusal without visible struggle in the moment. The insight "memories had never been taken; they had been offered" arrives as assertion rather than earned realization through scene pressure. Backstory functions within BRR allowances, anchored to present stimuli (corroded sextant, mushroom glow), but the reflective density flattens some present-tense pressure mid-piece.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara refuses the exchange, collects the tincture, and recovers memories, forecloses the path of forgetting with felt cost (abandoning safety). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (shipwrecks, upside-down trees, fairy ring, sextant) that converge at the scalpel beat. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (greenhouse, Mara, decades later). One escalation tightening occurs when she lifts the sextant and memory surfaces, narrowing her choice to complete or refuse the exchange.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks constrains movement (she must navigate ship ribs, the fairy ring center) and charges the closure (she exits through the galleon gatepost without looking back). Micro-setting details—salt-crystal leaves, upside-down peach roots, corroded sextant—recur and reweight at key beats. Sensory selection (cider and rust, accordion chord sigh) reflects POV priorities. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recover stolen memories) is signaled early and drives the scalpel choice at center. One meaningful tightening: the sextant moment surfaces a memory and urges final forgetting, forcing Mara to choose reclamation with visible cost (renouncing safety). The mushroom pulses brighter, applying pressure; her refusal forecloses the path and carries consequence (greenhouse shudders, ring withers). Agency is decision with on-page cost. No explicit antagonist, but coincidence does not resolve; protagonist choice does.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (memory vs. forgetting, curiosity as reclamation) emerges through particulars—the sextant's seven shards, the Pleiades tincture, the final lullaby. The closing insight "curiosity is just memory trying to find its way home" treads close to direct theme statement but is grounded in prior action. Subtext operates in the corroded sextant's mirrored ages and the mother's hand image. The final act offers a resonant answer (singing the lullaby under corrected stars) without overt moralizing, though the penultimate sentence edges into summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "chronically curious ache," "corroded sextant… inhaled her questions." Diction remains character-particular ("hands-on folklorist," "field journal… swollen with salt stains"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the sextant beat, wider at the hill conclusion). Some phrases approach elevated register ("persistent constellation of bruises") but stay within plausible narrator lexicon for a folklorist scholar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance setting, memory recovery, or motif. Rhythm varies appropriately. Two paraphrase loops appear: "the same pale green as the night she forgot" echoed by "the night the Pleiades returned, the night she learned"; "chronically curious" repeats without added pressure. Template cadence in the memory-return sequence ("the taste of pear butter… the Gaelic lullaby… her mother's laugh") reads list-like. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "accordion's last chord" works, though "chandeliers of wet rope" strains slightly. −0.6 for loops and template stems, modest accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of folklorist expertise, sunken orchard greenhouse, and fairy-ring memory theft feels specific and non-obvious. The corroded sextant with seven Pleiades-matching shards is a fresh inflection that drives the turn. Risk-taking in the inverted peach trees and shipwreck-ring setting heightens atmosphere without obscuring clarity. The premise (stolen memories via mushroom exchange) echoes genre templates but is transformed through grounded sensory detail and the protagonist's disciplined field method (scalpel, vial, tincture). Emotional specificity (mother's laugh "echoing inside the raincoat hood") avoids generic templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, makes the scalpel choice at center (slicing the mushroom rather than completing the exchange), and teaches students in the final beat. Her folklorist method (field journal, headlamp, scalpel) shapes tactics. Two distinct beats: detection at the fairy ring and the scalpel refusal. Causal: her choice reverses the theft. Closure linkage: she walks out and later teaches, enacting the recovered knowledge. Early signal: "hands-on folklorist" in the opening line.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fairy ring mushroom appears in four beats: initial glow and Pleiades bruises, pulsing urge at sextant moment, scalpel slicing to collect sap, and withering into moss at exit. Evolving use: from detection target to pressure source to harvested tincture. Causal: slicing it breaks the exchange cycle and allows memory return. Closure linkage: its withering signals the completed reversal. Irreplaceable: the Pleiades bruises and milky sap mechanics are specific. Cost: refusal to press sextant against cap forecloses easy forgetting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Decades later" frames the opening and returns in the teaching coda. It stakes the emotional cost (childhood memories stolen long ago) but does not tighten tactics on the page—the greenhouse visit could occur at any interval. The concept reweights at closure when she becomes a teacher "decades later," but this is summary rather than present constraint. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake (time as a dimension of loss and recovery) but lacks mid-scene causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Chronically curious" appears three times: opening attribution, quieting at the sextant, and implicit in the final teaching. The trait enables her return and the scalpel choice (curiosity drives investigation and refusal of forgetting). Visible cost: the "ache" quiets when she lifts the sextant, suggesting the trait's burden. Middle beat: curiosity compels her to slice rather than surrender. Not merely label; it alters action. However, the cost remains abstract ("ache") rather than a concrete tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Detect" drives the narrative engine: she detects the bruises on the mushroom cap, detects the theft pattern in photographs, and later teaches students "to detect the subtle shift when habits break." Two beats: initial constellation match and teaching coda. Causal: detection unlocks the Pleiades tincture method. Mechanics matter: the seven dark specks correspond to stars, enabling the recovery ritual. Not easily swappable; observation as a specialized skill redefines her options. Closure linkage: detection becomes pedagogical legacy.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Studying broken constellations" is signaled in paragraph eight (field journal with sketches) and pays off when she reads the sextant's seven shards and aligns the Pleiades overhead. Method matters: the sketched map guides her to the fairy ring center and the scalpel choice. Two beats: journal study mid-piece and star realignment at closure. Causal: prior study informs the tincture recipe. However, the method is introduced late (second third) and mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how the sketches enable the scalpel moment is implied rather than shown. Lyric payoff when constellations reform overhead.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks supplies concrete resources (galleon gatepost entry, ship-rib arches as navigation, fairy ring at center) and pressures movement (half-submerged obstacles, humid dark requiring headlamp). Micro-setting throughout: salt-crystal leaves, upside-down peach roots, corroded sextant at center. Closure linkage: she exits through the gatepost without looking back; the ring withers; she climbs the hillside above. Setting alters tactics (she must navigate to the center, follow the glow) and charges the final image (living peach tree on the hill vs. inverted ones inside). Irreplaceable: the greenhouse's shipwreck structure and inverted orchard are specific to the memory-theft premise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When habits break" appears in the mother's memory ("Habits are just stories we keep telling until the ground dissolves") and in the Pleiades bruises constellation "the evening her habits broke." Also in the teaching coda: "detect the subtle shift when habits break." The timeframe is thematic rather than causal—it does not tighten present decisions. No live clock on the page; the visit unfolds without time pressure. Present only as motif and retrospective frame. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but lacks middle causal pressure or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire to recover stolen memories drives every beat: return to the greenhouse, detection of the bruises, following the glow, lifting the sextant, refusing the final exchange, slicing the mushroom, recovering memories, and teaching students. Dramatized friction: the mushroom urges her to "complete the exchange, to press the sextant's broken mirror against the cap and let the final forgetting begin," but she chooses the scalpel instead. Visible cost: renouncing the "safety of forgetting over the pain of loss." Three beats: initial return, sextant temptation, scalpel refusal. Closure linkage: recovered memories enable the lullaby and teaching. Irreplaceable motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Crisp nostalgia" is invoked directly ("The greenhouse air tasted of crisp nostalgia, cider and rust") and modulates through the piece: wistful at entry, pressured at the sextant, relieved at memory recovery ("felt less like rust and more like the first bite of a pear, sweet with a tannic edge"). Tone charges the final image: singing the lullaby under corrected stars, the pear-bite comparison anchoring bittersweet reclamation. Coherent across turns; not static. However, the direct label in paragraph seven weakens integration—"crisp nostalgia" is named rather than purely embodied. Sensory anchors (cider, rust, accordion, pear) sustain the tone through pressure.</comment>
