<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior texture is specific—the "swallowed truth sink[ing]…dense as a lead slug" anchors her skeptic-turned-witness arc with palpable weight. The micro-choices at the wheel and speaking aloud under pressure show embodied agency. However, the brother's confession arrives entirely off-page via "radio voice," flattening what could be a live relational crucible; the emotional progression from skepticism to "forgiveness—secular, unproved, yet weighty" reads tidy rather than contradictory under peak stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara returns the wheel, allowing the shift to stop, and her own swallowed truth shifts from lead to brass—a conceptual repricing with palpable cost. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: details accrue (tunnel, valve wheel, tag, clanging) until the final cadence shift reweights the premise. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One structural seam: the ghost-shift premise hinges on the brother's backstory, yet that confession is narrated retrospectively rather than dramatized as a present choice, softening causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tunnel's rusted rail, silt-buried valve, dripping water, and overhead hatch constrain Mara's movements and charge the final act—she presses her ear to the wheel, unscrews the cap, leaves it spinning. Sensory detail is filtered through her skeptic's lens: "mineral stink of the old foundry," beads "like dry bones." The body (palm to rail, ear to rim) and recurring object (valve wheel) function as micro-setting that shapes tactics and the closure image. No occupation-level bloat; every detail serves pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—witnessing/weighing the brother's truth and the ghost shift's claim—is signaled early and tightens when Mara unscrews the wheel and the tag emerges. Her spoken challenge ("If you want weight, take it; if you want witness, I'm here") forces the shift's answer and narrows her path. The cost is legible: she must carry the truth now "no longer lead but brass." One limitation: the ghost shift's response (wheel jerking, beads rattling, sloshing stilled) edges toward convenient validation rather than Mara's agency driving the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—what truth weighs, who carries it, and how witness completes unfinished work—emerges through the valve wheel's mechanical ritual and the brother's confession reframed as self-exile rather than betrayal. The final image (wheel spinning, truth brass instead of lead) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "drowsy alertness," "swallowed truth," and the shift's Morse-like drip. Minor slip: the psychics' refrain is told rather than shown in her skeptical parsing, and "secular…forgiveness" in the penultimate beat risks thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinctive: "religiously skeptical to the marrow," "appraise it by touch, by smell," "secular, unproved, yet weighty" anchor Mara's intellectual-skeptic idiom. Psychic distance holds; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts high under pressure—"weighted with something sloshing inside its hollow spokes" and "drowsy alertness sharpening into a hunter's sway" feel elevated for peak-stress immediacy. The brother's off-page radio voice and the psychics' frantic refrain are summarized exposition rather than dramatized dialogue, missing subtext opportunity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language ("damp wool," "mercury or guilt," "beaded gyroscope") earns its keep by charging objects with thematic weight. Two line-level issues: paraphrase loops in adjacent beats—"pressed her palm…steadying herself" then "braced the wheel upright and pressed her ear"; "swallowed truth" recurs five times without evolving pressure. Template cadence in mid-section: "She + verb" stems stack across four sentences. Subtract −0.6 for loops and stems, but closure beats remain clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—talk-radio psychics, industrial ghost shift, and a brass tag as relic—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding pure template. The valve wheel's double function (tool and reliquary) and the reframing of the brother's guilt (locked out, not in) transform familiar haunting tropes. Risk-taking in the lyric-textural mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Derivative Premise check: the ghost-shift setup echoes industrial-horror conventions, but the skeptic-as-witness angle and mechanical ritual (unscrewing, tilting, tag emerging) particularize it enough to avoid the guardrail penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is signaled early ("reckless abandoned-mill explorer") and her choices—entering the tunnel, hoisting the wheel, unscrewing the cap, speaking aloud—drive the middle and ending beats. Her skepticism constrains how she interprets evidence. However, "reckless" is label-only; her on-page moves are methodical and controlled, not reckless. She does not make a high-cost trade-off that the recklessness would imply. Two beats (wheel handling, spoken challenge) plus closure linkage, but the trait itself is decorative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The valve wheel appears in beat one (glinting in silt), beat two (hoisted, sloshing), beat three (pressed to ear, unscrewed, tag extracted), and closure (spinning on rail). It shifts from artifact to reliquary to gyroscope, reweighting meaning each time. Causal pressure: the wheel's hollow spokes contain the tag that names the eight souls and reframes the brother's guilt. Closure linkage is strong: the wheel spinning measures "new equilibrium." Highly irreplaceable; no other object could carry this specific function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ghost shift frames stakes from the opening ("what really happened during the final phantom rotation") and shapes Mara's tactics: parsing psychic calls, seeking evidence in the tunnel, testing the wheel's "secret slosh." The clanging rhythm and shift's answer (wheel jerking, beads rattling) complicate her skepticism and enable the closure realization. Present in all three gates. However, the shift's response is atmospheric rather than a visible choice-driver; Mara interprets rather than negotiates. Cost is tied to the shift indirectly (she must carry the truth now).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical to the marrow" is signaled early and colors her interiority ("skepticism bristled," "voice flat with the same skepticism she used on late-night callers"). It constrains how she interprets the psychics' claims and the tunnel's cues, enabling her methodical approach. Payoff: the final forgiveness is framed as "secular, unproved, yet weighty," closing the arc. However, the trait does not force a visible on-page trade-off or cost; it filters perception without altering a tactical choice under pressure. Setup and closure present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Appraise" anchors the piece from the title beat ("come to appraise it by touch, by smell") through the wheel-handling sequence (hoisting, listening, unscrewing) to the closure ("measured, balanced, appraised at last"). The action is irreplaceable: Mara's methodical weighing—literal and conceptual—defines her agency and enables the shift's release. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure. Minor limitation: the psychics' framing ("someone measures their burden") telegraphs the action's thematic role, reducing some discovery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("three sleepless nights of frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, calls she had recorded and parsed like scripture she refused to believe") and the psychics' refrain ("The shift never left; they're turning still…") primes the closure logic. However, the mechanics—how she parsed the calls, what contradictions or patterns emerged—are summarized, not dramatized. The method does not shape a middle beat or tactical choice on the page; it is backstory exposition that sets up the premise. Setup present, middle and closure participation weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tunnel anchors early (rusted rail, dripping water, silt) and constrains Mara's movements: she steadies herself on the rail, rolls the wheel along it, climbs the service ladder at closure. Spatial detail is purposeful—overhead hatch, culvert at her boots, factory drains above feeding into the tunnel. The setting charges the final image: the wheel spinning in the dark as Mara climbs toward dawn. Present in all three gates with clear micro-setting pressure. Irreplaceability is moderate; a similar industrial ruin could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The hush "that followed the sudden confession" opens the piece and bookends it ("The hush returned, softer now"), framing the entire action in the confession's immediate aftermath. However, the timeframe is static rather than tightening: no live clock alters Mara's tactics, no urgency forces compression. The brother's confession is retrospective radio voice, not a present pivot. Setup and closure reprise are present; middle development (pressure from passing time) is absent. Lyric resonance without escalation caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is dramatized through every beat: Mara's three sleepless nights, her descent into the tunnel, her methodical appraisal of the wheel, and the realization that the brother "locked himself out." Desire conflicts with her skepticism (she "refused to believe" yet came to test the truth). The final cost is palpable: she carries the truth "no longer lead but brass…bearable." Present in all three gates with strong causal and emotional pressure. Highly irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is signaled early and recurs ("drowsy alertness that had carried her through three sleepless nights," "drowsy alertness sharpening into a hunter's sway," "drowsy alertness in her limbs melted into something like forgiveness"). The tone coheres across beats and modulates with pressure: from vigilant fatigue to sharpened focus to release. It charges the closure image by framing the shift from tension to "bearable" weight. However, the phrase is abstract and repeats without evolving sensory specificity; embodied cues (heavy eyelids, slowed pulse, tunnel chill) would deepen it.</comment>
