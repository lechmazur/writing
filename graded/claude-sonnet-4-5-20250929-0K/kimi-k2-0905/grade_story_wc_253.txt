<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The performer's moral ambiguity is embodied through contradictory past actions (reporting neighbors, forging joy coupons) that complicate present stance. Her embodied whittling and narration show agency under the remade hush, though internal contradiction could press harder in the moment. The officer's shift from enforcer to co-whittler provides relational pressure, but his arc feels slightly under-motivated in the turn itself. Micro-choices accumulate toward the planting gesture, which carries visible cost in the form of renounced safety.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line ~8. The piece accumulates density through whittling repetition, crow exchanges, and the bouquet's transformation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the performer plants bare stems and narrates absent watering until the sky responds. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—suspension of performance, acknowledgment of weight—and the lens holds through the final image of the flag for the morally ambiguous. One meaningful deepening (the planting and sky's tear) reweights the remade hush with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The wind turbines function as persistent constraint and atmosphere generator, shaping both micro-action (shavings snatched, updraft scattering petals) and the closure image (wooden feather lodged in joint, wrapper flag). The farmhouse porch and dried bouquet anchor spatial choreography cleanly. Sensory detail—scrape transmitted via hidden mic, crow's electric-white feather, soil darkening—is selective and purposeful. The turbines' "whoosh now sounded like a distant audience exhaling" charges the final third without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: cultivating lightness in grief under silence ordinance. Pressure tightens when the crow speaks, the performer answers with the wooden feather (small rebellion), and the officer joins. The planting of bare stems with empty-can narration forces the sky's single tear—a meaningful deepening that narrows options (performance suspended, guilt acknowledged as weight). Agency is clear in the whittling, the crow exchange, and the final log entry. Cost is legible: the performer renounces blank-faced safety for visible sedition, and the officer pockets his badge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—grief as soil, hush as method, voluntary planting versus involuntary growth—emerges through image and action without thesis statement. The dried bouquet's transformation (hydration deprivation → petal scatter → bare stems planted) and the crow's feather exchange operate as non-literal answer to whether lightness can grow in enforced silence. The final log line ("lightness possible, though not guaranteed") and wrapper-flag image offer Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost. Subtext operates in the officer's unbuttoned uniform and scratched badge, the performer's louder narration "so the ghosts… could hear."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance. The performer's perceptual signature—labeling scrape as "dirge," narrating to dried flowers, framing actions as performance items—remains consistent and voice-specific. Diction ("emotional void that passed for voice," "infant made of endings") is purposeful and character-particular. Dialogue between performer and officer carries subtext and goal pursuit without convergence. The crow's speech ("Whittle me a space where guilt fits like a splinter") stretches plausibility slightly but reads as deliberate surrealism taught by the post-mandate world. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates intentionally at the planting beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance image, action, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally: short beats during whittling, longer accumulation in the bouquet description and planting sequence. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language ("infant made of endings," "microphone hidden in her collar," "turbines… three-armed giants") is vivid and motivated without overwriting. Minor strain: "quivered when the blades passed through their shadow, pretending to be alive" slightly over-explains. Sentence variety supports momentum, and the final paragraph's cascade of dependent clauses accelerates into the flag image cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The happiness mandate premise is familiar dystopia, but the piece transforms it through specific inflection: silence ordinance, "dirge" logging, joy coupons, the performer's dual betrayals. The crow as interlocutor and the wooden feather lodged in turbine joint offer fresh physical metaphor. Whittling as sedition and narration as subversion feel organic to character and world. The planting of bare stems with empty-can watering until the sky responds provides a non-obvious synthesis that grows from prior particulars. Risk-taking (surreal crow dialogue, dense lyric compression) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early (line 1). Drives whittling action, narration to flowers, crow exchange, and co-whittling with officer. Her choice to narrate louder "so the ghosts… could hear" and to plant the stems with empty-can ritual creates the closure turn (sky's tear, log entry, flag). The blank face as mask for sedition is causally active across all three structural beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Introduced early (wired to porch rail). Used in three distinct beats: initial narration target, crow's feather gift, final planting after petal scatter. The bouquet's transformation—from apology-colored artifact to bare stems planted—directly shapes the closure image and the conceptual repricing of grief as soil. Irreplaceable; the story's physical and thematic logic depends on this exact object's arc from desiccation to potential growth.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("Since the happiness mandate had ended, the valley felt like… after the station signed off" and "remade hush"). Shapes stakes: silence ordinance, labeling scrape as "dirge," hidden mic monitoring. The turbines' "whoosh now sounded like a distant audience exhaling" and the final flag "announcing… that grief… might now be allowed to weigh something, and in that weight, perhaps, a new kind of song" reweight the concept at closure with visible cost (performance suspended, sedition declared).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early (paragraph 4: "reported neighbors… then later forged joy coupons"). Constrains present choice: her whittling and narration operate in the gap between enforcer and saboteur. The officer's presence and his unbuttoning/badge-pocketing reflect the same tension. The trait enables the final planting gesture—neither purely defiant nor purely compliant—with visible social cost (now marked by the flag). Tradeoff is legible but could press harder in a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Established line 1, sustained throughout. Whittling generates shavings the turbines snatch (constraint), produces the wooden feather for the crow (gift/rebellion), and becomes shared sedition when the officer joins. The planting of bare stems uses "the wooden feather and the nameless object the officer's knife had revealed" as anchors. The action is irreplaceable: swapping for another craft would require rewriting the turbine lodging, the crow exchange, and the closure's anchoring gesture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 3: "Observe… the blade kisses the grain…"). Recurs in "Item: hydration deprivation complete" enumeration and "Action: repetition as sedative" spoken louder. The method becomes the sedition itself under silence ordinance, charging the final log entry where she "began to narrate the watering of nothing with an empty can, describing every absent drop until the sky, confused, let fall a single real tear." The narration transforms from coping mechanism to rebellious speech act, shaping closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Present line 1 (sagging farmhouse porch) and reestablished frequently (turbines snatch shavings, crow lands on fence, updraft scatters petals, wooden feather lodged in turbine joint, wrapper tied to turbine fence). The turbines constrain action (shavings never touch ground, petals scatter) and supply the final image's visual anchor. The farmhouse interior houses the officer who listens and then joins, making the porch a spatial crucible. Micro-setting (porch, turbine joints, soil at porch foot) alters tactics and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Established early ("Since the happiness mandate had ended") and reinforced via silence ordinance, former laughter compliance officer, and references to "the fined and the jailed." The timeframe shapes world rules and social cost (reporting/forging in the past, monitoring in the present). However, the "after" does not impose a ticking clock or deadline that tightens tactics in real time. The historical pressure is causal but not urgent within the scene window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stated early (paragraph 2: "come here to cultivate lightness in grief"). Dramatized through whittling, narration, and the crow exchange. Friction between desire (lightness) and method (hush, sedation) charges the officer's question "You still believe lightness can grow in this?" and her reply "Grief is soil… what we plant is voluntary, what grows is not." The planting gesture and empty-can narration embody the motivation's cost: lightness remains unguaranteed, weight now acknowledged. The motivation shapes all major choices and the closure's conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Established early ("emotional void that passed for voice") and sustained: blank face, turbines "choreographing a remade hush," heartbeat as vandalism, dried flowers "pretending to be alive." Tone modulates under pressure—performer speaks "louder" for the ghosts, officer's question punctures the void, sky's tear briefly disrupts it. The final image ("flag for the morally ambiguous… grief… might now be allowed to weigh something, and in that weight, perhaps, a new kind of song") reconfigures the void into potential, charging closure without abandoning the established emotional register.</comment>
