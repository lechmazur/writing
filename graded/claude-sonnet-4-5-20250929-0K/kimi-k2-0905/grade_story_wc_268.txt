<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The titan's motivation is clear—restoring balance by unmasking the pretender—but his interiority remains abstract and distanced throughout. No embodied emotion appears; the prose tells us he acts with "regally unpretentious" calm and that balance is "the first law his kind had sworn to keep" without showing internal contradiction or cost. The pretender is sketched only through externals (licking his thumb, wearing "borrowed gravitas"), never granted contradictory impulses or a dramatized stake that would make the sundering feel like genuine loss rather than mechanical exposure. The titan's final forgetting of the man's face is asserted mercy, not an earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure gathers through imagery (ink pellet, library dust, constellation pause) toward the sundering moment. Orientation anchors "ancient temple library" and "diminutive titan" early, satisfying the test. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (glamour sundered, pretender exposed), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse: no on-page consequence for the titan (he simply walks away) and the pretender's unmasking lacks immediate repercussion beyond the description of melting features. The causal spine—titan searches, leaves clues, ink touches skin, glamour unravels—holds, but the ink pellet's mechanics (why it "waited for a reader who could feel the ache of drift") are asserted rather than dramatized, and the final beat (guards burst in, titan flicks the droplet) resolves without friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library setting is vivid and purposeful: leaning shelves, balustrades, spiral carrel, and cracked portico create a coherent spatial stage. The iron gall ink pellet, though small, functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the titan's method and charges the final image when it "flew to him, dissolving back into a drop of liquid night." Sensory detail is selective—"rust smell," "parchment breath," "faintly of storms"—and filtered through a consistent elevated register. The "ancient temple library lost in time" and the "pause of shifting constellations" frame the action without becoming tourist catalog, though the animate dust motes and roaring stone lions veer toward ornamental symbolism rather than spatial constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender to restore cosmic balance—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pretender opens the codex and the titan descends to whisper the second clue, narrowing the path to the sundering. The ink pellet touching skin and awakening the rune of drift provides a clear escalation beat. However, the resolution is frictionless: guards burst in but the titan "merely lifted his palm" and the droplet obeys; no cost, hesitation, or trade-off appears on the page. The pretender's glamour unravels "gentle yet absolute," and the titan walks away "already forgetting the man's face"—a declared mercy rather than a felt price that alters his later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth, legitimacy, and the price of cosmic balance—emerges organically from the titan's search and the pretender's exposure. The recurring iron gall ink and rust scent anchor the motif of drift and illegitimacy, and the final line "every throne is only ink yet to fade" offers a resonant, non-literal closure without overt moralizing. The "regally unpretentious" attribute and the titan's "precision" motive support the thematic concern with balance over revenge. Yet the thematic questions (What is the cost of unmasking? What does balance demand of the enforcer?) are answered largely by assertion—"history, too, must practice mercy"—rather than dramatized through the titan's visible sacrifice or internal contradiction. The ending's philosophical stance feels more stated than earned by on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("regally unpretentious," "dissolved into an iron gall ink pellet," "voice calm as closed winter"), purposeful compression, and lyric patterning create a fairy-tale-mythic register. Single-POV focalization remains stable; no head-hopping occurs. The pretender's brief interior glimpse ("pride muffled caution") stays within plausible third-limited bounds. However, the register occasionally drifts into abstraction—"the ache of drift," "threading through his veins like cold starlight"—that prioritizes ornament over immediacy. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered clue, one declaration) and functional. The voice modulates purposefully at the sundering ("Behold the signature of drift"), but the titan's perceptual signature is generic nobility rather than character-specific bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose is ornate and rhythmically varied, with purposeful compression ("no taller than a candlestick," "a drop of liquid night") and vivid sensory anchors. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence—"moonlit alabaster," "cold starlight," "liquid night," "closed winter," "stone through mist"—creating density that occasionally obscures propulsion. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "regally unpretentious" is restated as "neither bowing to the dust nor demanding reverence" and again as "regally unpretentious once more"; the titan's motivation (balance, precision) is repeated across three paragraphs without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to sigh," "seemed to inhale") and passive constructions ("was dissolved," "was not carved") appear in high-pressure beats. The ornamental climax—"dust motes rose like liberated subjects, swirling into the shape of a coronet that dissolved"—prioritizes metaphor over clarity and momentum. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: −0.8 for loops and figurative saturation touching closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core premise—a miniature titan enforcing cosmic law via a hidden ink rune—offers a fresh synthesis of myth and bibliographic detail. The "rune of drift dissolved into an iron gall ink pellet" is specific and non-obvious, and the library setting avoids generic fantasy tropes. However, the emotional arc (titan unmasks pretender, walks away unburdened) mirrors familiar myth-of-the-just-enforcer templates without significant transformation through lived cost or internal contradiction. The "regally unpretentious" attribute and the titan's stated motivation (balance, not revenge) function as labels rather than constraints that force difficult choices. The closing image—"every throne is only ink yet to fade"—is resonant but leans toward aphorism rather than an earned synthesis of prior particulars. Risk-taking in structure (lyric pacing, mythic register) is present but does not heighten stakes beyond surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The diminutive titan is present throughout and makes the key decision to descend and whisper the second clue, enabling the sundering. He opens with the search, acts in the middle by leaving messages, and closes by flicking the droplet and walking away. However, his choices are unopposed and cost-free; no moment forces a trade-off or visible price tied to his stature or nature. The "diminutive" detail is ornamental after the opening line—it does not constrain his movement or charge the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet is seeded early ("dissolved into an iron gall ink pellet no wider than a mite"), manipulated in the middle (the pretender smears it across his fingertips), and returns transformed in the closure (flies to the titan, becomes "a drop of liquid night," strikes the pretender's forehead). It drives causality: the rune awakens when the ink touches skin, sundering the glamour. The object's specificity (iron gall chemistry, rust scent) matters and is irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; one point shy of indispensable because the pellet's mechanics—why it "waited for a reader who could feel the ache of drift"—are asserted rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "rune of drift" is named early and framed as the search object; it shapes the titan's method (searching for a rune that can "sunder the glamour") and triggers the climax when it awakens in the ink. However, the rune's mechanics are abstract: what "drift" means and how the rune "threads through veins" is told, not shown through constrained action. The concept charges the final image (the pretender's visage "melts"), but its specificity does not alter tactics or impose visible cost on the titan.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is labeled twice (opening and near-closing) but never constrains an on-page choice. The titan moves without bowing or demanding reverence, consistent with the trait, yet no moment dramatizes a cost or trade-off where his restraint forecloses an easier path. The attribute is thematic flavor rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sunder" is the story's climactic action: the titan sunders the glamour by making the ink rune touch the pretender's skin, causing the false identity to unravel. This action is seeded (the rune "could sunder the glamour"), developed (the ink touches skin, the rune "awakens"), and realized at closure (the glamour "quivered... unraveling"). The sundering redefines the pretender's state and is irreplaceable—no synonym ("reveal," "dispel") would carry the same decisive, violent precision. Strong closure linkage and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method—leaving cryptic messages in library books—is introduced early ("Each night he crept along the balustrades, leaving cryptic messages") and used in one on-page beat (the titan whispers "Where the spine cracks, the truth leaks" into the margin). The method shapes the pretender's arrival (he comes "desperate to prove his legitimacy by deciphering prophecies") and primes the ink's activation. However, the messages themselves do not constrain the titan's choices or impose visible cost; they function as narrative machinery rather than a tactic tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is present throughout, providing spatial anchors (leaning shelves, balustrades, spiral carrel, cracked portico) that guide movement. The setting enables the search (books hold the ink pellet) and stages the climax (guards outside, titan watches from the carrel). The library's decay and isolation support the mythic tone. At closure, the library itself "settled into a new silence, shelves an inch closer to the earth, as if bowing," charging the final image. The setting is essential to plot and atmosphere, though it does not impose a mid-story constraint that alters the titan's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—"across the pause of shifting constellations," "the seventh night of the pause," "when Orion's belt hung slack"—is seeded early and frames the action window. The "seventh night" marks the climax, providing mild urgency. However, the pause does not tighten decisions or impose a visible deadline cost; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a live clock that alters the titan's moves. The constellations "exhaling" and "resuming their millennial march" at the end reprise the frame but do not reweight prior choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to unmask the pretender is stated early ("a man who wore borrowed gravitas," "desperate to prove his legitimacy") and drives the titan's search and tactical placement of clues. The titan's goal (restoring balance, not revenge) is declared and consistent. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction; no moment shows the titan hesitating or paying a cost to pursue this goal. The pretender's own stake (legitimacy) is sketched but never tested against a competing desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" appears explicitly in the climax ("the library itself seemed to sigh in graceful collapse") and is woven through the imagery: leaning shelves, cracked portico, dust rising, the pretender's visage melting, the library settling "an inch closer to the earth." The tone modulates from patient (titan searching) to charged (sundering) to elegiac (walking away), supporting the accumulative lens. The tone charges the final image—"shelves an inch closer... as if bowing"—with gentle, inevitable decay. Coherent and purposeful, though the explicit label in the climax is a minor tell rather than pure embodiment.</comment>
