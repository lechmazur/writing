<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The interpreter's interiority is consistent and voice-specific, with embodied sensations ("serenely electric pins") and micro-choices (unscrewing the hatch, discarding assumptions). However, the protagonist's agency reads as passive observation punctuated by technical gestures rather than choices under conflicting pressure. The final walk-down lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths; she simply descends lighter and wiser, which doesn't earn the transformation arc claimed. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves smoothly from discovery to epiphany without genuine struggle or misbelief that compounds stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an accumulative/textural lens early (lyric density, motif repetition, atmospheric escalation). Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; lunar perigee provides temporal pressure. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "every quiet is merely rehearsal" realization and the descent as rebirth, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no live option is foreclosed, no visible sacrifice made. The shard of hush dissolves offstage ("finally dissolved"), denying the reader the on-page moment where stakes crystallize. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs (the shard's true nature revealed as cocoon), but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it announces thematic satisfaction instead.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city and gorge are vivid and coherent throughout, with sensory specificity (rusted iron, bloated moon, girders creaking). The setting pressures the protagonist's work—lunar perigee tugs the structure, antennas hum with grammar, the tower stops swaying at the climax—demonstrating environment-as-constraint. Spatial choreography is clear: catwalk, maintenance hatch, transmitter room, descent. However, the micro-setting (the tuning coil, the fragment) doesn't demonstrably alter a tactical choice; the interpreter's actions feel preordained rather than forced by environmental limits or tool constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tuning the shard of hush before it silences all transmission—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fragment and shard magnetize, forcing the tuning attempt. However, escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency; the shard behaves conveniently (sliding "like a cat to a hearth") and dissolves on its own. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid at closure. The resolution grants the interpreter newfound certainty and a plan to build anew, but this reads as reward without sacrifice, undercutting the felt cost required for high-band entry under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—silence as cocoon, endings as beginnings, absence as presence—emerges from concrete images (the shard, the fragment, the loop metaphor) rather than direct statement. The final image ("every finale a hinge, every shard a seed") attempts to reweight prior material, but it does so through declaration rather than dramatized resonance. The "find the beginning in every ending" mandate is stated outright in paragraph six and then restated at closure, creating thematic echo rather than earned discovery. Subtext operates in the motif work (gold sublimating, silence expanding), but the protagonist's epiphany is over-articulated, diluting the non-literal answer the ending aims for.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature is distinct (poetic compression, metaphor-dense syntax, selective attention to frequency and light). Voice modulates with emotional intensity, tightening at the tuning moment, opening into lyricism at closure. However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated register that strains the POV's plausible lexicon—"serenely electric vacancy," "filament for the unheard," "pregnancy with every voice"—creating a homogenous lyric texture rather than a mind under pressure. The prose reads as authored rather than inhabited, especially during peak beats where compression should sharpen rather than ornament.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense throughout, but overwriting pervades peak beats: metaphors stack without breathing room ("chandeliers," "slow-motion waltzes," "bloated moon" in one paragraph), creating texture for its own sake rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("silence is absence" restated across multiple beats; "every ending" recurs four times in the final third). Template cadence is visible in repeated "she [verb]" openings across seven paragraphs. Filter verbs ("she heard," "she realized," "she understood") cluster in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. The closure beat is touched by ornamental phrasing ("mercury," "language older than silence") that obscures rather than charges the final image. No clear causality break, but momentum drags under the weight of decorative detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—interpreter tuning cosmic silence—offers a fresh angle on signal-as-metaphor, and the "shard of hush" concept is specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc (discovery → epiphany → descent) follows a familiar template, and key turns feel preordained rather than earned through character friction. The hollywood star fragment as catalyst is an inventive detail, but its function (feeding on vacancy, sublimating into photon) reads as symbolic convenience rather than grounded consequence. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode, which is a bold choice, but the final image's wisdom ("every finale a hinge") trends toward abstraction rather than durable, body-level insight. Transformation is attempted but not fully achieved; swap the interpreter for a different cosmic technician and the arc holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter is present throughout and her actions (climbing, tuning, descending) structure the narrative. She appears in the first line and drives all major beats. However, her choices feel procedural rather than conflicted—she unscrews the hatch, adjusts the dial, steps back—without visible friction or cost at decision points. The climactic tuning is described but not dramatized as a choice under pressure; the shard and fragment cooperate rather than resist. She is indispensable to the frame but not to the conflict; her interiority observes and interprets rather than deciding between competing options. Setup and closure gates are met, middle development is gestural.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment is introduced early (paragraph two), used in multiple beats (pinned to lapel, glowing warmer as assumptions are discarded, set on the tuning coil, sublimating into photon), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (coat lighter by one sequin). It shapes the tuning attempt and charges the final image. However, its function is largely symbolic—it "feeds on vacancy" and becomes "a filament for the unheard"—without demonstrable mechanical consequence or visible cost tied to its use. Removing it would require rewriting the tuning mechanism, but a different catalyst could serve the same function. Three gates met, causal role present but specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shard of hush is the story's central problem, introduced in paragraph four, pursued across multiple beats (discovery, observation, tuning, dissolution), and present at closure. It shapes the dominant stake (tune it before it eats every transmission) and alters tactics (the interpreter must discard assumptions to understand its true nature). The shard's behavior—silencing a thunderclap, sliding toward the fragment, dissolving into broadcast—drives escalation. Its reweighting from threat to cocoon is the story's conceptual turn. All three gates met, strong causal pressure, irreplaceable. Minor deduction for the dissolution occurring offstage ("finally dissolved") rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute "serenely electric" appears twice: as a descriptor of the vacancy (paragraph five) and as tactile feedback during tuning (paragraph twelve, "serenely electric pins"). It provides sensory texture but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The interpreter feels the pins and they "teach her bones their forgotten frequencies," but this is description rather than decision point. Setup gate met (early mention), middle and closure gates weak. The trait is consistent but ornamental; removing it would not break story logic or alter the tuning outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "tune" is the story's structural spine: signaled as the interpreter's job (paragraph four), prepared through discarding assumptions (paragraphs nine–ten), executed at the climax (paragraphs twelve–sixteen), and referenced at closure (paragraph twenty-two, "she would build a new receiver"). It shapes the dominant stake and occupies multiple beats. However, the tuning itself is under-dramatized—the interpreter "adjusted the dial" and "fed the fragment into the circuit"—without visible friction, failed attempts, or cost. The shard cooperates and the transmitter responds; no genuine obstacle complicates the action. All gates met, but causal pressure moderate due to smooth execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "by discarding assumptions" is signaled explicitly in paragraph nine and executed across three beats (silence is absence, gold is only metal, a story finishes). Each discarded thought heats the fragment, creating a mechanical link between method and outcome. The method shapes the tuning attempt and is referenced at closure ("one lifetime of conclusions"). However, the discarding is told rather than shown—no scene demonstrates the interpreter wrestling with a cherished belief or paying a price for letting it go. Setup and closure gates met, middle development gestural. The method is specific but could be replaced with "by opening herself" or similar without breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The setting—abandoned radio tower city on cantilevered legs over a black gorge—is vivid, specific, and present from the opening line through closure. It constrains the interpreter's work (rust, swaying girders, lunar gravity), supplies resources (antennas, transmitter room, tuning coil), and evolves with the action (tower stops swaying, gorge whispers upward). The descent at closure uses the setting's verticality to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The gorge's depth and the towers' precarious suspension create atmospheric pressure, though the setting does not force a tactical pivot. All gates met, strong causal involvement, irreplaceable architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "during lunar perigee" is signaled in the opening line and referenced twice more (paragraphs seven and thirteen: "bloated moon," "lunar gravity stretched the gorge wider"). It provides atmospheric pressure and a sense of cosmic alignment but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions or alters tactics. The interpreter works at her own pace; no countdown or urgency tied to the moon's proximity forces her hand. Setup gate met, middle and closure gates weak. The perigee is consistent and thematically resonant but largely ornamental; removing it would not change the tuning sequence or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" is stated explicitly as the interpreter's mandate (paragraph six) and restated at closure (paragraphs fourteen, twenty-one, twenty-four). It drives her interpretation of the shard (not threat but cocoon) and her decision to tune rather than destroy. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No scene shows her choosing this belief over a safer alternative or paying a price for it. The final realization ("every finale a hinge") echoes the mandate without friction. Setup and closure gates met, middle development weak. The desire is consistent but under-tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone "fantasy practicality" is coherent throughout: lyric language (cricket-antennas, chandeliers, waltzes) grounded by technical detail (maintenance hatch, tuning coil, reel-to-reel). The blend of wonder and procedure holds across all beats. Tone modulates slightly under pressure—compression tightens at the tuning moment, opens into reflection at closure—without breaking the established register. The final image ("counting each rusted step as the first word") sustains the practical-magical balance. However, the tone is static rather than dynamic; it charges the atmosphere but does not charge the final turn. All gates met, coherence strong, but the tone supports rather than transforms the closure effect.</comment>
