<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mercury-glass seer's interiority is vivid and embodied through concrete sensory details (feather texture, mirror-scrying). Her internal conflict between guilt over past prophecies and need to reclaim talents shows contradictory impulses, though the motivation for refusing to replant gifts feels somewhat asserted rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices. The custodian's shadow-stretching and spectacle-wearing details are striking but he remains functional opposition rather than a fully pressured second character. The final renunciation carries visible cost (sealing talents forever, becoming "no oracle") but the turn happens swiftly without prolonged internal resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (mercury-glass seer, labyrinthine bookstore, after remembering becomes painful) arrive early and remain stable. The causal chain is clear: she buried talents to escape soldiers → returns because home's shape has slipped → finds stone → custodian demands she replant → she refuses and breaks her reflection → escape with stone → seals it permanently. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (refusal to replant + sealing the stone = Earned Stasis) with visible cost: she loses oracle abilities permanently and releases the town from her guilt. One micro turn (custodian's offer) tightens pressure before the final choice. The lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture; escalation follows because/therefore linkage cleanly to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly realized through sensory details (wet paper, thunder, basalt walls, shelves carved into stone) and actively constrains choice: corridors corkscrew, the custodian rearranges sections nightly, the feather navigates via texture. The crow feather functions as micro-setting/tool that enables navigation and charges the final image when used to crack her reflection. Spatial choreography remains clear through nine spirals and the folio discovery. The mountain bookstore collapsing inward provides consequence at closure, and the outside valley dawn grounds the exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim buried talents to understand home's shape without becoming a weapon again) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the custodian demands she replant talents in exchange for the stone, forcing a trade-off between reclaiming memory and expanding his cage. Her refusal—cracking her reflection with the quill—demonstrates protagonist agency that narrows options with visible cost (she destroys her mirror-scrying gift on the page). The custodian's shadow-following and shelf-rearranging provide coherent escalating pressure under a causal lens. Cost is legible: she seals all talents permanently, choosing release over power.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (memory as both weapon and map; the cost of prophecy; home as carried weather rather than possessed place) emerges organically from action rather than statement. The crow feather, mirror-glass skin, and lost language stone accumulate meaning across beats without symbolic convenience. The final image—stone sinking to seal talents, "memory could belong to everyone, not seer nor soldier," thunder rolling behind her eyes—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution: she loses oracle power but gains the ability to go home unburdened. One minor slip: "not to wield but to fold them into a map she could burn once read" edges toward thematic echo but is anchored in present action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (mercury-glass skin catching sun, feather texture guiding turns, sensory filtering through prophecy-trauma). Diction remains elevated and lyric throughout, appropriate for the fantastical premise. However, high-density figurative language pervades most sentences without clear pattern-teaching ("mercury-glass," "eels in a sack," "taffy," "tuning forks," "storm-cloud suede," "ink-black wind"), creating occasional register drift that slows momentum in peak beats. The custodian's speech ("Seeking?" "Reality is rearranged by subtraction") reads distinct from narrative voice but his single exchange is brief. Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is ambitious and textured but suffers from density overload: nearly every sentence carries layered metaphor ("like eels in a sack," "cracked bell," "taffy," "tuning forks," "sparrow's heart," "root through her chest," "silver rain," "cataract of burning alphabets"). Template-cadence runs appear in the middle third (multiple "she [past tense verb]" openers). Several paraphrase loops: "mercury-glass skin" mentioned five times, "feather" texture described repeatedly without advancing new information. The final paragraph summary ("no oracle now—just a woman going home") edges toward scaffold. Information density is high but momentum drags under ornamental weight in non-closure beats. No clarity breaks at closure itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory navigation (via feather texture), reality-substitution (custodian rearranging sections), and memory-as-place creates a specific, non-obvious premise. The inversion—burying talents in books rather than hoarding them—feels fresh, and the custodian as antagonist-curator adds ingenuity. However, the "bookstore inside mountain" and "prophecy as curse" tropes are familiar fantasy territory executed well but not radically transformed. The final choice (cracking reflection rather than replanting) feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric-dense prose heightens atmosphere but occasionally obscures momentum, a mixed outcome.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mercury-glass seer present from opening; her reflection-cracking choice at the custodian confrontation creates the key turn that enables escape; her final decision to seal the stone rather than keep it redefines closure. Three beats of decision-making with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lost language stone appears in setup (paragraph 6), is sought and discovered (folio beat), touched to hear home's true shape (middle), and finally placed on ground to sink and seal talents (closure). Four beats; causal pressure throughout; charged reprise at end. Removing it breaks the story's logic and closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Buried talents frame the inciting need (she returns to reclaim them), create the custodian's demand (replant them), and define the final cost (sealed forever). Shapes stakes and tactics across three beats. Could be replaced with "hidden memories" or similar with moderate edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Custodian substitutes reality nightly by rearranging sections; this trait constrains her search (shadow follows to learn route and shift shelves) and explains the bookstore's threat. One key middle beat with visible tradeoff (she must quicken to stay ahead). Functional but the rearranging itself is told more than shown in her path.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Seed" recurs structurally: she seeded talents between pages (backstory setup), custodian demands she seed them anew (middle pressure), she refuses and instead seeds "the possibility that memory could belong to everyone" by sinking the stone (closure). Three beats; the final seeding redefines the verb's meaning and enables thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Feather introduced early (paragraph 7), used actively to navigate via texture (paragraphs 10, 15), tests the custodian's lapel (paragraph 10), and is drawn across her forearm to crack reflection (climax, paragraph 22). Mechanics matter: "barbs vibrating like tuning forks" and "tip across her mercury-glass forearm" show means shaping outcome. Four beats; indispensable to navigation and climax.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Labyrinthine bookstore occupying mountain is established in opening, supplies the custodian antagonist, constrains search via corkscrew corridors and rearranging sections, provides the folio hiding place (paragraph 16), and collapses inward at closure when she escapes. The setting is the primary antagonist's domain and its physics (shifting shelves, thunder hoarded between pages) shape tactics throughout. Removing it requires complete structural redesign.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" establishes present urgency in paragraph 2 and is echoed in "memory hurt because every prophecy she gave had chained another friend" (paragraph 13). Timeframe creates pressure but is not tracked as a live clock that alters moves; more of a motivational backdrop than a ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Motivation "to understand the shape of home" is signaled in paragraph 5 and dramatized when touching the stone reveals home's true shape (paragraph 17). Friction emerges in her refusal to wield talents again despite needing them to remember (paragraphs 14, 22). The final act (sealing the stone) releases guilt and lets her carry home "as a weather...without storm," resolving the want with visible cost. Three beats; desire drives and is conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Hidden thunder" appears literally (corridors smell of "thunder that refused to break," custodian's breath, hoarded lightning between pages) and charges the climax when "hidden thunder finally broke" to strike shelves. Tone modulates from foreboding (opening labyrinth) to confrontation (custodian exchange) to release (dawn valley). The final line "thunder at last rolling quietly behind her eyes" reweights the motif as internalized power rather than external threat, charging closure.</comment>
