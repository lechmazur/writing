<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mirelle's interiority is vivid and particular—her tactile cataloging ("cedar smelled like truce, iron like surrender") grounds her pacifist stance in embodied action. However, her arc leans heavily on epiphany and lacks genuine struggle; the radio-tuning sequence feels more like orchestrated revelation than earned confrontation. Internal contradiction is gestured at (wanting to open versus listening through) but not dramatized as simultaneous impulses under pressure. The sister's absence removes relational crucible; Mirelle's choices face no on-page resistance that could compound her blind spots.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered silence frequencies, each dial turn deepening the catalogue until the brass clasp's reweighting as "tuning fork shaped like a question" delivers Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchors cleanly (workshop, Mirelle, pre-fireworks). The closure unit lands with felt cost: leaving the clasp "unlocked, broadcasting its quiet frequency" forecloses her sister's original intent to lock secrets away. One meaningful deepening (four silences culminating in "Silence That Lets the World Speak Without Killing") satisfies length requirements. Causality is somewhat diffuse—each frequency appears more through poetic assertion than because/therefore linkage—but under Accumulative lens this is permissible if the final cadence shift reweights the stake, which it does.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop is sensuously rendered ("sawdust and gunpowder waiting for celebration") and the skylight-constellations anchor cosmic witness. Micro-setting via the cracked crystal radio constrains her method and the brass clasp's warming ("expanding") charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mirelle's priorities (textures translated to memories, sound-focused). The fireworks' mute arrival as "only colored light" in the final third demonstrates environment serving thematic pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cataloging silences to teach empathy—is signaled early and tightens through four escalating frequencies. The turn when she realizes the clasp "had never been meant to lock anything away" deepens understanding and forecloses the original goal (keeping secrets shut). Agency is present in each dial twist and the final choice to leave the clasp broadcasting. However, the escalation reads more as lyric accumulation than protagonist-driven pressure; no external resistance tests her commitment. The cost (renouncing secrecy, accepting the sister's loss) is felt but somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (path to empathy via listening, not locking) emerges organically from the radio tuning and clasp reprise. The final image—workshop doors open, child pausing mid-cry—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Yet the penultimate paragraph's "citizenship required no oath but this: to recover, to listen, to remain eclectic, descriptive, intuitively kind" edges into thematic echo, articulating the thesis in prompt-like language (−0.5). The piece leans on theatrical metaphor ("sky were an audience") that sometimes replaces scene pressure with meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured ("polite applause," "theatrical sincerity"), with a lyric-surreal register ("chrysanthemum of sound"). Psychic distance remains stable in third-limited. However, elevated diction ("overstuffed," "elongated moment") occasionally clashes with the visceral present, and some figurative choices feel imposed rather than character-filtered. The final paragraph's "velvet flags of a country whose only border was the moment before noise begins" is poetically controlled but risks purple. No head-hopping; filter use is voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines carry multiple jobs ("tears arrived without percussion; she let them glitter, tiny fireworks rehearsing"). Yet density spikes unevenly—figurative language clusters in nearly every sentence of the tuning sequence without clear pattern payoff, triggering the overwriting check (−0.5). Mixed metaphor: "silence, like perfume, reveals its notes only when overstuffed" conflates olfactory and auditory logic incoherently (−0.4). Paraphrase loops appear ("first she unscrewed… she turned the dial… Another twist… A third channel") with template cadence (−0.4). Clarity holds but propulsion lags under ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The radio-as-empathy-tuner and brass clasp as "tuning fork shaped like a question" offer a fresh synthesis. The pacifist-cataloging-silence premise is non-obvious and the theatrical tone commits fully. However, the "varieties of silence" conceit edges toward writing-exercise abstraction, and the fireworks backdrop feels like atmospheric convenience rather than integral pressure. The closing image (child pausing mid-cry) risks sentimentality. Transformation test: swap the clasp for another keepsake and much of the arc persists, indicating mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mirelle's eclectic-pacifist identity shapes her tactile translation method (cedar/truce) and her refusal to lock secrets, driving the cataloging goal and the final choice to broadcast rather than secure. Present in setup, middle tuning choices, and closure. Not merely observational—her decision to leave the clasp unlocked alters the workshop's function and the implied next-war trajectory. However, the pacifist trait is more asserted through coat-patch symbolism than tested by a conflicting live choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locked diary clasp appears in setup (dropped three wars ago), is held to the radio speaker mid-story, warms and expands at the climax, and is left unlocked on the bench at closure—four beats with evolving function. Its brass crescent shape enables the stethoscope metaphor and the final tuning-fork revelation. The "half-moon that once kept her sister's screams shut tight" reweights at the end when Mirelle understands it was "a tuning fork shaped like a question." Strong reprise with visible cost (renouncing secrecy). Swappable with minor edits to another keepsake (−0.3), preventing top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The path-to-empathy concept frames the cataloging mission and the final frequency of forgiveness. It shapes her tactic (listening rather than locking) and the closure image (workshop doors open, child hearing "a frequency that felt like held hands"). Present in setup motivation, middle tuning choices, and ending gesture. However, the concept operates more as thematic backdrop than on-page constraint—removing the empathy label would leave the silence-cataloging structure intact. Mid-band for shaping stakes without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" enables Mirelle's tactile translation method ("fingertips grazing cracked wood, translating textures into memories") and her rapid dial-tuning in the final rush. It appears in setup and drives the middle sequence. Yet the trait is label-heavy—asserted more than demonstrated through visible tradeoff. No clear cost: her intuition never misleads or exhausts her, limiting integration. Lyric seed to final reprise (walking "intuitively kind") reweights slightly but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Recover" frames the inciting goal (retrieve the clasp) and returns at closure when she leaves it to be recovered by others. It appears in the opening ("come to recover") and final third ("to recover, to listen"). The act of recovering constrains her presence in the workshop and her handling of the clasp. However, the verb is somewhat generic—"retrieve" or "reclaim" could substitute with minimal edits (−0.5). The dual meaning (physical recovery and emotional recovery) adds resonance but does not create irreplaceable causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tuning frequencies is signaled early (cracked crystal radio, vacuum tubes), structures the entire middle sequence (four dial turns, each yielding a silence variety), and delivers the climax when she finds "the frequency of forgiveness." The method constrains her tactic (she cannot simply open the clasp; she must listen through it) and its mechanics matter (dial progression, carrier waves, brass as conductor). Present across setup, multiple middle beats, and closure. Specificity (radio, frequencies, tuning fork) prevents easy swap. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop under stars is anchored early and provides the workbench, shelves of broken music boxes, and skylight for constellations as witnesses. The setting supplies the radio and the contained space for her cataloging ritual. The fireworks outside create the ticking clock and the mute-light contrast at the end. The workshop's open doors at closure invite others in, altering its function. Present in setup, middle staging, and ending image. Not merely postcard—space affects her isolation and the final gesture. However, swapping to another enclosed symbolic space (attic, bunker) would preserve most logic (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The pre-fireworks timeframe is signaled in the opening and returns when "the first fuse hissed" and "She knew she had seconds." It compresses her urgency ("tuned faster") and provides the mute-light payoff when fireworks bloom. Present in setup and closure. However, the clock is vague—no tracked countdown or escalating cues between opening and climax. The workshop sequence reads as timeless meditation until the fireworks suddenly intrude. Mid-band for framing without live pressure that alters tactics beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to catalog silences drives every dial turn and the notebook labeling. It is declared in the opening ("meant to catalog the varieties of silence") and fulfilled by the final entry. The motivation is dramatized through her whispered labels and the four-frequency progression. Friction exists between cataloging (analytical distance) and the sister's emotional weight, though this is more implicit than on-page conflicted choice. The motivation shapes structure but lacks a visible tradeoff—her cataloging never costs her a competing goal or exhausts her, limiting felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theatrical sincerity is embodied in "tears arrived without percussion," "theatrical and sincere" smile, and the grandiose metaphor ("sky were an audience"). The tone modulates with pressure: lush description in the tuning sequence, compressed urgency ("She tuned faster"), quiet resolution at the end. Coherent through turns. However, the tone occasionally tips into ornament that slows momentum (e.g., "velvet flags of a country") and the theatrical framing risks reading as authorial pose rather than character-organic stance. Present setup to closure; charges final image moderately.</comment>
