<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oracle's interiority is vivid and embodied through specific physical details (toes gripping stone, gold dust on fingerprints), and her obsession with "cartographing oblivion" shows clear motivation. However, the character operates in near-total isolation without meaningful internal contradiction or choice under pressure—she executes her mapping task without wavering or cost until the final dissolution. The backstory fragment about collecting pebbles as a child adds texture but doesn't tilt a present choice, and the climactic "stepped into her own outline" reads more as atmospheric culmination than a decision with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the oracle's progressive mapping of silence accumulates density and symbolic weight toward a final Conceptual Repricing where she becomes "the first coordinate" herself. The cost is conceptual and spatial—the fort dissolves, she merges with her own work—and the final image reweights the premise without requiring causal linkage. One structural weakness: the midpoint meanders through similar descriptive beats (drawing symbols, noting echoes, adding to the map) without a clear tightening or deepening until the star winks out, flattening escalation slightly before the ending lands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort is vividly rendered with salt-slick stone, crenels, and echoing stairwells; sensory details (taste of iron, cold seeping through stone) are filtered through the oracle's priorities and constrain her physical positioning. The fort's groaning stones and dissolving architecture directly charge the closure image, where "stone becoming suggestion" completes the thematic dissolution. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the parapet perch supplies both immediacy and symbolic elevation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the map before the last star dies—is signaled early and creates a ticking clock. However, the oracle faces no meaningful opposition or reversal; she simply progresses through her task until the star expires and the transformation occurs. The ending reweights her existence (she becomes part of the map), but this shift arrives as atmospheric culmination rather than through a choice that forecloses options or exacts visible cost. The accumulative pressure is present but doesn't tighten or deepen meaningfully in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the oracle's project of mapping absence and silence, with the final image offering a resonant answer: she becomes the coordinate around which "absence could finally orbit without longing." The recurring motifs—gold-leaf booklet shedding dust, the star's pupil, pebbles watching the shore—shift meaning across the piece without overt statement. One slip: "mildly obsessed with cartographing oblivion" edges toward meta-commentary, and the closing phrase "without longing" risks stating the emotional resolution rather than leaving it implicit in the image of her transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and internally consistent, with a lyric compression that matches the oracle's perceptual mode: "ambered hush," "marbled hush," "doors opening onto the same door." Diction remains controlled and character-particular throughout. Two frictions: the delayed footsteps ("her own, delayed and misplaced") introduce a surreal element without clear anchoring, risking a brief POV leak, and some passages ("latitude of last lullaby, longitude of unopened farewell") push toward ornamental lyricism that slightly obscures spatial and causal grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled and carries high information density in many lines ("The fort's stones answered, groaning as if remembering the weight of every absent banner"). However, multiple passages loop similar imagery without advancing pressure: the booklet is described shedding gold dust/flakes at least three times, the hush is repeatedly "ambered" or "marbled," and the mapping action cycles through bracket/spiral/smudge/line without escalation. The phrase "mildly obsessed" appears twice in identical form. Figurative density is near-constant (moth wings, guilty evidence, temperature of extinct suns, cooling wax) without pattern-teaching or strategic breathing room, risking overwriting in a lyric mode that doesn't fully offset the decorative load.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—an oracle mapping silence and absence into a living artifact—offers a fresh synthesis of cartography, apocalypse, and self-dissolution. Specific details (gold-leaf booklet, pebble-shore oracle, the ridge fort) anchor the concept in vivid particulars, and the final transformation (becoming a coordinate) feels earned in hindsight by the accumulation of symbolic gestures. However, the emotional arc and plot structure rely heavily on atmospheric escalation rather than surprising turns or non-obvious moral calculus, and the lyric mode's recursive patterning (hush → map → dissolve) follows a relatively predictable trajectory once the premise is established.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pebble-shore oracle is present throughout and her mapping action frames every beat. She makes one key choice at closure—stepping into her own outline—that finalizes the transformation. However, most beats show her executing a pre-determined task (opening the booklet, drawing symbols, writing coordinates) without meaningful decision points or opposition that would force tactical shifts. The character is more vessel than agent until the final act.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flaking gold-leaf booklet appears in the opening paragraph, is opened and used repeatedly (shedding dust, pages turned, symbols drawn), and its glowing persistence after the star dies charges the closure. The object's physical decay (cracking into continents, shedding dust) mirrors the fort's dissolution and the oracle's transformation. It constrains her action (she must finish before the star expires) and is causally active in the ending, though its role is more atmospheric vessel than irreplaceable tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ambered hush is seeded early ("the ambered hush that fell whenever the world forgot how to end") and recurs as "marbled hush" at closure, explicitly shaping the oracle's project: she summarizes silence into ink. The concept tightens the stakes (she must capture the hush before it ends) and appears in the final image ("a living hush folded small enough"). However, its mechanics remain abstract; it functions more as thematic atmosphere than a concrete constraint that alters tactics or forecloses paths.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "mildly obsessed" is mentioned twice ("mildly obsessed with cartographing oblivion") as a label but does not visibly constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The oracle's dedication to her task is dramatized through her persistence and immersion, but the "mildly" qualifier and the repetition suggest a descriptor rather than a trait that drives a tradeoff or mistake under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "retell" appears explicitly in paragraph five ("began to retell the silence the only way it could survive") and implicitly structures the entire mapping project. The oracle's summarizing and encoding of silence drives the accumulation toward closure. However, the action could be swapped for "record," "inscribe," or "translate" with minimal structural impact; its specificity matters thematically but not mechanically, and no single turn depends uniquely on the act of retelling versus other forms of capture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "by summarizing silence" is signaled early (paragraph five: "by summarizing silence into ink that would not dry") and shapes the oracle's encoding work (angled bracket for thunder, spiral for heartbeat). It appears again at closure as the map becomes "a living hush." The method is present across beats and contributes to theme, but its mechanics are abstract—symbols are drawn but their rules or constraints are not tested. The method reads more as thematic vehicle than as a constraint that alters tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort is anchored in the opening line and its physical details (parapet, crenels, stairwell echoes, groaning stones) ground every beat. The setting supplies the perch from which the oracle works and its dissolution in the final paragraphs ("stone becoming suggestion") directly charges the closure image. The fort's history (soldiers fled claiming night learned their names) primes the stakes, and the ridge's "slow exhalation" presages the transformation. The setting is essential to atmosphere and the ending's spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "when only one star remains in a dimming sky" is introduced in paragraph three and explicitly tightens the oracle's task: she must finish before the star expires. The star's dimming is tracked across multiple beats (flickering, elongating into a tear, becoming a contracting pupil) and its extinction triggers the closure. The clock is live and visible, and the oracle's urgency ("wrote faster, mildly obsessed with finishing before the star expired") dramatizes the pressure. The timeframe is causally active and shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to draw a map of an endless night" is stated explicitly in paragraph ten and implicit throughout as the oracle adds contours, symbols, and thresholds to the booklet. The map's purpose (to "cradle the world when light abdicated") raises the stakes. However, the motivation is told rather than tested through conflicting wants or costs; the oracle never wavers, doubts, or faces a tradeoff that would dramatize friction between desire and price. The ending fulfills the motivation but does not complicate it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone "marbled hush" is introduced early ("the ambered hush," "the marbled hush of something listening back") and maintained through lyric compression, long sentences, and recursive imagery. The tone modulates slightly under pressure (shorter clauses when the star dims, syntactic acceleration in "she wrote faster") and explicitly charges the final image ("the marbled hush that followed"). The tonal consistency and the return of "marbled hush" at closure integrate the element strongly, though the static mood across most beats trends toward mid-band rather than dynamic pressure.</comment>
