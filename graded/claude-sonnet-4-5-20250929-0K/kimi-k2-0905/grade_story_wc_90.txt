<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sister Halcyon's pacifist stance is declared but rarely tested by on-page choice under pressure. Her emotional states ("gravitationally lighter when happy") are asserted through poetic device rather than embodied contradiction. The holograms' warnings and her response ("Mercy is the mirror I choose") feel like staged internal debate rather than genuine friction. No credible cost or renunciation forecloses a path; she succeeds without struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no payoff; the reader learns setting/situation through lyric fragments rather than grounded anchors. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but the closure—slipping through the bruise into a redemptive dimension—offers no legible cost or foreclosed path; it is pure wish-fulfillment arrival. The "locked dimension" opens on cue when joy is declared sufficient, breaking any causal constraint. No meaningful before/after stakes change is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship hull and gravity spinner supply vivid, purpose-driven details that anchor the world. Photographs as material objects (stitched into a sail with hair monofilament) demonstrate micro-setting constraint. However, spatial choreography inside the ship remains vague and the "bruise in space" functions as pure metaphor rather than navigable environment. The ending garden-transformation is asserted, not shown through causal environmental change.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or internal conflict. No on-page reversal narrows options; the gravity spinner responds to declared happiness without dramatized cost. The ten billion deaths function as cosmic background rather than pressure that shapes Sister Halcyon's choices. The sail completes, joy floods, the door opens—linear wish-fulfillment with no trade-off or tactic shift forced by resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of shadow work and collective grief is stated directly ("shards of collective shadow work, the unacknowledged grief...") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. "Mercy is the mirror I choose" exemplifies Thematic Echo (−0.6). The final image of humanity as "a quiet lantern rather than a final bomb" is asserted meta-commentary rather than earned resonance. Kwan Yin's Tear and the photographs recur but their thematic weight is told, not discovered through character cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric register ("star-pocked silence," "gravitationally lighter when happy"). Diction is elevated and consistent, voice-motivated for the contemplative tone. However, peaks ("shadow work complete," "joy flooded her—not naive, but forged") slip into therapeutic abstraction and authorial assertion. No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression and ellipsis are present but the piece does not fully teach the pattern; some transitions feel like connective gaps rather than deliberate elision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff (overwriting penalty −0.5). Mixed metaphors appear: "bruise in space" widens into "corridor of whispers," then the ship "slipped through... like a needle through silk"—vehicles shift without coherent logic. Paraphrase loops: "vast auditorium of light where every photograph had become a living moment. Here the weddings danced, the birthdays laughed..." restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the catalogue beats ("the never-born children, the war-makers, the suicided Earth") flattens momentum (−0.4). Several beats summarize pivotal transformation (the sail unfolds, Tear dissolves, ship blooms) rather than dramatizing with concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—last pacifist on a recycled ship seeking to redeem collective grief—offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic and spiritual motifs. Kwan Yin's Tear and the photograph-sail demonstrate specificity. However, the emotional arc (loneliness → joyful transcendence) follows a predictable redemptive template without subversion or complication. The locked dimension opens exactly as declared with no cost, reducing risk. "Gravitationally lighter when happy" and shadow work integrate thematically but lack the friction or trade-off that would make the synthesis feel inevitable rather than assembled.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Sister Halcyon's pacifism is declared in the opening and mentioned when she stitches with "vows of non-violence," but no on-page choice tests or costs that stance. She encounters no violence to refuse; her arc is pure affirmation. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear is carried, warmed, placed over at the threshold, sewn into the sail's center, and dissolves into rain at closure—four distinct beats spanning setup, development, and payoff. Its sorrow fuses with Sister Halcyon's to complete shadow work (causal pressure). However, its properties (warmth, drinking tears, dissolving) feel interchangeable with any sacred object; specificity is limited. Strong integration but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Shadow work is named directly ("shards of collective shadow work," "shadow work complete") but functions as thematic label rather than on-page constraint. The concept does not narrow or enable a tactic; Sister Halcyon simply declares it done when her sorrow fuses with the Tear's. Functional as theme, but does not shape stakes or decisions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gravitationally lighter when happy" is signaled early, appears in the gravity spinner beat (her happiness makes the ship lose weight and drift), and returns in the final line ("gravitationally lighter when happy, forever pushing open..."). Two beats plus closure reprise. However, the cost or trade-off is never visible; happiness simply enables lift without friction. Lyric resonance present but lacks demonstrable price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stitching drives three beats: she stitches photographs into a sail with hair monofilament, raises the sail as prayer, and the sail unfolds into green aurora at closure. The action is irreplaceable (swapping to "weave" or "bind" would alter the vow-of-patience texture) and shapes the ending image. Causal pressure is present; the sail enables passage. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The shimmer of long-dried tears on photographs is signaled early ("drinking the faint shimmer...") and the Tear drinks them, but the mechanic—how tears enable the door to open—is never clarified on the page. The element primes the closure (tears → sorrow fusion → door opens) but remains abstract. Lyric resonance without dramatized mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is present throughout: hull stitched from dead cruisers, cloning crèche nursery, engine shrine, gravity spinner, hull plates singing. The ship's transformation (becoming a seed, rooting in the sky, blooming with vines) is central to the closure image. Spatial choices are limited; the ship is setting-as-vessel rather than constraint. Two gates (setup, closure) with thematic charge, but middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the last human was born" establishes post-extinction timeframe in the opening and recurs implicitly (never-born children, extinct species). However, the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions; Sister Halcyon proceeds at her own pace with no clock. Functional context but no tactical pressure. Present, minimal causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pushing open the locked dimension is the stated goal, repeated across beats ("the locked dimension she sought," "pushing open the locked dimension," "stood on the threshold," "forever pushing open"). The desire drives the sail-making and passage. However, internal conflict is absent; she never wavers or pays a visible price. Two gates (setup, closure) with clear pursuit but no friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" coheres across the piece: humming lullabies for absent children, refusing to flinch at the whispers, tending "redeemed shadows," the final image of her humming forever. Tone modulates from quiet determination to transcendent stillness at closure. The ghost motif (holograms, photographs, never-born souls) charges the final image. Strong tonal control with purposeful modulation.</comment>
