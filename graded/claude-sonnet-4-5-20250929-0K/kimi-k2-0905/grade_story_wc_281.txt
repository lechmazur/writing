<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation crystallizes on the page ("needed to illuminate these hidden pathways") and her actions follow a coherent arc from discovery to helping others. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract processing ("affectionate skepticism," "willowglass hope") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The transformation from private artist to public healer proceeds too smoothly without genuine internal friction—no visible cost attends her shift from solitary work to becoming a community beacon. Mrs. Chen's relief is shown, but Mira's own stake in privacy versus connection never dramatizes a competing impulse that would deepen her agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal lens: static shock activates the geode, which reveals light patterns, leading to the thought-shield solution. Orientation anchors (Mira, basement studio, post-recall timeframe) arrive clearly. The closure—Mira becomes a beacon and reflects on trusting science and intuition—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; her private refuge becomes public without dramatizing what she loses. The escalation from personal discovery to community healing proceeds in summary beats ("dozens, then hundreds") that compress key turns, weakening the causal chain at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio is established early with vivid sensory detail (beams of colored light, mirrors, projectors) and serves as the crucible for discovery and later sanctuary. The muscovite geode's physical properties (mica layers, static response) constrain Mira's experimentation and enable the solution. However, the studio's spatial choreography becomes vague during the montage of helping others—we lose the sense of bodies, tools, and proximity that grounded the opening. The setting charges the final image but does not constrain a choice at closure, limiting its integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring mental privacy to pill-affected victims—is signaled early and drives the arc. Mira's breakthrough (muscovite resonance disrupts telepathic signals) meaningfully tightens options, and the first test with Mrs. Chen provides an on-page reversal. However, the escalation from helping one neighbor to "hundreds" occurs in summary, flattening the pressure curve. The cost of Mira's transformation (private refuge to public beacon) is told rather than dramatized at closure, weakening the stake's felt weight in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the geode as both map and key, the idea that disasters can be healed through hidden pathways. The final image—Mira remembering that "sometimes the most profound solutions come not from forcing answers"—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, "willowglass hope" and "fractally precise" function as thematic labels rather than embodied concepts, and the ending statement ("trust both science and intuition") edges toward thesis articulation. The theme of privacy versus connection is present but not deeply complicated; Mira never faces a genuine cost in opening her refuge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and Mira's perceptual signature (attention to light, pattern, crystalline structure) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("fractally precise," "willowglass hope," "somatic markers") that feels imposed rather than character-particular, especially under the pressure of discovery. The single line of dialogue with the geode ("Of course you'd choose now to betray me") briefly grounds voice, but the remainder relies on summary narration that lacks rhythmic variation. Filter verbs ("watched," "realized," "understood") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are evident: "The static shock had activated something" / "Tonight, after the static shock, those pathways suddenly made sense" restates the trigger without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" sentence openings. Stock metaphors ("beacon," "sanctuary," "hidden pathways") accumulate without fresh texture. The montage section ("Working through the night," "word spread quickly") compresses pivotal beats into summary, reducing information density. Figurative language ("fractally precise," "willowglass hope") is used decoratively without grounding in concrete action, violating the overwriting density check.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—using a mineral's properties to counter telepathy pill side effects—offers a fresh synthesis of magical realism and speculative problem-solving. However, the execution leans on template plot beats (discovery → experimentation → breakthrough → helping others) without transformation. "Fractally precise" and "willowglass hope" read as quirky lexical ornament rather than lived specificity. The resolution proceeds without genuine risk or a non-obvious moral calculus; Mira's success is complete and her private-to-public transformation occurs without a visible trade-off that would deepen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's "affectionate skepticism" is mentioned early but does not constrain a key choice. She is present across all beats and makes decisions (building the studio, testing frequencies, creating discs), but the trait itself is ornamental—removing it would not alter her arc. The skepticism never creates friction with her intuitive leaps, so it lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in the opening (static shock), middle (mapping light, producing resonance), and closing (kept on workbench as reminder). It enables the solution through its specific properties (mica layers, static response) and shapes at least two beats. The final reprise reweights it as both catalyst and symbol. Strong integration, though the closure touch is reflective rather than active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall frames the external problem and drives Mira's motivation. It appears early (context for neighbors' suffering), middle (Mrs. Chen's test), and closure (hundreds seeking shields). However, the concept remains backdrop rather than active pressure on Mira herself—she never took the pills, so the recall shapes her goal but not her personal stakes or tactics under stress.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears three times as a descriptor (movements, patterns, attention) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It functions as label-only texture; swapping it for "meticulous" or "exact" would not alter beats. The trait lacks causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Devise" drives the middle arc: Mira devises a system of light frequencies, tests combinations, discovers the muscovite resonance. The action is essential to the breakthrough beat and shapes the solution. However, it is partially swappable (discover, invent, create would fit with minor edits), limiting irreplaceability. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" appears once in a single sentence explaining how Mira's body remembered finger patterns. The method is mentioned but not dramatized—we do not see her hands moving in specific patterns under conscious attention or the mechanism shaping later attempts. It seeds the discovery but lacks middle development and closure participation. Present in one beat only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The light painting studio is established early, houses all key beats (discovery, experimentation, testing, sanctuary), and transforms from private refuge to public beacon. It supplies resources (mirrors, projectors, geode) that enable the solution and its final state charges the closure image. The studio constrains Mira's methods and participates in all three gates. Strong integration across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the static shock" frames the timeframe and appears in the opening and a mid-story callback. However, time does not tighten decisions—Mira works "through the night" and "soon" in vague summary without a live clock that alters tactics. The timeframe is present but does not create escalating pressure or cost. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to illuminate hidden pathways to help the pill-affected victims" is stated explicitly and drives her arc from discovery to community healing. It appears early (crystallizes after the breakthrough), middle (Mrs. Chen test), and closure (becomes a beacon). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—she never struggles between privacy and exposure, so friction is absent. The motivation shapes two beats and the ending but lacks visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" is named once and described as solidifying into belief. The tone is optimistic throughout, modulating slightly from discovery wonder to communal purpose, but it remains static rather than charged by turns. The label itself is ornamental; removing it would not alter tonal coherence. The tone fits the arc but does not reweight the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>
