<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alya's motivation is present and consistent—she works to resurrect hope through engineering—but her interior life remains thin. The piece offers embodied moments (torch humming, glycol on tongue) yet her choices feel more illustrative than driven by contradictory impulses. The final walk-away reads as thematic closure rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. No secondary characters appear to apply relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through density of image and motif (sextant, glycol, brass birds) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the terminal acquires a heartbeat and Alya pockets the sextant as proof. Cost is conceptual—she leaves the space transformed but herself unchanged in a legible way—yet the final image reweights prior material. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (abandoned terminal, Alya, brass shard). One meaningful cadence shift when the birds stir suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terminal is vividly rendered (rust as Martian vermillion, frozen valves in attitudes of prayer) and the sextant shard constrains Alya's method (alignment with pictograph, measurement of flow). The glycol redirection depends on spatial layout; the canal, cooling tower, and fountain are causally linked. Sensory detail is filtered through engineering perspective (pressure × area, hydraulic arteries). The sextant charges the final image as portable meridian, satisfying the 9+ gate partially but not earning full 9-band due to minor decorative passages early.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resurrect hope via redirected flows. Pressure tightens when glycol reaches the fountain and the brass birds beat, a single meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present—Alya reroutes, welds, scratches equations—but the acts feel more procedural than fraught with competing goods or unavoidable harms. The spinning token and architect hologram add texture but do not narrow options with visible tradeoff. Cost is conceptual (reclaimed wonder) rather than a felt forfeiture that charges the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: hope as redirection, not perfection; measure what returns. The architect's line "Design for resurrection, not perfection; flow is forgiving" borders on direct statement but is dramatized through the glycol flow and the terminal's heartbeat. The sextant's shift from broken instrument to compass/proof offers a non-literal answer. Equation chalk lines as prayer flags and the "quieter circuit" image elevate without moralizing. Minor slip: "equations the city elders said were unsolvable" feels like declared rather than dramatized resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Alya with a distinct lyric register (calliope chords, Möbius confession, vermillion as rehearsal). Psychic distance is consistent. Compression is purposeful and legible. The architect hologram's dialogue feels functional but slightly expository ("Design for resurrection…"). Voice modulates under pressure (cap rotating like a slow black planet, valve clearing its throat) yet several passages rely on elevated diction (stoic wonder, kinetic sculpture, vectors of intention) that holds the reader at lyric distance rather than embodying immediacy. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout (calliope chords trapped, Möbius confession, Martian vermillion, zero-mass comet, prayer flags) without pervasive pattern-teaching or payoff; many metaphors decorate rather than constrain. Mixed vehicle: "mausoleum of intentions" and "vectors that doubled back" blur spatial logic. Paraphrase loop: "She spoke aloud to keep the silence honest" followed by immediate demonstration. Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" openers across paragraphs. Register drift: "functionally creative," "residual heat," "photovoltaic eye" elevate diction beyond POV's embodied urgency in peak beats. Information density is high but momentum intermittently stalls under ornament. Artifacts do not obscure closure but pervade enough to prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of abandoned spaceport, civil-engineer intern, and sextant navigation is specific and fresh. The maze-of-intentions framing and glycol-as-resurrection offer a non-obvious angle on hope-amid-decay. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the hologram architect elevate without gimmickry. However, the "equations for hope" framing and the intern-with-brass-shard setup echo template "young person redeems forgotten place" patterns; transformation is present but partial. The terminal's heartbeat and portable meridian image feel earned in hindsight. Proximity check passes; no famous-line echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alya is setup early, drives the middle beats (prying panel, rerouting glycol, scratching equations), and is present at closure (pocketing shard, walking out). Her choices (alignment, welding, redirection) alter the terminal's state and shape the ending. However, her decisions feel procedural rather than fraught with visible cost; observation and execution dominate over conflicted choice. Causal pressure is moderate; the sextant and glycol do the heavy lifting. Two gates (setup, middle) clearly met; closure participation is present but passive (she walks away with proof rather than deciding under pressure).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sextant shard appears early (pried from popcorn machine), used in midpoint beat (alignment with pictograph spiral), returns at closure (pocketed as compass/proof, warm portable meridian). Three beats with evolving function: discovery, tool, talisman. Charges the final image with reweighted meaning (not skyward but inward). Cost connection is conceptual (measure what returns). Irreplaceability is high; the arc etched with meridians and the alignment mechanic are specific. Minor gap: the "borrowed starlight" glow feels ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is named early (each corridor a vector that doubled back, Möbius confession) and revisited at realization beat (maze was test, not trap; vectors pointing inward). It shapes Alya's tactics (tracing, alignment) and the thematic answer (repair vs. escape). However, the concept functions more as metaphor than on-page constraint; the labyrinth does not narrow her physical options or impose a navigational cost. Closure linkage is thematic (quieter circuit, inward meridian) but not causal. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is lyric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" appears once as label ("stoic wonder" + "mechanical rhyme") and in the rerouting improvisation (welding as stanza, sextant as stylus). It enables the glycol redirection but is not dramatized as a tradeoff or constraint that costs Alya something else. Setup is implicit; middle development is shown through problem-solving; closure contribution is indirect (she will return with interns, carrying fragments). Swappability is moderate; "resourceful" or "ingenious" could replace with minor edits. No visible cost tied to the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Resurrect" frames the action early (resurrect hope, resurrect kinetic sculpture) and delivers at closure (terminal has heartbeat, birds patrol, Alya ready to resurrect stagnant futures). The glycol flow brings brass birds to life, the fountain arcs, and the terminal joins a quieter circuit—all major turns trace to this verb. Irreplaceability is high; "repair" or "revive" would lose the life-from-death charge. Cost is conceptual (reclaimed wonder vs. escape) and legible in the final image. Three gates met with strong causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled early (redirect hydraulic arteries, fluid dynamics) and executed in the middle beat (glycol rerouted from cooling tower to canal to fountain). Mechanics matter: alignment, welding, pressure equalization. The method enables resurrection and shapes Alya's toolkit (torch, service panel, conduits). Closure participation is strong: equations include "Redirected Flow × Residual Heat" and the terminal's heartbeat depends on the redirection. Irreplaceability is high; the hydraulic specificity is embedded in the engineer-intern frame. Three gates met with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The terminal is setup early (abandoned, echoes, cracked gate, decommissioned) and pressures every beat: utility core supplies pumps/valves, pictographs guide Alya, cooling tower provides glycol, canal and fountain channel flow, baggage carousel becomes platform. The space is not postcard but active constraint and resource. Closure depends on the terminal's transformation (heartbeat, brass birds, departing gate). Spatial choreography is clear and causal. Irreplaceability is total; no other setting offers these hydraulic arteries and kinetic sculpture. Three gates met with high causal and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" anchors backstory (carnival lights dimmed three nights ago) and thematic frame (carnival left, terminal joins quieter circuit). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Alya works at her own pace; no urgency or deadline alters her tactics. The "three nights ago" detail is ornamental. Closure mentions the carnival's departure again but as metaphor, not pressure. Setup gate met; middle and closure gates missing. Time is vague and untracked within the present action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early (redirect to resurrect hope, equations elders said unsolvable) and revisited at midpoint (scratching new equations on arrivals board). Closure delivers proof (sextant as compass, terminal heartbeat, theorem searching for equal sign). Desire is present but more thematic than conflicted; Alya does not face a friction between wanting hope and another competing cost. Two gates met (setup, closure); middle dramatization is procedural (she engineers without internal resistance). The want is told and illustrated but not tested against a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is coherent throughout: "stoic wonder" named once, "small stoic smile" at closure, and embodied in Alya's pragmatic yet lyric attention (rust as rehearsal, cap as slow planet, valve clearing throat). Tone modulates with pressure (discovery → alignment → resurrection) without breaking. The final image (portable meridian, pre-dawn darkness, taste of brass and glycol) charges with quiet intensity. Voice and diction support the tone across turns. Three gates met; the tone is indispensable to the piece's texture and closure effect.</comment>
