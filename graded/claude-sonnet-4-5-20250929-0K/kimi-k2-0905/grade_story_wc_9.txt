<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's grief over her lost daughter is embodied through concrete objects (saucer, cards, traced hand) and action (climbing, reading cards, speaking the name aloud), avoiding label-only interiority. However, the protagonist remains largely passive—events happen to her (cloud descends, crack heals, time floods back) rather than through her active choices under pressure. The final act of speaking the name and inviting the night to tea reads as renunciation with cost, but the gesture arrives after the major reversals have already been delivered by external forces. Motivation is consistent but the arc leans heavily on atmospheric transformation rather than contradictory impulses forcing difficult trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (cartomancer, midnight glade, after the birth) arrive within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery and metaphor accumulate (time pooling, cloud as cathedral, saucer crack as river/lightning bolt) and the final image of the healed saucer and spoken name reconfigures the dominant stake of reclaiming lost time. However, causality is soft—the cloud "shudders" and descends, the crack "detaches" and strikes her chest, time "rushes back"—without clear because/therefore linkage to the protagonist's prior choices. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid: she accepts the loss, names the daughter, and internalizes the glade), but the cost is implied rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or narrowed option on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The midnight glade, silver moss, and cloudbound setting are vivid and sensorially distinct, filtered through the cartomancer's grief-laden perception (moonlight "tasted of sugared milk gone cold"). The saucer crack functions as micro-setting, constraining the card-reading ritual and later detaching to strike her chest—a purposeful object-as-setting move that charges the closure. Spatial choreography (climbing, kneeling, landing in backyard) remains coherent across the descent. The glade's transformation from above-clouds to inside-cloud to internalized space is a strong atmospheric arc that supports the thematic reconfiguration without becoming postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming lost time and confronting the daughter's absence—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is largely atmospheric rather than agentic: the protagonist kneels, spreads cards, reads, traces the name, and speaks it aloud, but none of these acts narrow options or force a visible trade-off. The cloud descends on its own; the crack heals itself; time floods back without the cartomancer relinquishing a concrete resource or foreclosing a path. The final act of speaking the name and inviting the night to tea reads as acceptance with implied cost (she will carry this forever) but lacks the on-page price or tightening typical of 7.0+ under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery: lost time accumulates in liminal spaces, grief is a fracture that cannot fully heal, and love refuses to end even when its object is absent. The recurring saucer crack, the traced hand, and the phrase "choking beauty" accumulate meaning across beats and the final image—saucer healed into a silver seam, glade internalized, tea offered to the night—reweights the opening question without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution: the daughter "never finish[es] growing up," and other grieving parents will find only an outline, not the cartomancer herself. Subtext operates strongly in gesture and image (the crack as closed eye, tea with the night). Minor slip: "choking beauty" borders on thematic echo but is anchored in sensory particulars enough to avoid overt sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; focalization through the cartomancer's grief-saturated perception is consistent (the moonlight "tasted," the cloud "shuddered, remembering"). Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the fairy-tale register, but at peak emotional beats ("The cartomancer's throat filled with choking beauty") the metaphor leans toward stock poeticism rather than character-particular idiom. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned imagery (crack as river/canyon/lightning bolt, time as pooling liquid) are taught early and sustained. Psychic distance remains close but declarative, with limited embodied contradiction. No dialogue to evaluate. Distance control is clean but the prose occasionally drifts into narrated summary ("she understood," "she realized") where dramatized perception would sharpen the moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and image-dense, with vivid constructions ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "cloudbound repentance," "grease outline that never completely washes out"). However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without clear pattern-teaching or escalation, risking ornamental density: "choking beauty," "cathedral of vapor and regret," "lightning bolt of memory." Template cadence appears in repetitive participial and past-tense stems across the middle third. The phrase "willingly perplexed" recurs mechanically without reweighting. Minor clarity issues: "unfasten" is used twice (once for strap, once metaphorically for grief) without clear connection, and the simultaneous laughing/weeping risks cliché. No loops or scaffolding, but the density flattens momentum in the descent sequence where urgency would benefit from leaner syntax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy, grief for a stillborn child, and literalized metaphor (time pooling in clouds, crack as doorway) is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms familiar grief-processing tropes through the family custom of tracing hands and the dolls' tea-party imagery, grounding abstraction in domestic particulars. The ending avoids the explain-everything trap by leaving the cartomancer's fate ambiguous (she becomes an outline, a guide, but remains "not finished"). However, the premise risks proximity to workshop prompts about processing loss through magical realism, and the resolution—externalized magic healing the internal wound—leans on convenience (the cloud descends, the crack heals) rather than a choice that transforms the protagonist's stance through visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer climbs, kneels, spreads cards, reads, traces the name in the sky, lands, speaks the name aloud, and sets the saucer on the grass—six beats of involvement. However, most are observational or ritualistic rather than decisional: the cloud descends on its own, the crack detaches on its own, time floods back without her choosing to relinquish anything. The final act of speaking the name aloud is a meaningful choice that forecloses silence, but it arrives after the major reversals. Setup is immediate, development is observational, payoff is present but passive. The cartomancer's agency shapes the frame but not the key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The saucer crack appears in paragraph 2, serves as the card-reading surface in paragraph 5, widens into a canyon of voices in paragraph 8, detaches and strikes her chest in paragraph 13, and returns healed with a silver seam in paragraph 15—five distinct beats. Its properties evolve (glowing with memory, widening, detaching, healing) and the final healed state charges the closure image (a closed eye, filled with moonlight). The crack is irreplaceable: its history (imaginary tea the daughter never tasted) and transformation (fracture to seam) anchor the emotional arc. Setup early, development across middle beats, payoff at closure with visible reweighting. Causal pressure is moderate (it enables the card reading and symbolizes grief) but the healing happens to the object rather than through the protagonist's choice, capping at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Cloudbound repentance" is named as the first card turned and its ink bleeds upward, leading to the realization that lost time condenses into clouds. The concept appears in the title of the card, is echoed thematically (the cloud apologizes for raining, the cartomancer offers repentance by speaking the name), and recurs in the final paragraphs ("teaching the clouds to forgive themselves"). However, it does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page—it is a thematic label rather than a rule or pressure that the protagonist navigates. Setup is immediate (paragraph 6), development is metaphorical (paragraph 7), payoff is thematic echo (final paragraphs). The concept enriches atmosphere but remains ornamental to the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" appears three times: paragraph 3 (she "came willingly perplexed"), paragraph 18 ("remained willingly perplexed"), and implicitly in the frame. It is a label rather than a trait that constrains action—perplexity does not cost her anything or enable a specific tactic. The phrase recurs as thematic punctuation but does not drive a beat or narrow options. Late first use (paragraph 3 of 19), no middle development where perplexity alters a choice, and payoff is recapitulation rather than reweighting. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears twice: paragraph 5 (she unfastens the leather strap to release the cards) and paragraph 13 (the saucer crack "unfasten[s] the clasp of grief"). The first use enables the card-reading ritual; the second is metaphorical and marks the emotional turn. The action is specific but not irreplaceable—she could "unbind," "release," or "open" with similar effect. Setup in paragraph 5, metaphorical payoff in paragraph 13. The verb recurs purposefully but the link between physical and metaphorical unfastening is asserted rather than dramatized through causal pressure. Mid-band: functional reprise without strong causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths is introduced in paragraph 4 (she traced her newborn's hand once; the print vanished) and returns in paragraph 10 (she performs the custom on the cloud itself, tracing her hand and spelling the daughter's name). The custom is specific, generational, and charged with loss (the first trace vanished). It shapes the climactic gesture—tracing the name in the sky is the moment of peak emotional investment—but the mechanics are simple (trace, name appears) and the custom does not constrain earlier attempts. Setup early, payoff at the peak beat, but no middle development where the method alters tactics. Lyric reprise without causal pressure, landing in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds anchors the opening and recurs throughout: silver moss that grows where starlight cannot reach, the altitude where minutes fall upward, the cloud as cathedral. In paragraph 15 the protagonist "landed softly in her own backyard," and in paragraph 18 the glade is revealed to be "no longer above clouds but inside her." The setting pressures the ritual (the glade is the one place where lost time accumulates) and the final internalization charges the closure. Setup immediate, development (the glade as liminal problem-solving space) across the middle, payoff (internalized, becomes a guide for others) at closure. The glade is not easily swappable but its spatial properties (above/inside/internal) are metaphorical rather than tactically constraining, capping at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the birth" anchors the story's premise (paragraph 3) and specific timestamps recur (3:42 a.m. labor began, 4:17 heartbeat stopped, 5:03 the word "choice," paragraph 15 she lands at 3:42 a.m.). The timeframe provides emotional specificity but does not tighten decisions—no live clock forces her to act faster or choose between competing uses of time. The timestamps are commemorative rather than tactical. Setup early, no middle pressure where time alters tactics, payoff is symbolic (landing at the minute labor began). Functional frame without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to find where lost time accumulates is stated in paragraph 3 ("she had come...to the one altitude where minutes fell upward") and drives the climb and card-reading ritual. The desire is clear and consistent, but friction is minimal—she does not weigh competing wants or face a cost to pursue this goal until the very end. The realization in paragraph 7 ("lost time did not disappear but condensed into these very clouds") answers the question, and the remaining beats execute the recovery without further conflict. Setup early, development is cognitive (she learns the answer), payoff is acceptance (she internalizes the glade and offers tea). Motivation is present and purposeful but lacks on-page trade-offs or competing fears that would raise it to 7+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" is introduced in paragraph 9 ("The cartomancer's throat filled with choking beauty"), recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("the choking beauty of almost"), and suffuses the prose throughout: grief and wonder intertwined, loss made lyric. The tone modulates with pressure—early wonder ("silver moss," "spiral that tasted of iron and lullabies"), mid-story sorrow (porcelain voices, "canyon through which tiny...voices rose"), and final acceptance (moonlight tea, "older but not finished"). The oxymoric phrase "choking beauty" crystallizes the emotional register and charges the final image. Setup mid-story, development through contrasts (beauty/sorrow, presence/absence), payoff in the final third where the phrase returns and reweights the entire arc. Tone is coherent and purposeful, reaching low-7s.</comment>
