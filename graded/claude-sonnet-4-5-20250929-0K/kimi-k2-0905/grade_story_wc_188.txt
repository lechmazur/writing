<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Luma's motivation is clearly established (defying hopelessness), but her interior life remains largely abstract—we see her actions (chanting, trading, blowing dust) without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The governor's reversal from enforcing despair to consenting to the demonstration feels unmotivated; no prior causality explains why curiosity would override his stated policy. The silver dust that neutralizes the sentry and the mosaic note functioning as both literal object and symbolic heart collapse into convenient magic without earned constraints or visible cost to Luma's choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt (Luma, fortress, dusk) and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images and pattern-density build toward a final reweighting. The closure lands—starlight returns, black sand floats—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt on Luma's body or choices; the governor's hourglass and the sentries' smiles are effects witnessed, not prices paid. The kerosene rag → rocket → cracked sky sequence holds causal linkage in its mechanics, yet Luma's agency is undermined by the convenience of the silver dust passage and the governor's unexplained consent, which together function as plot lubrication rather than earned turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blooming fortress with stone petals and the spiral stair with constellation murals establish a vivid, coherent setting anchored early. Spatial choreography (dry moat, stair, battlement) tracks cleanly, and the kerosene rag knot and mosaic tiles are handled on the page, constraining Luma's rocket-building choice. The final image of the fortress "continuing its slow nocturnal opening" charges the closure with environmental change, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement for Q3, but some descriptions (gunpowder-and-pine perfume, the corked darkness) lean ornamental rather than shaping immediate tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—piercing the imposed darkness to restore hope—is signaled early and holds through the ending. One meaningful tightening occurs when Luma must negotiate passage (the sentry confrontation) and secure the governor's consent, yet both obstacles resolve via convenient tools (silver dust, his unexplained curiosity) rather than protagonist-driven trade-offs. The rocket launch and sky-cracking constitute a decisive physical act, but the escalation lacks visible cost: Luma risks nothing tangible (her satchel is already empty, her promise to "join the sentries" never feels credible), and the resolution feels ordained rather than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—hope as defiance of imposed despair, playfulness versus calcified seriousness—emerges from images (corked sky, black sand, the mosaic "Remember") and Luma's argument with the governor. The final image of stone petals releasing perfume and the drifting mosaic heart offer resonant, non-literal answers without overt moralizing. However, the governor's line "seriousness without playfulness calcified into the very despair he feared" edges toward thesis statement, and Luma's closing summary ("her job was never to keep the sky but to keep it opening") explains rather than trusts the enacted particulars to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with a consistent elevated-lyric register ("chanted while walking, a low rhythm that matched the pulse of the ramparts"). Psychic distance remains stable, and Luma's perceptual bias (noticing fire, rhythm, light) is character-specific. The dialogue exchange with the governor is sparse but functional, though both speakers' diction converges into the same philosophical register ("reckless weight that cracked the shell of order" vs. "seriousness without playfulness calcified"). The narrator's lexicon is controlled, but phrases like "filtering memories of every sky she had ever lit through ambient awareness" and "serious playfulness in their step" occasionally drift into abstraction that tells rather than shows.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout (stone petals, corked heavens, mosaic tiles as teeth, black sand as fireflies), which charges many images but occasionally blurs clarity in peak beats—"filtering memories...through ambient awareness, letting the lost starlight pool behind her eyes" stacks metaphor without grounding the action. Paraphrase loops appear: "the air itself felt corked" and "some great hand had stoppered the heavens" restate the same concept adjacently. Template cadence runs emerge in the middle third ("She struck flint...sparked leapt...which bloomed...the rocket's tail caught...the shell lifted"), and several sentences open with participial structures in sequence. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags under decorative layering in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—fireworks designer versus despair-enforcing governor, hope as literal sky-opening—offers a fresh symbolic frame and avoids stock fantasy tropes. Specific details (kerosene rag with ceramic mosaic, stone fortress blooming at dusk, black sand refusing to fall) feel particular to this voice and world. However, the emotional arc (defiant artist breaks tyrannical stasis) and the mechanical resolution (one big gesture cracks the spell) echo familiar templates without transformation; the governor's immediate reversal and Luma's unopposed success flatten the risk. The "serious playfulness" motif is announced rather than enacted through tactical friction or choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Luma appears in every beat, trades the knot, negotiates the sentry and governor, strikes flint, and launches the rocket—her choices create the key turns. However, her agency is undercut by convenient tools (silver dust) and the governor's unmotivated consent, reducing her decisions' felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot is introduced at the dry moat, traded to Luma with the mosaic note inside, concealed under the rocket tubes, ignited, and fuses into a glassy heart that pierces the sky—it drives three distinct beats and shapes the closure image. Swappability is low; the knot's dual function (fuse + mosaic carrier) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mosaic note spelling "Remember" is revealed inside the rag knot, fuses into a heart during ignition, and drifts across the reborn sky in the final image, reweighting the closure with a charged reprise. It does not constrain middle choices but participates in closure, satisfying two gates (setup, payoff) and showing lyric resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Luma chants in the opening, resumes chanting after the trade (weaving Jax's name for courage), and chants a new route at the end—three mentions across the arc. The chanting is described but never enables or constrains an on-page action with visible cost; it remains atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Filter" appears as verb ("filtering memories...through ambient awareness") in the stair-climb beat, and the concept recurs when starlight "filtered downward through ambient awareness into every mind below" at closure. The filtering mechanism enables the climactic effect (memories pooled → starlight released), making it essential to the resolution, though its mechanics are told rather than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" is signaled on the stair ("filtering memories...through ambient awareness") and recurs at closure ("filtered downward through ambient awareness into every mind below"). The method enables the sky-cracking effect and shapes the story's conceptual logic, but its mechanics remain abstract—no on-page cost or constraint tests its limits during Luma's climb.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming fortress frames the opening and closing images (stone petals unfolding, releasing perfume), the spiral stair provides spatial pressure, and the highest battlement stages the climactic confrontation. The fortress's nocturnal opening mirrors and reinforces Luma's act, charging the final image; the setting participates in closure and supplies tactical resources (the stair, the battlement vantage).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "hush of a night with no stars" and the eclipse-imposed darkness establish the temporal pressure early and persist through the ending ("a sky reborn enough for wishes"). The timeframe shapes the stakes (prolonged despair) and the resolution (starlight returns), but no on-page clock or urgency tightens Luma's tactics—she moves at a steady, ceremonial pace without time pressure altering her choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Luma's motivation "to defy the gravity of hopelessness" is stated early and drives her journey to the fortress, her trade with Jax, and her demonstration for the governor. The desire is dramatized in her actions (launching the rocket) but not conflicted—no on-page cost tests her commitment, and her success arrives without friction between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tone label "serious playfulness" is announced explicitly ("serious playfulness in their step") and echoed in Luma's laugh ("bright as cracking crystal") and Jax's "rag knot soaked in laughter." The tone modulates minimally; elevated-lyric diction dominates throughout without tonal pressure shifts matching escalation. The concept is declared rather than enacted through choice friction or voice variation under stress.</comment>
