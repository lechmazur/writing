<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and acoustically filtered ("minor seventh begging resolution"), with embodied emotion in her planting the seed and ritual acts. The grandmother's backstory anchors Mara's present renunciation of bonfire tradition with visible cost—she walks away from the crowd-based model. Internal contradiction appears in the decision to plant a seed in a mendicant's bowl (foolish vs. traditional), and the final choice to leave the bowl humming shows agency that forecloses collection-based survival. Minor slip: the grandmother's voice and Mara's own sometimes converge in elevated register during peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered acoustic imagery, the seed's root breaking through the bowl, and the wire-bridge improvisation; the final seedling leaf constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the bowl's humming and the green leaf reweight the mendicant tradition with conceptual cost—no bonfire, no crowd. Causality holds under this lens: each unfinished note accumulates pressure until the greenhouse "kept breathing unfinished music." Cost is legible in Mara's departure and the bowl left behind. One micro turn (shipwreck bell answering) supports without fragmenting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse with shipwrecks supplies concrete constraint: Mara kneels between durian trees, uses ship's bell percussion, breaks rigging wire for a bridge. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("ash-slick mud," "chronic hush," "drip of condensation...minor seventh"), filtered through acoustic perception. The bowl planted in wet soil and the wire-bridge both constrain and enable the final resonator, directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting is indispensable to the stakes and the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reimagining family tradition (survival-by-performance to creation-without-audience) is signaled early and tested on the page. Pressure accumulates through planting the seed, constructing the wire-bridge, and playing unfinished phrases until the greenhouse "kept breathing." The seedling's emergence and Mara's departure constitute a tightening that forecloses the mendicant path with felt cost. No explicit antagonist, but the "chronic hush" and shipwreck silence apply situational pressure. Agency is clear: Mara's choices (planting, building the resonator, leaving the bowl) drive the turn. Cost is visible in walking away from both crowd and bowl.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in the unfinished as invitation rather than abandonment—emerges from particulars: the composer's unresolved cadence, grandmother's cracked voice, the seed's root reaching toward drowned stories, and Mara's refusal to complete phrases. No overt thesis statement; the final seedling and humming bowl answer the central question non-literally. The bowl's transformation (mendicant vessel to resonator to abandoned seed-bed) charges the ending without moralizing. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and the wire-bridge improvisation. Minor slip: "vast, simple magnificence" in the final line edges toward abstraction, though it's earned by prior imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Mara's acoustic filter. Perceptual signature is distinct: "drip of condensation...minor seventh begging resolution," "chronic hush," sensory hierarchy shaped by musician's ear. Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated throughout. No dialogue. Distance control is clean; interiority remains character-bound. Minor register drift: phrases like "mendicant's bowl" and "vast, simple magnificence" push into slightly formal territory during emotional peaks, though the overall texture holds. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or thematic motif. Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the tradition motif. Minor overwriting: "ash-slick mud," "chronic hush," "copper light," and figurative clusters in adjacent sentences occasionally pile up ("jagged ring," "tired listeners," "minor seventh begging resolution" within the first three paragraphs). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Syntax supports momentum. The density and lyric texture elevate without obscuring clarity, though the figurative load is borderline dense in the opening third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Premise—post-apocalyptic musician reimagining family tradition through acoustic resonance in a drowned greenhouse—synthesizes familiar elements (artist-after-disaster, family legacy) into a fresh, specific frame. The wire-bridge resonator, unfinished melodies as invitation, and the bowl's transformation from mendicant tool to seed-bed are non-obvious. Emotional truth in renouncing the crowd for creation grounds the concept. The ending feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in withholding traditional closure and embracing unfinished phrases heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous lines. Conceptual integrity is strong.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Echo-harbor violinist shapes all key turns: planting the seed, building the wire-bridge, playing unfinished phrases, leaving the bowl. Present in opening, middle wire-bridge construction, and departure. Causal pressure throughout; closure depends on Mara's acoustic perception and ritual choices. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Mendicant's bowl appears in setup (grandmother's survival tool), middle (planted with seed, transforms into resonator via wire-bridge), and ending (left humming, seed sprouting). Drives three beats: planting, bridge construction, and abandonment. Reweighted from collection vessel to creative instrument to autonomous seed-bed. Cost tied to leaving it behind. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Chronic hush shapes stakes (silence as antagonist and canvas) and tactics (unfinished notes, pauses as doorways). Present early ("chronic hush of something forever unsaid"), tested in middle (hush "widened like a held breath"), lifted at ending ("chronic hush lifted just enough for night insects"). Constrains Mara's performance choices. Not ornamental, but slightly more thematic than causal compared to the bowl and violin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Acoustically perceptive enables key actions: hearing "minor seventh begging resolution" in condensation, constructing the wire-bridge resonator, sensing the greenhouse exhale. Present in setup, middle (wire-bridge), and ending (humming bowl). Drives two beats with visible cost (leaving behind mendicant model). Specific and irreplaceable; trait shapes all tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unbind" the bowl from emptiness frames the dominant stake and drives the seed-planting, wire-bridge, and departure. Present early ("intended to unbind it from that fate"), executed in middle (planting, playing), and resolved at ending (bowl left humming, no longer empty or mendicant). Redefines options; not easily swappable. Cost is visible in abandoning the crowd model.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Family tradition of storytelling around a bonfire is present in setup (grandmother's bonfire, "tossing the bowl into the flames"), contrasted in middle (Mara's choice "no bonfire...only the vast...magnificence"), and reprised at ending ("family tradition reimagined: no bonfire, no crowd"). Shapes Mara's renunciation with felt cost. Two beats: grandmother's memory and Mara's departure. Essential but slightly more thematic than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks constrains all tactics: wet soil for planting, durian trees for kneeling, glass for echoes, ship's bell for percussion, rigging wire for bridge. Present throughout; drives at least three beats. Final image (seedling, humming bowl, breathing greenhouse) depends on this exact setting. Indispensable; story logic fails without it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the rainforest burns" establishes post-disaster timeframe in setup ("sky still wore the color of old pennies"), informs middle urgency (ash, charred seeds), and contextualizes ending renewal (green leaf against copper light). Shapes atmosphere and stakes but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. Two gates (setup, ending resonance). Functional across arc; not a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>To find beauty in the unfinished is dramatized in the unresolved cadence story, playing fragments without resolution, and leaving the bowl to hum alone. Shapes all key choices: planting, playing, departing. Present early (violinist "who once refused to finish"), middle (playing "stopping before the melody could resolve"), and ending ("a note that refuses to end so something else can begin"). Conflicted desire drives renunciation with visible cost. Three beats; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Magnificent simplicity coheres through restrained diction, single-stake focus, and the final understated departure. Tone modulates with pressure: lyric density in the greenhouse, quiet resolve at dawn. Charges the final image ("vast, simple magnificence") without overstatement. Coherent across turns; no mood whiplash. Strong contribution to closure effect.</comment>
