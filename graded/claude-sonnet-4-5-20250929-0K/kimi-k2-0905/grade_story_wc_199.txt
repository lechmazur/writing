<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation crystallizes clearly ("she would build tiny monuments"), but the transformation claimed in "felt herself emerge transformed always" is asserted rather than demonstrated through embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The phrase "mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds" at the climax reads as label-speak rather than specific interiority. Supporting sorters appear but apply no relational pressure; their contribution feels ornamental. The ending choice (releasing the moonstone) lacks visible cost—no foreclosed path or trade-off appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens through its mosaic structure and lyric repetitions. However, the closure—leaves drifting down, Mireya resuming seed-sorting—lacks visible cost; the "mirror arbor" appears as a reward without forfeiture, and no option is foreclosed on the page. The monuments-to-sky sequence reads as a miraculous solution rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. Multiple micro-turns (leaves rise, runes appear, monuments built, moonstone burst) occur, but none narrows options or deepens pressure in a way that reweights the dominant stake with undeniable cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor and floating grove details are vivid and consistent. The moonstone cabochon dust speck and ascending leaves constrain Mireya's attention and frame her project, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Spatial choreography (highest bough, catwalks, lichened branch) remains clear. The "hush where past meets prophecy" and the final mulch-scent callback charge the frame without overwhelming momentum. However, the mirror arbor and verdant reflection above arrive as postcard description rather than a resource or constraint that alters tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring equilibrium by remembering forgotten things—is signaled early and frames the monument-building project. Mireya's decision to build monuments and release the moonstone shows agency, but the escalation is additive (more monuments) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The moonstone burst and sky-parting resolution feel rewarded rather than earned through a trade-off; no visible price or loss accompanies the climax. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece deepens texture but does not reweight the stake with felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—collective memory and what deserves remembering—emerges organically from the monument-building action rather than assertion. The dialogue between grove and mortals avoids a stated moral. The moonstone's radiance and the final folk-saying reprise offer a resonant image. However, the ending leans toward tidy satisfaction: the problem is solved, the arbor drifts on, and no conceptual or social cost charges the final image. The phrase "emerges transformed always" in the last paragraph risks thematic echo by restating the premise rather than reweighting it through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mireya; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and lyric ("pale moths," "soft thunder," "mossy delight"), though register occasionally drifts elevated ("regional folklore adjusted itself overnight"). The phrase "emerges transformed always" recurs as a refrain but reads as external narration rather than Mireya's perception, risking psychic distance slip. Perceptual signature is present (seed-sorter's attention to size, color, hum) but not deeply biased. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not testable here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("fragrant mulch that smelled of peat"). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "emerges transformed always" appears three times without clear payoff, "mossy" recurs decoratively ("mossy delight," "moss-covered," "moss still freckling"), and the opening's "orderly seed sorter" structure is echoed in "the orderly seed sorter became the first Keeper." The phrase "mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds" mixes plant metaphors without clear vehicle logic. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or distinct escalation. Paraphrase appears in adjacent beats: "Each monument stood for something the world had forgotten" and "invitations to remember" restate the same content. These artifacts dull momentum in peak passages, triggering −0.8 for patterned loops and mixed metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor, ascending leaves, and tiny-monument premise offer a distinctive synthesis. The moonstone-as-memory-lens and the folk-saying frame provide specific texture. However, the core arc—magical problem solved by ritual action that restores balance—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost. The mirror-arbor resolution and the universally-honored-unpaid-office ending trend toward fable convention. Risk-taking in lyric style is present but does not heighten stakes beyond the template. No close proximity to famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mireya arranges seeds, catches a leaf, opens the chest, prods the leaf, builds monuments, climbs, releases the moonstone, and resumes sorting. Her choices frame the sequence, but most turns (runes projecting, sky parting, leaves ceasing) occur through external magic rather than Mireya's agency altering tactics under pressure. Her decision to build monuments (setup) and release the moonstone (payoff) participate, but the middle beats are largely observational.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears in the first third (setup), is used to prod the leaf and reveal runes (middle beat), grows warmer with each monument (development), and is released at the climax to trigger the sky's acceptance (payoff). However, its unique properties—revealing secrets, storing memories—are told more than dramatized, and its release feels like a tool activated rather than a choice with visible cost. Swappable with another magical catalyst with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Regional folklore is introduced early via the grandmother's saying and frames Mireya's interpretation of the runes. The folk-saying is reprised at the end, reweighting community memory. However, the concept shapes Mireya's understanding more than her options; she does not face a friction between folklore and counter-evidence, and the ending simply affirms the folklore rather than testing or complicating it. Present across setup, middle (implicit in monument-building logic), and payoff, but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is mentioned three times: once as a repeated post-monument state ("felt herself emerge transformed always"), once in the penultimate paragraph ("the grove that emerges transformed always"), and once implied in Mireya's sharpened senses. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a concrete on-page trade-off or constraint. No visible cost or enabling action tied to this exact phrasing; it functions as a thematic label. Swappable with "is renewed" or "changes" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Prod" appears once: "She prodded the floating leaf with the dust speck, and the runes flared, projecting a map." This action triggers the revelation that drives Mireya's monument project (setup and middle linkage). However, the prodding itself is a single gesture; the major turns (monuments built, moonstone released, sky parts) trace to other actions. The verb could be replaced with "touched" or "showed" without major structural change. Present in a key beat but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments is introduced early as Mireya's crystallized motivation, enacted across multiple beats (acorn cup, ring of ash keys, feather collage), and directly shapes the climax when the monuments are lifted into the sky. The method's mechanics—labeling forgotten things, collective participation—matter and constrain the protagonist's approach. Removing this exact method would collapse the story's central arc. Strong setup, development, and payoff integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is introduced in the opening line, provides spatial anchors (highest bough, catwalks, lichened branch), and supplies the floating leaves and grove equilibrium that frame the stake. The "hush" timeframe and the arbor's silver-barked trees recur. However, the arbor functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a resource or constraint that alters Mireya's tactics; she climbs and places monuments, but the environment does not resist or complicate her choices. Present across setup, middle, and payoff, but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy—those breathless minutes between the last star's fade and the first bird's cry" is introduced early and signals a liminal window. The phrase recurs ("The hush deepened") and the "seventh dawn" marks the climax. However, the time constraint does not visibly tighten decisions; Mireya has leisure to build multiple monuments over implied days, and no urgency forces a trade-off. The timeframe charges atmosphere but does not narrow options on the page. Setup and payoff present, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To decode the message in falling leaves" is stated explicitly ("Determined to decode the message") and drives Mireya's use of the moonstone and her realization about monuments. The desire frames the middle beats (building monuments, reading rearranging runes) and is satisfied at closure when the grove's dialogue is understood. However, the motivation is not visibly conflicted; no cost or friction opposes her decoding project, and the ending rewards her effort without complication. Present in setup, middle, and payoff, but friction between want and cost is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" appears once ("her heart mossy delight unfurling like fern fronds") and "moss" recurs decoratively ("moss-covered button," "moss still freckling her fingertips"). The tone reads as gentle wonder throughout, coherent but static; no modulation under pressure or tonal shift that charges the final image. The phrase "mossy delight" itself is ornamental and could be replaced with "joy" or "contentment" without structural loss. Tone is consistent but does not constrain or reweight the ending.</comment>
