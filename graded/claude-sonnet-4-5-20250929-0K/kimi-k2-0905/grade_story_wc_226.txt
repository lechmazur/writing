<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and consistent—seeking to scatter blame through the canyon's refractive properties—but her interior contradictions lack simultaneous pressure; they alternate rather than collide in scene. The final choice (accepting the cost, tucking the feather, leaving) feels structurally earned but emotionally thin; we see the gesture more than the felt renunciation. Embodied emotion appears in flashes ("laughed, a sound bright enough to wound") but key beats lean on metaphor-heavy narration rather than contradiction acting in the body. The queen remains a shadow; no secondary character applies live pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira accepts the cost, the spire cracks, and she walks away doubled by echo, foreclosing the ritual path with visible consequence. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered imagery (ribbons of light, echoes multiplying, mist-shapes) and the cadence shift at "I accept the cost" reweights the stake. Causality is clean within this lens (mirror → light → echo → crack → feather → departure), though the mechanics of "accepting" remain slightly abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when listening replaces speaking, narrowing her tactic and opening the fissure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canyon, spire, and bone towers anchor early and pressure choices throughout: Lira climbs the spire, angles the mirror, hears echoes that force her shift from reciting to listening. The pale spire's crack charges the final image and the feather becomes a portable constraint (she'll paint with it). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("wind sounded like held breath," "silver backing flaked like old skin"), though some metaphors ("needle stitching sky to stone") tilt decorative. Spatial choreography is clear: base → ledge → down → rim.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—scattering blame to escape singular guilt—is signaled early and tightens once when Lira realizes "the price of forgiveness was not the speaking but the listening," forcing a tactic shift with visible cost (she stops reciting, absorbs all prior echoes, presses forehead to spire). That turn is protagonist-driven and narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The arrival of priests adds time pressure but remains off-page. One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost (walking away from the ritual, shadow doubled by echo, painting with her own blood) is legible and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness as bilateral cost, refracted truth vs. singular blame—emerges through particulars (the queen's plea, the mirror shard, the spire's crack, the doubled shadow) without thesis statements until the final paragraph's "the truth—refracted, shared, borne—would never again belong to only one throat," which teeters on summary but stays image-anchored. The feather and blood-painting promise reframe cracks as bridges, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the improvised poetry and the forged hush between sounds. Minor slip: "sharper than regret: the sound of a story learning to breathe" leans slightly precious.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "footstep back… as a whispered accusation," "mist began to swirl into shapes," "forged hush." Diction elevates appropriately for an artist-in-exile but remains character-bound. No dialogue on the page; Lira's improvised recitations ("Forgiveness is a coin with two faces…") feel performative and voice-appropriate. Minor register drift: "the method her mentor once mocked—impromptu poetry sessions—was the only tool left" reads slightly expository for peak pressure. Compression and elision are purposeful; the piece teaches its lyric pattern early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Two friction points lower the score: (1) Overwriting in high-pressure beats—"bone vibrating like a plucked wire," "the price of forgiveness was not the speaking but the listening," "seam of light opening like an eye"—stacks metaphor without breath; (2) Minor paraphrase loop: "The canyon caught the words, tossed them back and forth, multiplying" followed closely by "Each ribbon carried a syllable… canyon caught the words." No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is strong; clarity holds. Proximity to −0.6 for density without pattern-payoff, mitigated by overall momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—refracting truth through improvised poetry in a canyon of echoes, using a palace mirror shard to split light into the queen's plea—is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "cracks" from wounds to bridges and the doubled shadow (one dark, one echo) feel earned and memorable. The premise risks derivativeness (exile artist seeks mystical release) but the acoustic-optic mechanics and the bilateral forgiveness calculus elevate it. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric intensity heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band for bold commitment to the metaphor-physics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's identity as defiant artist frames her exile backstory and the choice to paint with the feather, but on-page her decisions (climb, angle mirror, speak, listen, accept, leave) drive all key turns. She appears in setup, enables the middle reversal (speaking → listening), and shapes the ending (tucking the feather, promising to paint again). Causal pressure is strong; cost is visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pale spire anchors setup (warm touch, "needle stitching sky to stone"), middle action (Lira climbs it, uses it to refract light, speaks over its vibration), and closure (cracks vertically, releases the feather, hums a new note). It is handled across three distinct beats and its transformation (whole → cracked, humming accusation → softer note) reweights meaning. Irreplaceable; the story's optics and acoustics depend on it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The price of forgiveness is stated explicitly in the backstory hook ("the queen had begged her for forgiveness… Lira had walked away") and tested on-page when Lira realizes "the price… was not the speaking but the listening." That insight alters her tactic (she stops reciting, absorbs echoes, accepts cost) and forecloses the ritual path. The concept shapes stakes and is paid in the doubled shadow and blood-painting vow, though the final paragraph's "truth—refracted, shared, borne" leans slightly thematic echo rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Innocently mischievous" is named once ("the tone she used as a child when stealing apricots") and colors her laugh ("bright enough to wound") but does not visibly constrain or enable a key choice with cost. The trait flavors voice but remains more label than lever. Mid-band for presence and tonal coherence, but no clear tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Refract" appears in the inciting hook ("to refract a single truth into many"), is enacted on-page when Lira angles the mirror to split sunlight into seven ribbons, and charges the ending when the truth is "refracted, shared, borne" and the spire's crack opens "like an eye." The action is irreplaceable—swapping it would break the optics metaphor and the accumulative image pattern. It drives two beats (mirror use, final reconfiguration) and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Impromptu poetry sessions" is named in setup as "the method her mentor once mocked" and executed on-page when Lira improvises two couplets ("Forgiveness is a coin…" and "I walked away because your fire…"). The method enables the middle beat (spire responds, mist swirls, echoes multiply) and is abandoned when she shifts to listening, which then unlocks the fissure. Signaled early, used in one extended beat, and its replacement (listening) drives closure. Reaches lower 6-band via lyric reprise and causal role, but brief single-beat use limits score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon of endless echoes anchor setup (hollow sockets hum, footsteps return as accusations), provide the acoustic mechanics for the middle beat (echoes multiply, feed back every word), and remain active at closure (towers quiet, canyon rim frames departure). The setting supplies the refractive resource and pressures Lira's tactic shift. Essential across three beats; removing it collapses the acoustic-optical metaphor system.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Before the ritual began—before the priests arrived… she had one hour" is stated in setup and the priests' bronze bells arrive at closure, bracketing the action. The clock is not tracked beat-by-beat but the frame tightens Lira's window and her departure preempts the ritual. The timeframe pressures her urgency and forecloses one path (participation), meeting two gates (setup, closure) with moderate causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To refract a single truth into many" is stated in setup, dramatized through the mirror-light-echo sequence, and tested when Lira realizes scattering blame is insufficient—she must also absorb cost. The motivation drives her climb, mirror use, recitations, and the final acceptance. Friction appears when want (scatter blame) collides with need (listen and accept), and the cost (doubled shadow, blood-painting vow) is visible. Desire is conflicted and shapes three beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Forged hush" appears explicitly ("The forged hush between sounds grew heavier than any sentence") and the tone—charged silence, held breath, wind like a pause—modulates through the piece: mist, whispered accusations, humming towers, the spire's soft final note. Coherent across turns and the tone charges the ending image (towers quieted, "sound of a story learning to breathe"). Reaches mid-6s for purposeful coherence and closure linkage, though "forged" as modifier remains slightly opaque.</comment>
