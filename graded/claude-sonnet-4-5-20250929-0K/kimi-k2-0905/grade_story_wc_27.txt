<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stargazer's motivation is clear and her physicality ("soles tasting the dust," "bare arches") anchors her throughout. However, her progression from observer to activist lacks sufficient internal contradiction; her "awkwardly confident" trait is labeled but not dramatized through conflicting impulses that complicate choices. The climactic decision to broadcast the lullaby feels unmotivated by prior character work—she moves from contemplation to grand action without visible struggle or cost that would foreclose other paths. The embodied details are strong, but the final choice arrives without the earned hesitation or trade-off needed for high-band scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening (who, where, when by line three). The piece follows a causal chain: whistle → stone hum → crane climb → shuttle ignition → broadcast, each beat motivated by the prior. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change (she launches and broadcasts the lullaby, reopening the sky), and the cost is visible (she leaves the planet, breaks curfews below). However, the stone circle's mechanics arrive conveniently without prior constraint, and the shuttle "long thought scrap" reviving on a lens-focused light beam stretches credibility. The causal lens holds, but convenience at the climax prevents entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The spaceport is vividly rendered with "cracked ferrocrete," "ruptured fuel line," "broken gantries," and swallows nesting in machinery. The setting provides the opera glasses, the crane, and the shuttle—all essential to the plot. The twin suns and "bruise-colored sky" establish atmosphere, and the hangar's acoustics ("resonator," "wind instrument") enable the climactic hum. Spatial choreography is clean (floor → crane jib → shuttle bridge). However, the stone circle beneath the foundation is introduced late without prior setup, weakening the micro-setting's constraint role. Strong sensory work and causal involvement, but the buried henge feels convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reigniting the rebellion and reopening the sky—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates as the stargazer moves from observation to action: whistle → hum → climb → ignition. However, escalation lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that forecloses options; each step succeeds without resistance or cost until the shuttle simply works. The "rebellion's lull" as background context never directly opposes her; no militia intervenes, no shuttle fails, no choice forces a trade-off. The final broadcast is an achievement, but without on-page friction or a visible price paid during the climb to closure, the conflict remains one-directional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through image and action: the lullaby as inheritance and hope, the stone circle as buried memory, the shuttle as promise. "Discover meaning in the mess" is dramatized through her physical acts rather than stated. The final image—"trailing song instead of fire"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the pause was surrender or gathered breath. The stone hum's frequency as destination is ingenious, and the duet between old and new (lullaby and spaceport) avoids didacticism. Minor deduction: "awkwardly confident" and the rebellion-as-exhale metaphor flirt with thesis language, and the closing "thousand [cut off]" gesture risks moralizing the ripple effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and purposeful: "soles tasting the dust," "dumb metal flowers," "peppercorns flung into blue soup." POV remains stable in close third with a consistent perceptual signature (sound, vibration, visual metaphor). Diction is controlled and poetic without slipping into generic lyricism. However, peak-pressure moments suffer from filter stacks: "she felt it as vibration," "she thought of the mess," "she understood the rebellion's lull." These dull immediacy during the crane climb and climax. The final paragraph's syntax—"She whispered… then punched"—maintains rhythm under pressure. Strong voice with minor distance-control slips in high-stakes beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("cathedral of thunderous serenity," "passports" for galaxies). Information density is high, and few lines are purely decorative. However, overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence in the climax carries metaphor or elevation ("tuning fork," "resonator," "wind instrument," "plasma flowers"), creating a textural pile-up that obscures the physical action. Mixed metaphors appear: swallows as "peppercorns flung into blue soup" jars against the cosmic scale. Template cadence in the middle third: "She raised… She traced… She thought… She kneeling…" Paraphrase loop: "Remember, Reclaim, Reignite" is immediately followed by "So she did what any barefoot stargazer would do," restating intent. Artifacts in the closure third trigger the disallow-9+ rule and cap high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of spaceport, ancient stones, and lullaby is specific and non-obvious; the harmonic-frequency-as-destination conceit is inventive. The barefoot protagonist and opera glasses as talisman add fresh texture. However, the core arc—lone figure reignites dormant vessel to inspire rebellion—follows a familiar template (the solitary catalyst). The stone circle's convenient power and the shuttle's resurrection via focused light lean on wish-fulfillment rather than earned transformation. The "song too beautiful to jam" resolution skirts consequence. Freshness in detail and setting, but the plot's bones are recognizable and the climax avoids the hard moral calculus that would deepen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present early, handles the opera glasses and climbs the crane, makes the broadcast decision. However, observation dominates; the key choice (inputting the frequency) happens quickly without visible alternatives or cost dramatized on the page. Two gates (setup, closure); middle development is passive perception rather than constrained decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Found early, used to trace the roof (~beat 1), then worn "around her neck like a talisman" and employed to focus sunlight onto the ignition sigil (~beat 2). Two-beat involvement with causal pressure at closure. However, the lens-focusing mechanic is introduced only at the climax without prior setup, and the object could be replaced by any focusing tool. Solid integration but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph five ("A lull in rebellion had lasted forty-three days") and shapes the protagonist's motivation throughout. The lull creates the dormant spaceport context and the stakes (reopening the sky). It reappears at closure when she "felt the planet fall away" and "curfews cracked" below, directly altering the situation. Causal across beats and present in the ending image; strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Labeled once in paragraph six ("awkwardly confident in the way of someone who has forgotten how to doubt herself when no one is watching") and echoed obliquely at the end ("confidence no longer awkward but welded to bone"). The trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Setup and closure reprise, but no middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The action is seeded early ("discover meaning… or manufacture enough to keep the sky open"), pursued through the crane climb and shuttle ignition, and realized at closure with the broadcast. The sparks, plasma flowers, and shuttle pressurization are all "reignite" beats. The harmonic broadcast continues the reignition into orbit. Present across setup, middle, and closure with specific causal steps; the story's spine depends on this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hum is introduced early (paragraph eight: "vibration… rising through her bare arches"), becomes words ("Remember, Reclaim, Reignite"), and directly motivates the climb and broadcast. At closure, "the ancient stones' hum faded into cosmic background, yet persisted." Three-beat involvement; the harmonic frequency as shuttle destination is mechanically specific. Strong integration, though the stone circle itself arrives without prior spatial setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Present from the opening line, provides the opera glasses (fuel line), the crane (for the climb), the shuttle (for escape), and the acoustic properties (hangar as resonator). The bay's roof hatch and eastern launch pad are used at closure. The setting supplies resources that shape every major action and constrains movement (decommissioned crane, rusted ignition sigil). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Anchored in paragraph two ("margin of daylight, when the planet's twin suns balanced on the horizon") and used to create the "cathedral" effect. The timeframe returns at closure ("Their wings caught the twin suns' last light"). However, the passage of time is not tracked during the action sequence, and the daylight margin does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Setup and closure reprise with atmospheric charge but no causal pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stated explicitly in paragraph ten ("discover meaning in the mess, or at least manufacture enough to keep the sky open") and dramatized through the climb, ignition, and broadcast. The desire drives all major actions. However, it is articulated rather than shown through conflicting wants or on-page friction; she pursues it without hesitation or visible cost that might pull her in another direction. Strong causal linkage but minimal internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph two ("cathedral of thunderous serenity—silent, yet echoing") and sustained throughout: the hum crescendos, engines cough, yet the broadcast is "song instead of fire." The tone modulates from quiet observation to vibrant action while maintaining the paradox. It charges the final image ("engines thundered into serenity") and coheres across beats. The oxymoron is purposeful and pressure-aware, reaching into the closure without flattening.</comment>
