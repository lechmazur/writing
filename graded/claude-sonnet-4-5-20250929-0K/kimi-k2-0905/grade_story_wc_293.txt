<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fiddler's motivation ("sculpt possibility from ashes of never") is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("luminous disbelief made audible") without embodied sensation. The father's death and the hitchhiker's vanishing are recounted rather than forcing micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values. No visible internal conflict acts simultaneously; the piece narrates emotional states instead of dramatizing contradictory wants colliding under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric ambitions, but closure lacks legible cost—she "steps backward—or forward" onto a bridge "rendered in silver halide and hope," and the final image offers only the violin remaining with a "wink." No decision forecloses a path; the ending dissolves into metaphor without a felt price. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (pullout anchored, but "after the hitchhiker vanishes" timeframe remains vague and the inciting incident is entirely offstage). The piece teaches a pattern of poetic compression but does not pay it off with a resonant reconfiguration that makes before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain pullout, guardrail, and gorge anchor spatially and the glass flake functions as a micro-object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid ("dusk bled across the valley like a slow photograph developing") and filtered through the fiddler's perceptual lens. However, the pullout does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a lyric stage rather than a pressure point that shapes the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("sculpt possibility from ashes of never") is signaled but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. The fiddler plays, the glass flake warms, a doorway appears—pressure is asserted through metaphor rather than escalated through protagonist agency or a tightening that forecloses an option. The hitchhiker's hand extended is a reversal in image only; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path before it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (amnesty from "never," possibility sculpted from loss) emerges from the collodion flake and scaffold-wrap language but is stated overtly ("her mandate: sculpt possibility") rather than earned through concrete particulars. The father's fall and the tarp language offer a recurring motif, but the final image ("promise that never is just another pixel waiting to be moved") edges toward platitude. The piece invites reflection yet the ending moralizes gently rather than reweighting prior material through a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and diction is purposefully elevated ("fermata held until breath itself became suspect"), but the register drifts into abstract lyricism ("wireframe waiting for skin," "rasterized yet kind") that flattens the fiddler's perceptual signature under peak pressure. Psychic distance widens when metaphor replaces embodied perception. No dialogue is present to judge. The prose reads as authorial performance rather than character-particular thought during the climactic beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching that pays off at closure: "bled across the valley," "ghost limb of possibility," "fermata held until breath became suspect," "wireframe waiting for skin." Mixed metaphors cluster (pixels, emulsion, scaffold wrap, bones-to-clay, fence charged with storm) and compete rather than cohere. Template cadence appears in stacked "she [verb]" stems across the middle third. Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs (image + mood) but momentum stalls when metaphor piles without advancing causality. Paraphrase loops appear ("stepped backward—or forward" restates ambiguity without added pressure).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The collodion-flake-as-amnesty conceit and scaffold-wrap language offer fresh synthesis, and the fiddler's occupation integrates with her method of decoding wind. However, the core arc (loss → possibility via art and memory) follows a familiar template, and the ending ("roads that exist only because she played them into being") gestures toward magical realism without grounding the transformation in specific causal rules. The emotional truth of grief and the father's fall feel authentic, but the final image retreats into abstraction rather than committing fully to the premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The bridge-song fiddler is present throughout and her playing frames the arc, but her choices are reactive (she "understood," "hesitated," "recalled," "placed") rather than creating key turns. The decision to take the hitchhiker's hand is prepared by recollection, not by a dilemma that forces her to weigh competing costs. She observes and performs rather than deciding under pressure that narrows options. Present in setup, middle action, and closure, but causal agency is low—mid functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wet-plate collodion glass flake is handled in the opening (wedged in the case, lifted to sky), middle (vibrates, squares shift), and ending (crushed into dust). It reweights meaning—seed becomes permission, pixels drift apart—and charges the final image. However, its mechanics remain metaphorical; the flake does not constrain a choice or impose a trade-off, it simply "granted amnesty" and "grew warm." Setup, development, payoff gates met; causal pressure moderate; swappable with another talisman without breaking plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Pixelated amnesty" appears as a label ("each micro-fracture refracted a different future, a pixelated amnesty") and as thematic echo ("each note a pixel granted amnesty from silence") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The fiddler does not choose between pixels or pay a cost to rearrange them; the concept decorates the prose without altering options. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Dynamically observant" is mentioned once ("dynamically observant to the breeze's pitch") as a label without constraining or enabling action with visible cost. The fiddler listens and plays, but the attribute does not force a trade-off or differentiate her approach from a generic musician. Label-only, no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Recount" is signaled early ("Tonight she would recount how never became maybe") and frames the playing as an act of retelling. The violin performance structures the middle, and the ending mentions "the recounting itself." However, the act of recounting is not causally distinct from playing; the two are conflated without unique mechanics. Present in setup and closure; one beat of clear involvement; swappable with "perform" or "remember" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Scaffold wrap flutters are introduced early ("secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters, the coded language of construction tarps") and return in the middle ("snap for danger, ripple for safe passage") and ending ("scaffold-wrap Morse against her ankles: go, go, go"). The method is signaled and mentioned across beats, but its mechanics remain vague—how does wind-language "spell the route" the hitchhiker took? The tarp code is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice it enables or constrains. Setup and closure gates met; middle development weak; functional but largely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mountain scenic pullout anchors spatially and returns in the ending ("When dawn finally touched the pullout, only the violin remained"). It supplies the guardrail that casts the shadow-doorway, but the pullout does not constrain tactics or alter the fiddler's choices—it serves as a stage rather than a pressure point. Setup, minor middle use (guardrail shadow), payoff (dawn returns); one causal involvement (shadow as passage); micro-setting role borderline functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the hitchhiker vanishes" frames the opening but does not tighten decisions. The timeframe is vague (dusk → night → dawn) and no clock pressures tactics. The "after" signals loss but does not track elapsed time or impose urgency. Present in setup; no middle or closure pressure from time itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" is declared overtly ("her mandate") and repeated at the hesitation beat ("she recalled her mandate"). It names the desire but friction between want and cost is told rather than dramatized—she hesitates once, then acts. The motivation is present in setup and closure and frames one choice, but the conflict between wanting to move forward and fearing her father's fate is summarized rather than enacted through competing impulses in scene. Functional, one-beat causal role, replaceable phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" is named once ("luminous disbelief made audible") and the tone of wonder mixed with uncertainty persists through "eyes rasterized yet kind" and "silver halide and hope." Tone is coherent but static—no modulation under pressure. The ending maintains the same register of poetic possibility without sharpening or darkening as stakes rise. Present and consistent; does not charge the final image with a tonal shift or intensification.</comment>
