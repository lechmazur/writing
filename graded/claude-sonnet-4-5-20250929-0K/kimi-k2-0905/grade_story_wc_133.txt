<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's insomnia and artistic struggle are established, but her interior life remains surface-level—she catalogs defeat, handles the brooch, paints, then sleeps, without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The exchange with the old woman generates recognition rather than a choice that forecloses a path; the final sleep feels granted rather than earned through on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse: "haggard awe" and "wryly earnest" are claimed more than enacted through micro-choices under pressure. The transformation from insomnia as burden to gift is asserted in summary rather than dramatized with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors late (~"The island's monastery" at line 5) but the disorientation does not serve closure, triggering a modest penalty. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara follows rain trails, exchanges fragments, paints, receives water, and returns transformed—a density increase that reweights her insomnia without a causal because/therefore chain. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (insomnia reframed as vigilance, enabling sleep), but the cost is conceptual and muted; the vial of pure water and the completed painting are received gifts rather than sacrifices. The middle exchange with the old woman functions as recognition and thematic echo more than a tightening that narrows options, limiting escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal island, causeway, monastery, and rain trails are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (basalt stones, bell tower at drunken angle, frescoes bubbling underwater). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the monastery interior sequence (chamber of tide measurements, painting location) lacks tight anchoring. The amber brooch, shells, pottery shard, and glass vial function as micro-setting that charges the closure image—the vial of untouched water and the brooch's warmth shape Mara's final stance. Sensory selection is strong (wet stones, pigments mixed with rainwater, golden sunset light) and filtered through Mara's exhausted perception, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—threshing meaning from ruin—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete consequence (lost commission, failed relationship, physical peril) tests it. The exchange with the old woman offers mutual recognition rather than a choice with trade-offs; Mara paints, receives water, and walks home without forgoing a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening occurs (insomnia reframed), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally felt—she simply sleeps for the first time in months with no on-page price paid. The painting and vial are gifts freely given; no resource or relationship is spent to earn them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (art as witness to convergence, insomnia as vigilance) emerges through monastery imagery, the brooch's prehistoric insects, and the rain trails linking past and present. The final sleep and dream of spirals offer a resonant non-literal answer without stating a moral. However, the closing lines veer into thematic summary ("patterns that had existed long before her species learned to fear the water") rather than trusting image alone. The old woman's dialogue ("the meaning we've threshed from what we've lost and what we've found") borders on restating the thesis. Subtext is present in the shell spirals and bleeding frescoes, but some beats over-articulate rather than imply.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyric-literary voice (ribboned rain trails, "drunken angle," "haggard awe"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the old woman's lines carry recognition and instruction without strong subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mara notices art materials, water, ruins—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels writerly rather than character-bound ("unearthed convergence," "thresh meaning," "primordial seas now poisoned by human greed"). Free indirect style is clean, though some lines read as narrator commentary rather than Mara's interior voice. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is competent with strong images (monastery as "broken tooth," woman's fingers "gnarled like driftwood") and varied syntax. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: seven consecutive paragraphs open with "Mara [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating a predictable rhythm (−0.5). Paraphrase loops surface: "thresh meaning from experience" recurs three times without variation, and the "unearthed convergence" phrase is repeated verbatim. Stock metaphors (defeated army, breathing thing) lack transformation. The closing lines summarize theme rather than landing on a charged concrete image, reducing propulsion. Information density is adequate but the final two paragraphs rehearse established ideas rather than advancing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The water-wars setting and memory-exchange premise offer a post-apocalyptic frame, but the core arc—artist seeks meaning, meets elder, paints, receives symbolic gift, finds peace—follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The tidal island and amber brooch add texture but do not alter the emotional or structural arc; swapping them for a desert ruin and a carved stone would leave the plot intact. The insomnia-as-vigilance turn is conceptually interesting but arrives through assertion rather than a non-obvious synthesis earned in action. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the story executes its premise at midline competence without ingenuity that makes the combination feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her insomnia frames the arc. She makes one mid-level decision (to paint the monastery), but it does not narrow options or create a turn with cost; the old woman invites her to paint, she complies, and is rewarded. Her observation dominates action; she walks, kneels, studies, paints, and receives. The final sleep is a granted transformation rather than one driven by her choice. Present in setup, weak development, present at closure (but passive), and swappable with "grieving sculptor" or "exiled poet" without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The amber brooch appears in three beats: Mara clutches it (line 3), it grows warm near the shells (line 8), and the old woman touches it and explains its memory (line 18). Its warmth signals the shell spiral discovery, linking past and present, and it "pulses" on the causeway return, charging the closure image. However, it does not constrain a choice—Mara does not trade it, use it to unlock knowledge, or sacrifice it. It functions as a thematic token (prehistoric insects, mountain-to-island memory) rather than a plot driver. Present in setup and closure, modest causal role, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unearthed convergence" is named twice (line 7, line 24) as a thematic claim but never operationalized as a stake or tactic. The story depicts overlap of past and present (monastery underwater, brooch's prehistoric insects, frescoes bleeding) as setting detail, not as a force that narrows Mara's options. The concept echoes in theme but does not shape on-page pressure. Ornamental use; replaceable with "layered history" or "temporal overlap" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Wryly earnest" is applied twice as a tonal label (line 4 to Mara, line 21 to the old woman) but never enacted through a choice, dialogue beat, or gesture that reveals cost. It describes voice rather than constraining action. No on-page moment shows Mara or the old woman choosing earnestness over irony (or vice versa) with visible consequence. Label-only trait; no development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Exchange drives the middle sequence: Mara seeks the memory market (line 6), the old woman offers the pottery shard (line 12), Mara paints and receives the vial (lines 19–20). The action is signaled early, shapes two beats (shard → painting, painting → vial), and participates in closure (the vial "that had never been touched by the wars" reweights survival and purity). However, the exchanges are frictionless gifts rather than trades with cost; no memory or resource is spent. Present in setup and development, modest closure charge, but swappable with "barter" or "gift" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Following rain trails" appears in three moments: Mara watches rain ribbon the causeway (line 2), walks rain trails methodically (line 7), and is guided home by rain trails (line 24). The method is signaled but its mechanics never matter—Mara does not choose between trails, the trails do not lead her astray or require navigation skill, and the ending guidance is passive (trails guide her, not vice versa). The rain functions as ambient setting rather than a tactic that shapes attempts. Present but ornamental; no middle development that tests the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tidal island is introduced early (line 1), pressures the arc (causeway access depends on tide, monastery half-drowned, chamber of meaningless tide records), and charges the closure (tide returns as Mara walks back, island exists "in multiple times simultaneously"). The setting supplies the memory-exchange frame, the shell spirals, the frescoes, and the untouched spring water. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (causeway, monastery shadow, chamber, causeway return). The island's dual earth-sea nature is indispensable to theme and image. Strong setup, essential development, closure participation with conceptual cost (Mara's understanding of time and survival shifts because of the island's nature).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the water wars" frames the setting (causeway aftermath, monastery drowned, uniforms patched, seas stolen, oceans' forgotten rhythms) and explains the scarcity that drives the memory-exchange market. However, the timeframe does not impose urgency or tighten a decision—no clock, no approaching threat, no resource countdown. The wars are backstory texture rather than a live constraint. Present in setup as exposition, absent in middle development, and asserted thematically at closure ("the water wars had not ended anything") without altering Mara's final choice. Functional but replaceable with "after the floods" or "the drought years."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to thresh meaning from experience" is named early (line 4 "another failure to thresh meaning") and restated at the exchange (line 21 "the meaning we've threshed"). The motivation explains her pilgrimage and her painting, but it is never dramatized as conflicted choice—she does not weigh meaning-seeking against survival, comfort, or relationship. The insomnia and art are means, not costs. The final sleep suggests the motivation is satisfied, but the shift is granted rather than earned through on-page friction between want and price. Present in setup, weak development (painting scene enacts the want but without obstacle), thematic closure presence without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Haggard awe" is named once (line 9, applied to both Mara and the old woman) and enacted through Mara's raw eyes, exhaustion, and wonder at the shell spirals and monastery transformation. Tone is coherent across beats: reverent attention to ruin, lyric description of water and time, quiet exchange without melodrama. The tone modulates from weary observation (opening) to feverish creation (painting) to peaceful closure (sleep and dreams). The final image of spirals and prehistoric patterns sustains the tone's blend of fatigue and wonder. Strong setup, consistent development, and tone charges the closure image with contemplative resonance rather than declarative summary.</comment>
