<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Hoshiko remains more vessel than agent throughout; her "watchful" trait is asserted repeatedly but never dramatizes a choice-under-pressure moment where observation costs her something or forces a trade-off. The donor heart's memories do all the work, delivering epiphanies without her earning them through struggle. Interior voice relies on stock metaphors ("quietly explosive sparks," "narrative gravity") and therapy-speak abstractions rather than embodied contradiction, and the final "understanding" arrives as summary rather than a renunciation or endurance with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: memories and images pile up toward a thematic revelation. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the final understanding that some become "invisible within" stories rather than collectors—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page forfeiture, no visible before/after in her tactics or world state. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchor by ~100 words), but the ending reconfigures meaning without demonstrating what Hoshiko has paid or lost, reducing closure to a delivered insight rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house, silk tethers, valley-mist, and the morpho wing supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Hoshiko's dye-master idiom (indigo holding sky and ocean, cochineal beetles). The teahouse setting constrains her location and provides the window/sun-trail mechanics, charging one beat when she aligns the wing with morning sun to project ghost-images. However, the environment does not narrow a later choice or alter the closure image; it remains atmospheric rather than a micro-setting that shapes the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and maintained, but escalation is summary-driven rather than choice-driven. Hoshiko receives memories, paints the wing, and arrives at understanding without a meaningful on-page tightening that forecloses an option or forces a trade-off. The piece layers texture (tea vapor forming dragons, scales becoming pigment) but never dramatizes a moment where she must renounce collection, risk discovery, or pay a visible price to pursue her question.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme—stories choose porous vessels who become channels rather than containers—emerges from recurring images (morpho wing, dye, light through stained glass) and culminates in the final insight about disappearing into narrative. However, the resolution is stated rather than dramatized: "she understood her new purpose" reads as authorial summary, not an earned, non-literal answer. The collector's journey and the woman he sought layer in subtext, but the ending articulates the moral explicitly rather than leaving resonance to image and implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows dye-master specificity (pigments, scales, iridescent patterns), and the valley-mist phrasing recurs purposefully. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction at peak beats—"narrative magnetism," "story-saturated," "quietly explosive gift"—that reads more like prompt echo than Hoshiko's lived idiom under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "realized") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy when the closure moment most demands embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "quietly explosive" appears three times, "valley-mist wonder" twice in identical constructions, and the final two paragraphs restate the same thematic insight across multiple sentences without added pressure. Template cadence runs of "She [verb], [gerund]" and "The donor heart [verb]" flatten rhythm. Stock metaphors—"moths around flame," "iron filings aligning to invisible force"—appear without transformation. Register drift into academic abstraction ("narrative magnetism," "cognitive channels") clashes with the dye-master POV in the closure beats. Artifacts touch the final third; applying −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of donor-heart memories, dye mastery, floating teahouse, and story magnetism is imaginative, and the morpho wing transforming into a map offers a specific image. However, the emotional arc—passive receipt of insight leading to a teaching mission—follows a familiar template of mystical revelation without meaningful transformation through struggle. The piece synthesizes elements inventively but the closure restates the prompt's conceptual language rather than earning a non-obvious reconfiguration, and Hoshiko's journey reads as illustration of theme rather than a risky character choice that transforms familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Hoshiko is present throughout and her dye-master perspective filters description, but her watchfulness remains observational rather than decisional. She pours tea, paints the wing, and "understands"—none of these actions create a turn that narrows options or alters tactics under pressure. The closure realization is delivered to her via the donor heart's memories rather than earned through a choice she makes, keeping her role passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The morpho wing appears in the opening, is pressed against the window to project ghost-images (middle beat), and dissolves under her brush to create the final map. Three distinct beats, all causally linked to her investigation. The wing's iridescent scales supply the "tracking sun trails" method and its dissolution charges the closure image by transforming into a guide. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff, though the wing's mechanics (how scales hold maps the collector never visited) remain unexplained, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" appears as descriptor for the wing and is mentioned when Hoshiko aligns it with sun, but the concept never constrains a choice or creates tactical friction. The story explores "narrative magnetism" and "story-ways" more centrally; "iridescent caution" reads as atmospheric labeling rather than a stake or pressure that alters her path. Present by middle, absent from closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is applied three times as a label—to memories, to the gift, to sparks—but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables action with visible cost. The phrase describes interior sensation without showing Hoshiko managing a volatile impulse, suppressing an outburst, or paying a price for restraint. Ornamental repetition without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears as the collector's quest (woman who could illuminate truth), Hoshiko's painting releasing memories, and the final purpose to "illuminate the story-ways." The action threads through all three sections and the ending hinges on it. However, the mechanics remain metaphorical; what does "illuminate" do that "reveal" or "teach" could not? Mid-strong integration with modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails is signaled when Hoshiko presses the wing to the window and notes "how the light revealed hidden patterns in the scales—maps of places the collector had never visited." The method enables the ghost-image projection beat and ties to the final map creation. Present in setup and development, contributes to closure, but the mechanics (why sun trails, not lamplight or magnification?) are not defended, lowering specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house anchors all action, supplies the window for sun-trail tracking, and drifts on thermals to mark time progression. The tethered, airborne location isolates Hoshiko and provides the valley view essential to the investigation. However, the setting does not constrain a choice under pressure or alter the closure; it remains atmospheric staging rather than a micro-setting that narrows her options or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After receiving the donor heart three moons ago" anchors backstory and the memories are described as stirring since transplant, but the timeframe does not tighten present decisions. No urgency, no ticking clock, no cost tied to elapsed time. The "three moons" detail is setup-only and does not shape middle or closure beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation—learning why some people magnetize stories—is stated early, drives Hoshiko to the teahouse, and the closure delivers the answer (porosity, becoming channels). Present across all three gates. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; she pursues it without friction, cost, or competing want, reducing dramatization to a research quest fulfilled by passive receipt of insight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Valley-mist wonder" recurs as a phrase and the tone—lyric, sensory, contemplative—holds consistently through the accumulative design. The vapor forming temporary shapes, the scales dissolving into pigment, and the final image of dye disappearing into silk all sustain the wondering, mist-like texture. The tone modulates with density (thickening around her as memories accumulate) and charges the final image of invisible transformation, though the final-paragraph summary slightly deflates the lyric effect.</comment>
