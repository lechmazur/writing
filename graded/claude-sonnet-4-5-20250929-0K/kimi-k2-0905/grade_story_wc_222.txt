<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vespers operates with consistent agency and her choice to pass the sundial lid to the child closes a legible arc of apprenticeship, though the lyric register keeps interiority at arm's length—we observe stylized gestures rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Halcyon's fear of heights arrives as a carved secret rather than dramatized resistance, weakening his presence as a pressure point. The protagonist's motive ("steal only what people no longer dare to keep") is declared rather than tested through on-page friction, and the final handoff feels ceremonial rather than costing Vespers a visible path or capability. Embodied emotion is sparse; poetic imagery substitutes for moment-to-moment internal struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece sustains an Accumulative/Textural lens: images layer (frozen bells, chess secrets, shadow stairs) and the final handoff reconfigures the apprenticeship motif with a felt passing of the mantle. Closure cost is present but oblique—Vespers walks away unburdened, which reads as liberation rather than forfeiture, muting the sacrifice. The chess match functions as a Charged Poise beat where stakes crystallize, yet the swap of the carved bishop (the teaching "how to fall upward") enables the resolution through a rule introduced in that moment, creating a minor convenience slip. Orientation is taught early (spire, sky wrong, chivalrous thief) and the shard structure (climb, match, descent, handoff) holds a single contiguous arc, so no Orientation Test penalty applies.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire, bruised sky, and glacier chessboard supply vivid, purpose-driven anchors that pressure the climb and match. The pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting, constraining Vespers's proof of the "wrong hour" and opening the shadow stair—a clear choice-shaping tool. Sensory details (frozen song bells, thawing-lake eyes, auroras like hooked fish) are specific and voice-filtered, avoiding catalog. Spatial choreography remains legible across vertical planes (halfway up, summit, descent). No cap from Q2 orientation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—passing wonder/apprenticeship—signals early and tightens when Vespers swaps the bishop, yet that swap introduces the solution (fall upward) rather than narrowing options through prior constraint. Halcyon's acceptance of the shadow stair escalates pressure, but his choice feels prompted by Vespers's invitation more than by his own foreclosed alternatives. The descent and handoff deepen the theme but do not add a second reversal or price that alters Vespers's tactics. One meaningful pressure point is present (the match climax), meeting the length minimum, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (wonder vs. rule, the price of apprenticeship, embracing the unknown) emerges organically from the chess match, shadow stair, and final handoff without overt statement. The sundial lid and chess pieces recur with shifting valence—secrets traded, teaching passed—charging the closure image of the child opening the lid. "Sky's still wrong" / "that means there's room to amend it" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The piece invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity (what Vespers loses by descending, what the spire's collapse costs) and resists tidy binaries, though the thematic echo in the child's final line hovers near prompt-language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable, lyric, and compressed throughout, with purposeful heightened diction ("sacredly playful," "cautious abandon") that the text teaches early and sustains. POV remains single (Vespers) with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature—poetic, elliptical, attuned to wonder—remains character-consistent. Dialogue (the child's two lines, Vespers's reply) carries subtext and advances the handoff without breaking voice. Elision is pattern-taught (the chess match skips many moves, the spire's collapse is compressed), and the closure image reweights the sundial lid without requiring causal blow-by-blow. No filter-verb stacks or mid-pressure register drift; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and voice-motivated ("sky bleeding like bruised glass," "auroras writhing like hooked fish"), with no mixed metaphors that violate logic. Information density is high; nearly every line advances image, character, or pressure. Sentence openings vary, rhythm modulates with urgency, and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. One minor friction: "the unknown yawned widest" in the chess-match beat borders on stock metaphor, and "melting runes that spelled forgiveness" leans abstract at a closure-adjacent moment, but neither obscures causality. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn; propulsion is steady and paragraphs serve purpose.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—chivalrous thief, chess with carved secrets, shadow stairs that obey teaching, apprenticeship passed like a hot coin—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The "fall upward" concept and sky-as-playground frame offer a fresh angle on mentor-succession arcs. Risk is present in the lyric register and elliptical structure, both of which heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Emotional truth and human complexity emerge through Vespers's ceremonial restraint and the child's bright fever. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows its implications (spire collapses, secrets melt) without retreat, though the "apprentice of wonder" framing and "cautious abandon" phrasing echo prompt language and slightly undercut originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vespers climbs, sings to amuse the wind, swaps the bishop (enabling the teaching), invites Halcyon onto the shadow stair, and passes the sundial lid—five distinct on-page choices. The bishop swap and handoff create key turns; removing Vespers breaks the story logic. Present early, active across beats, and indispensable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sundial lid is flourished to prove the wrong hour (match beat), casts the shadow stair (climax), is snapped shut to seal the borrowed hour (descent), and pressed into the child's hand (closure). Four functional beats, each distinct. Early signal, causal pressure (enables the stair), closure linkage (handoff), and irreplaceable specificity (gnomon, wrong quadrant). One minor friction: the lid's mechanics (how it creates stairs) remain elided, slightly reducing causal transparency.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" frames Vespers's backstory, motivates her climb and handoff, and recurs in the final beat when the child begins "the cautious abandon of wonder." It shapes the dominant stake (passing apprenticeship) but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost. Present in setup and closure, functional in one key beat (handoff), yet the phrase itself reads as thematic label rather than on-page tactic. Lyric reprise reweights the stake, lifting the score above pure ornamentation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" appears twice: Vespers's stance at the parapet ("arms wide… sacredly playful, a dare wrapped in a prayer") enables Halcyon's trust and step onto the shadow stair—a visible causal link. The trait is shown through embodied action (flourish, posture) rather than label-only, and it charges the climax. Setup is implicit (her backwards lullaby, bow), closure linkage is present (final stance invites Halcyon's leap), but middle development is thin. Two gates met, one causal beat, lifting it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Amend" is the explicit stake in the chess match ("one amendment to any truth"), recurs in Vespers's invitation to Halcyon ("amend his life"), and echoes in the final exchange ("room to amend it"). It drives the match outcome and Halcyon's choice to step onto the stair, creating two key turns. Early signal, closure participation, and thematic resonance. Slightly swappable with "change" or "transform" at phrase level, but the consistency and charged reprise reduce that friction. Three gates met, strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The chess pieces are introduced early (hand-carved, secrets inside), used across the match (queen falls with a memory, knight holds Halcyon's fear), and the bishop swap is the pivot that places the "fall upward" teaching on the board, enabling resolution. The mechanic (carved hollow, secret inside) is shown three times with escalating import, and the final scatter releases all secrets as "melting runes." Four distinct beats, causal pressure (swap changes board's gravity), closure linkage (scatter), irreplaceable specificity. The swap itself is the linchpin; removing it breaks the story.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire pressures every beat: the climb tests stamina, the wind forces the frozen-song tactic, the summit hosts the match, and the spire's collapse (once Halcyon leaves) ends the scene. "Above the clouds" isolates the characters and makes the shadow stair's impossibility legible. Early anchor, constrains choices (climb method, descent speed), and the spire's dissolution charges the closure image. Micro-setting (the parapet, glacier board) also alters tactics. Three gates, high causal pressure, indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" opens the story, signals urgency, and recurs in the final exchange ("Sky's still wrong" / "room to amend it"), reweighting it as invitation rather than omen. The timeframe does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat (no live clock), but the wrongness motivates the climb and brackets the arc. Lyric reprise at closure lifts it above ornament. Two gates (setup, closure), thematic rather than tactical pressure, mid-band fit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Embrace the unknown with open arms" is dramatized in Vespers's climb without rope, her backwards lullaby gambit, the bishop swap (trusting an untested teaching), and the handoff to an unknown child. The phrase "open arms that had once caught her" appears explicitly at closure, and the story enacts the motive across four choices with visible risk. Early implicit signal, constrained middle choices (no safety gear, trusting the shadow stair), closure linkage. One friction: the motive is told more than conflicted—Vespers never hesitates or pays a visible cost for her openness on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" is embodied throughout: Vespers uses no rope yet carries the sundial (caution + abandon), sings to the wind (playful risk), bows with flourish yet proves the hour methodically, and her final stance is "a dare wrapped in a prayer." The phrase appears once explicitly but the tone modulates across beats—cautious in the climb, abandoned in the match gambit, both at the handoff. Early coherence, pressure-responsive modulation, and the final image (child opening the lid) charges it. Three gates, high tonal integrity, indispensable to voice.</comment>
