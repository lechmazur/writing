<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to capture her brother's betrayal is clear and drives her through the forge encounter, but interiority leans heavily on abstract sensory translation ("colors faintly," "russet that dripped") rather than embodied contradiction. The final insight about complicity arrives late and feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The brother remains an absence rather than a dramatized relationship, limiting relational crucible work. Obsidian-shard collection reads as symbolic closure without visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through sensory layering, forge encounter, and final garden reweighting. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the obsidian shard and brother's laugh returning reweight absence into forgiveness, teaching trees to "hold both wound and blossom." Cost is legible—she admits her own doubt—but the price feels conceptual rather than immediately felt. Orientation anchors within ~120 words (drowned valley, greenhouse, Mara). One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses ear to forge and hears her complicity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sunken orchard in shipwreck hulls, forge built from ships' ribs, and roots through portholes create vivid, specific setting that constrains Mara's choices (she must approach the forge, feed it absence). Sensory detail—salt-caked slate, lavender coals, aurora bleeding—is filtered through her device, anchoring POV perception. The forge functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Environment evolves causally: coals breathe, petals chime like bells after her admission. Setting detail is purposeful and tied to stakes without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capturing trust's fracture-sound—is signaled early and tightens when the keeper demands "what you miss most." Mara's decision to feed her brother's absence to the forge is the lone reversal, raising cost by revealing her complicity. Agency is renunciation (admitting doubt) with conceptual cost, but physical consequence is muted: she pockets the shard and walks away without immediate trade-off. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening once through forge encounter. Cost is legible in the final image but not viscerally felt as a forfeited path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—trust fractures at subsonic frequencies; healing requires admitting the hollow space—emerges from forge encounter and final image without direct statement. Obsidian shard and brother's laugh reprise with shifted meaning, charging the trees' blossom-and-wound paradox. Final line offers resonant answer: "teaching the trees how to hold both wound and blossom in the same breath" reweights prior absence-collection without moralizing. Subtext operates in keeper's tongs-of-quiet, roots feeding on "memory leached from salt-soaked wood." Minor slip: "so others might choose to speak before the color of goodbye stains the air" edges toward thematic echo in penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Mara; perceptual signature (hearing colors, translating heat to chord) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism—"battered marvel of a note," "bruised pearl"—that feels more authorial than character-bound under stress. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue present except keeper's single line, which reads natural and goal-driven. Some filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood") dull immediacy in peak beats. Voice modulates with pressure but retains ornamental texture throughout rather than compressing under crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual texture. Figurative density is high throughout—"aurora bled," "cells divide in cambium layers," "hemorrhaging russet," "bruised note"—and several metaphors stack in peak beats without pattern-taught payoff, triggering overwriting penalty (−0.5). Mixed vehicle: "cello roar" conflates string and wind. Paraphrase loop: "the gap she had preserved by collecting absences" recaps "collecting absences" already stated two paragraphs prior without new pressure (−0.2). No template cadence or filter stacks, but density occasionally obscures causality (what mechanically happens when she "feeds" intangible gap to forge). Information density is high; propulsion steady but textured rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Premise—hearing-aid designer hunting sound of betrayal in forge under aurora—synthesizes sensory synaesthesia, drowned orchard, and memory-as-fuel in fresh combination. Execution is specific (device translates heat to chord; roots curl through portholes) rather than generic. Risk-taking in sustained lyric texture and sensory translation heightens stakes without obscuring closure. Turn—she hears her own complicity—feels earned in hindsight. Minor deduction: forge-as-confessor and trees-as-memory-archive lean toward familiar symbolic convenience without fully transforming the tropes through lived occupational detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's occupation (hearing aid designer) is signaled early and shapes her sensory perception (device behind ear, microphone miniaturization experience). It enables the forge encounter—her device translates heat to chord and etches waveform onto obsidian—and informs her closure decision to "tune the next hearing aid… to reveal the fragile hush where trust trembles." Present in all three gates (setup, middle choice to press ear to forge, ending lab plan). Causal pressure moderate: occupation enables perception but does not constrain choices with visible cost. Swappable with "sound engineer" or similar with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Forge introduced early ("ashen forge under aurora glowed ahead"), used in middle beat when Mara feeds absence and presses ear to metal, returns at end when keeper closes it and "buds opened." Present in all three gates. Drives two beats: feeding and ear-press. Forge's mechanics (coals breathing lavender, exhaling glass-crack sound) are specific and irreplaceable. Closure linkage strong: forge heat and its song enable obsidian-shard imprint and petal chiming. Cost connection clear: her complicity is heard through forge skin. High integration with slight deduction for ornamental aurora descriptor in first mention.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Memories as fuel is signaled early (trees "feeding on memory leached from salt-soaked wood," "every sailor's broken promise") and shapes middle beat (Mara feeds brother's absence-memory to forge). Concept constrains her choice—she must offer what she misses most—and enables the closure reweighting (brother's laugh "no longer absent" teaches trees). Present in setup, middle, and ending. Causal pressure moderate: concept shapes tactics (collecting absences) and final image, but mechanics remain abstract. Cost tied to concept: admitting her doubt. Slightly swappable with "grief" or "loss" as fuel.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Attribute introduced early ("her newest prototype let her hear colors faintly") and enables middle action (forge coals as "slow cello," crack transmuted to "hemorrhaging russet"). Present in setup and middle beats; ending references tuning aids but not color-hearing specifically. Constraint weak: synaesthesia enriches perception but does not force a visible tradeoff. Cost absent: no price paid for hearing colors. Functional but replaceable with "sensory translator" or similar tech without major structural change. No closure-scene reprise of the specific trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Imprint" is central action: Mara's goal is "to imprint the exact moment trust breaks," and climax occurs when "her device etched the waveform onto a flake of obsidian." Present in setup (goal stated), middle (device sparks, transmuting crack), and ending (she pockets shard, plans to tune next aid). Drives two beats and defines closure unit. Cost tied to action: imprinting captures her complicity as well. Irreplaceable: removing "imprint" collapses story logic. Minor deduction: mechanics of imprinting intangible absence remain abstract despite specificity of obsidian-flake result.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Method "collecting absences" is signaled early ("she believed absences could be collected like dew, stored, and replayed") and informs middle beat (she opens satchel, lays "echoless gap" into forge). Present in setup and middle; ending references method implicitly (brother's laugh "no longer absent"). Mechanics matter: keeper lifts "the intangible thing with tongs made of quiet." Constraint moderate: method shapes what she offers but does not visibly limit tactics or force cost. Swappable with "capturing silence" or "recording voids" with minor edits. No explicit reprise of collection method at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting introduced in opening line ("sunken orchard greenhouse… shipwrecks") and saturates narrative: hawthorn arch entry, salt-caked slate, trees in lifeboat hulls, roots through portholes, cracked glass roof. Present in all three gates. Pressures choices: greenhouse space forces proximity to forge; shipwreck ring frames exit. Micro-setting (forge in greenhouse) alters tactics: she must approach, press ear to iron. Closure charged by setting: aurora funnels through glass, petals chime, trees taste her wound. Irreplaceable: removing drowned orchard and wrecks breaks story's logic and final image. High specificity and causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "while cells divide" appears in two lines: "while cells divide in cambium layers" (paragraph 3) and "While cambium split and cells divide, the orchard itself grew" (paragraph 13). Lyric motif but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed clock. No urgency tied to cellular time; Mara's night visit could occur over any duration. Present in setup and middle as metaphor, absent from ending. Does not constrain tactics or force tempo. Ornamental: swappable with "while night deepens" or similar without structural loss. Late-middle mention (40%+) and lack of causal pressure cap score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation stated early ("to imprint the exact moment trust breaks," hunting brother's sentence) and drives all beats: arrival, forge encounter, ear-press, shard pocketing, and lab-plan ending. Desire is conflicted when forge reveals her complicity. Cost visible: admitting doubt reweights her project from fixing past to "admitting the hollow space inside every future connection." Present in setup, middle choices, and ending decision. Irreplaceable: removing this want collapses causality. Minor deduction: motivation is told more than dramatized through on-page friction; brother remains abstract absence rather than live memory that resists her.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone "battered marvel" is coherent throughout: auroras, forge exhale, obsidian shard as "battered marvel of a note," fragrance "like forgiveness rendered in pale gold." Modulates with pressure: opening iron-taste and rusted keels set bruised mood; climax intensifies with "hemorrhaging russet"; ending softens to "bruised pearl" and "pale gold." Tone charges final image: brother's laugh and trees holding "both wound and blossom" embody battered-marvel paradox. Present across all beats. Minor deduction: phrase "battered marvel" appears once explicitly (shard line), risking label rather than sustained tonal texture, though wounded-beauty imagery pervades.</comment>
