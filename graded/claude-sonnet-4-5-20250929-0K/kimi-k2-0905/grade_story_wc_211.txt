<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ambrose's interiority shows embodied specificity (kneeling, tweezers, ledger work) and his core contradiction—archivist versus suppressor—operates on the page. The child-memory and the prophecy's cruelty are motivated by established backstory (born speaking dead languages, 1958 field trip). However, the final stance feels preordained rather than wrestled from live friction; he simply "waits" for the knock without a visible micro-choice that forecloses another path. The closure cost is conceptual but not dramatized as a decision with visible alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Ambrose, rooftop orchard, post-foghorn dawn) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: foghorn silence → wax shaving → prophecy → immersion memory → quinces with faces → ledger inscription → final transmutation. The closure is Conceptual Repricing—Ambrose becomes the city's grief archive—legible and purposeful. Cost is conceptual (he will answer "in a voice neither alive nor dead") but not felt as a trade-off that closes off another on-page option. One tightening (immersion triggers child-memory) deepens the prophecy's personal stake, satisfying the length default.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is vivid (quince, medlar, Judean date palm, drip basin) and purposeful: the shaving lands on soil, the basin triggers memory, quinces bear oath-faces, the ledger rests beneath the tree. Micro-setting (basin, soil, bark) constrains the immersion choice and charges the final image ("orchard would be gone—transmuted"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (quince-juice ink, greenhouse glass quiver). The orchard's transmutation into "velvet disquiet" reconfigures the space's meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: suppress or archive the accidental prophecy. The immersion choice tightens by triggering the child-memory, which reveals the prophecy's inevitability and personal cost. However, the escalation is passive—prophecy "kept changing," quinces "bore faces," foghorn "migrated into him"—without Ambrose making a second decision that narrows live options. The final act (writing the word, speaking the prophecy aloud) feels like acceptance rather than a choice with visible alternatives, landing the piece in mid-6s for escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: oath-scribe vocation, wax as promise-medium, dead languages as archive, foghorn as city voice. The prophecy inverts Ambrose's role (patterns archive him), and the quinces bearing oath-faces concretize the cost. The final image—"orchard transmuted into velvet disquiet"—is resonant and non-literal, reweighting the premise without stating a moral. The Hittite verb "to remain" recurs purposefully (shaving, quinces, final voice) and the ending leaves ambiguity (what will knock?) without confusion, satisfying thematic depth at this length.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong (tweezers "consecrated for oaths," quince-juice ink distilled each autumn) and diction fits Ambrose's archival register ("venerable," "xylem," "subsonic grief"). However, elevated vocabulary peaks in high-pressure beats without always advancing pressure ("translucent ribbon showed microscopic grooves," "velvet disquiet that drapes itself") and some passive constructions dull immediacy ("prophecy's cruelty: the foghorn had not died; it had migrated"). Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The prose remains character-particular under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high (wax shaving carries prophecy, memory, and role-inversion in tight sequence). However, repeated template stems appear across the second half: "He understood," "He saw," "He spoke," "He opened," "He straightened." The phrase "accidental prophecy" recurs four times without functional variation, and "velvet disquiet" appears twice in the final paragraph, once as ornament. Minor paraphrase loop: "the archive had inverted; the patterns would archive him" restates without added detail. These artifacts dull momentum in the closure third, triggering −0.6 and disallowing 9+ globally per the high-band artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—accidental prophecy via phonograph shaving, oath-scribe who speaks dead languages, rooftop orchard—synthesizes fresh elements. The inversion (archivist archived by patterns) is non-obvious and earned. However, the role (oath scribe tending ancient garden atop tower) leans ornamental, and the final transmutation ("orchard would be gone") is asserted rather than shown as consequence. The child-memory field trip is a strong specific anchor that transforms the prophecy into personal cost. Risk is present (dead-language Hittite prophecy, sensory archive inversion) but some beats (quinces bearing faces, foghorn migrating into him) feel symbolic rather than causally grounded.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ambrose is present throughout and makes two choices: lift the shaving (setup) and immerse it (development, triggers memory). His final acts—writing the word, pressing forehead to bark, speaking the prophecy—shape the closure by accepting the inversion. However, these are acts of recording rather than decisions that narrow live options; he does not wrestle between suppressing versus archiving but instead fulfills a role the prophecy assigns. Two beats (tweezers lift, immersion) plus closure participation meet the gate, but agency is muted, placing the score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wax shaving appears in four beats: lands on soil (setup), lifted with tweezers (early action), held to light reveals Hittite (middle development), immersed triggers memory and dissolves (payoff, enables closure). Its properties—caramel curl, microscopic grooves, warmth, wax-as-promise medium—are specific and irreplaceable. The shaving's dissolution is causal (memory drenches, shaving dissolves, prophecy migrates into Ambrose), driving the inversion. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage with specificity elevate the score; it narrowly misses 8.5+ because the final image (ledger, orchard) eclipses the shaving itself at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accidental prophecy is framed early (shaving "forming" words "never given"), appears in middle beats (Hittite phrase "kept changing," child-Ambrose hears future self), and the ending turns on Ambrose accepting the prophecy's cost (foghorn migrated, patterns archive him). It shapes tactics (immerse to silence versus archive) and the closure rests on prophecy's inevitability. However, the prophecy is more atmospheric force than dramatized complication; it does not narrow options so much as impose a destiny Ambrose accepts. Two gates (setup, payoff) with causal pressure but muted friction, landing mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dead-language fluency is established (born speaking Etruscan, understands Hittite) and used in two beats: reading the shaving and writing the word in the ledger. It enables the plot (only Ambrose can read the prophecy) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; the trait is competence without friction. No on-page moment where speaking a dead language forecloses another path or imposes a trade-off. Present in setup and payoff with enabling function but no dramatized cost, placing it in low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Immersion is signaled early ("intending to immerse it, silence the voice") and executed at midpoint, triggering the field-trip memory that reveals the prophecy's personal history and inevitability. This beat redefines options: suppression is impossible because child-Ambrose already heard adult-Ambrose recite it. The shaving dissolves, prophecy migrates into Ambrose, and quinces bear oath-faces—all consequences of immersion. The action appears in setup, drives the key turn, and shapes closure (ledger beneath tree, orchard transmutes). Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The field-trip memory is signaled obliquely in paragraph 1 ("school group that had toured the roof") and its mechanics matter: immersion triggers the 1958 memory, which reveals child-Ambrose heard his future self. This reframes the prophecy as inevitable loop, deepening cost. The method shapes the middle turn (water touched wax → memory drenched him) and participates in closure logic (prophecy already fulfilled). Present in setup (school group cue), drives middle beat, and informs closure, but the initial cue is easy to miss, slightly weakening setup credit. Two-and-a-half gates with causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The orchard is present throughout: soil where shaving lands, basin triggers memory, quinces bear oath-faces, Judean palm anchors ledger, greenhouse door awaits knock. Micro-setting (basin, bark, soil) constrains choices (immerse here, press forehead, set ledger beneath tree) and the final image turns on orchard transmutation into "velvet disquiet." Early setup, repeated beat use (soil, basin, tree), and closure payoff (transmutation) with specificity (quince-juice ink, xylem, drip irrigation). Strong integration across all three gates with causal and imagistic work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is established (foghorn's last note at dawn) and bookends the piece (final fog rolls in, silent). It frames the story's window but does not tighten decisions; Ambrose has unlimited time to lift, examine, immerse, and write. The silence is thematic (city's grief, subsonic ache) but does not pressure tactics. Present in setup and closure image (next fog) with atmospheric function but no live clock that alters moves, landing mid-5s for two-gate resonance without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Archiving emotional patterns is stated early ("lifelong vow") and dramatized in beats: lift shaving with oath-tweezers, "intending to... silence the voice before it named a disaster," write Hittite word in ledger, press prophecy into tree. Friction appears when the archive inverts ("patterns would archive him"), creating cost. However, the desire is never tested against a competing want; Ambrose archives even when it costs him. Two gates (setup, payoff) with friction at closure but no mid-scene choice where archiving competes with self-preservation, placing it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Velvet disquiet is taught through diction (foghorn "moan," silence "settle," "soft velvet disquiet") and modulates coherently: opening stillness, curiosity (shaving examination), dread (prophecy cruelty), resignation (final transmutation). Tone charges the final image ("voice neither alive nor dead, only remaining") and remains consistent through turns without flattening into single static mood. However, the phrase "velvet disquiet" appears only twice, both times in the final paragraph, weakening early setup. Strong payoff and modulation with late explicit naming, landing low-7s.</comment>
