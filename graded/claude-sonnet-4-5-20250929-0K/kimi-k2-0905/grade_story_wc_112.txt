<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sky mechanic's interiority is concrete and her prosthetic lungs function as both constraint and metaphor throughout. Her hesitation ripples across time in a dramatized choice, and the final decision to wait—to remain "obliging"—forecloses the path of intervention with visible cost. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: she seeks proof of sideways time yet refuses to finish becoming. Minor slip: the younger-self projection feels slightly abstract in embodiment compared to the present-tense sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: she steps back, centers the lever, and commits to waiting, crystallizing the choice between intervention and patience with felt cost (she will not pull the lever tomorrow). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through the nexus pulse, moth-bat interference patterns, holographic projections, and the vision of branching futures, culminating in a cadence shift at "she stepped back." Orientation anchors early (station, aviary, twilight routine). One meaningful deepening occurs when she steps "outside the station's timeline" and sees both futures, reweighting her nightly ritual into a repeatable proof rather than a theorem.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus constrains her exploration (she must touch it to engage the lever), and the aviary's "hush of beating wings at rest" charges the final image of subdued awakening. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "icy warmth," "chilled honey," "subsonic hum," "titanium ribs." The station functions as chrysalis, a micro-setting that shapes her stance. Spatial choreography remains clear across the axial spine, aviary module, and lever at the bulkhead. Minor gap: the violet cloud-sea of Kepler-9c is named but never returns to pressure a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prove that time moves sideways and explore the choice to keep or reverse her prosthetic lungs. The lever-pull tightens options by showing both futures, forcing her to choose intervention or patience. Agency is clear: she lowers the lever by degrees, steps sideways with time, then steps back and centers it, refusing to intervene—a renunciation that forecloses the path of altering her younger self with visible cost (she remains the station's organ). Escalation deepens under the Accumulative lens via subsonic moth-bat patterns and the lattice of possible choices. No artificial reversals; pressure coheres to the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through chrysalis imagery, the mechanically warm lungs as companionship rather than burden, and the idea that proof lives in "the angle of her next footstep" rather than data. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: time's sideways movement is validated not by theorem but by the quiet repetition of choice. Subdued awakenings (moth-bats, station, mechanic) layer without overt statement. The magnetic nexus as lattice of frost reweights prior mentions. No moralizing; the final image leaves the younger self "waiting for the next twilight when the lever might be moved one degree less, or—" with purposeful incompletion that charges ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent (mechanically warm, twilight routine, obligation to the sky). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "obliging sky mechanic," "chilled honey," "reluctant imago," "sideways time." No head-hopping. Reflection anchors in present stimuli (nexus pulse, projections, moth-bat song) and tilts present stance via micro-choices (lowering the lever, stepping back). Purposeful compression ("three against five," "icy warmth") is taught and legible. Minor slip: "mechanically warm" recurs frequently enough to approach tic, though it remains voice-motivated and thematically charged.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the aviary module where the native moth-bats folded their glassy pinions and pretended to sleep" anchors setting, creature, and tone). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "patient spider," "prism," "paper fan," "lattice of light." Deduction for mild overwriting in the midpoint descriptive run ("subsonic hum that vibrated the titanium ribs" followed by "interference patterns" and "signature of subdued awakenings") where metaphoric density briefly slows momentum without pattern-teaching payoff. The final paragraph's repetition of "mechanically warm" and "obliging" reads as intentional echo rather than artifact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of xenobiology research station, holographic time-mapping, prosthetic lungs as station organ, and moth-bats as mirror for the protagonist's chrysalis state feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the "scientist explores time" template through embodied cost (her lungs) and the choice to remain in stasis. The final image of the younger self waiting for "the next twilight when the lever might be moved one degree less, or—" is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, lyric closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the holographic principles remain somewhat abstract; grounding their mechanics earlier would sharpen irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present by first paragraph (setup ✓). Her choice to engage the lever drives the middle exploration (development ✓), and her decision to step back, center the lever, and wait rather than intervene is the closure action (payoff ✓). Causal pressure: her hesitation maps to the younger self's hesitation, and her final stance forecloses intervention with visible cost. Beat involvement: at least three (nightly walk, lever engagement, stepping sideways, stepping back). Irreplaceability: the "obliging" trait and her status as the station's organ are specific to her role. Cost: she remains tethered to the station, choosing not to alter her past.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Present in first paragraph (setup ✓). She touches it at twilight, engages it via the lever, touches "the real sphere to its ghost" in the hologram, and it appears in the final image as "the lattice of the magnetic nexus" where the younger version waits (development ✓, payoff ✓). The nexus's pulse ("three against five") matches the moth-bat patterns, constraining her interpretation. Its core as "lattice of light where every possible choice glimmered like frost" reweights meaning at closure. Beat involvement: at least three. Irreplaceability: the alloyed cobalt sphere with mechanically warm heartbeat and holographic lattice is highly specific. Cost: its witness function traps her in recursive choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled obliquely in the moth-bat behavior ("pretended to sleep") and the station as chrysalis (setup ✓). The moth-bats' "subdued awakenings" signature (three-against-five ratio) identifies the station and mechanic as chrysalides refusing to emerge, shaping her realization (development ✓). The final image of waiting to "open her own chrysalis when the moment was ripe" directly invokes the concept (payoff ✓). However, the concept operates more as theme than as a constraint that narrows tactical options on the page. The awakenings are observed and interpreted but do not themselves enable or block a concrete action with immediate cost. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but remains one step removed from direct causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present in first paragraph via "mechanically warm heartbeat" of the nexus mirroring her prosthetic lungs (setup ✓). The attribute recurs: "mechanically warm bellows," "icy warmth," "mechanical lungs breathing with her instead of for her," and "keeping the station's heart mechanically warm" (development ✓, payoff ✓). It enables her bond with the station (companionship rather than burden) and constrains her choice: reversing the prosthetics would sever that bond. Beat involvement: at least three. Cost: the tradeoff between flesh and station organ is visible. Minor cap: while thematically charged, the attribute's mechanical constraint on a specific action is implied rather than dramatized in a single high-stakes beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Present early: "she engaged the lever recessed into the bulkhead" (setup ✓). The lever-pull triggers the projections and visions, enabling her exploration of both futures (development ✓). "Lowering the lever by degrees" controls the intensity, and "lever centered" in the final paragraph marks her choice to halt intervention (payoff ✓). The action is causally indispensable: without the lever, no visions, no choice to step sideways, no decision to wait. Beat involvement: three. Irreplaceability: swapping "lever" for "switch" or "button" would require only minor edits, but the tactile "chilled honey" quality and the degrees of lowering add specificity. Cost: centering it forecloses immediate change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph four: "holographic principles encoded in the nexus were her only witness" (setup ✓). The method appears again when she touches the nexus to its ghost hologram to "tilt time sideways" (development ✓). The final image references "the lattice of the magnetic nexus" where holographic choice-frost glimmers (payoff ✓). However, the mechanics of how holographic principles enable sideways time remain abstract; the method is invoked rather than demonstrated with clear constraints or costs. It shapes her approach but does not visibly narrow tactical options or force a tradeoff on the page. Functional but replaceable with "quantum entanglement" or similar SFnal handwave.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anchored in first sentence: research station above Kepler-9c (setup ✓). The aviary module, axial spine, twilight corridors, and bulkhead lever provide concrete spatial pressure (development ✓). The station's identity as chrysalis and her role as its organ shape her final choice to remain (payoff ✓). The setting supplies the nexus, aviary, and moth-bats as resources. Spatial choreography is clear. Minor limitation: the xenobiology function is named but never directly constrains a choice (e.g., a specimen breach, protocol conflict). The station operates more as thematic container than as a source of immediate tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Present in title phrase and paragraph three: "within the hush of beating wings at rest" (setup ✓). The timeframe recurs: "every evening," "tonight," "twilight," and the final "tomorrow she would come again" (development ✓, payoff ✓). The nightly ritual structures her routine, and the decision to wait "until then" defers action with visible cost. However, the timeframe does not impose a live clock or urgency that tightens tactics within this single evening's scene. The hush functions more as atmospheric setting and thematic echo (subdued awakening) than as a ticking constraint. Lyric reprise reweights but does not visibly alter immediate choices under time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Stated in paragraph four: "she had come here to prove that time moves sideways" (setup ✓). The desire drives her lever-pull and exploration of the visions (development ✓). The final realization—"the proof she had sought… was not a theorem but a doorway"—and her choice to prove it "not in equations but in the quiet repetition of choice" constitute payoff (✓). Friction: she wants proof yet refuses to act on it, choosing to wait. Cost: she records no data, files no report, accepting that the evidence lives in footsteps rather than publication. Beat involvement: at least three. Irreplaceability: the specific phrasing "time moves sideways" recurs and is reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Established early: "icy warmth that spilled from the walls" and "mechanically warm heartbeat" (setup ✓). The oxymoron recurs throughout: "icy warmth lingered in her chest," "mechanically warm," "obliging" (development ✓). The final image of companionship ("breathing with her instead of for her") and "keeping the station's heart mechanically warm" sustains the tone through closure (payoff ✓). The tone modulates with pressure: clinical at the walk, dreamlike during visions, settled at the end. It charges the final image by reconciling obligation and warmth. Minor limitation: the paradox is announced more than it is texturally demonstrated through varied sensory beats; it reads more as label than as felt contradiction in specific moments.</comment>
