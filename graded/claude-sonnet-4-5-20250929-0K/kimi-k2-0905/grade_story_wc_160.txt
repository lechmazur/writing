<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mireya's core motivation is clear and her method of mediation drives the closure. However, the interiority remains thin—her contradictory impulses are asserted more than dramatized ("slyly heartfelt reverence" is label-only), and the emotional progression through discovery feels mechanical rather than embodied. The delegations' turn from "faces hard with seasons of mistrust" to nodding acceptance happens too cleanly without visible internal struggle. The final paragraph's reflective summary tells us about her steady hands and the founder's presence rather than showing cost in concrete choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (amphitheater, volcano, floodgate dispute). The causal chain—adhesive analysis → coordinates → hidden tube → lullaby → acoustic mediation → compromise—holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening when the lullaby transforms the delegations' perception. Closure lands on the page with the water surging and Mireya feeling the founder's ongoing decision. The cost, however, remains somewhat abstract: "hands did not tremble" and "familiar weight" are felt states, but we don't see a concrete path foreclosed or a visible price paid in the final image. The ending drifts slightly into thematic summary ("trust ingenuity more than victory") rather than resting on the image alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amphitheater is vividly anchored with basalt benches, moonlight dappling, and the volcano's breathing rhythm. The surveyor's chain and the hidden keystone block constrain Mireya's method and drive the discovery sequence. The acoustics of the amphitheater directly enable the resolution by weaving the delegations' demands into harmony. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (vine-choked steps, orchestra floor, tenth row, stage, rim). The setting does more than frame—it actively mediates conflict, charging the final image of water and breath.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harmonizing the farmers' and fishers' conflicting demands without bloodshed—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mireya sings the lullaby and the amphitheater transforms discord into duet, forcing both sides to hear each other's necessity. The compromise (gates opened at moonrise for three nights, closed at moonset) narrows options and earns the delegations' nod. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless: no visible resistance after the acoustic transformation, no competing goods dramatized in the final choice. The cost is implied in "not defeated but enlarged," but we don't witness a trade-off or see what Mireya or the delegations sacrifice to reach this point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of mediation through empathy (encrypted compassion) emerges through the lullaby's acoustic transformation and the amphitheater's role as mediator rather than through assertion. The founder's choice to "trust ingenuity more than victory, compassion more than decree" arises from concrete particulars—adhesive analysis, hidden cipher, sonic harmony. The final image of the river flowing together "under the volcano's patient, dappled resolve" reconfigures the opening's "dappled resolve across the basalt benches" with accumulated meaning. Minor slip: the penultimate paragraph edges into direct thematic statement ("to trust ingenuity more than victory") where the image could have carried the weight alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third tracking Mireya. The prose establishes a distinct texture with elevated diction ("dappled resolve," "wax impression," "grinding whisper") that fits the quasi-mythic atmosphere. However, the register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory—"vine-choked steps," "slyly heartfelt reverence," "latest link in a chain older than resentment"—where the figurative density competes with clarity. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the delegations' voices are not individuated. Perceptual signature is consistent (engineer's eye on adhesive lattice, chain links, acoustic mechanics) but lacks embodied sensory variance under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose carries strong imagery and varied rhythm, but several artifacts accumulate. Figurative language clusters in most sentences of the opening and closing without always advancing pressure: "silver coins of light," "tuning fork," "slyly heartfelt," "grinding whisper," "dappled resolve" (repeated twice). Paraphrase loops appear: "She understood then the encrypted compassion: the founder had not chosen sides but had given the volcano itself the role of mediator" is immediately restated as "turning human discord into chords." The final two paragraphs loop thematic summary rather than resting on the image. Template cadence in the middle section: "she asked...and the amphitheater answered...When the song ended...Mireya proposed..." follows a mechanical beat. Apply −0.8 for density + loop + template in non-closure beats; −0.3 additional for figurative muddle touching the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—acoustic mediation via ancient cipher and volcanic amphitheater—offers a fresh synthesis. The founder's compassion encoded in adhesive impurities and a lullaby that modulates acoustics is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional turn (delegations move from mistrust to handclasping) follows a familiar template: wise mediator discovers ancient wisdom, applies it, conflict dissolves. The resolution lacks the friction or moral calculus that would elevate it beyond competent execution of the frame. The piece commits fully to its premise and the closure image (river singing the lullaby) recharges prior material, but the path from discovery to harmony is too smooth to feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mireya's choices structure the narrative: descending the amphitheater, analyzing the adhesive, pacing the chain, opening the tube, singing the lullaby, proposing the compromise. Her decisions alter tactics (from material analysis to acoustic mediation) and produce the closure (water surging, chain coiled). Present in setup, middle beats, and ending. Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability is high. −0.3 for some moves being recounted rather than fully dramatized (the adhesive analysis is summarized in one sentence). Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, minus −0.3 summary = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in the opening (satchel), is unwound at the tenth row to locate the keystone, and is coiled again over the delegations' handclasp in closure ("its links warm with shared pulse"). Three distinct beats; it enables the discovery and charges the final image. The chain's heirloom status and its role as "impartial verdict" and later "latest link...older than resentment" add specificity. −0.2 for the second mention being somewhat ornamental (legend says it would provide a verdict, but the chain itself does not arbitrate—the lullaby does). Score: early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.0, closure +1.4, specificity +0.6, ornamental friction −0.2 = ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion is the founder's hidden message and shapes the stakes (finding the cipher to mediate). It drives the adhesive analysis and the lullaby's function. The concept appears in setup (legend of encrypted compassion), development (lullaby discovered, understood as the founder's choice not to take sides), and closure (delegations harmonized, Mireya feeling the founder's presence). However, "encrypted compassion" itself is abstract; the operational element is the lullaby, not the concept. The concept reweights meaning at closure but does not narrow tactical options on the page—the lullaby does. Score: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, swappability friction −0.5 (could be "hidden wisdom" or "ancient empathy"), ornamental −0.3 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears once as a label ("unwinding the brass loops with a slyly heartfelt reverence, as though she served both farmers and fishers simultaneously"). It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it is an adverbial descriptor of her manner. No setup, no middle development, no closure participation. The trait is told, not shown through distinct beats or choices. Score: ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3, no causal work = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tremble" is invoked twice: "the pattern...trembled like a tuning fork when the mountain sighed" (adhesive lattice) and "though the night air was cool, her hands did not tremble" (closure). The first use is metaphorical; the second is a negation signaling steadiness. The closure image of steady hands contrasts unspoken anxiety and charges the final beat, but "tremble" itself does not create a turn—it underscores emotional state. The adhesive's trembling enables discovery (setup), and the final non-tremble marks resolution (closure), but no middle beat involves trembling as an action. Score: early +0.5, closure +1.0, lyric reprise reweights +0.5, swappability −0.4 (could be "shiver" or "shake"), ornamental first use −0.3 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method—analyzing leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope—is signaled in paragraph six and executed in paragraph seven (magnification goggles, crystalline lattice, impurities forming a pattern). It produces the coordinates that lead to the keystone, enabling the entire discovery chain. Present in setup (archive fleck mentioned early), development (analysis drives the search), and indirectly in closure (the adhesive's copper hue matches the keystone mortar, validating the method). The mechanics matter and shape attempts. −0.3 for the analysis being summarized in one beat rather than dramatized across multiple attempts. Score: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal +1.3, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.7, summary friction −0.3 = ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater is the primary setting and directly enables the resolution: its acoustics turn discord into harmony. It appears in setup (descent, basalt benches, moonlight), development (orchestra floor, tenth row keystone, hidden cavity), and closure (stage, delegations arrive, Mireya sings, volcano exhales). The amphitheater's structure (rows corresponding to chain links) constrains the search; its acoustics alter the delegations' perception. The volcano's breathing rhythm becomes the compromise cycle. Irreplaceable and causal across all three gates. Score: early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.5, closure +1.6, specificity +0.8, cost connection +0.4 = ~8.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" recurs as a rhythmic motif: the amphitheater breathes (opening), the adhesive pattern trembles "when the mountain sighed," the volcano exhales at closure, and the breathing rhythm becomes the compromise (gates opened/closed matching the mountain's breath). The timeframe is more atmospheric than tactical—no live clock tightens decisions. Present in setup, development (sigh triggers pattern recognition), and closure (exhale, breathing rhythm). The breathing reweights the compromise but does not narrow options under time pressure. Score: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure +1.0, lyric reprise +0.5, lacks tactical pressure −0.5, ornamental in middle −0.3 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mireya's motivation—to harmonize conflicting values without bloodshed—is stated early and dramatized throughout. She descends seeking the founder's cipher, analyzes the adhesive to find it, and uses the lullaby to make each side feel the other's necessity. The motivation drives every choice and shapes the compromise. Present in setup, development (each beat advances the goal), and closure (compromise reached, Mireya reflects on serving both sides). Friction between wants (impartial verdict) and costs (the delegations' mistrust, her own uncertainty) is implied but not deeply embodied. Score: early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure +1.4, cost connection +0.4, embodiment friction −0.4 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears in the opening ("moonlight that dappled resolve across the basalt benches") and the closing ("under the volcano's patient, dappled resolve"). The tone is consistent—measured, deliberate, tinged with wonder—and modulates subtly as pressure rises (the adhesive discovery, the lullaby's revelation, the delegations' transformation). The final reprise reweights the opening image, charging it with the earned compromise. However, the tone remains somewhat static; it does not sharpen or crack under peak pressure. Score: early +0.6, coherent through turns +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, lyric reprise +0.6, static mood friction −0.4 = ~6.7.</comment>
