<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chen's desire to "transpose life into a new key" and orchestrate his disappearance operates through consistent micro-choices (palming film, hollowing the bolt, untying the skiff), but his interior remains somewhat abstract—label-speak like "accidentally prophetic" appears without embodied cost in peak moments. The keeper is functional but static, existing primarily to receive Chen's moves. The final departure earns a visible forfeiture (leaving the spy life, the island's gravitational pull internalized), yet the emotional progression leans on poetic assertion ("felt the rocky island slide inside him") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening exchange and supply skiff arrival. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: recurring images (lighthouse beam, open secret, stone keys) accrue density and the final departure reweights Chen's identity from spy to "wind." Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Chen's untying of the skiff forecloses his espionage role with visible cost (abandoning specs, film, buyers). One meaningful deepening occurs when he plants the fortune-cookie film and chooses departure over remaining "one more note" in the island's enigma, but causality between beats occasionally feels elliptical rather than motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse and rocky island are concretely rendered (Fresnel lens, granite spine, combers smashing, lithophone stones) and constrain Chen's spycraft (lamp provides exposure, timing descent between beam rotations). Micro-setting elements—wire specs, hollowed bolt, skiff—function as tools that enable his final move. Sensory hierarchy reflects Chen's dual focus (light as shutter, wind as escape vector). The island as "stone keys" that "tune his ribs" charges the final image, making setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Chen's orchestrated disappearance, signaled early ("transpose life into a new key"). One meaningful tightening: planting the film-cookie and stepping into the skiff narrows options from cryptic espionage to self-erasure. Agency is visible (untying the skiff, whispering "not fortunes but lyrics"), and the cost is legible—he abandons buyers, coordinates, his sage role. Escalation under the Accumulative lens accumulates through recurring motifs (open secret, pulse syncing with beam), but the keeper's drunkenness and Chen's ease undercut immediate pressure; coincidence (supply skiff, keeper's distraction) facilitates rather than complicates the escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—"open secrets" as truths hidden in plain sight—emerges through concrete particulars: fortunes mistaken for whimsy, the lighthouse "confessing light to no one," Chen's final lyrics encrypting escape. The fortune "THE ROCK YOU STAND ON WILL SOON STAND INSIDE YOU" operates non-literally, reweighting Chen's internalization of the island at closure. Subtext runs through gesture (palming film, timing steps between rotations) and the final image of the submerged spine humming. Minor slip: "accidentally prophetic" and "open secret" are stated frequently enough to edge toward thematic echo, though the closing image rescues resonance by making the concept felt rather than declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Chen; perceptual signature is consistent (light as shutter, wind as score, island as instrument). Diction elevates purposefully ("lithophone," "Fresnel lens," "combers") to match Chen's cryptic register, though occasional phrases ("accidentally prophetic," "familiar enigma") veer toward prompt-label phrasing. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven ("You still write those cookies, Chen?" / "Ever think the light talks?"), and carries subtext. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during departure. Brief convergence: the keeper's speech and Chen's both lean poetic under the beam's influence, but the effect reads intentional rather than voice collapse.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high ("white explosions that looked like negatives," "island was a lithophone," "oars, each pull a bar in a new score") and mostly coherent, but several metaphors crowd single beats without clear payoff (lighthouse as "pen and darkroom," fortune as "tiny lantern"). Template cadence appears in the middle third: "He wanted to orchestrate... to transpose life..." / "He recalled the line... realized the island..."—parallel infinitive chains across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "open secret" recurs six times with slight synonym variation ("open secret planted like a seed" / "an open secret signaling nothing and everything"), dulling precision. Information density is strong elsewhere; no outright clarity breaks. Deductions: −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops, capping at upper 6-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of spy thriller, fortune-cookie writer, and lighthouse as darkroom is specific and non-obvious; removing any element (spycraft specs, beam-as-shutter, prophetic fortunes) would collapse the premise. Emotional particulars (Chen's desire to become "only wind," the keeper's unknowing complicity) avoid generic templates. Minor derivative echo: the cryptic sage who vanishes after planting a final message has antecedents, though the lighthouse mechanics and microdot-film integration transform it. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, and the final image (submerged spine humming a chord "left to wander in the key of salt and departure") offers a resonant, non-clichéd closure. Risk-taking in metaphor density occasionally edges toward overwriting but heightens stakes without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Chen is present from the opening and drives every key turn: palming film, writing the fortune, planting the bolt-cookie, untying the skiff. His choices alter tactics (using the lighthouse lamp for exposure, timing descent between beam rotations) and the ending depends on his decision to leave. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is moderate—his agency is clear, but the keeper's passivity and convenience (drunkenness, distraction) reduce friction. Closure linkage is strong: Chen's departure fulfills his stated goal and the final image ties to his internalization of the island. Swappability is low; another profession would require different mechanics. Deductions: −0.8 for moderate rather than high causal pressure (obstacles are environmental rather than interpersonal), +0.7 closure linkage, +0.4 two beats (planting fortune, untying skiff), +0.3 early signal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The specs appear in paragraph two ("wire spectacles that doubled as spycraft microdot film specs") and recur when Chen extracts the film coil and later trades them for reading glasses. Setup gate met. Development: the specs enable his spycraft but do not constrain a middle choice—Chen removes them to extract film, a procedural step without visible cost. Payoff: mentioned in summary ("microdot specs traded for reading glasses") but not dramatized in the ending beat; the skiff departure focuses on oars and island internalization, not the specs. Two touches across beats (extraction, trade reference). Swappability: another recording device (miniature camera, hidden recorder) could replace with minor edits. Deductions: −0.5 late payoff summary-only, −0.4 swappable, +0.4 one beat involvement, +0.3 early signal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Open secrets" frames the premise (fortunes "so obvious no one believed they were prophecy," the lighthouse "confessing light to no one") and recurs across beats: Chen plants the fortune as "an open secret planted like a seed," the sea "keeps its secrets by speaking them aloud," and the final beam is "an open secret signaling nothing and everything." Setup gate met early. Development: the concept shapes Chen's tactics (writing fortunes that hide in plain sight, palming film during weather-log inspection). Payoff: the closing image explicitly names "open secret" and ties it to the lighthouse's ongoing confession after Chen's departure. Causal pressure is moderate—"open secret" organizes theme and atmosphere but does not narrow options or impose a trade-off at the climax. Cost connection is thematic rather than concrete. Three distinct beats. Deductions: −0.6 for primarily thematic rather than stake-altering pressure, +1.4 three beats, +0.8 early setup, +0.7 closure linkage (final image).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is introduced as a trait in paragraph four ("accidentally prophetic, the kind that turned true because people carried it in their pockets") and recurs when Chen recalls the fortune and "felt the words burrow, accidentally prophetic." Setup in first third. Development: the trait describes Chen's fortune-writing method but does not constrain an on-page action—he writes the fortune and leaves; the prophecy's fulfillment is deferred to reader imagination (the keeper will internalize the rock, Chen already has). Payoff: Chen feels the line's truth before departing, a realization rather than a forcing function. The trait is label-only; removing "accidentally" and "prophetic" would not alter Chen's choices or the keeper's reaction. Swappable with "eerily accurate" or "self-fulfilling." Deductions: −1.0 ornamental/label-only, −0.4 swappable, +0.4 one beat, +0.3 early signal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Orchestrate" appears as Chen's stated goal ("needed to orchestrate one final message," "orchestrating a life no buyer could decrypt," "whispered new lines... orchestrating a life") and shapes his method: he arranges elements (fortune, film, skiff, timing) to construct his disappearance. Setup early. Development: "orchestrate" motivates planting the fortune-cookie with hidden film, timing his descent, and the synchronized departure. Payoff: the final paragraph references "orchestrating a life" as Chen's new mode. The verb is thematically apt (musician/composer connotations fit "transpose life into a new key") but does not create a unique constraint—synonyms like "arrange," "craft," "engineer" could replace with minor tonal edits. Two beats (planting message, final reflection). Deductions: −0.5 moderate swappability, +0.9 two beats, +0.8 causal pressure (frames tactics), +0.8 early signal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Directing flow" appears in "letting the revolving Fresnel lens direct the flow of light across the paper" and "letting moonlight direct the flow of the oars." Setup in first third. The method matters mechanically: Chen uses the lighthouse beam to expose film, a specific constraint that shapes his cover story (admiring the logbook) and timing. Development: directing light is dramatized when Chen writes the fortune under the rotating beam, "each pulse a silent shutter." Payoff: the method recurs when moonlight directs the oars, but this is metaphorical rather than mechanical; the skiff's propulsion does not depend on "directing flow" as a technique. The lamp mechanics are irreplaceable, but "direct the flow" as phrasing is somewhat generic. Two beats. Deductions: −0.4 second instance is metaphorical rather than causal, −0.3 phrasing partially swappable, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal pressure (exposure method), +0.8 early signal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse and rocky island are introduced immediately ("lighthouse keeper," "evening supply skiff," "black water") and pressure every key choice: the lamp exposes Chen's film, the beam's rotation times his descent, the granite and combers embody the "rock you stand on," and the island's pull (lithophone, tuning his ribs) precipitates his departure. Setup gate met. Development: the tower's spiral stairs and lantern room enable Chen's spycraft and provide the vantage for his decision. Payoff: the closing image centers the lighthouse beam and the submerged island spine, charging the ending. The setting is irreplaceable—relocating to a generic safehouse would eliminate the beam-as-shutter mechanics and the stone-key metaphor. Three or more beats. Visible cost: staying would make Chen "one more note" in the island's music, a fate he chooses to escape. Deductions: none; all positive signals present. +1.4 three beats, +1.6 causal pressure, +1.8 closure linkage, +0.8 specificity/irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After last orders" appears in paragraph two ("After last orders, yes—when the world thinks I'm retired") and recurs ("when the horn signaled last orders at the mainland tavern"). Setup in first third. The timeframe establishes atmosphere (night, end of working hours, cover of retirement) but does not tighten decisions—Chen has the entire evening and no visible deadline pressures his departure. Development: "last orders" is mentioned again when fishermen will read fortunes, but this is future projection, not present constraint. Payoff: absent from the ending; dawn is referenced ("By dawn he would beach") but "last orders" does not return. One functional beat (establishing nocturnal cover). Time is vague (evening supply skiff → dawn) rather than a live clock. Deductions: −0.6 no payoff, −0.5 does not tighten tactics, +0.4 one beat, +0.3 early signal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Transpose life into a new key" is introduced early ("needed to orchestrate one final message, to transpose life into a new key") and recurs when Chen wants "to transpose life into a new key where he was not spy or sage, only wind." Setup gate met. Development: the desire motivates Chen's entire sequence—writing the fortune, extracting film, planting the cookie, and departing. The "new key" metaphor ties to musical imagery (lithophone, bars in a score, chord) and charges his renunciation. Payoff: Chen's whispered "new lines... not fortunes but lyrics, orchestrating a life no buyer could decrypt" fulfills the goal in the ending beat. Friction is present: the desire conflicts with his established role (buyers, coordinates, sage identity) and the island's gravitational pull. Cost is visible—he abandons income, recognition, and the familiar. Two beats (statement, fulfillment). Deductions: the desire is poeticized rather than embodied in contradictory impulses during peak pressure. +0.9 two beats, +1.0 causal pressure, +0.8 closure linkage, +0.6 cost connection, −0.7 mostly told rather than shown in friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Familiar enigma" appears in "the beam overhead sweeping its familiar enigma across black water" and recurs when Chen imagines becoming "one more note in its familiar enigma." Setup early. The tone—contemplative, layered with secrecy and pattern—coheres across beats: the lighthouse "confesses," fortunes are "open secrets," the island is a "lithophone." Development: the tone shapes Chen's perception (moonlit combers as "negatives developing," oars as "bars in a new score") and supports his cryptic method. Payoff: the closing image sustains the tone (submerged spine humming "a chord struck once, then left to wander") and modulates subtly—what was "familiar" becomes "wandering," reflecting Chen's departure from repetition. The tone charges the final image by making enigma itself the mode of escape. Two beats. Deductions: "familiar enigma" as phrasing is somewhat abstract; the effect is more atmospheric than pressure-imposing. +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, +0.5 modulation under pressure, −0.4 abstract phrasing partially reduces specificity.</comment>
