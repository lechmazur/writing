<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The keeper's agency is present but largely observational until the late climactic choice. Interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("the absence felt louder") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The mother revelation arrives late and risks unmotivated emotion; the decision to sacrifice her archive place feels asserted more than earned through prior micro-choices thattest competing values. The final transformation into "the memory itself" reads more like thematic summary than a choice with visible tradeoffs on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure: the keeper becomes the broadcast archive, reweighting "deletion" as distributed memory. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (corporate role, archive, hashtag emergence). The causality chain from hashtag auto-complete → patch speaker → coordinates → server farm holds, though several moves (security lie, crystal bargain, hashtag trending worldwide) rely on convenience rather than protagonist tactics. The closure image—blank user posting every 73 hours, Block 73 singing back—lands with conceptual cost (her erasure from payroll, mother's voice distributed) but the immediate trigger (touching crystal, singing aloud) feels more like activating a preset mechanism than a decision that narrows prior options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The server farm's "rows of crystal blocks" that "hum different notes" and Block 73 "glowing warmer" create a tactile, purposeful setting that charges the final image (the empty rectangular hole singing back at 73 BPM). The patch object—woven triangle, scorched edge, tiny speaker—is handled twice (taped under desk, dissolved into skin) and its chord drives the middle investigation. Spatial choreography (archive desk → midnight tube → polar cap farm → Block 73) tracks cleanly. The social network archive and neural implant anchor the world's digital-memory logic without exposition dumps.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncovering the Aurora cover-up and her mother's erasure—is signaled early via the forbidden folder and recurring 73s. Pressure accumulates through the hashtag auto-complete, the patch chord match, and the crystal's biometric bargain, but most turns arrive via discovery rather than protagonist-driven escalation under resistance. The keeper's lie to security is brief; the company's instant capitulation ("denial, then recall, then silence") deflates antagonistic pressure. The crystal bargain (open file, lose archive place) offers a clear trade-off with felt cost (name dimming, badge pixelating), and the final broadcast prevents refill of absence—one meaningful tightening that reweights the stake under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—corporate erasure vs. distributed memory, the persistence of the deleted—emerges from concrete images (ghost squares, blank user, Block 73's hole) without overt moralizing until the final paragraphs' assertions ("deleted files never disappear," "absence refuses refill"). The lullaby motif recurs purposefully (mother's hum, patch chord, server harmony, worldwide remixes) and reweights at closure. The keeper's transformation into "the memory itself" risks abstraction, but the image of a blank user posting a chord every 73 hours offers a non-literal answer. Minor slip: "brightly attentive for seven years" reads like prompt echo rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric-SF register ("timestamps that pulsed like dying stars," "rattled like a dying hard drive") that modulates under pressure but occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("dementia servers," "pirate frequencies") that risks aesthetic gloss over embodied perception. Free indirect access to the keeper's thought is clean. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though several metaphors stack without clear embodiment (archive as "living archive orbiting the planet"). No dialogue present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—most sentences carry metaphor or simile—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting concerns ("cursor hovering over timestamps that pulsed like dying stars," "train that rattled like a dying hard drive," "archive's search bar auto-completed," "waveform birth a map"). Several paraphrase loops: "the keeper understood" immediately followed by exposition of what she understood; "deleted files never disappear—they just wait" echoed by "ensuring the absence would never again be silent." Template cadence appears in the final third: "She walked… she opened… she touched… And if you search…" The climactic beats remain legible but are dulled by stacked modifiers and metaphoric convenience (crystal "melts," memories "flow," name "dims").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate memory-keeping, missing spaceship, and social-media grief commodification offers a specific angle. The patch-as-speaker and server-farm-as-musical-instrument provide fresh tactile detail. However, the core premise—evil corporation stages tragedy for engagement metrics, lone archivist sacrifices self to expose truth—follows a familiar template (whistleblower + digital dystopia) without transforming it through a non-obvious moral calculus or lived occupational friction. The mother reveal and the keeper's literal transformation into broadcast signal risk high-concept gloss over grounded consequence. The recurring 73s and lullaby chord provide ingenuity within the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Keeper is present throughout; her choices (lie to security, touch crystal, sing aloud) create the major turns. Early presence and causal involvement across investigation, bargain, and broadcast phases. The decision at the crystal is pivotal but arrives late and feels partly automated by the biometric trigger.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Patch appears in beat one (taped under desk, speaker flexed), returns causally in beat two (chord run through crawler births map), and reappears transformed in closure (dissolved into skin as brand 7373). Charged reprise with visible cost; the object's unique property (embedded speaker playing mother's lullaby) drives the investigation and final identity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Missing persons cold case (Aurora's two hundred influencers, five years vanished) frames the forbidden folder, the staged crash revelation, and the thawed hashtag trend. The concept shapes every major beat: the auto-complete trigger, the decommissioned server farm, the unsend file, and the worldwide broadcast that resurfaces the case. Essential across setup, investigation, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears once as a label in paragraph three ("brightly attentive for seven years") and echoes in the final paragraphs ("the brightly attentive keeper still counting"). No on-page constraint, tradeoff, or action shaped by this trait; it reads as thematic descriptor rather than embodied attribute that alters a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lie appears once explicitly ("She lied to security, claiming a routine audit") to gain farm access—a brief but necessary turn that enables the investigation. The broader pattern of corporate lies (staged crash, erased manifest) thematically recurs but is not dramatized as the keeper's repeated tactic. One functional beat; swappable with "forged credentials" or similar without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Recurring numbers (73, 737, 7373) appear in hashtag auto-complete, "tattoo her dreams," label Block 73, the final skin brand, the 73-hour posting interval, and the wind's 73 BPM. The method drives investigation (numbers guide her to the farm and block) and charges the closure image. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage; the specificity (73 as mission identifier and mother's biometric signature) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Social network archive is present from the opening line, supplies the forbidden folder and auto-complete trigger, reappears in the crystal's unpacked holograms (passengers' final posts), and persists in the blank user posting chords. The setting provides the investigative resources (abandoned-audio crawler, archive firewall) and frames the thematic stakes (what gets remembered vs. deleted). Strong across setup and payoff; micro-setting (desk, patch taped beneath) adds embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears as a phrase in two places: describing the lullaby's transmission and the final broadcast loop. The timeframe reads more as poetic motif than a constraint that tightens decisions; the five-year gap (Aurora vanished) and the keeper's seven-year tenure are mentioned but do not create visible urgency or alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To find where deleted files go" is explicitly named in the final paragraph and implicitly drives the keeper's investigation of the forbidden folder, the patch chord, and the server farm. The desire is dramatized through the lie to security and the crystal bargain (lose her place to open the file), where want conflicts with job security and self-preservation. Friction with cost is present but compressed into a single late choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sensed absence—ghost squares, blank usernames, comments ending mid-sentence, the "absence felt louder," Block 73's empty rectangular hole, the blank user—pervades the prose and modulates from quiet unease (opening archive scroll) to layered loss (mother's erasure, two hundred missing) to defiant presence (broadcast ensuring absence "never again be silent"). Tone charges the final image and coheres across turns without flattening into single static mood.</comment>
