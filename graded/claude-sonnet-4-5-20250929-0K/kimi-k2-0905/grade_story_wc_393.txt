<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emil's motivation to turn apology into action is clear and embodied through the clockwork heart repair, his pocket-burning warrant, and his final decision to deliver evidence. Internal conflict appears primarily in reflective mode rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the choice to send both music box and evidence feels inevitable rather than torn. Olya functions well as secondary pressure but remains more symbolic craftsperson than fully individuated character. The ending choice forecloses passivity with visible cost (candle fund, his complicity in witnessing), though the weight of standing "beside truth" reads slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost: Emil walks toward the penitentiary having "turned apology into motion, gear by gear," now positioned beside both gurney and truth. The orientation is clean (shop, storm, dawn execution hour) and the causal chain holds—repair enables music, evidence delivery enables investigation, both choices reweight his chaplain role. One meaningful deepening occurs when Emil produces Rowan's scrawl, transforming the repair errand into a justice mission. Cost is legible in the candle fund, his unchanged witness duty, and the "imperfect, courageous beat" that acknowledges limits, though the final image's conceptual repricing could feel more viscerally urgent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The repair shop is rendered with vivid particulars—brass gears' "vibrant hush," stained skylight, glass dome with slow-constellation dust motes, rows of mandolines and serinettes. The walnut-sized clockwork heart and hair-thin replacement spring function as micro-setting that enables the repair choice and charges the closure when "the shop filled with a fragile lullaby, each note a drop of light piercing cloud." Spatial choreography is clean (counter, loupe, glass dome, shelf metronomes, door). The storm exterior brackets the scene purposefully, teaching the light-through-clouds image that Rowan described and Emil repeats, paying off in the silver-dawn slit at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: repair the music box so Rowan can hear it before execution, an apology made action. Pressure tightens when Olya declares "I can give it beat, but I cannot give it mercy; that gear is missing," forcing Emil's hand to produce the evidence list—a meaningful choice that narrows his passive chaplain role into active truth-bearer. The cost is visible: candle fund spent, complicity in witnessing unchanged, and the acknowledgment that "time—though cracked—kept imperfect, courageous beat." One clear reversal (repair possible but insufficient → evidence delivery required) with agency driving the turn, though the execution hour looms mostly as backdrop pressure rather than live ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the clockwork-heart particulars: "contrition without consequence is merely nostalgia," "second opinions are luxuries of the living," and the earned insight that salvation can be "granting the world a second opinion before the final tick." The piece resists tidy moralizing by keeping Emil's witness duty intact despite his actions, and the final image—"time—though cracked—kept imperfect, courageous beat"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the apology-into-action question. Rowan's line about innocence ("light breaks through storm clouds, sudden, unfair") recurs purposefully and charges the dawn-slit closure. Minor slip: "vibrant hush" as phrase appears three times and risks becoming a thematic echo rather than emerging strictly from scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds Emil's POV cleanly with strong perceptual signature—"prayers felt like coins flung into a dark well," the warrant "heavier than any cassock cloth"—and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the repair negotiation, reflective for Rowan's backstory). Olya's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("A pulse can be coaxed, Chaplain, but the song it plays may not forgive you") and subtext. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("aptly deliberate" repeated, "explicates" implied in complex syntax) but remains largely voice-consistent. The phrase "vibrant hush" recurs as both setting descriptor and tonal marker, bordering on authorial intrusion but staying just within the lyric register the piece establishes early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high, but several patterns accumulate: "aptly deliberate" appears twice as descriptor (voice and money), "vibrant hush" three times, and metaphoric density in nearly every line ("coins flung into a dark well," "time recycled, penance mechanical," "drops of light piercing cloud") without taught pattern or payoff for all instances. The phrase "each note a drop of light piercing cloud" beautifully echoes Rowan's earlier storm-light image, earning its figurative weight. Minor template cadence: "He owed… He had offered… He produced…" in adjacent beats. Clarity remains high and no loops obscure causality, but the cumulative figurative load and repeated phrase-markers ("vibrant hush") slightly dull momentum in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of music-box repair, execution vigil, and evidence delivery through a chaplain protagonist offers a specific, non-obvious angle on apology and justice. The clockwork-heart conceit avoids sentimentality by grounding metaphor in literal mechanism (replacement spring from a sailor's chronometer, "time recycled, penance mechanical"). The "second opinions" frame is particular and earns its thematic weight through Olya's and Emil's choices. Minor proximity concern: "vibrant hush" and the extended clockwork-as-mercy metaphor risk ornamental lyricism, and the storm-light image, while purposeful, borders on familiar poetic territory. The piece commits fully to its premise and the ending's "imperfect, courageous beat" reweights the apology question without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Emil's choices create all key turns: he commissions the repair, repeats Rowan's storm-light line (steadying Olya), produces the evidence list, instructs delivery to the journalist, and walks toward the penitentiary having "turned apology into motion." Present throughout, his decisions drive middle escalation and closure participation. Causal pressure is strong; cost is visible (candle fund, unchanged witness duty). Irreplaceable: the chaplain role uniquely positions him to witness, possess the warrant, and hold both sacred and civic authority.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The clockwork heart appears in at least four beats: Emil examines it at counter, Olya peers through loupe and diagnoses it, she repairs it under the glass dome with the chronometer spring, and it ticks to life filling the shop with music. It returns in the closure as the ballerina pirouettes, and the final "imperfect, courageous beat" echoes its mechanism. Causal: the repair enables Rowan's final hearing and crystallizes the mercy/justice gap that forces Emil's evidence decision. Specific properties (cracked spring, hair-thin replacement, ticking pulse) matter throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Second opinions" is named explicitly by Emil's arrival and Olya's line "second opinions are luxuries of the living," then appears in Emil's evidence list ("a map of doubts begging for second opinions") and the closure ("granting the world a second opinion before the final tick"). It shapes stakes by framing the repair errand and the journalist delivery as parallel acts of re-examination. The concept changes Emil's options from passive prayer to active evidence-sharing. Early signal, middle and closure participation present, with moderate causal pressure and clear cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Aptly deliberate" appears twice as descriptor—Olya's "voice aptly deliberate" and Emil's candle-fund money "aptly deliberate"—but functions more as stylistic marker than trait that constrains action. The adverb modifies manner without creating visible tradeoff or limiting a choice under pressure. Present in two beats but ornamental; no on-page cost tied specifically to this attribute. Swappable with "carefully measured" or "purposefully slow" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Deserve" appears in Emil's belief that "contrition deserved another chance, even for metal" and drives his motivation to repair the music box as apology made tangible. It underpins the thematic question but does not itself create a major plot turn; the escalation comes from producing the evidence list, not from the deserve-frame. Present early as motivational seed, charges the closure's "imperfect, courageous beat" image, but middle development is thin—one could replace "deserve" with "require" or "merit" and the plot holds. Lyric-resonance use without strong middle causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rowan's description "by the way light breaks through storm clouds, sudden, unfair, blinding the guilty and the free alike" is quoted by Emil mid-scene and steadies Olya's hand, directly enabling the repair decision. The storm-and-light imagery brackets the piece: rain and lightning at the start, "a slit of silver dawn above the slate rooftops" at closure. The method (light breaking through clouds as metaphor for innocence and second chances) shapes Emil's tactic—he repeats the line aloud as persuasion. Signaled early, used to alter middle choice, charges the ending image. Specific mechanics (the image's unfairness and suddenness) matter thematically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair shop provides the essential resource (Olya's skill, the chronometer spring, tools) and the spatial pressure—rain drumming, lightning forking, metronomes pausing mid-swing—that accompanies the moral negotiation. The glass dome, loupe, and pirouetting ballerina are handled across beats. The shop's threshold allows the music to "spill onto the awakening street" at closure, a micro-setting action that completes the second-opinion theme. Environment constrains Emil's options (he must come here for the repair opinion) and charges the final image when the shop door opens. Present throughout, alters tactics, closure participation clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"In the calm before realization" appears as the opening frame, and the execution "at dawn" provides a distant but live deadline. The storm moves east "leaving a slit of silver dawn," anchoring the time pressure as Emil walks toward the penitentiary. The timeframe tightens decisions moderately—Emil acts tonight because Rowan dies tomorrow—but the urgency is asserted more than tracked beat-by-beat. Early signal, closure participation (dawn arrives), middle beats reference the execution hour. The calm-before-realization phrase does not recur or reweight at the end, limiting its integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Emil's motivation "to turn an apology into action before the execution hour" is stated early and dramatized through two choices: commissioning the repair and delivering the evidence. The friction between wants (offer consolation) and costs (spending candle fund, accepting complicity in witnessing despite new evidence) is visible on the page. His line "prayers felt like coins flung into a dark well" embodies the inadequacy driving the action. The closing beat—"having turned apology into motion, gear by gear"—directly fulfills and reweights the motivation with acknowledgment of limits ("still had to stand beside the gurney"). Desire shapes all key turns with clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" appears three times (opening gears, Olya's response deepening, music spilling onto the street) and establishes a coherent paradoxical tone—urgent quietness—that modulates with pressure. The oxymoron charges the final image when the lullaby insists on salvation through second opinions. Tone fits the repair-shop setting and thematic restraint, but the explicit repetition of the phrase borders on authorial fingerprint rather than organic modulation. Present throughout, purposeful at closure, though one use could be implicit rather than named to avoid decorative recurrence.</comment>
