<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive the plot, but her interiority relies heavily on metaphorical assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The passage "exile taught her that silence could be amplified quiet" reads as wisdom-statement rather than lived tension. The teenage boy and Lita are functional but serve primarily to receive information; their pressures on Mara remain declarative. The final choice to let the bell "ring" silently is present but not earned through prior micro-choices that show competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pebbles collected, the ledger growing, the arbor spiral closing. The closure is Charged Poise—the silent bell vibrates, shutters open, the network holds—with conceptual cost legible in "until the sanctions cracked or the ridge itself remembered how to sing." Orientation anchors arrive by the third paragraph (arbor, valley, midnight). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara decides to "triple the frequency" and places the final pebble. The cost is felt but oblique; the because/therefore linkage between the bell's silent ring and the shutters opening is compressed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor returns across three beats, its cracked dome and incomplete pebble spiral constraining Mara's exodus decision. Midnight, the valley lights, and the ridge anchor time and space early. The cart's false bottom and the rail spur donation site supply tactical resources. Wild sage rising "like unbanned prayer" charges the final image with sensory and conceptual weight, linking setting to theme without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining the network through sanctions—is signaled early and tightens when Lita warns "memories will be rationed too." Mara's agency is visible in the decision to triple frequency and in placing the final pebble, both of which foreclose easier paths. The cost is legible: the cart empties, dawn arrives without guaranteed resupply, and the spiral remains incomplete. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal; one meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—community endurance coded as ordinary exchange—emerges through the pebble covenant, the ledger of children's names, and the silent bell as amplified quiet. The final image of shutters opening and Mara descending offers a non-literal answer: the network persists not through volume but frequency, not through sound but invisible toll. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph; the bell's refusal to ring reweights silence as active resistance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance modulates purposefully between close interior and wider valley perspective. Diction is controlled—"censored stars," "contraband salt," "unbanned prayer"—though several phrases ("gently persistent," "amplified quiet") repeat as labels rather than varying the perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the boy's line about the bell remembering names and Lita's warning about rationed memories advance plot and carry subtext. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the arbor and the final ridge moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift effectively. Information density is high—most lines do double work. However, paraphrase loops appear: "gently persistent through the alleys" in paragraph three is echoed by "the residents' gently persistent way" in paragraph thirteen, and "amplified quiet" recurs without material shift. The phrase "drawn the antique silver bell" appears twice in near-identical constructions. Template cadence in several "She [verb]" openers and the repeated stem "Tonight/Then/There she" across paragraphs create mild sluggishness. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "breathing continued" is vivid, "open mouth that had forgotten speech" is strained. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence (−0.4), and one mixed metaphor (−0.3) totals −0.9, landing the score near 6.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—exile resistance via food distribution and silent signals—engages familiar material but transforms it through the bell-as-map, the pebble covenant, and the ledger of children. The turn to "triple frequency" rather than volume is a fresh tactical inflection. However, "sanctions period," "exile community," and "regime erasure" remain somewhat generic; the specific valley, city, or conflict lacks grounding detail. The final image of the silent bell vibrating air is memorable, but the arbor spiral and the "ridge remembering how to sing" feel slightly allegorical rather than irreducibly particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara appears in setup (paragraph two), drives the cart run (middle), decides to triple frequency (paragraph eighteen), places the final pebble (paragraph nineteen), and lifts the bell at closure (paragraphs twenty-two to twenty-four). Her choices—loading the cart, waiting for the signal, taking pebbles, setting the ledger plan, ascending to the ridge, releasing the wool—create key turns and the closure unit. The final image depends on her decision to let the bell vibrate without striking. Cost is visible: the empty cart, the incomplete spiral, the uncertainty of future crates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bell appears in setup (paragraph two, muffled clapper), recurs at the arbor when shown to the boy (paragraph ten, engraved mountain range), and returns at closure when Mara removes the wool and lets it vibrate (paragraphs twenty-two to twenty-three). Its engraving is "a map home" and its silent ring signals network endurance. The bell's evolving use—from hidden tremor to partial reveal to final silent toll—charges the ending and shapes the thematic question. Removing it would collapse the closure image and the intergenerational signaling mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Anonymous donations appear in setup (paragraph four, unmarked crates "To the Bell"), recur when Lita warns of tightening sanctions (paragraph seventeen), and Mara replies she needs "one more crate, one more anonymous donation" (paragraph twenty). The concept shapes stakes—supply uncertainty pressures the network—and alters tactics (Mara must triple runs before donations dry up). However, the mechanics remain abstract; we do not see a crate arrive or Mara sorting its contents. The cost connection is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" appears as a descriptor in paragraph three ("moved gently persistent through the alleys") and is echoed in paragraph thirteen ("the residents' gently persistent way"). The trait is asserted rather than enacted through contradictory impulses or visible tradeoffs. Mara's persistence enables the midnight run and the pebble collection, but no on-page cost—such as exhaustion forcing a choice or a missed opportunity—is tied to this specific quality. The label recurs without constraining a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Declare" drives two beats: paragraph eleven ("Tonight we start the second ledger—names of the children...") and paragraph twenty-four ("Mara declared nothing this time; the bell's silent ring was the announcement..."). The first declaration sets the intergenerational covenant; the second renounces speech for silent signal, redefining communication under sanctions. The action is not easily swappable—replacing "declare" with "whisper" or "plan" would lose the public, stake-setting force. However, the second use is summary rather than direct speech, softening its impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Midnight food runs appear in setup (paragraph one, "every midnight"), are enacted in the cart sequence (paragraphs three, six, twelve to fourteen), and recur in Mara's response to Lita (paragraph eighteen, "triple the midnight food runs") and at closure (paragraph twenty-four, "intergenerational support had crossed another night" and "through midnight food runs until the sanctions cracked"). The method shapes tactics—frequency over volume, timing for stealth—and its mechanics (cart noise, false bottom, pebble exchange) matter on the page. Removing it would eliminate the causal chain and the thematic question of how endurance scales.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The arbor appears in setup (paragraph one, "terra-cotta arbor on the ridge"), recurs as Mara's waiting point (paragraph seven, "beneath the arbor's cracked dome"), is where Lita keeps the ledger (paragraph sixteen), and Mara places the final pebble there (paragraph nineteen, forming the incomplete spiral). The arbor supplies the pebble spiral—a visual constraint for the exodus decision—and the ledger meeting point. The "open mouth that had forgotten speech" charges the setting at paragraph fifteen, and the final ridge descent begins there. Its elevation and recurring visits pressure Mara's endurance and signal the network's center.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sanctions appear in setup (paragraph one, "under sanctions"), recur when Lita warns they will tighten next week (paragraph seventeen, "rice will triple, then memories will be rationed too"), and frame the closure (paragraph twenty-four, "until the sanctions cracked"). The timeframe tightens decisions—Mara must triple runs before supply vanishes—and shapes the dominant stake. However, the sanctions remain abstract; no on-page moment shows a checkpoint denying passage or a crate failing to arrive. The detained mother (paragraph six) is the sole concrete consequence, and it occurs off-page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Intergenerational support is named in paragraph eleven ("Tonight we start the second ledger—names of the children who will need elders") and at closure (paragraph twenty-four, "intergenerational support had crossed another night"). The motivation is dramatized through Mara's choices: delivering formula to the detained mother's baby (paragraph six), taking pebbles from residents (paragraph thirteen), planning the children's ledger with the boy (paragraph eleven), and telling Lita the network will "weave elders and orphans into a single rope of years" (paragraph twenty). Friction is visible—empty cart, incomplete spiral, uncertain resupply—but the desire itself is never conflicted; Mara's commitment is steady.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone is established in paragraph five ("silence could be amplified quiet, a hush so complete it rang louder than slogans"), modulates through the whispered exchange (paragraph nine), the muffled bell (paragraph two), and the forbidden-candle breathing (paragraph twelve), and charges the closure when the bell vibrates without striking and "amplified quiet...traveled along the valley walls" (paragraph twenty-two). The oxymoron "amplified quiet" is coherent across turns and supports the thematic question: resistance through withholding sound. The tone remains steady rather than shifting with pressure, which is apt for an accumulative design but limits dynamic range.</comment>
