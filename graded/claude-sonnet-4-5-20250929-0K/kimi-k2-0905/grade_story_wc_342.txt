<comment>The protagonist's prosopagnosia is conceptually strong but operates primarily as thematic texture rather than forcing concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to preserve the guild's memory is clear, yet the peak moment—painting the sky—unfolds without visible internal contradiction or competing impulses that would complicate the act. The final realization ("painting her own face after all") arrives as an epiphany rather than being earned through prior on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is present in tactile details (palm against coin, candle flame dancing) but the interiority leans toward abstract insight ("limitation is not failure but filter") that edges into diagnostic self-awareness mid-crisis.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors who (face-blind artist), where (tree-trunk library), and when (pre-demolition) within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (coin indentations, fractal brushstrokes, guild history) and the closure reconfigures the premise—her limitation becomes the means of preservation—with conceptual cost (she walks out carrying nothing, the sky remains unseen by her). One meaningful tightening occurs when the first explosion forces her to work faster, narrowing options. The closure image (painted sky glowing as she leaves) offers Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, though the cost is more conceptual (accepting unknowing) than visceral sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The tree-trunk library constrains her final act—curved walls guide the brushstrokes, root vibrations alter her pace—and the coin's indentations directly shape the painting's mechanics (notch distances translate to millimeters, depth determines saturation). The knothole window, candle flame, and hollowed book safe all return with functional weight. The library's imminent demolition charges the final image; without this specific setting's erasure, the act loses urgency. Micro-setting (coin, brush, wall texture) drives the craft action at every beat.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserving the guild's sky-memory before demolition—is clear from the first paragraph. Pressure tightens when the siren countdown begins and the first explosion forces faster work, narrowing her window. The cost is legible: she leaves behind her creation, unseen by her own eyes, accepting that memory outlasts recognition. However, the escalation is more temporal (external countdown) than driven by protagonist agency or internal trade-offs; she executes her plan without meaningful obstacles or renunciations that would deepen the pressure further.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges from particulars: face-blindness as filter, negative space as identity, the guild's choice of "those who could see beyond seeing." The coin's indentations and the painted sky function as non-literal answers to the question of how limitation enables memory. The final image—sky glowing inside walls—resonates without stating a moral. Minor slip: "limitation is not failure but filter" and "wisdom begins with admitting what we cannot know" edge toward thesis articulation rather than letting the scene carry the weight. The piece resists tidy resolution; her inability to see the whole yet knowing it exists lands as earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Single-POV control is stable; perceptual signature (tactile focus, fractally precise observation) reflects the protagonist's condition. Distance and focalization remain consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register not fully anchored to her interior voice: "identity exists beyond recognition," "possibility hasn't yet collapsed into night," "wisdom begins with admitting what we cannot know" read more essayistic than character-bound thought under pressure. The piece teaches a heightened, lyric cadence early and sustains it, so the register is defensible as intentional voice design, but some lines feel less lived-in than observed from above.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Information density is high; sentences layer setting, action, and interiority effectively. Rhythm varies and propulsion is maintained through the countdown. However, template cadence appears in several beats: "She understands now…" / "She knows suddenly…" / "She realizes…" creates a repetitive revelation pattern. Paraphrase loop: "the sky she has never seen clearly" and "her vision always fragmented" restate the same idea within one paragraph. Mixed metaphor: "sky-shaped absence that holds them together" strains coherence when absence is given weight and agency. Filter-verb stack in reflective passages ("understands," "knows," "realizes") dulls immediacy during high-pressure beats. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce line-level tightness, triggering a −0.8 deduction in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia, fractal precision, and guild preservation offers a specific angle; the protagonist's condition becomes the qualification rather than obstacle. The transformation of limitation into method feels earned in hindsight. The tree-trunk library and coin-as-braille are fresh particulars. However, the "hidden knowledge preserved by the outcast" premise echoes familiar templates; the piece elevates it through tactile specificity (indentations, pigment mixing, root vibrations) and the negative-space painting concept. Risk-taking in voice (heightened, lyric compression) supports stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The face-blind portrait artist is present throughout and her condition motivates the craft action (painting negative space, relying on indentations). She makes the key decision to paint the sky rather than faces and executes the work under pressure. However, the choice itself is not contested on the page; no competing option or internal conflict complicates the act. Setup: clear from opening. Development: her blindness shapes the method (fractal brushwork, negative space). Payoff: she completes the painting and leaves. Two beats, minimal causal pressure, moderate closure linkage. Band 6.0–6.9; lack of on-page trade-off or competing impulse keeps it mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The secret book safe appears twice: discovery (holding coin and note) and return (she places the coin back after painting). The note provides motive ("craft what must be remembered") and the safe anchors the guild's legacy. However, the safe itself does not constrain a choice or evolve in use; it functions as storage, not pressure. Setup: paragraph five. Development: motive delivered via note. Payoff: coin returned, "original and painted, both true" offers symbolic closure. Two beats, functional but largely ornamental. Lyric reprise adds thematic weight but not causal necessity. Band 5.5–6.3; scored 5.8 for the charged return image without middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Discovering limits drives the entire arc: her prosopagnosia is reframed from disability to filter, enabling her to paint what others overlook (negative space, sky without faces). The concept shapes her method (fractal precision as compensation, reliance on tactile indentations) and charges the ending (accepting that she cannot see her own work yet knows it exists). Setup: paragraph three. Development: constrains her approach throughout. Payoff: "understanding finally that the guild's greatest knowledge was never in books but in choosing those who could see beyond seeing" articulates the conceptual repricing. Strong causal pressure, clear closure linkage, core to stakes. Band 7.0–8.4; slightly essayistic articulation in final beats prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Fractally precise appears as label and method: "fractally precise strokes," "each eyelash rendered in mathematical succession," "fractal patterns—each branch of sky dividing into smaller branches of light." The trait enables her technique and reflects her compensatory rigor. However, the fractality is described rather than dramatized with visible trade-off (e.g., time cost, physical strain, choice to prioritize precision over coverage). Setup: paragraph three. Development: method throughout painting. Payoff: "fractally precise map of human limitation" in closing line. Two beats, moderate specificity, no on-page cost tied directly to the trait. Band 5.0–6.9; scored 5.4 for label-heavy use without enacted friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Craft is the central action: she mixes pigments, translates coin measurements to brushstrokes, paints the sky while demolition approaches, and embeds braille stars. All major turns trace to this work—discovery of the coin's purpose, decision to paint negative space, final act of preservation. Removing craft would collapse the story. Setup: opening gesture (palm against coin foreshadows). Development: entire middle (painting mechanics, pigment mixing, fractal strokes). Payoff: completed sky glows as she walks out. Three beats, strong causal pressure, indispensable to closure. Band 7.0–8.4; scored 7.9 for thoroughgoing integration and clear irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The coin's faint indentations guide the painting: notch distances determine millimeters of sky, depth sets saturation, constellation pattern (Orion reversed) sparks the negative-space insight, and she presses the coin into wet paint to create braille stars. The method is signaled early (paragraph one, tactile focus) and shapes multiple beats. Setup: opening line. Development: measurements translate to brushstrokes, pattern revelation, braille transfer. Payoff: coin returned to safe, "indentations now doubled." Three beats, clear causal pressure, high specificity. Band 7.0–8.4; scored 6.7 because the mechanics, while present, are told more than enacted with visible friction or trial.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The tree-trunk library supplies the canvas (curved inner wall), constrains her method (living wood, root vibrations alter her pace), and anchors the stakes (guild sanctuary erasure). The knothole window provides her color reference (dying sun), and the library's imminent demolition tightens the clock. Removing this setting would break the logic of why she paints, where, and how. Setup: paragraph two. Development: vibrations force faster work, curved wall guides brushstrokes. Payoff: "tree-trunk library holds its breath one last time" as she exits. Three beats, strong causal pressure, indispensable. Band 7.0–8.4; scored 7.6 for clear necessity and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The timeframe (hush before demolition) frames urgency and tightens choices. The siren countdown and first explosion force faster painting. However, the clock is declared more than tracked; we do not see her lose coverage, make trade-offs (detail vs. speed), or sacrifice sections due to time pressure. Setup: opening and title phrase. Development: siren wails, explosion begins. Payoff: she completes and leaves before full demolition. Two beats, moderate pressure, but the time constraint does not visibly alter her tactics on the page (she finishes as intended). Band 5.0–6.9; scored 6.4 for functional urgency without enacted cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The motivation to mirror the sky inside walls drives the entire sequence: she interprets the guild's note, decides to paint negative space, and executes the work as preservation act. The desire is dramatized through tactile preparation (pigment mixing, coin measurements) and physical action under pressure. However, the motivation is not conflicted—no competing want (escape, self-preservation, doubt about the guild's worthiness) complicates her commitment. Setup: paragraph four. Development: sustained through painting. Payoff: walks out without looking back, accepting the unseen result. Two beats, clear causal role, but lack of friction between want and fear or cost keeps it mid-range. Band 6.0–6.9; scored 6.9 for strong dramatization without internal contest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Heightened stillness is established early ("hush just before," "holds their breath," "that heightened stillness where possibility hasn't yet collapsed") and modulates with pressure: contemplative opening, urgency when the siren wails, quiet resolve at exit. The tone charges the final image ("her painted sky glowing softly in the candle's final flicker") and supports the theme of limitation as filter. Setup: opening line. Development: sustained through reflective beats, shifts under countdown. Payoff: calm departure despite demolition. Coherent across turns, charges closure. Band 7.0–8.4; scored 7.4 for consistent modulation and thematic fit.</comment>
