<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ferry guides remain largely external and interchangeable, with minimal individuated interiority beyond role descriptors. Marta and Jun's actions—approaching, speaking, stamping—serve allegorical function rather than embodied choice under pressure. The hound's "crisis" is asserted through summary ("having discovered that the courage she'd sought outside herself had been within all along") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Emotional states are labeled ("mournful howl," "desperate searching") without contradictory embodiment or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are deliberately veiled—the "shoreline," "ridgeway," and "crossing between worlds" remain atmospheric rather than grounded—past the ~120-word threshold without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure; apply −0.4. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the hound chooses her role), but the cost is told ("no longer bound by leash but by choice") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or trade-off. The causal engine is weak: the guides walk, find the hound at a cliff "that shouldn't exist," stamp her, and balance restores via assertion rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "veiled ridgeway," "twilight mist," and "shoreline" establish a liminal atmosphere, and the ticket punch appears in multiple beats. However, spatial choreography remains vague—the cliff's appearance and the guides' path lack concrete grounding—and sensory detail defaults to stock twilight imagery (amber lanterns, dew, mist). The ticket punch's star stamp charges the final turn when pressed to the hound's forehead, offering micro-setting constraint that elevates the score above ornamental description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the guardian to balance the crossing—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: the guides walk, hear a howl, find the hound, and resolve the problem in a single gesture (the star stamp). No live options are foreclosed on the page, and the hound's internal shift ("courage she'd sought outside herself had been within all along") is summary rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. The "indirect routes" complicate the journey but do not force a trade-off or meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme—unused courage requiring recognition rather than external seeking—emerges through the hound's arc and the recurring ticket-punch motif. However, the final paragraph risks thematic echo ("understanding that courage unused simply waits for recognition") by articulating the premise in prompt-like language. The star-stamp gesture offers a resonant, non-literal answer when it marks the hound "not as property but as partner," though the effect is somewhat diluted by the explanatory framing that follows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The third-person limited narration maintains stable distance and employs a consistent lyric register ("shoreline lullaby quality," "breath on cold glass"). Voice texture is purposeful, with elevated diction and rhythmic parallelism that support the twilight tone. However, the prose occasionally drifts into exposition that explains rather than trusts image ("understanding that the hound's crisis mirrored that of many travelers she'd comforted"), and dialogue carries minimal subtext—characters articulate theme rather than pursue goals obliquely.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Patterned phrasing recurs across beats: "gently persistent," "shoreline lullaby," "ticket punch with star stamp," "veiled ridgeway," and "vigil in twilight" appear as near-repetitive stems rather than charged reprises. Several lines loop conceptually (e.g., "courage unused" restated across paragraphs 7, 19, 24) without added pressure. Template cadence in mid-section paragraphs ("They walked," "They found her," "Jun stepped forward") flattens momentum. Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained ("paw prints that appeared and vanished like breath on cold glass"). Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The guardian-dog/leash/courage-within premise tracks a familiar allegory of self-discovery without a sharp particularizing turn. The ticket-punch-as-blessing gesture and the liminal ferry-guide frame combine generic fantasy elements (souls crossing, guides with lanterns, a mythic hound) without transforming them through world logic or non-obvious stakes. The "indirect routes" and "veiled ridgeway" remain atmospheric rather than mechanically specific. Emotional truth is present in the hound's loneliness, but the resolution feels inevitable from setup without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The wise ferry guides frame the narrative and execute the final turn (Jun stamps the hound), but their decisions are modest—they walk, listen, approach, and perform the ritual. Early presence and closure participation meet two gates, but causal pressure is low: the guides observe and facilitate rather than make high-cost choices that narrow options. Swappable with "wise shamans" or "psychopomps" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ticket punch appears early (paragraph 3), is mentioned in beats throughout (paragraphs 6, 11, 17, 22), and delivers the climactic action when Jun stamps the hound's forehead (paragraph 17). The star stamp's meaning shifts from "permission to traverse" to partnership blessing, offering a charged reprise. However, the punch's mechanics are asserted rather than constrained by prior rules, and its resolution feels convenient rather than costly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Vigil in twilight" is named early (paragraphs 1, 5) and recurs as a frame (paragraphs 20, 24), shaping the timeframe and tone. The vigil provides context for the guides' task but does not constrain tactics or force a choice—removing "vigil" and substituting "watch" or "patrol" would not break story logic. It functions as atmospheric setting rather than a stake-shaping concept with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is attributed to the guides (paragraph 4) and Jun (paragraph 14), framing their approach to the hound. The trait enables Marta's "shoreline lullaby tone" (paragraph 16) and Jun's navigation of "fractured landscape" (paragraph 14), but these are told qualities rather than choices with visible trade-offs. The trait could be swapped for "patient" or "calm" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Traverse" governs the ferry guides' mission (souls crossing waters, paragraph 4) and the night's journey through "indirect routes" (paragraph 13). The action is present in setup and development (paragraphs 4, 9, 10, 13, 20) and implicit at closure when the hound returns to the crossing. However, the traversal itself is atmospheric rather than mechanically costly—no obstacle forces a sacrifice tied specifically to crossing. Functional but mid-replaceable with "journey" or "passage."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is signaled early (paragraph 8) and described in the middle journey (paragraphs 13, 14: "paths that seemed to exist in multiple directions simultaneously"). The method shapes the search but does not constrain a choice—the guides navigate without visible cost or fork, and the "indirect" quality is atmospheric rather than mechanical. Present in two beats but swappable with "winding paths" or "hidden trails."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "veiled ridgeway" appears early (paragraphs 1, 9) and becomes "fractured landscape" (paragraph 14) during the journey, then "shift[s] back into focus" at closure (paragraph 18). The setting's instability provides mild pressure (the land "lost after the leash broke"), and the cliff at paragraph 15 stages the confrontation. However, spatial mechanics remain vague—no specific ridgeway feature alters a tactic or choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" (paragraph 2) sets the inciting event three days prior, creating the task that drives tonight's vigil. The timeframe anchors urgency (the crossing is "unprotected," paragraph 5) and provides setup and development. However, elapsed time within the vigil is unmarked, and no ticking clock forces a trade-off. Present in setup and implicit at closure (the hound returns, restoring balance), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits" is voiced in paragraph 3 and drives the hound's arc (paragraphs 12, 16, 17: "having discovered that the courage she'd sought outside herself had been within all along"). The motivation is present in setup, development, and closure, shaping the guides' interpretation and the hound's shift. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—the hound is discovered in a state of realization rather than choosing between competing goods. Causal role in ending but modest friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" is established early (paragraph 4: "shoreline lullaby quality") and recurs at key beats (paragraphs 7, 16, 23: "a shoreline lullaby calling souls home"). The tone is coherent and modulates from calm framing to mournful middle (paragraph 12) to welcoming closure (paragraph 23), charging the final image when the hound's howl transforms. The lullaby quality constrains the guides' approach (soft coaxing rather than command) and supports the twilight atmosphere, though it remains largely atmospheric rather than forcing a tactical choice.</comment>
