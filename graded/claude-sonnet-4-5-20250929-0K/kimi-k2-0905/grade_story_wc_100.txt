<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The undertaker's motivation is signaled early (refusing prior summons, feeling an unpaid debt), and his final choice to remain as keeper feels thematically coherent. However, interiority relies heavily on stock metaphor ("tugged at him like an unpaid debt") and the emotional arc telescopes from refusal to acceptance without on-page struggle—his "inadvertently stubborn" trait is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The shift from weary refusal to tenure acceptance lacks embodied resistance or visible cost that would foreclose a path; he sees his name and accepts in one beat without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure unit—undertaker becomes keeper, sends signals skyward—is present and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with a visible cost: he is tethered, occupies the desk, his parlor stands empty). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through underwater library imagery and the final column of stillness reweights the premise. However, causality between beats is loose (dream → travel → descent → lens repair) with ellipses that feel convenience-driven rather than motivated. The octopus catalog wrapping his ankle and his acceptance occur within a single paragraph without dramatized resistance, weakening the felt cost at closure. Mid-story beat linkage is outline-like ("he followed," "he located," "he understood"), and the lens shift from causal setup to lyric accumulation at the end is not taught early enough to feel seamless.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail (barnacled marble boulevards, swollen volumes, brass octopus catalog with moon-phase dials, coral circulation desk). Sensory selection is strong and POV-filtered through the undertaker's mortuary lens (glass "fogged like the eyes of the many dead," shelves "aligned like processional candles"). The setting constrains the protagonist's choice—he must use the lens shard to navigate, tear pages to amplify the signal, and the octopus physically tethers him, forcing tenure. Spatial choreography is mostly coherent, though the mechanics of "underwater conflagration" and breathing/movement logistics are left vague, reducing plausibility slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (revitalizing the distress signal to release accumulated souls) is signaled by the midpoint and drives the final act. One meaningful tightening occurs: the lens remains fractured after insertion, forcing the undertaker to improvise with the paper-boat ritual. However, escalation is thin—no on-page resistance complicates his descent or repair, and the octopus's tethering feels like a consequence rather than a choice under pressure. The cost (permanent tenure, tethered ankle, empty parlor) is legible but arrives as acceptance rather than a dramatized trade-off that forecloses a live option. Agency is passive: he is summoned, he follows, he accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—rest as an active, addressable need; the living's fear of drowning in unfinished stories—emerges organically from the library's function and the undertaker's vocation without overt statement. The lens shard, paper boats of names, and final column of stillness operate as purposeful motifs that reweight prior material. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: rest has a permanent address reachable through descent, and the keeper's role redefines care from burial to beacon. However, "occupying impossible spaces between caretaker and cared-for" edges toward explicit theme statement, and the final paragraph's "a beacon that burns backward into the hearts of those still afraid" risks sermonizing. The conceptual cost is clear (perpetual service), and the piece resists tidy moral resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (tight third) and the narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register with rhythmic control ("a morse of moonlit bubbles," "chased stillness," "bruised glimmers"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the undertaker filters the library through mortuary idiom (souls as "overdue fines," catalog entries for the dead). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism that feels authored rather than character-bound ("occupying impossible spaces," "interval between heartbeats when the dearly departed almost speak"). No dialogue is present, so no dialogue-specific issues. The prose remains legible and purposeful throughout, with free indirect style cleanly managed, though peak compression at closure ("chased stillness") is taught too late to feel fully earned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (lens as ticket, library dome cracked like skull, fire translating grief into light). Information density is high; most lines advance setting, stakes, or character. However, several beats exhibit scaffold artifacts: "inadvertently stubborn" appears twice verbatim as a label, "occupying impossible spaces" recurs as template phrasing without evolving meaning, and "distress signals" is repeated across paragraphs in summary rather than fresh action. The final third sustains metaphor density without pattern-teaching, creating mild overwriting (−0.4 for figurative saturation in peak beats). Stock metaphors like "tugged at him like an unpaid debt" and "books breathing underwater" reduce specificity. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks, but cumulative text-pattern issues and filter-verb stacks ("he saw," "he felt," "he understood") dull immediacy in key moves.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core synthesis—underwater library as repository for unmoored souls, undertaker as lighthouse keeper—feels specific and non-obvious, with the lens shard functioning as both literal beacon and metaphorical connection. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through with purposeful detail (paper boats of names, cold-burning fire of memory, octopus catalog). However, the "weary professional summoned to supernatural duty" frame is recognizable, and the emotional arc (refusal → acceptance of eternal role) follows a template path without fresh friction. The undertaker's mortuary lens adds specificity, and the inversion (distress signals sent not for rescue but as reminder) offers a twist, but the piece does not transform familiar elements enough to feel indispensable. Risk-taking in lyric density and concept is present but does not fully compensate for derivative structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The undertaker is present throughout and his choices shape the ending (travel, descent, lens repair, paper-boat ritual, acceptance of tenure). However, most moves are reactive or convenience-driven rather than internally conflicted decisions that alter tactics: he "followed," "located," "understood," "pressed," "tore," "positioned." The final acceptance (seeing his name, taking the desk) feels passive—no on-page resistance or trade-off is dramatized. The character enables the plot but does not drive key turns through contradictory impulses or costly choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lens shard appears in four distinct beats: arrival (inciting), dream (pulling him), navigation (glowing hotter in the library), and repair (inserted, amplified by fire, sealing cracks). Its specific properties (fractured glass, maternal click of bezel, phosphorescent scars) matter causally and charge the final image (column of stillness, ongoing beacon). The element shapes tactics (he must amplify it with paper boats) and participates directly in closure (the lens demands a keeper). Swapping it for another object would break the lighthouse/distress-signal logic. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Distress signals appear as the inciting concept (note's summons), the library's broken function (projecting signals to summon the living), the undertaker's solution (sending signals skyward via the repaired lens), and the final image (sailors see the column, souls check out). The concept shapes the dominant stake (revitalize the beam to release souls) and redefines closure (signals remind the living of rest's address, not rescue). It is woven through beats and charges the ending. However, mid-story it is more thematic than tactical—no choice is complicated by the signal's mechanics. Still, setup, development, and payoff are all present, and the element is indispensable to the premise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is named twice verbatim as a label but never dramatized through on-page contradiction or cost. We are told he "refused every prior summons" and is "inadvertently stubborn" again at closure, yet the actual refusal occurs off-page and his acceptance of tenure is immediate without visible resistance. The trait does not constrain a beat or enable a choice with a trade-off; it functions as character decoration rather than a driver of action. Late ornamental mentions do not integrate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Revitalize" is the central action: the note commands it, the undertaker's entire journey aims toward it, the improvised paper-boat fire achieves it, and the lens's revival triggers the closure (souls released, keeper installed). The action is irreplaceable—swapping "revitalize" for a generic "repair" would flatten the thematic charge (life returned to the signal, memory fueling light). The action shapes tactics (he must find amplification when the shard alone fails) and the ending hinges on its success. Setup, development, and payoff are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is named three times as a phrase (in the descent, at the catalog, and at the final desk) but its mechanics are never explained or demonstrated on the page. It reads as thematic flourish rather than a method that shapes attempts or choices. The undertaker's navigation is linear (ladder → ocean floor → library → desk); no beat requires him to occupy or traverse "impossible spaces" in a way that alters his tactics. The phrase is present but replaceable with "entering" or "reaching" without structural loss. Late ornamental use caps integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library is introduced early (ocean floor, boulevards of barnacled marble, swollen volumes, brass octopus catalog, coral desk) and supplies resources that shape the ending: the catalog navigates him to the book, the book's salt pages become the amplification material, and the circulation desk becomes his permanent post. The setting constrains choice (he cannot leave once tethered) and charges the final image (column rising from the depths, keeper tending the glow). The library's specific features (moon-phase dials, "Perpetual Repose, Volume Infinity") are indispensable to the logic. Setup, development, and payoff are all present with visible causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Time begins clearly ("That night he dreamed," "He traveled," "At the ocean floor") and the sequence is linear: package arrival → dream → travel → descent → repair → acceptance. However, elapsed time is vague (no sense of hours, urgency, or deadline), and the timeframe does not tighten decisions—he could have taken days or minutes without altering the plot. The element is functional (post-package causality holds) but does not create pressure or shape tactics. It meets the setup gate and holds through closure, but lacks tactical impact for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to "give rest a permanent address" is implicit in the undertaker's vocation (he has dressed the dead, tended graves) and made explicit in the note's summons and his final role (circulation desk, filing returned souls, sending signals). The motivation shapes his journey and the ending's meaning (rest now has a keeper and a beacon). However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction—he accepts the call and the tenure without on-page struggle between wants and costs. The motivation is present across beats and charges closure, but lacks embodied conflict for higher integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" is named twice (as the column rising and the sailors' experience) and the tone throughout balances lyric density with quietude: hushed interiority, slow underwater movement, "interval between heartbeats," library "aching for checkout." The tone modulates subtly (weary refusal → dream pull → underwater discovery → ritualized repair → calm tenure) without breaking coherence. The final image (column calming waves, complete hush) crystallizes the tone with purpose. However, "chased stillness" as a phrase is more metaphor than tonal instruction—it appears late and is not taught early enough to guide reader expectation. The piece's actual tone is sustained lyric solemnity, which the phrase names but does not uniquely enable.</comment>
