<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation around guilt is palpable and embodied through the tattoo work and amber handling. However, the time-fold scene lacks clear psychological throughline—her decision to "reach for the baby" feels more symbolic than causally earned by prior contradiction. The firmware's effect on her interiority is told more than shown acting on micro-choices. Internal conflict exists but doesn't drive enough on-page friction to enter the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara witnesses rather than silences, the cry continues, and she picks up a fresh needle—renunciation of erasure with visible cost (the discomfort persists). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery (amber, firmware, Pleiades, letters) accumulates pressure and the final cadence shift ("wings were singing," breath syncing) reweights the guilt-stake. Orientation is clear by ~100 words (lab, Elara, constellation tattoos). One meaningful deepening occurs in the time-fold return to the crib. Cost is legible in the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lab setting (wax cylinders, rusted speakers, firmware slot, clock) constrains Elara's method and charges the final image when the lab's "new rhythm" syncs with her breath. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: hum, hiss, amber warmth, wings twitching. The amber functions as micro-setting, recurring with evolving meaning (trapped mosquito → cracked → singing wings). The Pleiades tattoo recurs purposefully. However, spatial choreography during the time-fold scene is abstract—exact positions and distances blur slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (silencing guilt) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: Elara writes the memory, feeds it to the machine, the amber cracks, and the voice rebukes her—tightening options from erasure to witness. Agency is present in her final choice to reach for the baby and continue tattooing. Cost is visible: the cry doesn't stop, and she must endure rather than erase. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres. No multiple reversals required at this length; the single turn is sufficient but not intensely narrow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (guilt as ledger, witness over silence) emerges organically from concrete action: feeding the paper, amber cracking, mosquito crawling, reaching for the baby. The final image—"wings were singing," "quiet between heartbeats"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The Pleiades and amber recur with shifting meaning, charging the closure. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing wrist to fracture, syncing breath). Minor slip: "the only way to hush the dissonance was to pay it—not with silence, but with witness" edges toward direct statement but is anchored in the ledger metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices constellations, scars, firmware static, amber warmth. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("meteor burning itself out," "ledger," "dissonance"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during tactile moments, slightly distant during lyric passages). Minor register drift: "firmware roots burrowing deeper into the cracks of her mind" and "cognitive smoothness" terms edge toward over-articulation for peak stress. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue on page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Information density is high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The firmware was haunted. It didn't just replay the past; it *tethered* to it" repeats the same idea; "The machine didn't silence guilt—it *fed* on it" is near-synonym churn of prior lines. Template cadence in opening: "She pressed… She'd found… She'd read…" runs three consecutive "She [past verb]" stems. Mixed metaphor: "pulling threads of guilt through the years like fishing line through water" (threads/fishing line vehicle clash). These artifacts lower the score but do not obscure closure. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for metaphor muddle = −0.9 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooist, haunted firmware, amber fossil, and guilt-as-ledger feels specific and non-obvious. The turn from erasure to witness is earned in hindsight. Emotional truth (guilt requires witness, not silence) avoids platitude through concrete particulars (baby's cry, mosquito's singing wings). However, the "machine that records lost sounds and haunts its user" premise echoes familiar SFF templates; transformation comes from the tattooist angle and the ledger metaphor. Risk-taking in structure (lyric density, time fold) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's identity as constellation tattooist is signaled early (forearm map, needles for grieving mothers) and returns in the final beat ("picked up a fresh needle. There were more stars to ink"). She presses her tattooed wrist to the amber fracture—a choice that attempts guidance. The tattoo work frames her skill at marking grief but does not drive the middle turn (machine rejection). Two beats with purposeful reprise and one choice constrained by the role. Fits 5.0–6.9 band; causal pressure is moderate. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, moderate causality +0.7, specificity +0.4 = baseline ~3.0 + 3.4 = 6.4; swappability (another artisan role could work) −0.2 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amber appears in beat 1 (pressed to palm, trapped mosquito poised), beat 2 (warmed in grip, "insects in resin could survive millennia"), beat 3 (cracked when machine rejects), beat 4 (glowed, mosquito crawled out), and closure (whole again, wings singing). Drives the key turn: amber cracks = machine's rejection. Charged final image: wings singing signals transformation. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7 = baseline 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4; cost connection +0.3 = 8.7; minor ornamental description in beat 1 −0.2 = 8.5; round to nearest tenth per instructions but rounding rule says "always round down," so 8.5 → 8.5 (no rounding needed). Wait, instructions say "always round down to the nearest 0.1"—8.5 is already at 0.1 precision. But let me recalculate: 3.0 + 5.4 + 0.3 - 0.2 = 8.5; this is already at tenth, but the "round down" rule means if I had 8.54 I'd go to 8.5. Here I calculated 8.5, so it stands. Actually, let me re-examine: baseline 3.0, early +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.3 = 3.0+5.4 = 8.4; then cost +0.3 = 8.7; ornamental −0.2 = 8.5; but I may have double-counted. Let me recount beats: 1) pressed palm (functional), 2) warmed grip + metaphor (functional), 3) cracked (turn), 4) mosquito crawls out (turn consequence), 5) whole again + singing (closure). That's five distinct beats. Four beats +1.4 is conservative; five beats would be +1.4 (capped guidance). Recalc: 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.4 + 1.2 + 1.5 + 0.7 + 0.3 = 8.7; ornamental −0.2 = 8.5; but guidance says closure linkage +0.7 to +1.8, I gave +1.5 (high); causal pressure +0.5 to +1.6, I gave +1.2 (high). Total additive = 5.7, minus 0.2 = 5.5, baseline 3.0 → 8.5. But the guidance also says "≥8.5 typically shows strong causal pressure and closure linkage and high irreplaceability, with a felt cost"—amber meets all. However, "indispensable" (8.5–10.0) means "story logic or final image would fail without this exact element." The amber's transformation (wings singing) is load-bearing for closure. I'll score 7.8: strong integration across many beats and closure, but not fully indispensable (another object could theoretically carry similar weight). Recalc: 3.0 + 0.6 (early) + 1.4 (beats) + 1.0 (causal) + 1.2 (closure) + 0.6 (specificity) + 0.3 (cost) − 0.3 (some ornamental description) = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is mentioned early ("firmware in her ears hissed," "firmware was haunted," "firmware's slot"). It shapes the method: Elara feeds the paper to the firmware, and it responds (groans, exhales, then rebukes). The firmware's "roots burrowing deeper" and final "static softened into something like rain" appear at closure. Two gates: setup (early), payoff (closure image). Missing middle gate: firmware does not constrain a middle choice; Elara's decision to use it is not shown as difficult. The firmware is more atmospheric mechanism than active constraint. Early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.5 (moderate), specificity +0.4 = 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3; missing middle gate (cap 4.6 per instructions, but two-of-three gates met so eligible to ~6.0); swappability (another haunted device) −0.4, summary-only at key turn −0.4 = 6.3 − 0.8 = 5.5; round down → 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Translates baby cries" is mentioned early ("firmware in her ears hissed, translating the cries of infants long dead into static") and recurs at closure ("firmware's static softened into something like rain"). However, the trait does not constrain an on-page choice—Elara does not use the translation to make a tactical decision. It adds thematic color (guilt around ignored cries) but remains label-only. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; missing middle. Early +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, thematic reinforcement +0.3 = 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5; missing middle cap 4.6; label-only trait −0.3, no visible tradeoff −0.4 = 4.5 − 0.7 = 3.8; but closure linkage is stronger than I first credited (firmware's translation softening is part of the resolution image) so +0.4 → 4.2; actually, let me reconsider: the trait is mentioned but not used in action. The firmware translates cries into static, which Elara hears, but she doesn't parse or act on specific translations. The trait is thematic setup and closure accent, not a tactical tool. I'll score 4.8: functional setup and closure, but replaceable and not causally active. 3.0 + 0.5 (early) + 0.9 (two beats: opening, closure) + 0.5 (closure linkage, modest) = 4.9; −0.1 for label-only = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tether" appears in the exposition ("it *tethered* to it, pulling threads of guilt through the years") and again when the voice rebukes Elara ("You don't get to erase what you owe"). The action of tethering (firmware binding her to past guilt) drives the story's central problem and the turn (machine rejects erasure). However, the word "tether" itself is used metaphorically and the physical/mechanical act is not dramatized—Elara does not struggle against a literal tether. The concept drives stakes; the specific verb is somewhat swappable ("bind," "chain"). Early +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.7, specificity +0.3 = 3.0 + 3.4 = 6.4; swappability −0.3, summary-only (not shown as physical struggle) −0.3 = 6.4 − 0.6 = 5.8; but the tether concept is load-bearing for the turn, so +0.4 → 6.2; actually, re-reading: "tethered to it, pulling threads of guilt" is the mechanism that creates pressure, and the machine's refusal to untether drives the climax. I'll score 6.7: essential concept, but the specific word/action is not irreplaceable. 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 1.1 + 0.8 + 0.4 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Letters found in mahogany desk from estate sale are introduced early ("She'd found them tucked inside a mahogany desk bought at an estate sale"). They explain the lab's origin and method ("if you wrote the sound you wanted to silence and fed it to the machine"). Elara uses the method: she writes the cry on a page and feeds it to the firmware. Three gates met: setup (early), development (drives her attempt), payoff (the method fails, leading to the turn). However, the letters themselves vanish after setup; the desk and estate-sale detail are ornamental. The *method* (write + feed) is used, but the *means* element as stated includes "found in antique furniture," which is setup-only color. Early +0.5, two beats (mention, use) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, specificity (estate sale, mahogany) +0.3 = 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5; estate-sale detail is ornamental −0.4 = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Laboratory of lost sounds is introduced immediately ("The laboratory hummed like a dying star, its walls lined with wax cylinders and rusted speakers"). The lab's tools (firmware slot, speakers, clock) enable and constrain Elara's actions: she feeds the paper to the slot, the speakers respond, the clock hands spin backward. The lab's "new rhythm" at closure ("the lab's new rhythm: not the hush of an ending, but the quiet between heartbeats") charges the final image. Setting shapes method and final meaning. Early +0.7, three beats (opening, middle use, closure) +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6 = 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2; but "laboratory of lost sounds" as concept is somewhat generic (another archive or recording studio could substitute with edits) −0.5 = 7.7; however, the lab's specific tools (firmware, wax cylinders, clock) are integrated, so I'll score 7.3 as strong but not fully indispensable. Recalc: 3.0 + 0.7 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 1.2 + 0.5 = 7.8; swappability −0.5 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"When time folds in on itself" is dramatized in the middle beat: "The lab's clock hands spun backward... Time folded. She was kneeling beside a crib again." The time-fold enables Elara's return to the pivotal night, which is central to closure. However, the timeframe element is used once (middle scene) and the mechanics are vague—no clear constraint or cost is tied to the folding. The fold is a transition device, not a persistent pressure. Early signal (implied by "time" metaphors) +0.3, one beat (middle fold) +0.4, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.7 (the return shapes the ending), specificity +0.3 = 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3; vague mechanics −0.3, one-time use −0.2 = 4.8; but the fold is necessary for the closure's emotional turn, so +0.5 → 5.3; wait, let me re-examine: the time fold is the mechanism that allows witness (closure's core). That's strong causal work. I'll score 6.0: setup implied, one key beat, payoff shapes closure, but mechanics remain abstract. 3.0 + 0.4 (early implied) + 0.4 (one beat) + 0.8 (causal) + 1.0 (closure linkage) + 0.4 (specificity) = 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To hush the dissonance of old guilt" is the explicit motivation stated in the text and dramatized throughout. Elara's actions (feeding the paper, pressing wrist to amber, reaching for the baby) all pursue this goal. Internal conflict: she wants erasure but learns she must witness instead. Friction between want (silence) and cost (enduring the cry) is on-page. The motivation is signaled early, drives all three major beats (write/feed, rejection, return/witness), and is reweighted at closure ("the only way to hush the dissonance was to pay it—not with silence, but with witness"). Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection +0.5 = 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6; but "hush the dissonance" language edges toward thematic label rather than pure dramatic want, and the phrase appears in the text as meta-commentary −0.4 = 8.2; internal contradiction (want erasure / need witness) is present but not intensely embodied in moment-to-moment choice −0.3 = 7.9; round down → 7.9. Actually, let me reconsider the "hush the dissonance" phrase: it appears as narration, not Elara's direct thought, and is somewhat abstract. The motivation is clear and drives action, but the phrasing is authorial rather than character-voiced. I'll score 7.6: strong integration, but the label-like phrasing and modest internal friction lower it slightly. 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.4 + 1.3 + 1.4 + 0.4 − 0.5 (label phrasing) = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" as tone: quiet, charged, elegiac. The prose sustains this through imagery ("dying star," "meteor burning itself out before it could hit the ground," "quiet between heartbeats," "wings were singing"). Tone modulates with pressure: urgent when the machine rejects ("You don't get to erase what you owe"), hushed at closure ("the lab's new rhythm... the quiet between heartbeats"). The final image is charged by the tone. However, "meteor hush" as a phrase never appears on-page, and the tone occasionally drifts into over-lush lyricism ("tethered to it, pulling threads of guilt through the years like fishing line through water") that strains coherence. Early signal +0.6, coherent across beats +1.2, modulates with pressure +0.9, charges final image +1.3, specificity +0.5 = 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5; occasional register drift −0.3, phrase not explicit (minor) −0.1 = 7.1; but tone is load-bearing for the closure's resonance, so +0.3 → 7.4; wait, I need to check if figurative density in peak beats harms clarity per Q7 rules. The closure beat is clear despite lyricism. I'll score 6.8: strong tonal coherence and closure charge, but occasional overwriting and the absence of the exact phrase lower it. 3.0 + 0.6 + 1.1 + 0.8 + 1.2 + 0.4 − 0.3 (density without full pattern-teaching) = 6.8.</comment>
