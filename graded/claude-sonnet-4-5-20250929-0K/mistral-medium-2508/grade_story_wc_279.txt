<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lior's perceptual signature is established early ("socially perceptive in the way of those who'd spent lifetimes watching others pretend"), but his interiority leans abstract rather than contradictory-impulses-in-scene. The closure choice—plunging his hand into the mandala—feels motivated by his character, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally embodied. Emotional progression is present (pulse stutters, breath hitches) but remains gestural; the final stance crystallization ("Always") feels earned but not deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns, whispers, and the mandala deepen until the grotto's chorus and the final void-drawing create a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant—the mist "swallows the first line hungrily" and Lior accepts perpetual creation/destruction). Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph, though "when" (the unlearning week) is contextual. The closure lands with conceptual cost (the void must be drawn again and again, "some things were meant to be devoured"), and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening—mandala splits, flake burns, hand plunges—reconfigures his relationship to the mess and the village.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's acoustics and mist function as active constraints: the flake whispers, the mandala's void opens, and the mist "swallows" Lior's final line. Sensory detail (lavender, slate, cobalt, ochre) is specific and filtered through the artist's craft-focused POV. The setting charges the final image—void and mist merge—meeting the 9+ gate's environment-constrains requirement. Spatial choreography (knee, hand, mandala center) remains clear across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess during the village's enforced forgetting—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening: the flake burns and instructs "interject now, or it collapses," forcing Lior's hand-plunge that shifts the mandala and triggers the grotto's chorus. The cost is conceptual and opportunity-based (he must keep drawing the void perpetually), legible in "some things were meant to be devoured." Agency is present (choice to interject, to draw again), but the escalation is a single pressure point rather than layered reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—meaning emerges from chaos, not erasure—arises from concrete actions (mandala patterns, flake whispers, village bonfires) without thesis statements. The final image (drawing the void, mist swallowing the line) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: creation requires embracing destruction and incompleteness. "The mess is the map" recurs purposefully, reweighted at closure when Lior commits to perpetual re-drawing. No moralizing intrudes; ambiguity (the child's added line, the open window) invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Lior's artist-filter: "grains cool and deliberate," "chalk and sands." Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("coiled," "slotted," "spilling") without register drift. The flake's voice is formatted clearly as direct address. Some filter verbs ("seemed to hum," "appeared to") slightly dull immediacy in early beats, but purposeful compression in the closure sequence ("walked," "knelt," "began") accelerates rhythm without losing specificity. Perceptual signature (noticing the baker's shaking hands, blacksmith's cracked laughter) is character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or stakes. Some paraphrase loops appear: "The unlearning was over. / The remembering had just begun" restates conceptually what the prior beats dramatized, and "whimsy was just the face of a man who'd stopped fearing the lack of answers" tells rather than shows. Template cadence in the final third ("He knelt… He didn't speak… He slept… He packed…") stacks identical stems across five moves, applying −0.4 for runs. One mixed metaphor: "mist coiled… like a held breath" then "mist pooled thicker" shifts vehicle (breath to liquid) without acknowledgment. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—artist as counter-memory keeper, mandala as active portal, grotto acoustics as collaborative medium—feels specific and non-obvious. The "emergent hush" concept and the flake's evolving voice transform the familiar trope of forbidden knowledge into a collaborative, perpetual practice. Risk-taking (the void that must be drawn again, the mist as co-creator) heightens stakes and charges the ending without obscuring clarity. The village square mural spreading overnight and Lior's acceptance of the cycle ("some things were meant to be devoured") avoid tidy resolution, committing fully to the premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lior appears in setup (first paragraph), middle (mandala creation, hand-plunge decision), and closure (drawing the void again). His choices—listening instead of scrubbing, creating the mandala, interjecting, returning to draw—drive all key turns. The whimsical label is thematized ("whimsy was just the face of…") but his perceptiveness and artistic commitment shape tactics throughout. Two-gate minimum met; causal pressure present; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flake is handled/used in four distinct beats: discovery and first whisper ("The mess is the map"), pocketing, burning and second instruction ("interject now"), and dissolution with the ancestor-artist's name. Its meaning evolves from cryptic guide to active participant to lineage marker. It enables the mandala choice, charges the hand-plunge moment, and seeds the perpetual-creation theme. All three gates met; high irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Emergent hush" is named explicitly ("the term slotted into his mind like a key") and defined: "meaning wasn't in the clean lines… but in the spaces between the chaos." It shapes Lior's understanding and justifies his refusal to scrub, but does not directly alter on-page tactics—choices stem from the flake's instructions and the mandala's mechanics rather than from applying "emergent hush" as a method. Present in setup (implied by grotto silence), middle (named), and closure (the void/hush relationship). Functional but more thematic scaffold than action driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lior's social perceptiveness is described early ("noticing the way the baker's hands shook when she lied") and again mid-story ("socially perceptive… watching others pretend"). It characterizes him but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—his key moves (listening, drawing, interjecting) stem from artistic intuition and the flake's guidance, not from reading people. Setup present; no middle or closure beat where the trait alters tactics. Label-only use; swappable with "observant" or "introspective."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Interject" appears once as the flake's command ("Interject now, or it collapses") and Lior immediately obeys by plunging his hand into the mandala, triggering the grotto's chorus and the pattern shift. This action defines the story's major turn—passivity would have collapsed the mandala and forfeited the revelation. Setup (the flake's instruction), middle execution (hand-plunge), and closure consequence (perpetual drawing). High causal pressure; not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sand mandala is signaled early (second paragraph: "satchel of colored sands"), used in the middle beat (pouring cobalt and ochre spirals, letting patterns emerge), and the mandala's split-open center becomes the portal/void that Lior draws again at closure. Its mechanics matter: the spirals mirror the mist, the center splits to reveal the void, and Lior's hand rearranges the sands "like living tissue." All three gates met; the method shapes attempts and reappears transformed (from sand to chalk-drawn void). Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto's whispering acoustics are established in setup ("acoustics were infamous—a whisper… slithered… clear as a bell"), actively used in middle beats (tiles hum, flake whispers, chorus of confessions), and the mist's physical presence charges the closure ("mist swallowed the first line hungrily"). The setting supplies the core resource (the flake, the acoustics) and pressures Lior's choices (he returns because the grotto invites). High irreplaceability: no other setting offers whispering tiles and collaborative mist. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The unlearning week is named in setup ("that liminal week when the village erased its collective memory") and contextualized (bonfires, scrubbing altars). It creates the thematic stakes (why Lior's refusal matters) and appears in closure ("The unlearning was over. / The remembering had just begun"). Time does not tighten tactics on the page—no clock pressure or deadline forces faster choices. Present in two gates (setup, closure) with thematic relevance but minimal tactical constraint. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not drive middle action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lior's desire to discover meaning in the mess is dramatized: he listens instead of scrubbing, pours sand in spirals "letting the patterns emerge," and commits to perpetual drawing at closure. Conflict is present—the village's erasure versus his counter-practice—but the cost is conceptual (endless labor) rather than viscerally embodied loss. Setup (refusal to scrub), middle (mandala creation, hand-plunge), and closure (drawing the void again). Two friction points: told motivation ("man who'd stopped fearing the lack of answers") and the final choice reads as acceptance rather than tortured struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone blends unease (mist coiling, "pressed against his eardrums," flake burning) with lilac/lavender sensory notes (chalk colors, "tasted like lavender and possibility"). It modulates: early dread, mid-story awe (the grotto's chorus), and closure acceptance ("mist curled in like a question"). The final image—mist swallowing the line hungrily, Lior not minding—charges the ending with eerie collaboration rather than pure unease. Coherent through turns; the lilac–unease pairing is maintained but not heavily foregrounded in every beat. Present in setup, middle, and closure with moderate intensity.</comment>
