<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's motivation is concrete and embodied through her craft—the desire for "that precise *click* when a gear found its mate after years of solitude" anchors her pursuit. Her sister's loss provides clear stakes, and the final action (reaching into the mirror, taking the watch) demonstrates agency with visible cost: she becomes "the key" rather than merely a mender. Internal contradiction surfaces in her shift from repairing mechanisms to becoming part of one, though the transition could be more viscerally conflicted. Minor deduction for the child's appearance feeling slightly convenient rather than fully earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the locksmith retrieves the watch, opens the door her sister vanished through, and reframes herself from mender to key—a Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses her old identity. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through gears, mirrors, prophecy scraps, and the final image reweights the premise with the watch "warm against her ribs." Orientation anchors (frozen library, dawn, Hall of Whispers) arrive early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the water-mirror hums and the child appears, narrowing her options to a single irreversible reach. The three-winters backstory and the eclipse door feel slightly scaffolded rather than discovered in scene, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The frozen library, ice-encased shelves, water-mirror, and spiral staircase all constrain action and charge the final image. The gears scattered on ice, the vial of burnt-sugar oil, and the crescent-moon key function as micro-setting that enables tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "breath curled like old ink," "salt-stiffened leather," "mirrors wept silver." The setting evolves causally—the hall shudders, mirrors weep—as the locksmith works. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The environment participates in closure when "the clouds parted" and morning arrives, reweighting her internal state.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering her sister) is signaled early and drives all choices. Pressure tightens when the first gear sighs, the second resists with "something darker than rust," and the third triggers the water-mirror's hum—a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. The child's shake of the head narrows options to a single irreversible reach. Agency is clear: the locksmith's action (reaching in, grasping the watch) opens the door below. Cost is visible in her transformation from mender to key, a role she cannot unmake. Minor deduction for the convenience of the child guiding her at the pivotal moment rather than forcing a harder calculus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the clock-as-broken-hall metaphor and the sister's absence without overt statement. The watch with hands "coiled tight as a held scream" and the final line ("the world, at last, like a lock worth turning") offer a resonant, non-literal answer to repair and loss. Subtext operates in the child's silent warning and the locksmith's whispered coaxing of gears. The ending reweights prior material: she stops mending what moonlight broke and becomes the mechanism herself. Minor deduction for "driftwood nostalgia" feeling slightly performed in phrasing rather than fully embedded in her perceptual filter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization through the locksmith's craft-driven perception. Diction is purposeful: "breath curled like old ink," "gummed with something darker than rust." Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices mechanisms, spiral stairs, gear teeth—though under peak stress the voice becomes slightly elevated ("the shape of time's absence") rather than compressing. The child's lips forming words without sound and the mirror dissolving "into ripples, into light, into the *click*" demonstrate rhythmic control. Minor deduction for occasional filter-verb stacks ("she'd found," "she'd thought") that dull immediacy in reflection passages.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Strong images abound: "ice-encased shelves into veins of hauntingly bright silver," "water, still and black as a held breath." However, the piece exhibits template cadence in several passages: "She wasn't here for the books. / The locksmith—known in the lowland villages..." and "She didn't ask for what. / She knew." Paraphrase loops appear: the locksmith's repair motivation is restated multiple times without added pressure. Figurative language clusters densely in places ("breath curled like old ink," "ripples spread like cracks in a prophecy") without clear pattern-teaching. These artifacts touch non-closure beats, so deduction remains moderate (−0.6 for template runs, −0.3 for paraphrase).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmith, clockwork hall, and mirror-as-door offers a specific angle on loss and mechanism. The water-mirror suspended in iron, gears filed to crescent-moon shapes, and the watch with hands coiled inside demonstrate purposeful detail. The child's silent "you're late" and the final transformation (locksmith becomes key) feel earned in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat. However, the frozen-library-as-clock and lost-sibling-through-magical-door components draw on familiar fantasy templates; transformation is present but not radical enough to push higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present early (title role), shapes two key beats (gear placement, reaching into mirror), and drives closure by retrieving the watch and opening the sister's door. Her choices create the turns: whispering to the resistant gear, reaching in when the child shakes its head. Causal pressure is strong. Visible cost: she transforms from mender to key, foreclosing her former identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (crescent-moon key, oil vial, pliers) and used across three beats: scattering on ice, first gear sighs, second resists, third turns and triggers the mirror's hum. Each gear's engagement escalates pressure. The assortment enables tactics and constrains action (she must coax the second gear). Present in closure via the watch she retrieves and uncaps, linking repair tools to the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Named early ("Hall of Whispers, though the scholars called it the Hall of Mirrors") and shapes the dominant stake: the hall is a clock, the mirrors weep silver at closure. The water-mirror constrains action (she must press her palm, reach in). However, the labyrinth-of-glass framing remains largely atmospheric; the mirrors do not force tactical choices beyond the single water-mirror interaction. Lyric reprise (ice-veins opening, mirrors weeping at end) reweights the space but does not fundamentally break the stakes if swapped for another magical archive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright silver" appears in the opening image (ice-encased shelves) and returns when "the mirrors wept silver" at closure, reweighting the visual motif. However, the trait functions as atmospheric description rather than constraining or enabling action with visible cost. It charges the final image lyrically but does not alter tactics. Lyric reprise without causal pressure places it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The action of uncapping appears twice: implied when she prepares tools, and explicitly promised in the final paragraph ("when she uncapped its face"). The gesture redefines options: uncapping the watch will reveal "not time, but the shape of time's absence—a sister's hand." This action shapes the closure image and is causally indispensable; removing it would collapse the repair-as-recovery arc. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Introduced early ("scraps of prophecy left in the margins of this library's most fragile texts," "she'd found them three winters ago") and shapes her approach: she deciphers fragments, learns gear-language, waits for alignment. The method constrains her timeline (she arrives at dawn, the eclipse moment). However, the prophecy itself—"The hands move backward when the lock is turned"—does not visibly alter a mid-scene choice; it functions as backstory motivation. Present in two gates (setup, development via her learned mechanics) but less active in closure than other elements.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The frozen library pressures every beat: ice floor requires scattered gears, spiral staircase forces ascent, water-mirror suspended in frostbitten iron enables the reach, clouds parting at closure reweights her internal state. The setting supplies resources (mirrors, gears, the watch inside the mirror) and alters tactics (she kneels on ice, her shadow stretches across mirrors). The valley door opening "far below" at closure is causally tied to the hall's mechanics. Indispensable across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Soft hush of a distant morning" frames the opening and closing, and "first pale light bled through the clouds" anchors the arrival. Time tightens her work: she arrives as dawn breaks, works "through the soft hush," and the ending declares "The morning was no longer distant. / It was here." However, the timeframe does not impose a live countdown or force tactical trade-offs; it functions more as lyric atmosphere. Lyric reprise with modest causal pressure places it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Desire for "the rhythm of repair, that precise *click*" is embodied early and drives her gear-work across three beats. Friction surfaces when repair shifts to transformation: "she didn't feel like a woman out of step with the world. / She felt like the key." The motivation shapes closure by forcing her to become part of the mechanism rather than merely fix it—a visible cost. Strong causal linkage and closure participation, with friction between mending and merging.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and purposeful: wistful, melancholic, charged with longing ("breath curled like old ink," "gummed with something darker than rust," "bright and brutal and new"). It modulates under pressure when the mirrors weep and the door opens, intensifying without breaking. The final image ("the world, at last, like a lock worth turning") charges the tone with earned resolution rather than static nostalgia. Strong coherence and closure linkage, though "driftwood nostalgia" as a label feels slightly imposed rather than emerging purely from the images.</comment>
