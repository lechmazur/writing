<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to reimagine his civilization is clear and his poet-revolutionary identity provides texture, but the core decision at the climax—using the shard despite knowing it will turn to dust—lacks embodied hesitation or visible internal conflict in the moment. The relationship with Taelis is functional but thin; her conversion feels abrupt without resistance or cost on her side. Elias's emotional arc from weight to lightness is stated ("the weight in his chest lighter") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The reflective material about the Chronos Revolt provides context but does not force a micro-choice that alters present tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure lands on the page: Elias achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the vision forces Taelis and the archaeologists to carry "uneasy knowledge," and he himself reconciles with time's beauty. The shard's destruction is a visible cost, and the dispute resolution is legible. However, the causal chain suffers from a gap: the mechanism by which the shard "twisted" time-strands and reconstructed the cathedral for three breaths is asserted rather than earned through prior demonstration or established rules, weakening the because/therefore link at the pivotal beat. The Drive Lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture; the ending honors both, but the unexplained mechanics at the climax pull it back from the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid, black stone cathedral, time-strands "thick as rope," and the storm's charged particles create vivid atmosphere and are woven through action (Elias covering mirrors, moving through chambers, kneeling at the altar). The shard functions as a micro-setting element that charges the final image. However, spatial choreography is sometimes vague—where exactly Taelis enters, how close she stands, and the cathedral's layout during the vision blur under the figurative density. The setting constrains one choice (covering mirrors during the storm) and charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the occasional opacity in blocking and the fact that the environment doesn't tighten Elias's tactics further cap the score in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's need to force the archaeologists to see the Republic as something more than a "failed experiment"—is signaled early and drives the escalation. The shard's use narrows his options (it will turn to dust), and the vision itself is a meaningful tightening that reweights the dispute. The cost is legible: the shard is destroyed, and Elias stays behind while the archaeologists leave. However, the pressure is largely internal and philosophical; Taelis offers minimal opposition beyond one line of accusation, and the "dispute" never escalates into a concrete on-page confrontation with stakes that feel urgent or reversible. The escalation reads more as accumulative texture than causal tightening, which fits the inferred Hybrid lens but limits the score because the protagonist's agency at the peak moment (triggering the vision) feels like an inevitability rather than a difficult trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme—legacy as poetry rather than data, memory versus excavation, the beauty and terror of visible time—emerges organically from Elias's actions and the final image. The line "It isn't history. It's poetry" risks thematic echo but is dramatized within the vision's pressure and doesn't feel like a thesis statement. The shard, mirrors, and time-strands recur with shifting meaning, and the ending reweights the opening's "forgotten jewel" and "tangled, glowing web" without moralizing. The archaeologists' "uneasy knowledge" implies complexity without tidy resolution. The piece earns mid-high marks here, though the echo line and the slight abstraction in "letting it speak" keep it from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias as poet-revolutionary. Diction is controlled and textured ("baroque spires," "burnished sorrow," "strands thick as rope"). However, the narration occasionally slips into helpful-narrator mode, over-explaining the vase's function ("it had *refracted* it, bending moments like light") and the priestesses' belief about mirrors in a way that flattens urgency. Taelis's single line of dialogue is functional but generic, and the piece offers no second voice for contrast. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the elevated register never modulates under pressure, which limits dynamism. Free indirect style is clean, and there is no head-hopping, but the lack of rhythmic or syntactic variation during the climax (the vision) keeps this in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and often dense with information, but overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: "the air above it rippling like heat off desert stone" and "the time-strands around them *twisted*, knitting the cathedral's ruins back into wholeness for the space of three breaths" stack metaphors without clarity gain. The italicized emphasis on *refracted*, *twisted*, *worshipped*, and *remembered* becomes a tic. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but scaffold sentences like "The storm outside the cathedral's cracked dome was a rare one, its winds carrying charged particles that made the time-strands glow like embers" delay momentum. The opening and closing images are strong, but mid-story density occasionally obscures propulsion. Filter verbs ("believed," "saw," "felt") are used sparingly and do not cluster, so no additional penalty applies. Sentence openings vary, but the elevated register never breathes, creating a uniform texture that dulls peaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of visible time-as-material, a poet-revolutionary mourning a failed utopia, and an archaeological dispute over legacy offers a fresh angle. The shard as a refractive device rather than a simple artifact, and the mirrors-during-storms ritual, feel specific to this world. The emotional core—revision as an act of love, not vengeance—avoids generic templates. However, the "archaeologists dismiss, lone custodian proves them wrong" frame is familiar, and the piece does not fully subvert it; Taelis's conversion is too swift and the final beat ("It was beautiful, after all. And it was his") leans toward uplift without a harder counter-pressure. The specificity of the Republic's time-threads and the Chronos Revolt backstory provide texture, but the story does not take a bold structural or perspectival risk that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, and his choices drive the narrative: he devises counter-theories, collects the shard, covers the mirrors, and triggers the vision. However, his decisions feel linear rather than conflicted—there is no on-page moment where he hesitates or weighs a meaningful alternative. The revolutionary background is rich context but does not constrain a present choice with visible cost. He is the focalizer and actor, but the final beat (staying behind, accepting time's beauty) is more resolution than turn. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, but the lack of a difficult trade-off or a choice that narrows options caps the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shard is introduced early ("fingers traced the edge of a crystal vase shard"), recurs in the middle ("the shard hummed against his wrist"), and is destroyed at the climax ("the shard was dust"). Its function as a refractive device that can reconstruct the vase's lattice is specific and irreplaceable. The shard's destruction is a visible cost that charges the ending. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated in an earlier beat, and the middle appearance (humming against his wrist) is passive description rather than an active choice to use or withhold it. Three beats, closure linkage, and causal pressure are present, but the lack of a mid-story turn where the shard constrains tactics holds it in the upper-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute is the nominal frame and motivates Elias's need to "force the archaeologists to see." It appears in the setup ("The dispute with the off-world archaeologists had begun...") and in the climax (Taelis's objection and conversion). However, the dispute is more backdrop than active pressure—Taelis appears late, offers one line of resistance, and capitulates immediately. The dispute does not shape Elias's tactics in the middle beats (covering mirrors, handling the shard), and the resolution ("the dispute was over") is told rather than dramatized. Setup and payoff are present, but middle development is absent and the concept's causal role is thin. This places it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is identified as "a poet before he was a revolutionary," and the final line "It isn't history. It's poetry" echoes this trait. However, the attribute is label-only; there is no on-page moment where his poetic sensibility constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost. The prose style reflects lyricism, but that is narrator voice, not dramatized character trait. The attribute colors tone but does not drive a beat. Setup is present, but development and payoff are absent. This caps it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Devise" appears explicitly: "Elias had spent a decade devising counter-theories, but words were not enough. He needed proof." This motivates the present action (using the shard), but the devising itself is summarized backstory. The major turn—triggering the vision—traces to this decade-long effort, but the on-page action is not the devising; it is the execution. The action is present in setup and paid off at closure, but it is not enacted in a middle beat. Swappability is low (the specificity of "counter-theories" and "proof" is clear), but the lack of a middle beat where devising shapes tactics holds it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The method is introduced in the middle: "Elias moved through the chambers, covering every mirror with sheets of irradiated silk—a method stolen from the old priestesses, who believed storms could splinter reflections into alternate selves." It is enacted on the page and the priestesses' belief provides world-building. However, the method does not matter mechanically—the vision is triggered by the shard and the storm, not by the covered mirrors. The mirrors do not constrain or enable the outcome; they are ambient detail. Setup is absent (not signaled early), development is present, and payoff is absent. This places it in the low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with its black stone cathedral, hollowed-out chambers, cracked dome, and time-strands is vivid and specific. The storm's charged particles are a necessary condition for the vision ("The storm outside... winds carrying charged particles that made the time-strands glow like embers"). The setting is present in all three acts and constrains the climax (the storm enables the vision). However, the cathedral does not force Elias to choose between options or supply a resource he must use strategically; it is stage and atmosphere, not active pressure. Setup, development, and payoff are all present, and the setting charges the final image, but the lack of tactical constraint holds it in the mid-upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after time becomes visible" is established in the opening ("time had become a tangled, glowing web") and is setting-as-premise. However, it does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock. The storm is time-bound ("By the third hour"), but this is passive tracking, not tactical pressure. The timeframe is backdrop, not driver. Setup is present, but development and payoff are absent. Swappability is moderate (the story could function with a different timeframe if the time-strands were removed). This places it in the low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's desire to "reimagine the civilization's legacy into something less brittle, less broken" is stated early and drives his actions: collecting the shard, devising counter-theories, and triggering the vision. The motivation is tested at the climax when he must destroy the shard to achieve his goal, and the cost (the shard turns to dust) is visible. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized—there is no on-page moment where his desire conflicts with another want or fear in a way that forces a difficult trade-off. The final line ("It was beautiful, after all. And it was his") confirms the motivation's fulfillment but does not deepen it. Setup, development, and payoff are all present, and the cost is legible, placing this in the low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The tone of "burnished sorrow" is signaled in the opening ("faces—farmers, weavers, children—all staring out with the same burnished sorrow Elias had carried since the revolt's end") and recurs in the final image ("for the first time in decades, he did not mind the sight of time. It was beautiful, after all"). The tone modulates from weight to acceptance, and the lyricism is consistent. However, the tone is more static mood than dynamic pressure—there is no moment where the sorrow sharpens under stress or conflicts with another emotional register. The lyric reprise (first paragraph to closing beat) reweights the stake, but the tone does not charge the ending beyond what the plot delivers. This places it in the low-mid 6s.</comment>
