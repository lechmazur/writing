<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The philosopher remains abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses in scene, only poetic assertions ("he laughed, because the sound...wasn't his"). The final shift ("no longer needed to wander") is declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of metaphysical labels without character-particular texture or stakes-driven thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates images (gear, hum, forest) toward a density shift at closure. However, the Orientation Test fails—who/where/when remain vague past 120 words; the philosopher is unnamed, the forest's reality status unclear, and "after the sixth sense awakened" provides no concrete anchor. Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing (frontier internalized, gear left behind), but cost is asserted ("no longer needed to wander") rather than shown with a visible forfeiture or constraint. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt and −0.3 for abstract cost, then cap all categories at 8.3 per cross-cap rules.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest supplies vivid sensory fragments (brass trunks, copper ferns, binary rustles), but these remain decorative—no environmental constraint shapes a choice or tactic. The gear appears frequently yet only as a touchstone, not a tool that alters action. Spatial choreography is coherent within the dreamlike frame. The setting charges the final image (gear left on a branch) but does not constrain an on-page decision, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unravel the hum") is signaled early, but no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The philosopher listens, the hum intensifies, he understands, he leaves the gear—a linear drift without escalation. No cost is legible: what does he forfeit by internalizing the frontier? What option is foreclosed? The final walk is continuation, not closure crystallization. Accumulative lens allows pattern-building, but even under that lens, pressure must cohere and deepen; here it plateaus into metaphysical glide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (rediscovering mental wildness) emerges through recurring images (gear, hum, wind) and a purposeful turn when the philosopher realizes the frontier is internal. The closing image (gear winking for the next philosopher) offers a non-literal answer. However, the piece edges toward abstraction—"bright, unnameable thing," "probable miracle"—rather than grounding insight in a specific on-page cost or choice. The final lines risk overt thematic statement ("sixth sense waking up...Not really"). Strong thematic ambition, but the execution leans toward assertion over earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, perceptual signature leans poetic-philosophical. Diction is elevated and consistent, but leans generic at peaks: "quiet, electric thrill," "bright, unnameable thing." Free indirect thought is clean. No dialogue to judge. Syntax varies purposefully (short declaratives, long lyric cascades). However, the voice reads as imposed rather than character-particular—every line sounds like the narrator's essayistic register, not the philosopher's lived idiom under pressure. Rhythmic control is strong, but distinctiveness is middling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; many lines do double duty (sensory + conceptual). However, figurative density is high throughout without teaching a strict pattern: "tuning fork pressed to the ribs of the world," "branches tracing equations," "compass made of smoke." Some vehicles are vivid, others blur ("probable miracles" remains abstract). Template cadence appears in the closing run: "Only gears. Only hums. Only the quiet..." (−0.3). Paraphrase loops: "the frontier wasn't out there—it was..." then "He stood, and the forest stood with him..." restate the same realization (−0.2). No major causality break, but density without payoff and minor scaffold lower momentum. Apply −0.5 cumulative in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mechanical-organic hybrid forest and sensory synesthesia ("taste the shape of ideas") offer fresh textures. The philosopher's arc—externalizing the quest, then internalizing it—is a familiar wisdom-parable structure executed with lyric ambition. The gear as winking gift for future seekers is a purposeful grace note. However, the core turn (seeking → being) is not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious cost; the closure reads as philosophical assertion rather than dramatized inevitability. Freshness in setting and voice, but the emotional and causal arc remains template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The philosopher is present throughout and makes one decision: to leave the gear behind. However, most beats are observational or receptive ("he listened," "he understood"). The closing choice (walking "with" the hum) does not narrow options or create visible cost; it is continuation of stance rather than a turn. Introduced early, present at closure, but agency is thin. Functional but replaceable protagonist role caps the score in low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gear appears in four distinct beats: carried in pocket (opening), pressed to temple (midpoint), grows warm (understanding), left on branch (closure). It is handled on the page and its final placement reweights meaning (gift for the next seeker). However, the gear does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it is symbolic anchor, not tool. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but no causal pressure or cost tie (−0.8 for ornamental use). Solid integration as motif, but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The hum of insight is the dominant stake: the philosopher comes to unravel it, listens for it through trees, feels it pull the gear, realizes he must become it, and walks with it at closure. It shapes every beat and the final Conceptual Repricing ("the hum wasn't something to be unraveled, but something to become"). Early signal +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure (reframes the quest) +1.2. Strong integration; the story's logic depends on this exact element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Translocates during sleep" is mentioned once in the fourth paragraph ("made his dreams translocate him across the forest while his body slept"). It appears after the 25% mark, does not constrain an on-page choice, and is never revisited. Late introduction −0.4, ornamental use −0.8, no middle or closure participation (missing two gates, cap 4.6). Present but inert.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unravel" frames the initial goal ("Tonight, he would unravel the hum") and is explicitly renounced at the turn ("the hum wasn't something to be unraveled, but something to become"). Early signal +0.6, turn participation +0.9, closure linkage +0.8. However, the action itself is passive observation rather than dramatized struggle; the shift is conceptual rather than tactical. Solid thematic hinge, but replaceable with "understand," "solve," or "decode" without structural loss. Mid-band fit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"The sound of wind through different trees" is the method signaled in paragraph six ("listen to the wind through different trees") and executed immediately (ironwoods, copper ferns). It appears in two beats: the listening attempt and the closing walk where "the wind carried him deeper." Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.8. However, the mechanics are decorative—any sensory meditation could serve the same function. Functional but not irreplaceable; mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mechanical rainforest is present from the opening line, supplies sensory texture across five+ beats (vines, brass trunks, binary rustles, ironwoods, copper ferns, fractal spirals), and frames the closure ("the forest breathing around him," "the forest stood with him"). Early signal +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2. However, the setting does not constrain a tactic or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is stage, not obstacle. Strong atmospheric integration, but not indispensable to causal logic. Upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the sixth sense awakened" anchors the timeframe in the opening paragraphs but remains vague throughout. No clock tightens decisions; "Tonight, he would unravel" suggests immediacy, but the scene drifts without temporal pressure. The timeframe does not shape a single tactic or force a deadline. Early signal +0.4, but no middle or closure participation (missing two gates, cap 4.6). Ornamental framing (−0.6). Low functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("rediscover the wild frontier of your mind") is signaled obliquely in the opening ("where thoughts grew untamed") and made explicit at the turn ("This was the wild frontier"). It drives the quest and is internalized at closure ("the frontier wasn't out there—it was the quiet space between his thoughts"). Early seed +0.5, turn participation +0.9, closure linkage +1.0. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between want and cost appears on the page. Thematic anchor, but not viscerally tested. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tone of "probable miracles" is coherent throughout: lyric wonder, gentle surrealism, philosophical optimism. It charges multiple images (bird with gears, river flowing upward, shadow compass, gear winking) and modulates appropriately at the closure ("bright, unnameable thing," "quiet, electric thrill"). The tone supports the conceptual shift and never breaks into cynicism or melodrama. Early establishment +0.7, closure charge +1.2, coherence across turns +0.9. However, tone is static—no tonal shift mirrors escalation or cost. Strong atmospheric consistency, but not dynamically integrated with pressure.</comment>
