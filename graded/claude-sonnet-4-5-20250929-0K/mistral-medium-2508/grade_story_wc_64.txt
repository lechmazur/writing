<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias possesses a coherent interior life—his "blithe nature not dimmed but *deepened*"—and his decision to untangle the knots flows from established traits (speaking to worms and dead things with kindness). The emotional embodiment is strong ("throat tightened," hands that don't shake), and the final choice to tell the widow what he saw carries visible cost in that he transforms ignorance into knowledge with stakes. However, the widow's motivation and arc remain mostly off-page, and the chess frame feels ornamental rather than a crucible that forces micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~80 words. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: each knot untangled deepens atmosphere and reweights the widow's secret, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing when Elias sees the river vision and understands the sovereigns were "payment for silence." The closure reconfigures the premise ("Intentions were just knots waiting to be named") with felt cost—he now holds a burden he will carry to the widow. One knot-by-knot escalation suffices for this length, though the chess clock frame and the final reset feel cosmetic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, marigolds leaning toward headstones, and the weeping cherry tapping the roof create a lived-in micro-setting that constrains Elias's nocturnal ritual. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("damp earth and rust," "wet stone and lavender"). The tapestry becomes a tactile object whose threads "breathe," and the silo's door that never latches pays off when it "at last, clicked shut" in the final line, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the shape of intentions knotted in the tapestry—is signaled early and tightens through three progressive knot-unravelings that release scent, voices, and vision. The final knot's noose of silver thread delivers a meaningful turn: the widow wanted truth unraveled, not buried. Cost is legible on the page (Elias now carries the knowledge and will confront her at dawn), and the escalation is driven by protagonist agency. However, the chess match and widow's presence feel more framing than pressure-applying, and no live loss (time, safety, social cost) alters tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: intentions as knots, the dead as restless, secrets woven into land. The final image—marigolds trembling, silo door shut—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "what shape can intention take?" without moralizing. The tapestry's shifting threads and the chess reset work as earned motifs that reweight prior material. One slip: "Intentions were just knots waiting to be named" edges toward authorial thesis-statement, though it's embedded in Elias's realization and the line doesn't replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is consistent and voice-particular ("blithe," "tenderly organized," "the way soil darkens when turned"). Perceptual signature is strong: a gardener who speaks to worms notices marigolds leaning and roots whispering. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom") that feels ornamental rather than character-rooted, and the widow's off-page dialogue ("*You'll see*") is minimal, so voice distinction cannot be tested. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the knot-untangling sequence. Clarity holds throughout, with vivid specifics ("dried blood and forgotten violets," "sovereigns and promises"). However, several constructions lean toward overwriting: "the way the marigolds leaned toward certain headstones and the way the silo's door never quite latched" uses template repetition ("the way...and the way"), and "a chorus of murmurs in languages Elias didn't know but *felt*, like the pulse of roots in winter" stacks metaphor on metaphor without full coherence. The closure image is clean, but mid-scene figurative density occasionally obscures propulsion. Apply −0.6 for pattern density and register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—cemetery gardener untangles a widow's knotted secret via tapestry—synthesizes familiar gothic elements (graveyard, silo, drowning) into a specific synthesis: intentions as textile knots. The detail is particular (cobalt silo, sovereigns in pockets, weeping cherry) rather than generic, and the final turn (sovereigns as payment for silence, not gambling) feels earned in hindsight. The chess frame and "velveteen gloom" tone risk ornamental flourish, and the story does not take bold structural risks, but the emotional truth of carrying secrets and the tactile unraveling method offer enough fresh inflection to rise above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the key decision to untangle the knots (middle) and to tell the widow what he saw (ending). His "blithe" nature is embodied in his calm hands and his kindness to worms, and his choices—to decode the tapestry and then reset the chessboard—drive both the revelation and the closure. Setup clear, middle causal, closure participation strong. Cost: he now holds a burden. Minor friction: the widow's absence means some pressure is off-page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in the first third (Hester presses it into his palm), reappears when he carries it to the silo's edge and opens it to find the tapestry, and is folded shut at the end ("Elias folded the tapestry back into the sovereign case"). Its brass clasp "cold as a grave marker" and the twist that it holds tapestry, not coins, drive the investigation. The case constrains the secret (it must be opened, decoded, then closed) and charges the ending when Elias refolds it, aware of the weight. Three distinct beats, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is named by Hester and operationalized as the knots that "breathe" and release murmurs in unknown languages. The concept shapes Elias's stake (he wants to know what shape intention takes) and the silo's voices warn him ("You shouldn't have dug where you weren't asked"), adding pressure. However, "uncharted" itself is more atmosphere than mechanics—the story could function with "knotted secrets" or "woven intentions." Closure ties to the concept (intentions as knots), but the exact phrase feels ornamental. Setup, middle involvement, closure thematic; specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" describes Elias's evening gardening (rows of marigolds and lamb's ear) and recurs thematically when he "tenderly" decodes the tapestry's knots with "calloused fingers tracing the pattern like a blind man reading braille." The trait enables his careful, patient unraveling and contrasts with the violent secret he uncovers, but no on-page cost or tactical constraint is tied to tenderness itself—he could be meticulous or skilled with the same result. Setup, thematic echo, no middle cost. Cap: swappable trait, lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Untangle" is the engine: Elias begins by decoding the frayed threads, and each knot loosened releases escalating revelation (breath, scent, voices, vision). The action is irreplaceable—the story hinges on his progressive unraveling, and the final knot (the noose) delivers the climactic turn (the widow wanted truth unraveled, not buried). The method is signaled, beats are distinct, and closure pivots on the completed act. Setup, middle (three beats), closure. Strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—"decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border"—is signaled when Elias examines the stitched knots and enacted through three progressive untanglings. Each knot's pattern matters: the first loosens with a held breath, the second with scent, the third fights him, the fourth is a noose of silver. The mechanics shape his attempts (he traces like reading braille, teases apart the noose) and the border's "knots so tight they seemed to resist the air" constrains his work. Setup, middle involvement across beats, closure linked. Specificity high, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt silo appears in the opening line and frames the entire scene: Elias carries the case to its edge, the silo's iron ribs groan, shadows stretch when knots loosen, walls murmur voices, and the door clicks shut in the final line. The setting pressures mood (damp earth, rust, groaning bones) and the final door-latch pays off an earlier detail ("the silo's door never quite latched"). However, the silo itself is more container than constraint—Elias could decode the tapestry anywhere. Stars and marigolds add atmosphere but don't alter tactics. Setup, atmospheric middle, closure charge moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chess clock "ticked its last" in the opening line, anchoring the scene after the game ends, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elias has all night, and dawn's approach ("Dawn would come soon, and with it, the widow's knock") is noted but not felt as pressure. The widow's arrival could happen anytime; the clock does not track or constrain his untangling. Setup present, no middle urgency, closure anticipates dawn but doesn't hinge on it. Functional background, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to discover the shape of intentions" is dramatized through his patient decoding and his wonder ("what shape of intention could knot itself so deep into cloth"). The motive is coherent with his trait (he speaks to dead things, seeks to understand), and friction appears when the voices warn him and he tightens but persists ("Elias's hands didn't shake"). The final realization ("Intentions were just knots waiting to be named") and his decision to offer the truth to the widow show the desire fulfilled with cost. Setup, middle friction, closure payoff. Strong thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" saturates the prose: damp earth and rust, cobalt silo under low stars, dried blood and forgotten violets, blue lantern flame, shadows leaning forward. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly—quiet at the chess game, uncanny when knots release voices, somber when the vision appears, restful when the door clicks shut. The final image (marigolds curling like hands in prayer, silo shut) charges the gloom with earned closure. However, "velveteen" itself is more label than lived texture; the effect is achieved through concrete detail rather than that exact word. Tone consistent, closure charged, specificity of label moderate.</comment>
