<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear—exile from the guild and pursuit of vivification—and his arc of feeding the crozier memories and doubt embodies internal contradiction. However, key moments rely on label-only interiority: "gnawing certainty," "exact pitch of the guildmaster's sigh," and especially the final beat where his hands move with "stoic sensitivity" without showing how that manifests in concrete micro-choices under pressure. The transformation at closure reads more asserted than earned through visible, embodied cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens with motivated escalation: Elias feeds the crozier memories and doubt, leading to the nexus explosion and his transformation. Closure lands on-page with the guild's flight and Elias's stance crystallization. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—his scars reverse, the crozier heals, but the felt price of "stopping pretending destruction was the enemy" remains more conceptual than viscerally paid. The final image reweights prior material, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration, though the cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus is vividly rendered with molten copper veins and temperature shifts, and the crozier's fracture constrains Elias's choices throughout. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling in the center, the retort in the corner, the nexus's heartstone as impact point. The frozen bloom charges the final image. However, the setting leans decorative in places; details like "sickly gold, like light filtered through bruised skin" are atmospheric but don't alter tactics as much as they ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias proving his method of creative destruction—is signaled early and tightens through the feeding sequence to the forbidden incantation. The crozier's hunger narrows his options, and the final turn (guild fleeing, Elias staying) is earned by his agency. Visible cost: his scars reverse (body alteration), the guild will burn the nexus (social consequence), and he forecloses his past identity. The escalation is coherent under the Causal lens with a meaningful tightening and felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—interrupting death/destiny at the root, creative destruction as method—emerges organically from the crozier's mechanics and Elias's choices. The piece avoids moralizing; the final exchange ("I stopped pretending destruction was the enemy") arises from action rather than assertion, and the nexus roaring in agreement is image, not thesis. The frozen bloom and healed crozier offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "stoic sensitivity" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward label rather than fully dramatized complexity, but the thematic closure is strong.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"frozen bloom," "liquid" air—and the narrative voice carries texture. Dialogue at the end is brief but goal-driven. However, register drifts into elevated phrasing under pressure: "successive approximation toward something alive," "vivify," and especially "stoically sensitive" feel imposed rather than character-filtered. The phrase "stoic sensitivity" in the climax reads as external narration rather than Elias's lived perceptual signature, weakening distance control at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense—"teeth," "blackened lace," "frozen bloom"—but several beats show overwriting: "sickly gold, like light filtered through bruised skin" stacks metaphor without added clarity. Template cadence appears in the feeding sequence: "Each offering made... Then he fed it doubt... The crozier shuddered." Paraphrase loop: "The explosion was silent. A wave of frozen bloom unfurled..." restates the same event. Filter-verb stack in the middle ("He jerked back... what if destruction wasn't the end? What if it was the method...") dulls immediacy. These artifacts cluster but don't fully obscure closure; applying −0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of alchemical vivification with "creative destruction" as method is specific and non-obvious, and the crozier's hunger mechanism is fresh. The final turn—interrupting death at the root rather than animating the dead—feels earned in hindsight. However, the exiled alchemist and forbidden ritual are familiar genre beats, and the guild's immediate flight after his transformation borders on convenience. The piece commits to its premise without hedging, but the emotional arc (exile → vindication) follows a recognizable template. Transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias drives all key turns: stealing the crozier, feeding it memories and doubt, slamming it into the nexus, speaking the forbidden incantation, and refusing to flee when the guild arrives. His choices narrow options and alter tactics throughout, and his final stance crystallizes the closure. The character is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crozier is handled across multiple beats: traced at opening, fed memories/doubt, slammed into the nexus, healed by the explosion, and cradled at closure. Its hunger and fracture constrain Elias's method, and its healed seam charges the final image. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and stakes. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Creative destruction" shapes Elias's method—feeding the crozier failures and doubt to power transformation—and the guild labels his work with the phrase. It alters tactics in the feeding sequence and is verbalized at closure ("I stopped pretending destruction was the enemy"). However, it reads more as thematic echo than mechanical driver; the crozier's hunger is the active force, and "creative destruction" names rather than constrains the process.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" appears only at closure as a descriptor of Elias's transformed hands ("moved with the stoic sensitivity of a man who had split the sky"). It does not constrain or enable any prior on-page action. The label asserts a trait without showing how sensitivity or stoicism shaped his choices under pressure. Ornamental late mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Vivify" is established early as Elias's forbidden goal and reappears when he realizes vivification means "interrupting death at the root." The crozier's un-making of his scars dramatizes the concept, and the final ember in the crozier's maw literalizes vivification. The action redefines the story's stakes and is causally active at closure, though the mechanics lean abstract compared to the crozier's concrete hunger.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Successive approximation" is named explicitly in the second paragraph ("successive approximation toward something alive") and implied in the feeding sequence (memories, then doubt, escalating offerings). It shapes the middle beats' tactics but remains more conceptual than mechanically visible; the exact iterative method is asserted rather than dramatized step-by-step. Present in setup and development, but its closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ember nexus is anchored at opening with molten copper veins and unnatural cold, its heartstone becomes the impact point for the climax, and its embers roar in agreement at closure. The nexus's temperature and light shifts constrain Elias's perception and validate his choice. It pressures the protagonist and charges the final image, making it essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"When the penny drops" is signaled in the opening ("Tonight, the penny would drop—or the nexus would"), recurs internally ("The penny dropped"), and the world remakes around its sound at the climax. It tightens urgency and marks the decisive moment. However, it functions more as metaphor than mechanical timeframe; no live clock tracks elapsed seconds or forces tactical trade-offs. Lyric resonance with closure linkage, but not a constraint-based timer.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Elias's desire to escape his "destiny" of tending fires without lighting them is dramatized early (exile, "stifling destiny"), drives his choice to use the forbidden incantation, and is verbalized at closure when he declares the cage broken. The motivation creates friction—he must feed the crozier his own doubt and wounds—and forecloses his guild identity with visible cost. Strong setup, development, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Frozen bloom" appears as the climactic explosion effect ("crystal petals locking mid-bloom, time stuttering"), visually anchors the transformation, and becomes the setting when the guild finds him ("garden of glass petals"). The tone coheres—cold, crystalline stasis interrupting motion—and modulates with pressure from embers to frozen clarity. It charges the final image and is indispensable to the closure's visual-conceptual payload.</comment>
