<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beekeeper's seventeen-year silence and embodied grief (tracing box edges, controlled breath) ground his stance effectively. The ghosts' arrival and his wordless understanding create pressure, though the protagonist remains largely reactive until the box-opening choice. His motives cohere—preserving unspoken weight—and the final renunciation (departure without speech) forecloses the path with visible cost. Minor deduction: interiority occasionally drifts toward lyric abstraction ("weight of unspoken things") rather than immediate perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (beekeeper, ruined oasis, post-vanishing timeframe) arrive early. The ghost arrival and box-opening constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights the covenant; the coda (oasis blooming, beekeeper gone) delivers Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise as his departure and the handprint crystallize cost and continuity. Felt cost: his absence, the ghosts' shift from regret to naming. One slip: the long coda risks diffusing the closure beat's immediacy, though the handprint image anchors it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skeletal hives, melted wax "tears," sand-swallowed dunes, and stained glass box create vivid micro-setting that constrains the beekeeper's world and charges the closure (box atop hive, handprint). Sensory detail (thyme scent, wind shift, raindrop) modulates with pressure. The wasteland's transformation from howling to "steady breath" directly mirrors the covenant's untangling, elevating setting to thematic participant. No slips in spatial logic or continuity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: breaking/honoring the covenant and the beekeeper's silence. The ghosts' arrival and box-opening provide one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens; the beekeeper's exhaled breath and decision to open foreclose his path of absolute silence with legible cost (departure, transformation passed to others). Pressure coheres. Minor cap: the protagonist's agency tilts passive—ghosts initiate, he responds—though his exhaled breath and lifting the comb are micro-choices that enable closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—covenants outlasting the living, silence versus surrender, unspoken weight made light—emerges from stained glass fractures, honeycomb light, ghost transformation, wind's shift from grieving to free. The final image (handprint "still warm," bees remembering, wind as breath) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "sound of a name, spoken at last" and "quiet that held space" crystallize the thematic question with undeniable conceptual cost. No lapses into thesis or echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (beekeeper reading wind through glass cracks, gauging ghost-pressure as "teeth ache") is distinct and apt. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (intimate at box-opening, panoramic in coda). Diction stays character-consistent except minor register drift: "tranquilly perceptive" and "counterbalance" feel slightly elevated for a mute recluse's interior lexicon. No head-hopping; tense and stance hold. The coda's shift to traveler perspective is clearly signaled and serves closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; images like "ribs of buried giants" and "held breath shapes a room" are vivid. Information density is high in most beats. However, template cadence appears: "The beekeeper [verb]. He [verb]. He [verb]" runs across multiple paragraphs, and paraphrase loops surface ("The box stayed. The covenant did not"—restates prior content without added pressure). Figurative density in the coda (wind as grieving thing, then breath; quiet that "held space") approaches saturation without full pattern-teaching. Apply template-cadence and loop penalties: −0.8 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The beekeeper-ghost covenant and stained glass box offer a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The silence-as-preservation motive and covenant-untangling avoid stock resolutions. However, the core frame—recluse, lost bees, magical restoration—echoes familiar wasteland-redemption templates; transformation occurs through sensory specificity (honeycomb of light, thyme scent) and the handprint's charge, but the emotional arc (regret → naming, howl → breath) follows a predictable redemptive trajectory. Risk-taking in the coda's multiple epilogue layers adds ambition but doesn't fully escape the template's pull.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Beekeeper present throughout; "astonished" is implied in his response to ghosts (no flinch, understanding), "recluse" is stated (seventeen-year silence, isolated oasis). He makes two key choices: exhaling to fog the panes (enabling the seam to shiver) and lifting the comb to light (prompting ghost departure). These choices shape the middle beat and closure. However, his agency tilts reactive—ghosts arrive, press the box; he responds. Setup early, development at box-opening, payoff in closure participation. Causal pressure moderate; cost visible (his departure). Swappability: another recluse archetype could fill the role with minor edits. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.6, reactive stance −0.4 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stained glass box appears in opening paragraph (lap, fractured panes, no hinge), returns at ghost encounter (ghost presses, seam shivers), opens to reveal honeycomb, and reappears in coda atop hive with handprint. Four distinct beats. Its properties (fractured glass teaching wind-reading, fused seam, light refraction) constrain beekeeper's world and enable the covenant's visualization. Irreplaceable: removing it breaks the vault metaphor and closure image. Setup early +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure (seam as lock, honeycomb as payload) +1.3, closure linkage (handprint) +1.5, specificity (stained glass fractures as perceptual tool) +0.7, cost connection (weight carried, then left behind) +0.5 = ~8.7. No swappability; no late penalty.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Tangled covenant" is named mid-story ("covenant, tangled and half-forgotten") and drives the ghost encounter: they remind the beekeeper, the box is "a vault for words too heavy to speak, promises sealed." The covenant's untangling (final third: "thread by thread, into the open air") shapes the closure and explains the oasis's restoration. It constrains the beekeeper's silence and the ghosts' regret, enabling the resolution. Setup ~40% +0.3 (late signal −0.3 net 0.0), two beats (ghost scene, untangling coda) +0.9, causal pressure (covenant as lock on words/restoration) +1.1, closure linkage (untangling frees wind, restores land) +1.2, specificity (covenant = unspoken promises in a dying land) +0.5, cost (beekeeper's departure to honor it) +0.4 = ~7.1. Deduction for late naming and slight abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears as a label mid-story ("tranquilly perceptive in a way that required no voice") describing the beekeeper's wind-reading through fractured glass. It's demonstrated earlier (he "had spent years gazing at the horizon through the box") and enables his understanding of the ghosts' intent without words. The trait constrains his response (no flinch, deliberate exhale) and underlies the closure (his silent departure, bees remembering). Setup via action (gazing years) +0.6, label at ~50% (−0.3 for label-only phrasing, net +0.3), one beat (ghost understanding) +0.4, causal pressure (perception enables covenant grasp) +0.7, closure linkage (silent mastery persists in absence) +0.8, swappability (another perceptive trait could substitute) −0.5, cost connection +0.3 = ~6.2. Deduction for label reliance and moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Gaze" recurs: beekeeper "gazing at the horizon through the box's fractured glass" (setup), ghosts "hovered before the box" and "leaned in...a single shared gaze" (climax), travelers "looked closely at the stained glass box" (coda). The gazing through fractured glass teaches wind-reading and charges the covenant's visualization; the shared gaze with ghosts marks their transformation. Three beats, each functionally distinct. Setup early +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (gaze as perceptual method and communion) +1.1, closure linkage (travelers' gaze reveals handprint) +1.0, specificity (not mere looking but interpretive gaze through medium) +0.6, cost (gaze as vulnerability, communion) +0.4 = ~7.9. Minor swappability (observation could substitute in some beats) −0.3 = 7.6, but the shared-gaze beat is irreplaceable, so net ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" as method: beekeeper reads wind warnings "in the way light bent through [box's] cracks," ghosts' whispers are "pressures...that made his teeth ache," he "understood" without words, and the box's seam shivered when ghost hands pressed. The method (non-verbal interpretation of pressure, light, and tactile cues) is present in two beats (wind-reading, ghost understanding) and shapes the middle turn. Setup early (wind-reading) +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (method enables covenant grasp) +0.9, closure linkage (handprint as final clue for travelers) +0.7, swappability (another sensory method could work) −0.5 = ~5.8. Moderate integration; not indispensable but functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Abandoned beekeeping oasis in scorched wasteland: skeletal hives, melted wax, sand-swallowed dunes anchor opening; the setting's desolation constrains the beekeeper's isolation and the covenant's weight. Ghost arrival occurs "at dusk" in the ruins. Coda shows oasis "in bloom, hives rebuilt," reversing the wasteland. Four beats (opening ruin, ghost encounter site, raindrop, blooming coda). The setting's transformation from scorched to restored *is* the closure's physical proof. Setup early +0.8, four beats +1.4, causal pressure (desolation as covenant's symptom, restoration as its resolution) +1.4, closure linkage (bloom and hives as visible consequence) +1.3, specificity (beekeeping oasis, not generic desert) +0.7, cost (transformation requires beekeeper's departure) +0.5 = ~8.2. Essential to structure and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After ghosts become visible" timeframe: story begins post-vanishing (seventeen years prior), then "the ghosts came...at dusk," and events unfold in one continuous scene from dusk through box-opening to implied departure and coda ("years later"). The timeframe is clear but does not tighten tactics; no countdown or urgency. The "years later" epilogue anchors the transformed world. Setup (ghost arrival marks present) +0.5, two phases (ghost scene, coda) +0.5, closure linkage (epilogue uses time passage to show consequence) +0.6, specificity (dusk, seventeen years, first raindrop "in a decade") +0.4, but no tactical pressure from time −0.5, no live clock −0.5 = ~6.4. Functional framing, not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of unspoken words" stated mid-story: beekeeper "had spent a lifetime preserving the weight of unspoken things—his own silence a counterbalance." Demonstrated earlier (seventeen-year silence, tracing box edges) and tested at climax (ghosts ask him to break silence; he exhales, opens box). Desire drives the central conflict (preserve vs. release) and the resolution (he remains silent but lets covenant untangle). Setup via silence +0.6, label at ~50% (−0.2 for telling, net +0.4), two beats (lifetime preserving, climax test) +0.9, causal pressure (motive as lock and key) +1.2, closure linkage (departure without speech honors preservation while allowing release) +1.1, cost (he loses presence but gains transformation) +0.5, swappability (another preservation motive could work) −0.5 = ~7.6. Strong but slightly abstract phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" as tone: the beekeeper's silent communication (exhaled breath, lifted comb, gaze), ghosts' wordless pressures, and the prose's lyric density ("sound of a thousand wings," "quiet that held space") sustain the tone. Modulates from mournful opening to charged ghost encounter to elegiac coda. Coherent through all turns. The final wind imagery ("moved like a breath—steady, sure, and finally free") charges the closure with the tone's central paradox: silence that speaks. Setup early (seventeen-year silence) +0.8, modulation across beats +1.2, causal pressure (tone as embodiment of covenant's constraint) +1.0, closure linkage (quiet that "held space" crystallizes theme) +1.4, specificity (not generic silence but weighted, expressive muteness) +0.7 = ~8.1. Integral and consistent.</comment>
