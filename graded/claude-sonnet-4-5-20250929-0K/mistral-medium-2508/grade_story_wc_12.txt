<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The priest's interior stance reads as abstract philosophical posture rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. His motivation to "illuminate hidden assumptions" remains stated rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. The possession entity and the novice function as symbolic tokens; their reactions don't constrain the priest's moves or force trade-offs. The transformation into indigo feels declared rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who (loop pedal priest), where (dimensional anchor chamber), and when (before possession completes) arrive within the opening paragraph—waived. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but remains ambiguous through the midpoint; the piece layers motifs (indigo, silence, loop pedal) without clear pressure tightening until the priest's dissolution. Closure unit: the priest's absorption into indigo and the novice's continuation could qualify as Charged Poise or Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted through metaphor ("no longer there to hear it") rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or action that changes options on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to an exact sentence where the priest's vanishing alters tactics or narrows the novice's live choices beyond resuming the same ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor, loop pedal, and indigo palette function as micro-setting elements that recur and gain symbolic weight. The palette's emptying and the pedal's looping charge the final image when the novice presses it again. Spatial choreography (chamber, corner, floor, threshold) remains stable. However, the "dimensional anchor" itself stays abstract; its geometry and constraints don't visibly limit movement or enable a tactical choice—mere description of "walls pulsed" and "cracks" without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (illuminate hidden assumptions vs. stop possession) signals early but remains conceptual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the indigo trail reveals the anchor's incomplete design, narrowing the priest's understanding. However, the priest's agency is passive observation followed by voluntary dissolution; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off between competing goods. The possession "hesitates" at the end, but this shift arises from the novice's repetition, not from a choice the priest made that foreclosed a path with visible cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density increases through motif layering, but pressure doesn't tighten options—merely reweights thematic meaning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (questioning vs. answering, understanding over banishment) emerges through the priest's method and the cycle's continuation. The indigo as "color of the space between fear and curiosity" and the empty palette charge the closure image with conceptual weight. Subtext operates in the priest's smile and the possession's recognition. However, the final paragraph ("The kind that decorates silence like a promise") edges into overt thematic summary, and the priest's off-stage laugh ("sounded like the color of understanding") replaces scene pressure with authorial assertion—threshold of −0.4 in this category for the explain-everything drift in the last third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on the priest until his dissolution, then shifts cleanly to the novice at a section break—acceptable under Multi-POV Track C. Perceptual signature: the priest's lens filters the chamber through metaphor (silence as decoration, color as thought), but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("muffled clarity," "unwritten symbols") without grounding in his sensory particulars. Dialogue between priest and entity carries subtext ("mistake decoration for surrender") but the entity's voice ("chorus of borrowed syllables") remains generic menace. The novice's brief segment lacks distinct interior texture; their actions mirror the priest's without voice differentiation. No mid-paragraph head-hopping, but the two POVs read as interchangeable philosophical observers rather than distinct minds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The loop pedal spun" recurs five times with minimal variation; "The anchor held/hummed/breathed" cycles through synonym churn; "decorates silence" and "muffled clarity" repeat without added pressure. Template cadence: "The priest [verb]. The [noun] [verb]." across a dozen beats. Figurative density (indigo as liquid thought, silence as frost, question shaped like a hook) clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, muddling high-pressure moments. Filter-verb stacks: "The priest had known," "would have approved," "had always preferred"—three passive reflections in the final third that dull immediacy. Applying −1.4 baseline for spread of loops and template cadence, plus −0.3 for filter stacks touching closure → −1.7 total, with disqualification from 9+ globally and high-band cap at 8.8 per artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Core premise (priest uses loop pedal and indigo to illuminate dimensional anchor's hidden design before possession completes) offers a fresh genre synthesis. The transformation test passes: removing "loop pedal" and "indigo palette" would collapse specificity into generic exorcism. However, the emotional arc (priest accepts dissolution, novice continues cycle) follows a familiar mentor-sacrifice template without a non-obvious inflection. The priest's method (rhetorical devices, looped silence) remains abstract; no concrete action demonstrates how indigo or sound waves mechanically reveal the anchor's flaw. Risk-taking in structure (mosaic fragments, lyric repetition) is present but doesn't heighten stakes—merely decorates the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Loop pedal priest: present throughout; presses pedal twice on-page (setup, middle); his decision to step into indigo triggers dissolution (payoff). However, his choices are observational and passive until the final surrender; he doesn't face a forced trade-off that alters tactics. The pedal-pressing and indigo-stepping could be performed by any mystical investigator—role lacks irreplaceable specificity tied to "loop pedal" identity beyond the prop he operates. Two-gate met (setup, payoff), eligible to ~6.0; causal pressure weak (−0.6), late passivity (−0.5), swappability (−0.7) → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Artist's palette with one color (indigo): handled twice (priest plunges hand, drags across floor; novice dips finger at end). Color "moves like liquid thought," reveals anchor's assumptions, climbs priest's body, empties by closure—three-beat involvement with closure linkage. Lyric reprise (palette empty → novice finds remnant) reweights the cycle's continuation. However, indigo's properties (why this hue reveals hidden truths) remain symbolic assertion without mechanical grounding. Three gates met; beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability (any mystical paint) −0.6, ornamental middle mentions −0.3 → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Unraveled stillness: appears as atmosphere ("weight of unraveled stillness") and thematic echo ("the stillness had been plumbed") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. The priest doesn't navigate stillness as an obstacle or resource; it decorates mood without causal work. Present in setup and payoff (stillness "no longer muffled" at end), missing middle development → two-gate cap 6.0; ornamental use −1.0, summary-only −0.5, label-only trait −0.4, swappability (any mystical atmosphere) −0.6, late theme claim −0.4 → dominant limiter ornamental use sets upper neighborhood ~3.0, other frictions nudge to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Decorates with silence: the priest "decorates silence" via loop pedal, stated in dialogue and narration, but the act's mechanics (how looping absence reveals truths) remain abstract. No on-page moment shows the decoration enabling or constraining a choice with visible cost; it's a thematic label without dramatized friction. Present setup (pedal press), absent middle development, payoff (novice presses pedal, "decorates silence like a promise") is summary → missing middle gate caps at 3.4; label-only trait −0.4, ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.6 → 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Plumb: the priest "plumbs the depth of the anchor's lie" (stated by entity), and the stillness "had been plumbed" at closure. The term recurs but the action itself—dragging indigo to reveal cracks, stepping into color—isn't uniquely "plumbing"; it could be "unveiling" or "sounding" with minor edits. Present in setup (intent declared), middle (indigo reveals), payoff (stillness plumbed), meeting three gates → eligible ≥6.1. However, causal pressure weak (the plumbing doesn't force a tactical pivot), swappability high (−0.7), summary-only use (told "plumbed," not shown measuring depth) −0.6 → 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Through rhetorical devices: the priest "plucks a rhetorical device from the air—a question shaped like a hook" and casts it once. The loop pedal warps the question, but this single beat doesn't recur or shape later attempts. Introduced in middle third (−0.3 for late signal), absent from closure participation → missing closure gate caps at 2.8. One beat involvement +0.4, but ornamental use (the device doesn't alter the entity's response or the priest's next move) −0.8, swappability (any mystical tool) −0.6 → cap 2.8 plus one beat +0.4 plus frictions = 3.4 after rounding guidance, but strict cap at 2.8 per missing payoff gate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dimensional anchor: setting present throughout; described as "chamber" with "geometry" and "cracks." The priest uses the anchor's incompleteness (missing final bar) to dissolve rather than trap the entity. Setup (opening location), middle (indigo reveals incomplete design), payoff (anchor "held differently" at end)—three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. Closure linkage: the anchor's reweighted function charges the ending (+0.9). However, spatial mechanics (how cracks enable the reveal, what "held differently" means tactically) remain vague; no on-page choice shows the priest navigating anchor constraints. Causal pressure present but modest (+0.6), ornamental description −0.5, swappability (any mystical cage) −0.6 → 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Before the possession completes: timeframe stated in opening ("before the possession completed") but never functions as a live clock. No on-page moment shows the possession advancing or the priest racing against a deadline; the entity sits in the corner throughout. Setup (declared early), absent middle development (no time pressure tightens choice), payoff (possession "hesitates" but no countdown pays off) → missing middle gate caps at 3.4. One weak causal link (priest arrives "before" to act preemptively) +0.4, but swappability (any "during crisis" framing) −0.6, summary-only −0.4 → 3.7 within cap neighborhood.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To illuminate hidden assumptions: motivation declared early ("His motivation wasn't exorcism. It was illumination") and revisited when indigo reveals the anchor's incomplete design. The priest acts on this desire (drags indigo, steps into it), and the novice continues the illumination cycle at closure—three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. However, the motivation never faces on-page friction or cost trade-off; the priest doesn't choose illumination over saving his student or his own safety in a dramatized beat. Causal pressure modest (+0.6), closure linkage +0.7, but told-only desire (no conflicted micro-choice) −0.8, swappability (any investigative motive) −0.5 → 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Muffled clarity: tone anchored in opening ("silence so thick it decorated the air," "muffled clarity") and paid off at closure ("the silence, at last, was no longer muffled. It was alive"). The oxymoron modulates through the piece—silence gains texture, loops tighten perception, clarity emerges from opacity. Three gates met (setup, middle atmospheric layering, payoff reweighting), eligible ≥6.1. Closure linkage strong: the tone shift from muffled to alive charges the final image (+1.2). However, emotional pressure remains static; the priest's calm philosophical stance doesn't degrade or sharpen under stress. Coherence across turns +0.5, but static mood through middle −0.4, modest specificity (the "muffled" quality described more than enacted) −0.3 → 6.2.</comment>
