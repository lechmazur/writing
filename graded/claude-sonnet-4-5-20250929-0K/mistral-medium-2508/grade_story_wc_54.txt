<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena's functional creativity is consistently embodied through on-page problem-solving (jury-rigging the bridge, mapping water flows, repurposing the terminal). Her interior voice shows contradictory impulses—the pull toward规则 versus the itch to solve—but the final choice feels slightly mechanical, announced rather than wrested from competing desires. The sextant discovery and hydroponics resurrection demonstrate competence, yet genuine struggle is muted; she calculates rather than fumbles, which flattens the cost. Micro-choices are present but the resolution lacks visible friction or a path foreclosed with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the equation *Hope = Flow × Resistance* reweights the terminal's failed promise into a pedestrian bridge, and the weather vane's shift from stars to horizon charges the final image with conceptual cost (abandoning escape for passage). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered images (carnival, graffiti arrows, algae-thick water) and the sextant's alignment with traveler paths. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sextant slots home and redirects flows, narrowing Lena's options from restoration to repurposing. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terminal's corroded steel ribs, algae-thick reservoirs, and graffiti arrows constrain Lena's tactics—she must trace flows and align the sextant to unlock the hydroponics bay. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (burnt sugar scent, fogging breath, static-laced screens) and filtered through her engineer's bias. The sextant piece as micro-setting object charges the closure when it slots into the recess and triggers resurrection. Spatial choreography is clean; the labyrinthine layout and circuit-board floor plan are specific to this voice and advance the maze-of-intentions concept.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—solving the terminal's failed equation and finding a way *through*—is signaled early and tightens when Lena maps the sextant's angles to traveler paths, then narrows further when she repurposes the bypass schematics to include the pedestrian bridge. One meaningful on-page reversal occurs when the hydroponics system sighs open, revealing the terminal isn't abandoned but *resurrecting*. The escalation is driven by Lena's agency (tracing, slotting, calculating) under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible but muted: she forgoes the restoration fantasy and accepts imperfect passage, yet the sacrifice doesn't fully foreclose a live option with visible emotional weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—hope as redirection rather than destination—emerges through concrete particulars: the carnival's theft of belief, the sextant as a prior solver's tool, water pressure triggering doors, and the equation *Hope = Flow × Resistance*. The final image (weather vane pointing to the horizon, not stars) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the graffiti arrows (desperation carved into walls) and Lena's quiet satisfaction. One friction: the equation is underlined twice, bordering on thematic statement, though it remains integrated as her voice and the stoic-wonder tone absorbs it. No platitudes; insight arises from the maze's specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices circuit-board layouts, rusted gears, and valve mechanics. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated—"not collapsing, but *resurrecting*" and "*recalibrating*" reflect her engineer's lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven; the exchange with the foreman advances her stance without exposition. One minor slip: "the wind through the broken windows whispered like a countdown" feels slightly elevated for her pragmatic register under peak pressure, though it's brief and doesn't obscure clarity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The terminal shuddered, not collapsing, but *resurrecting*" conveys event, tone, and stakes). Clarity and concision are strong; no paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. One cluster of filter verbs in the hydroponics bay paragraph ("The sextant piece fit... when she slotted it home") slightly dulls immediacy but remains legible. Figurative language is purposeful (corroded steel ribs, sky the color of old bruises) and doesn't overrun the beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs cleanly. Minor syntactic repetition with "She didn't [verb]" stems appears twice but doesn't escalate to template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core premise—civil engineer as maze-solver in a defunct spaceport—synthesizes familiar elements (abandoned infrastructure, mysterious artifact) through specific occupational detail and the "maze of intentions" frame. The sextant's alignment with traveler paths and the redirection-as-hope calculus feel earned in hindsight. One fresh inflection: repurposing the terminal into a pedestrian bridge rather than restoring it offers a non-obvious transformation. Emotional specificity (Lena's quiet satisfaction, the foreman's incomprehension) avoids generic templates. Minor friction: the carnival framing and burnt-sugar scent echo common abandonment tropes without full transformation; the town's loss of belief is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's choices create all key turns: entering the terminal despite prohibition, tracing the sextant's contours against schematics, slotting it into the hydroponics column, and repurposing the bypass to include the pedestrian bridge. Present in setup (opening paragraph), development (mapping flows, triggering the system), and payoff (sketching the equation, correcting the foreman). Her observation-to-decision rhythm drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. Causal pressure is strong—each choice narrows options from restoration fantasy to pragmatic passage. Cost is legible in the equation and weather vane shift, though the emotional weight is muted. Three beats, closure linkage, and irreplaceability justify high placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in four beats: discovery under the kiosk, alignment with terminal schematics, slotting into the hydroponics recess, and return as warm object in her pocket after resurrection. Its unfamiliar constellations and jagged edge signal prior failure; its hum of "intent" and fit into the recess enable the system's resurrection. Causal pressure is strong—without it, Lena cannot unlock flows or redirect the terminal's purpose. Present in setup, development, and payoff; its mechanics (alignment, angles, recess fit) matter and cannot be swapped. Specificity and beat involvement justify high placement; closure participation is indirect (pocket warmth) but charged by the prior resurrection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" shapes Lena's tactics on the page: she traces looping corridors, deciphers graffiti arrows as traveler paths, and aligns the sextant with "desperation carved into the walls." The concept frames the terminal as a "failed equation where every turn had been someone's last bid for meaning" and drives her shift from restoration to redirection. Present in setup (paragraph 4), development (hydroponics bay as heart of labyrinth), and payoff (the equation and weather vane as conceptual reconfiguration). Two beats with causal role; closure linkage is thematic rather than plot-decisive. Swappability is moderate—"maze" could be abstracted to "network" with minor edits—but the intention-layer adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Functional creativity constrains and enables on-page actions with cost: Lena's jury-rigging trait (established via bridge-from-scrap backstory) manifests when she maps water pressure to door triggers, repurposes carnival scaffolding for the pedestrian bridge, and calculates flows rather than celebrating resurrection. Present in setup (paragraph 2), development (calculating new rhythm, detour schematics), and payoff (sketching the equation). Two beats with visible tradeoff—pragmatism over sentiment, passage over escape. Not merely label; her choices reflect engineering bias (observation → calculation → repurposing). Cost is conceptual (foreclosing restoration) rather than visceral, limiting score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Resurrect" defines the major turn: when Lena slots the sextant home, the terminal *sighs*, valves groan open, screens flicker, and decades of sediment flush—the building shifts from abandoned to resurrecting. This action redefines options from passive study to active repurposing and triggers the climactic realization that hope is redirection. Present in setup (implicit goal to solve the maze), development (beat 5, hydroponics bay), and payoff (lights dim "in quiet satisfaction"). Causal pressure is high—without resurrection, Lena has no proof the terminal can function or no basis for the pedestrian bridge. Irreplaceability is strong; "repair" or "activate" would lack the life-into-death metaphor that charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Redirected flows shape Lena's mechanics and tactics across three beats: tracing sextant contours to align with traveler paths, slotting the piece to trigger valve redirection and flush sediment, and mapping water pressure to predict door paths of least resistance. Present in setup (paragraph 5, circuit-board layout and graffiti coordinates), development (paragraph 6, hydroponics bay resurrection), and payoff (paragraph 7–8, new rhythm and equation). The method is signaled early and its physics matter—flow × resistance becomes the thematic equation. Causal role is strong; without redirection, the terminal remains inert and Lena's solution implausible. Specificity (valves, reservoirs, pressure) prevents easy swap.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport terminal pressures every choice: its structural-unsound label motivates Lena's entry, looping corridors force maze-solving, the hydroponics bay supplies the resurrection mechanism, and the second-story bridge site enables the pedestrian detour. Present in setup (paragraph 3, arched ribs and cracked observation deck), development (labyrinth layout, severed pipes), and payoff (lights dimming, weather vane creaking). Four beats with direct causal role; the terminal's specifics (reservoirs, columns, scaffolding) cannot be swapped for generic "building." Cost is tied to setting—repurposing its failed promise into passage. Micro-setting (body and tool) also constrains via the sextant.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the carnival leaves" frames setup (opening paragraph, trampled grass and burnt sugar) and motivates the town's lost belief, but it does not tighten tactics or create a live clock on the page. Lena's entry at "cold dawn" and exit by "noon" mark elapsed time without urgency; the next morning's foreman encounter confirms passage but doesn't pressure her choices during the terminal exploration. Present in setup and payoff but absent from development beats. Two-gate lyric reprise (carnival theft → horizon shift) reweights the stake thematically. Functional but replaceable—"after economic collapse" could serve similarly. Mid-band placement reflects thematic coherence without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is dramatized through Lena's on-page actions: entering the prohibited terminal, tracing the sextant's alignment, calculating flows, and sketching *Hope = Flow × Resistance*. The desire shows friction between restoration fantasy (the terminal's gates as functional) and pragmatic acceptance (pedestrian bridge as passage). Present in setup (paragraph 2, "problems like rusted gears"), development (paragraph 6, calculating not cheering), and payoff (equation and recalibration line). Two beats with causal role; cost is conceptual (foreclosing escape for throughput). One friction: "puzzle out" reads slightly abstracted; the equation itself borders on tell, though the final image (weather vane, sketching) anchors it in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stoic wonder modulates coherently through turns: Lena's "breath fogging in the cold dawn" and the sextant's hum establish quiet awe, "She didn't cheer. She calculated" crystallizes stoicism under pressure, and the terminal's lights dimming "in quiet satisfaction" charges the final image with restrained emotion. Tone is consistent—no exclamation, no sentimentality—and the weather vane's creak and Lena's squint at sunrise extend the stoic register. Present in setup, development, and payoff. One minor friction: "resurrecting" and "whispered like a countdown" tilt slightly lyric, but the overarching restraint absorbs them. Tone shapes closure by refusing triumph and offering earned, muted resolution.</comment>
