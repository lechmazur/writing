<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Daniel's interiority shows consistent perceptual signature—his ear for "layers" in port sounds, his gathering impulse—but motivation remains largely told rather than tested under pressure. The collecting behavior reads more as symbolic texture than embodied drive with contradictory stakes. Micro-choices (pressing ear to 47-B, leaving offerings) exist but feel ritual rather than conflicted. The final act of pressing the bundle into steel lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternative that would earn the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (port, Daniel, death certificate error). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density builds through layered fragments (label, stories, ledger page) toward a final image of dissolution. However, the closure unit—"he stepped forward, and the water closed behind him"—gestures at transformation without landing a legible cost or decisional fork; the "erasure was real" functions as summary rather than on-page stakes shift. The ledger discovery (his own handwriting) sets up potential reversal but deflates into passive shedding rather than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (corrugated steel ridges, rust language, wind through gaps) and evolves causally (alleys shift with tides, new crate appears). Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The setting does constrain Daniel's navigation and the flooded paths force wading in the climax, meeting the 9+ gate for choice-constraint. Micro-setting (the label clutched to chest) charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Daniel seeking texture of others' memories to reclaim or redefine his erased existence—is signaled early but never tightens into a live choice with visible trade-off. The gathering behavior remains consistent but does not escalate; no reversal forces him to risk or renounce. The ledger discovery could narrow options (confront authorship vs. continue collecting) but he folds it into the bundle without friction. Final act reads as ritual dissolution rather than agency-driven decision with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and reclamation emerges organically from the death certificate premise and accumulates through fragment-collecting. The poison-label metaphor ("some histories were meant to be rewritten") hovers near overt statement but is anchored in the concrete object. Final image—label turning gold, water closing—offers lyric resonance but stops short of non-literal answer; the "some poisons were meant to be absorbed" edges into thematic echo. No forced moral, and ambiguity (is he dissolving or integrating?) invites reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Daniel's selective attention to texture, rhythm, and fragments reflects his ghost-status consistently. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("labyrinth's maw," "syrupy," "scent of diesel") is specific and voice-driven. Brief dialogue snippets from dockworkers feel natural and purposeful. Minor register wobble in "metaphor: some histories" (overly literary for a man dissolving into the port) but does not disrupt overall control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high; sentences layer setting, interiority, and symbolic freight efficiently. Minor paraphrase loop: "The death certificate had been a misprint, but the erasure was real" restates the opening premise without new pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in middle section: "He gathered… He'd pressed… He layered…" runs briefly but does not pervade (−0.3). No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddle. Clarity and momentum remain solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The death-certificate-erasure premise is fresh and the container-labyrinth setting offers vivid particularity. The fragment-collecting method and layered-memory conceit show ingenuity. However, the emotional arc (ghostly observer dissolves into environment) follows a familiar lyric trajectory without sharp turn. The ledger twist (his own handwriting) arrives but does not transform prior causality. Transformation test: plot and arc could transfer to another liminal space (abandoned building, subway tunnels) with modest edits, suggesting mid-high originality rather than indispensable synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Daniel (death certificate error survivor) is present throughout and his gathering behavior stems from the clerical erasure. However, his choices are largely observational or ritual (collecting label, pressing ear, leaving offerings) rather than decisions that create key turns. The ledger discovery could force a turn but he folds it passively. Present in closure (steps into water) but the act reads as drift rather than decision-driven turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears early (peeled from crate), returns in multiple beats (pressed with stories, layered with woman's image, clutched in climax, turns gold in final image), and carries evolving symbolic weight. It participates in closure (pressed into steel, catches dawn light) with charged reprise. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its function remains symbolic/atmospheric rather than causally decisive. Strong lyric integration but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Erased histories (core concept) shapes the premise (death certificate error) and thematically colors Daniel's fragment-collecting. The concept appears in the ledger moment (names crossed out) and final reflection ("erasure was real"). It does not, however, constrain on-page tactics or force a choice between competing options. Functions more as thematic backdrop than active stake-driver. Mid-band for thematic presence without causal bite.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" (attribute) is told early ("saw the world unfiltered… what others overlooked") and demonstrated through his selective attention to textures and stories. The trait enables his collecting behavior but does not visibly constrain or trade off in a key beat; no moment where filtering costs him an option or forces a sacrifice. Label-heavy without embodied stakes test. Functional but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Layer" (action) appears explicitly and repeatedly: layers story onto label, layers memories, presses bundle into steel. The action structures his gathering method across beats and culminates in the climactic pressing-into-crack moment. However, it does not create a major turn or reversal; it remains consistent ritual rather than a choice that redefines options. Present in closure but swappable (e.g., "weave," "accumulate") with minor edits. Solid integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories (method) is signaled early (stevedore's tale of Container 47-B, woman's child memory) and recurs across beats. The method shapes Daniel's gathering behavior and is tied to the ledger discovery. However, its mechanics do not constrain a key choice or alter tactics under pressure; it remains a consistent behavior rather than a method tested or adapted. Present in closure (fragments pressed into steel) but does not drive the turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vivid, present throughout, and actively pressures Daniel: alleys shift with tides, forcing navigation by memory; flooded paths require wading in climax; the crack in old steel provides the final repository. The setting supplies resources (crates, ledger) and constraints (shifting layout, rising water) that alter tactics. Essential across beats and participates decisively in closure. Strong causal integration; near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Tides (timeframe) are mentioned early ("labyrinth shifted with the tides") and the climax occurs when "tide came in higher than usual," flooding paths. However, tidal rhythm does not tighten a decision or create a live clock; Daniel's gathering spans undefined weeks without temporal pressure. The final flood is an environmental complication rather than a deadline that forces choice. Present but does not drive escalation or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of memories" (motivation) is stated early ("texture of others' memories") and drives his collecting behavior across beats. However, the desire is more told than dramatized through conflicted choices; no moment where pursuing texture costs him an alternative or forces a renunciation with visible friction. The ledger discovery could test the motive but he absorbs it without struggle. Functions as thematic anchor but lacks on-page friction or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Nameless identity" (tone) is established immediately ("Daniel had no name here") and sustained through ghostly imagery (moves "like a ghost," figures in upper tiers, water closes without ripple). Tone modulates subtly with accumulating fragments and intensifies in the flooded climax. The final image—erasure complete as he steps into water—charges the tone decisively. Coherent across beats and integral to closure effect. Strong tonal control that supports rather than decorates.</comment>
