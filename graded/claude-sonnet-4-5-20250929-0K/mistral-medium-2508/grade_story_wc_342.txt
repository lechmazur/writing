<comment>The artist's contradiction—chasing exactness while denying limits—drives the arc, and her final choice to "paint nothing" forecloses the knife with visible cost. Interiority is image-rich and embodied ("her hands remembered," "her fingers twitching"), though some moments drift into abstraction ("the way a glance could split a life") without grounding in scene pressure. The closing choice reads earned by the night's work, but the pivot from precision to void feels slightly telescoped given the density of prior obsession. Minor label-speak appears ("fractally precise" as guild joke) but stays controlled.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands on the page: the artist moves from knife to brush, painting "nothing," forecloses the compulsion with felt cost, and the final line crystallizes earned stasis ("let the limits hold her"). Orientation anchors early (oak hollow, night deadline, artist at work). The causal chain holds—coin unlocks safe, instruction drives glass installation, collapse teaches the lesson—but the dream sequence and wake blur into extended coda, diluting the decisive moment's charge. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a late Causal turn; the choice to paint nothing reconfigures prior material, yet the multi-paragraph drift after the coin-drop softens closure impact.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The tree-hollow library is vividly anchored (shelves carved into living wood, scent of sap and mildew) and constrains the artist's final night. The coin's indentations guide her tactile navigation and blueprint the glass ceiling, charging the climax. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the glass-ceiling construction sequence compresses mechanics ("channels to guide the beams") without showing tool-handling in real time. The oak's "dying flesh" and post-demolition ash anchor setting continuity through closure.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—mirroring the infinite inside walls—is signaled early and drives the night's work. Pressure tightens via the dawn deadline and the oak's imminent destruction, culminating in the ceiling's collapse that dramatizes the limit she'd denied. The choice to paint "nothing" the next morning is a micro turn that deepens the arc, though the post-fire scene dilutes urgency; the demolition crew's arrival feels more atmospheric than a live force narrowing her options. Agency is clear: she builds, witnesses failure, and shifts medium with visible cost (the knife set aside).</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—what cannot be held—emerges through the coin's indentations, the fracturing light, and the shift from knife to brush without overt statement. The final painted void and the line "let the limits hold her" answer the implicit question with resonance. The guild's despair pressed into the coin and the artist's acceptance converge in the blank sheet, reweighting prior compulsion. Minor slip: "the shape of a question with no answer" drifts toward abstraction, and "a sky that had finally learned to stay" edges into symbolic convenience, but the particulars (coin, glass, ash) ground the arc.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and image-driven ("river of gold fracturing," "pillow damp with sap"), with purposeful compression in the glass-ceiling construction. Voice modulates under pressure: terse action during the build, lyric expansion in the dream and morning beats. The post-collapse sequence risks over-lyricism ("the hush before demolition," "the sky wrote itself"), yet the final lines sustain texture without obscuring closure. Psychic distance widens slightly in the coda (multiple paragraph-long reflections), but the artist's perceptual signature—touch, craft, pursuit—remains stable.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high through the coin-and-safe sequence. Paraphrase loops appear: "She understood. / The guild hadn't been hoarding…" restates the instruction without added pressure (−0.2). The dream-and-wake sequence contains template cadence: "She woke… she reached… she stopped… she dipped… she painted… she hung" stacks parallel stems across six lines (−0.5). Figurative language ("like trying to catch smoke in a net," "wound in the tree") is mostly coherent, but "the color of the hush before demolition" mixes abstract and concrete awkwardly. No loops touch the closure beat directly, mitigating impact.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—face-blind artist, tactile coin blueprint, light-fractured library—feels specific and non-obvious. The turn from knife to brush painting "nothing" grows from prior causality and reweights the premise without explaining. Risk is present: the extended coda (dream, morning, blank sheet) trusts image over event. Proximity check: "trying to catch smoke" and "the sky wrote itself" echo stock phrasing, and the foreman tossing the warped coin feels slightly convenient. The piece commits fully to its premise and resists hedging, elevating the score despite familiar touchstones.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The artist's face-blindness is signaled early ("forgotten what faces looked like") and frames her turn to the library project, but on-page choices (decoding coin, building glass ceiling, painting nothing) don't hinge on prosopagnosia specifically—another obsessive craftsperson could execute the same beats. The trait enriches backstory (thousand failed portraits) but doesn't constrain a pivotal choice with unique cost. Present across setup and payoff (the blank portrait), yet swappable for "compulsive perfectionist" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The coin appears early, unlocks the safe (one functional beat), serves as blueprint for the glass channels (second beat), and returns warped at the end, its indentations erased—reweighting the theme of loss. Three distinct touches across setup, middle, and closure. However, the foreman tossing it feels slightly convenient (it survived the fire when nothing else did), and its mechanics (how pressure indentations guide channel-cutting) remain abstract. Strong closure linkage but moderate causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Discovering limits drives the dominant stake: the artist's lifetime pursuit meets literal collapse, then acceptance ("let the limits hold her"). The concept shapes tactics (building a ceiling to hold the infinite) and is tested on the page (beams give way, illusion shatters). The closing choice to paint "nothing" enacts the limit with visible cost, forecloses the knife, and charges the final image. Setup, middle constraint, and closure payoff are all present with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Fractally precise" is mentioned once as a guild joke, labeling her style without constraining an on-page action. The glass-ceiling work implies precision (scoring channels, cutting panes), but the text never shows how fractal recursion or infinite detail trades against time, sanity, or outcome—any meticulous artist could perform these beats. The trait enriches characterization abstractly but remains ornamental; no visible cost or tactical constraint tied to it. Missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Craft (carving, blade-work, glass-cutting) anchors every major beat: decoding the coin, building the refracting ceiling, and the final pivot to brush and ink. The collapse punishes the ceiling-craft with immediate consequence, and the closing act—painting "nothing"—redefines craft itself with visible renunciation (knife set aside). Three or more beats, causal pressure throughout, closure participation strong. Irreplaceability is high; "scholarly research" or "diplomatic negotiation" would require full story redesign.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The coin's faint indentations unlock the safe early and serve as the blueprint for the glass channels, shaping two key beats. Mechanics are signaled (spiral and dots, "language of pressure") and guide on-page action (pressing into leather, scoring wood). The warped, erased coin at closure reweights the method's fragility. However, the connection between coin-pattern and glass-channel geometry remains abstract—how does a spiral translate to beam refraction?—limiting felt irreplaceability. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The tree-hollow library anchors every beat: it supplies the coin and safe, its shelves frame the glass-ceiling build, the oak's groan signals collapse, and post-demolition ash closes the arc. The setting's imminent destruction (dawn deadline) tightens all choices. Spatial specificity (shelves carved into living wood, scent of sap) grounds action, and the hollow's vertical structure enables the light-refraction climax. Three gates met; causal pressure strong; closure participation direct (ashes, new page). Irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The hush-before-demolition frame is set early ("crew would arrive at dawn") and motivates the single-night deadline, but on-page clock pressure is thin—no tracking of hours, no escalating sounds of approach until "the first hammer struck" at the climax. The post-collapse beats (fire, morning wake, blank sheet) drift beyond the stated timeframe without consequence. Setup present, middle constraint implied rather than dramatized, closure moment (collapse coinciding with dawn) lands but feels more symbolic than tactically urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The desire to "mirror the sky inside walls" drives the glass-ceiling project, is tested on the page (light pours in, then shatters), and is repriced in the closing choice to paint "nothing" instead. The instruction from the safe ("Mirror the sky") triggers immediate action with visible cost (one night's work, collapse, renunciation of knife). Friction between the want (capture infinite) and the limit (some things can't be held) charges the final image. Setup, middle execution, and closure transformation all present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Heightened stillness is established early ("air thick with sap and mildew," "she worked by touch") and sustained through contemplative pacing and image-driven narration. Tone modulates under pressure: compressed action during the build ("By the time the first hammer struck"), lyric expansion at collapse ("watched the light scatter"), meditative drift in the dream and wake. The final line ("the sky…had finally learned to stay") crystallizes stillness after turbulence, charging closure. Coherent across beats, though the extended coda risks static repetition of mood.</comment>
