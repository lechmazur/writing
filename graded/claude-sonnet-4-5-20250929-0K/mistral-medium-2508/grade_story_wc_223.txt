<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority relies heavily on abstract, poeticized statements rather than concrete embodied emotion. Her motivation as "historian of small gestures" is declared but never tested against a competing impulse or difficult trade-off on the page. The "crisis actor" backstory appears purely as exposition without anchoring in present choice. While the final walking action has some cost, it reads more as symbolic gesture than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The orientation test fails: by ~120 words, "who, where, when" remain unclear—Liora's present stakes and the penumbra's threat are abstract until well past the opening third. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing (silence defeats the penumbra), but the causal chain is metaphorical rather than dramatized—no on-page action earns the penumbra's retreat. The "wings" that emerge from the chessboard and the penumbra's withdrawal lack motivating links; the resolution relies on thematic assertion ("silence... the one thing the dark could never digest") rather than earned causality. Apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the rule.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vividly described with "hollowed-out cathedral," "arches humming," and dust patterns, but it functions primarily as backdrop. The chessboard appears in multiple beats but does not meaningfully constrain Liora's tactics—she could perform the same symbolic unbinding in any setting. Spatial choreography is coherent (perimeter → center → floor) but remains illustrative rather than pressuring choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory against the penumbra—is signaled early but never dramatized as a live trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows Liora's options or forces her to sacrifice one goal for another. The penumbra's "hunger" is described but does not escalate pressure; it simply "recoils" at the end without earned causality. The final "walking" is poetic but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of memory versus erasure emerges through images (dust patterns, missing pawns, "spaces between" stories) rather than direct statement, which is strong. The chessboard and wings carry some resonance, shifting meaning from loss to release. However, the final assertion—"silence... the one thing the dark could never digest"—states the thesis rather than letting the image speak, and the penumbra's retreat reads as thematic convenience. The interplay between "small gestures" and unbinding is more lyric echo than earned dramatic irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register with strong rhythmic control ("remember, then unbind, then tell"). Free indirect access to Liora's perceptions is clean, though the diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("benevolently ruthless thing," "luminous absence") that risks obscuring concrete stakes. Minimal dialogue; the two lines Liora speaks on the page feel more like incantation than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance is stable, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence ("nomadic penumbra," "cathedral of forgotten kings," "wings... fragile as moths"), creating texture but occasionally obscuring clarity in peak beats (e.g., "its absence luminous as a wound"). Multiple paraphrase loops: "They didn't surrender... They ascended" is restated as "the pawns hadn't been taken... had unbound themselves" without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third: "The penumbra drifted... The interregnum ended... And Liora? She walked." Heavy filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she told it," "she pressed") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Apply −1.0 for patterned artifacts (loops, template stems, filter stacks) and −0.3 for elevated diction drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "nomadic penumbra" and "historian of small gestures" offer fresh angles on memory-erasure narratives, and the idea that "silence" defeats a story-devouring entity is a non-obvious reversal. However, the crisis-actor backstory and chessboard symbolism feel more assembled than inevitable. The path-spelling mechanic is under-developed, appearing more as ornament than integral constraint. Transformation test: the emotional arc of defiance against erasure could function with different imagery, suggesting mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Liora's identity as "crisis actor" turned "real crisis survivor" is present in exposition but does not constrain or enable any on-page choice. The contrast between performed grief and authentic witness is thematic but never dramatized—Liora's actions (walking, tracing patterns, holding the bishop) do not hinge on this background. Late signal (second paragraph), no middle development, ornamental closure presence (walking away). Cap at 4.6 for missing setup in first third; apply −0.8 for ornamental use and −0.6 for swappability (any survivor role would function identically).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chessboard appears early (setup), is handled in two distinct beats (Liora kneels, touches squares, lifts bishop; later the board splinters into wings), and returns at closure (reassembles with all pieces). The missing pawns are thematically charged and reweighted at the end ("the pawns... had unbound themselves"). However, the board's role is primarily symbolic—it does not constrain Liora's tactics or create a visible obstacle. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4; subtract −0.6 for ornamental use (no causal pressure) and −0.4 for thematic rather than action-driven involvement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "nomadic penumbra" is introduced early and described across multiple beats, but its mechanics remain abstract. It "devours memory" and "preserves longing," yet these properties do not visibly alter Liora's options or tactics on the page—she walks and traces patterns regardless of the penumbra's threat. The penumbra's retreat at the end is asserted rather than earned through on-page cause-effect. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.4; subtract −0.7 for ornamental use, −0.5 for swappability (any erasure force would function similarly), and −0.5 for summary-only involvement (the threat is described, not dramatized).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is applied to the penumbra as a descriptive label but does not constrain any on-page action or create a visible trade-off. The attribute is present (the penumbra devours memory but preserves longing) but remains thematic decoration rather than a trait that enables or limits Liora's choices. Late first appearance (third paragraph), no middle development, ornamental closure presence. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; apply −0.5 for label-only use and −0.4 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears as one of Liora's traced words in the opening, recurs as a realization ("the pawns... had unbound themselves"), and is spelled in the climax ("her steps spelling release"). It shapes the conceptual arc—from binding to release—and is present at closure. However, the action itself is abstract: Liora's walking spells words in dust, but this does not causally force the penumbra's retreat. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2; subtract −0.6 for ornamental use (no tactical pressure) and −0.5 for swappability (any liberation verb would function similarly), and −0.8 for late mechanics (the spelling is described but not dramatized as constraint until the end).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "pattern of walking that spells words" is introduced in the opening ("remember, then unbind, then tell") and recurs in the climax ("her steps spelling release"). However, the mechanics are never shown—we do not see how the pattern constrains Liora's movement or affects the penumbra's response. The method is present but abstract, functioning more as lyric motif than dramatized constraint. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8; subtract −0.7 for ornamental use (mechanics never shown), −0.5 for summary-only (told rather than enacted), and −0.8 for late development (no middle beat where the method is tested under pressure).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "whispering gallery" is established early with vivid detail and Liora moves through it (perimeter → center → floor), but the setting does not constrain her choices—she could perform the same symbolic actions elsewhere. The gallery's "whispers" (child's laugh, door slam, chess clock) provide texture and thematic resonance, and the final image includes the reassembled chessboard "in the empty gallery." Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5; subtract −0.6 for ornamental use (no tactical pressure) and −0.4 for postcard description (vivid but not functional).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Interregnum" is defined mid-story ("the quiet between devourings, when the penumbra slept") and bookends the narrative ("The interregnum ended"), but it does not create a visible deadline or tighten Liora's decisions. The timeframe is thematic rather than tactical—Liora's actions are not accelerated or constrained by a closing window. Late signal (mid-story), ornamental closure presence (declared rather than felt). Cap at 4.6 for missing first-third setup; apply −0.5 for ornamental use and −0.4 for summary-only (the interregnum is described, not dramatized as pressure).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Liora's desire "to become the historian of small gestures" is declared in the second paragraph and shapes her actions (collecting unnoticed details, tracing patterns). However, the motivation is never tested against a competing want or cost—she does not sacrifice anything on the page to preserve memory. The final walking away reads as fulfillment rather than trade-off. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7; subtract −0.6 for told-only (desire is described but not dramatized in conflict) and −0.4 for missing friction (no visible cost tied to this motivation).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" as tone is established early ("hollowed-out cathedral," "nomadic penumbra," "drifting shadow") and sustained through the narrative with images of erasure and light (the penumbra's "absence luminous as a wound," "the luminous absence beyond the arches"). The tone modulates with Liora's actions—from quiet tracing to bright laughter to final walking—and charges the closure image. The final paragraph sustains the paradox of presence-in-absence ("lighter now," "taste of something it couldn't name"). Early signal +0.7, consistent modulation across beats +1.0, closure charge +1.3, specificity +0.6; subtract −0.4 for occasional static mood (the tone is consistent but does not always tighten with pressure) and −0.3 for abstract phrasing that risks obscuring concrete stakes.</comment>
