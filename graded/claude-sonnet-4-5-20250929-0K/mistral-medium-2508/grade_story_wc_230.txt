<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lior's interiority is concrete and embodied through physical tells (finger twitching) and sensory detail (truffle flavor as grief). His choice to bury the eye rather than use or sell it is earned by the sister's death and the archivist's warning, foreclosing a path with visible cost. Minor weakness: the sister's jump and scream feel slightly abstract—"honesty he still couldn't parse" lacks specificity that would anchor her loss more deeply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Closure is Earned Stasis—Lior buries the eye, refusing revelation's blade, with visible cost (renunciation of power/cure). The warlord's men provide a micro-turn that tests his occlusion tactic; burial then forecloses the eye's use permanently. Orientation is swift (kneeling forager, post-virus valley, ravine orchard). One escalation beat (men arrive, he deceives) tightens to final renunciation. Cost is on-page and felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ravine and orchard constrain movement and supply the truffles that enable Lior's survival tactic. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: mud, musk, storm-clawed roots. The eye's "unnatural weight" and truffle aroma as masking agent are micro-setting details that charge the final burial image. Spatial choreography (kneeling, climbing, pressing into earth) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: survive scrutiny without revealing the eye. The warlord's arrival tightens pressure; Lior's smearing of truffle pulp over the eye is an on-page tactical choice driven by his occlusion skill. Burial is protagonist-driven renunciation that forecloses future use with visible cost (he climbs away, "didn't look back"). One meaningful escalation and a final choice that narrows options permanently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—occlusion versus revelation, kindness as lie—emerges through concrete action (burying the eye, deceiving the men) rather than statement. The sister's paradox ("kindness is the lie") and the final image (ravine keeps secrets, so does he) offer resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. The textbooks-were-wrong refrain reweights "cure" as dangerous revelation. Final burial answers the thematic question through irreversible gesture, not thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and close. Perceptual signature is distinct: Lior notices patterns (mist curls, wind pitch), occludes rather than hides, tastes grief in the truffle. Diction is elevated but consistent ("unspooled the threads of trust," "stars hung like pins"), rhythmically varied, and voice-motivated. No dialogue on the page; the warlord's hypothetical questions are framed as interior rehearsal, maintaining POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("orchard hung like a broken chandelier," "revelation was a blade"). Minor overwriting: "something older" and "something like grief" are vague placeholders in otherwise specific beats. The truffle-smearing sequence is propulsive and clear. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected. One slight register slip: "cognitive smoothness" is not Lior's lexicon, but "pattern recognition was survival now" functions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The empathy-virus premise (involuntary truth-telling) is transformed through Lior's occlusion tactic and the eye as revelation-relic rather than cure. The sister's death and textbook marginalia provide specific grounding. The ravine burial is a fresh synthesis of the premise's implications. Minor proximity concern: "artful deception" and "unfiltered truth" echo familiar post-truth discourse without full transformation into lived friction beyond the one warlord encounter.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lior's rationality (pattern recognition, tactical occlusion) drives the smearing choice and burial decision. His foraging provides the truffles that enable both survival and deception. Present throughout, causally active in two beats (deception, burial), and essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in the opening third (archivist's gift), is handled in the smearing beat, and shapes the burial closure. Its "unnatural weight" and gold-flecked iris are specific; it cannot be swapped. Three beats (receipt, occlusion, burial) with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The smuggled-relic concept (eye from a city that no longer exists) frames the archivist's warning and the textbooks' false promise. It narrows Lior's options (can't use it, can't let them see it) and drives the burial. Present early, shapes middle choice, participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness (post-virus) constrains all valley survivors and motivates Lior's occlusion skill ("learned to occlude"). It enables his deception of the warlord's men ("They believed him. They always did.") with ironic cost. Setup and payoff present, but middle development is thin—one beat of visible constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Occlusion is Lior's defining action: smearing truffle pulp over the eye, offering partial truth to the men, burying the eye to prevent revelation. It drives two major beats and defines closure. Removing it would collapse the story's tactical and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The discredited textbooks are mentioned twice (archivist context, "textbooks had been wrong") and prime Lior's knowledge that the eye reveals rather than cures. They shape his refusal to use it but are not mechanically active in beats. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle involvement is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard supplies truffles (survival currency), the ravine hides the eye at closure, and the storm's aftermath creates the mud and exposed roots. Setting pressures choices (warlord's men crush underbrush, Lior climbs back up) and charges the final image. Three beats; causal and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Post-empathy-virus timeframe establishes involuntary truth and the sister's recent death (three weeks prior). It motivates occlusion tactics and the warlord economy. The dusk arrival creates time pressure in one beat. Setup and one middle constraint; closure linkage is thematic rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Psychological safety is implied (Lior's occlusion protects others from the eye's revelation, protects himself from scrutiny) but never dramatized as a friction or conflicted want. The archivist's warning and sister's death suggest safety failed, yet Lior's choice to bury the eye reads more as self-preservation than cultivation of safety for others. Present thematically but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fractured grace: elegiac diction ("orchard hung like a broken chandelier," "stars hung like pins") juxtaposed with visceral survival detail (mud, rot, musk). Tone modulates from the opening's lyric ruin to the smearing beat's tactical urgency to the quiet burial closure. Coherent through turns and charges the final image without becoming static.</comment>
