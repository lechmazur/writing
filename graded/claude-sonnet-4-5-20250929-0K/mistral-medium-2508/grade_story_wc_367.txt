<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority shows purposeful contradiction—her laughter as weapon, her prophetic speech unintended—but the character work suffers from ornamental gestures ("fingers that knew the weight of shadows") and generic embodiment ("her breath fogging the glass"). The central choice to deny the shadows dawn feels unmotivated by prior causality; we see ritual and stance but no earned internal conflict that makes this refusal cost her something visible. The backstory fragments (fishermen's reactions, two prior incantations) anchor her reputation but don't tilt a present micro-choice, remaining decorative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes atmospheric density and pattern (lighthouse ritual, storm coiling, shadows pressing) toward a final image of renewal and return. Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse, Liora, night ritual). However, closure lacks legible cost—Liora descends with "hands still warm," smiling, already counting hours until she climbs again; the storm defers, the village stirs with hope, but no visible price is paid and no option foreclosed. The ending reads as tonal recurrence rather than Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing with felt consequence, capping the band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, salt-worn stone, and star-choked sky are vivid and selective. The lantern's glass and wick constrain Liora's ritual actions (twisting the wick, pressing palm, bending reflection) across multiple beats, and the spatial choreography (spiral stairs, harbor below, water's edge) remains coherent. The "false dawn" and "ozone and old promises" charge the ending image. The lighthouse as micro-setting shapes her routine and the village's hope, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of environment constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora must steer the storm and deny the shadows their dawn. One tightening occurs when the shadowed shape appears and she whispers refusal, bending the light to hold the line. However, the cost of this denial is not legible—the storm simply defers, the light "wins," and she descends unharmed, already anticipating repetition. No live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off enacted. Escalation reads as atmospheric accumulation rather than agency under pressure narrowing her choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of cyclical duty versus entropy emerges from the lighthouse ritual, ancient shadows, and Liora's laughter-as-weapon, avoiding overt statement. The prophetic line "The next sunrise will be the last you recognize" and the final image of unprinted headlines reweight the premise with conceptual pressure. However, the ending offers warm hands and a smile, softening the thematic cost; the cycle renews without friction or ambiguity that would resist tidy closure. The piece invites reflection but doesn't quite deliver a non-literal answer with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Liora; perceptual signature is distinct ("color that bent when you tried to name it," "shadows listened"). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout pressure beats. However, elevated register occasionally drifts from Liora's implied lexicon ("accidentally prophetic," "total internal reflection" as physics term feels like author intrusion rather than her thought). No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose texture reflects her stance—calm defiance tinged with glee—without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and the prose carries density (lantern hum, ozone scent, wind chorus). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "The storm wasn't coming; it was already here" echoes "the storm would return. It always did." Template cadence runs flatten peak beats ("She smiled. The work was never done. That was the point."). Stock metaphors accumulate without transformation ("slow heartbeat," "ripe fruit," "drowning man reaching"). Filter-verb stacks in high-pressure moments ("could feel," "swore it carried") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-gateway and laughter-as-weapon offer fresh inflections on the storm-herald archetype. The detail of total internal reflection (light trapped in glass) and the post-print world anchor specificity. However, the emotional arc—dutiful guardian cycles through ritual, denies entropy, repeats—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The prophetic utterance and shadowed shape feel ornamental rather than inevitable. The ending returns to the starting stance without a synthesis that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her ritual actions (climbing, adjusting wick, bending light, refusing shadows) drive beats. However, her choices feel procedural rather than dilemma-laden; the refusal "You can't have it" lacks visible cost or internal friction. She observes and enacts routine without a key turn where her decision alters tactics or stakes. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but causal pressure and cost connection are weak, capping the band near functional-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick appears in setup (flickering, "not quite light"), middle (Liora twists it, flame stretches), and closure (burned lower, "dipping toward the oil"). It's handled across three distinct beats and its state changes alter her actions (she "let it" burn lower to hold the line). However, its unique properties—why glass wick specifically—are not leveraged for causal pressure; a generic wick would function similarly. Solid involvement without irreplaceability, landing mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "otherworldly routine" frames the entire story: Liora's nightly ascent, the ritual of tending the wick, steering unseen things. Setup is immediate, and it shapes her tactics (adjusting flame, bending reflection) and the ending (she will climb again). The concept constrains her choices—ritual duty versus the shadows' hunger—and the closure returns to it. However, the routine itself doesn't change or generate cost; it's a frame rather than a pressure that narrows options. Two gates met with moderate causal shaping, scoring mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" appears mid-story when Liora speaks the sunrise line unintentionally. It's dramatized in one beat (her surprise, the lantern's hum response) but doesn't constrain a later choice or generate visible cost. The trait is specific and non-swappable, but its causal role is limited to that moment; it doesn't shape tactics or return at closure. One beat involvement without follow-through, landing low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Steer" is the core verb of Liora's action: she steers the light with will, bending reflection to carve a path and hold back shadows. It appears in setup (duty to steer the unseen), middle (steering the beam like a blade), and closure (steered the storm before it steered her). Two beats show her steering actively, and it frames the ending. However, the mechanics are vague—will alone, no trade-off—so it doesn't narrow options with felt cost. Present across structure, moderate causal weight, mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Total internal reflection" is named once mid-story as a trick that traps glow in an endless loop. It's signaled but not mechanically developed; the reader doesn't see how this specific optics principle enables or constrains her tactics. It reappears obliquely when she "bends the reflection," but the means could be generic light-manipulation. Present in setup and middle, but swappable for "refraction" or "light magic" without loss. Functional mention, low causal leverage, caps below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse anchors every beat: spiral stairs, lantern chamber, glass panes, harbor below. It supplies the resources (wick, oil, glass) that Liora uses to enact the ritual and shapes her spatial choreography (ascent, descent). The setting pressures her choices—wick height, light angle—and charges the ending image (lighthouse waiting, hungry). Setup, middle, and closure all depend on this exact place. Essential across structure with causal shaping and closure linkage, entering high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the last print newspaper" is mentioned once in setup ("the world below had long since abandoned print") and echoed in closure ("unprinted headlines"). It establishes era but doesn't tighten decisions or tactics; Liora's ritual operates the same regardless of this detail. The timeframe is ornamental flavor rather than a constraint that narrows options. Present in setup and closure as thematic accent, no causal pressure, capping low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is Liora's implicit motivation: she manipulates the wick and shadows to ensure morning arrives. It's dramatized in her refusal to the shadows ("You can't have it. Not yet") and the closure statement that she shapes dawn. However, internal friction is absent—she never doubts or weighs cost; the desire is enacted without conflict. Setup and closure gates met, desire shown in action, but no want-versus-cost tension, mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone of "shadowed elation" is coherent throughout: Liora's laughter is wild and sharp, not joyful but weaponized; the storm "gleeful," her smile recurring amid ominous imagery (shadows clawing, sky splitting). Tone modulates with pressure—calm ritual escalates to tense refusal, then eases to warm descent—and charges the ending (laughter carried to sea, shadows waiting). The tone supports closure without flattening into single mood, entering low-7s for sustained, modulated presence.</comment>
