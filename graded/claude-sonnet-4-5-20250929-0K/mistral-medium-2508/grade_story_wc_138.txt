<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lysander's boredom and desire for goodbye are clearly signaled, but his internal contradictions remain largely decorative. The dropping of the amulet feels motivated by curiosity rather than earned through on-page struggle between contradictory impulses. The embodied emotion is sparse—most interiority is abstract philosophizing ("boredom was a slow poison") rather than concrete perception under pressure. The final choice lacks visible cost because we never see what path is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the escondite's transformation accumulates through sensory intensification and conceptual layering toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant—Lysander's "first honest thing" crystallizes a stance with palpable reweighting). The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (letting go, dimensional dispersal), though the felt stakes remain somewhat abstract. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The lens holds without contradiction, and one meaningful deepening occurs when he drops the fragment and the escondite dissolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered through color, sound, and spatial distortion; "walls shifting between violet and bruise-blue" and "floor became the ceiling became a memory" ground the reader in a coherent alien space. The setting actively constrains and enables: the escondite's magnetic language responds to the amulet, the storm bends light outside, and spatial mutiny shapes Lysander's final act. The micro-setting (ice pillar, amulet fragment) charges the closure image when walls dissolve. Minor: some sensory selection could be tighter under the POV's priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lysander presses the fragment to the pillar, triggering the escondite's transformation and forcing his leap into the unknown. The cost is conceptual (dimensional dispersal, loss of fixed identity) and legible in the final beats ("maybe he was everywhere"). However, the escalation is more atmospheric than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; the amulet's expansion does most of the work. No explicit antagonist or secondary pressure complicates the path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—letting go as an honest acknowledgment rather than an ending—emerges through the amulet's curse-as-curiosity, the escondite's question-not-place transformation, and Lysander's laugh in the void. The final image (copper vein replacing the fragment, walking with the void) reweights prior material with non-literal resonance. Minor slip: "Goodbye wasn't an ending. / It was the first honest thing he'd ever said" edges toward overt statement rather than pure image. Subtext operates well in the storm's stillness and the whispered universe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with strong rhythmic control: "geometry gone feral," "hushed thunder of a universe leaning in to hear the punchline." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature reads as an immortal's weary, curious gaze. Minor issue: some elevated diction ("prismatic escondite," "spatial mutiny") risks register drift from Lysander's internal lexicon, though it remains largely voice-motivated. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and pay off at closure. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; imagery is often vivid and specific ("jagged sliver of black glass, veined with copper"). However, several paraphrase loops and near-synonym cycles appear: "curious" and "curiosity" recur within tight spans; "the escondite shuddered" / "The escondite wasn't a place anymore" restates transformation without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the short declarative beats near the end ("Lysander closed his eyes. / When he opened them..."). Some figurative density in non-peak beats ("prismatic," "fractal ice," "feral geometry") without clear payoff. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of bored immortal, spatial rebellion, and cursed object as door rather than trap offers a fresh angle on familiar material. The escondite's transformation from place to question is specific and non-obvious. However, the immortal-seeking-meaning and object-as-threshold tropes are well-worn, and the story's emotional arc—curiosity leading to release—follows a predictable template. Specificity in world rules (magnetic fields, dimensional argument) and the final image (copper vein) elevate originality. Risk-taking in lyric compression is purposeful but does not fully escape the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lysander is present throughout and his choice to drop the fragment creates the key turn. However, his role is more observer than active agent for much of the piece; the amulet's expansion does the causal heavy lifting. His decision is signaled by his desire but not deeply conflicted on the page. Present in closure (walking with the void) but the cost is conceptual rather than a visible tradeoff in tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amulet fragment appears in the opening beat (veined sliver in his coat), is handled when pressed to the pillar (mid-beat causal action), expands to rewrite the escondite (closure participation), and returns transformed as a copper vein in the final image. It narrows options (triggers spatial mutiny) and its curse-as-curiosity reweights the ending. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; indispensable to the transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is defined early ("location rebelled against its own coordinates"), demonstrated when the floor becomes ceiling, and drives the escondite's dissolution into fluid space. It shapes stakes (Lysander respects this rebellion) and enables the ending's dimensional dispersal. However, it functions more as atmospheric mechanism than a problem that alters protagonist tactics or forces a trade-off. Present in closure but the concept could be replaced with another reality-bending frame without fundamentally breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Dimensionally aware" is mentioned once in the ending ("dimensionally aware in a way that had nothing to do with sight or sound") but does not constrain or enable prior choices. It describes Lysander's state after transformation rather than shaping his decision to drop the fragment. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to the trait on the page. Late arrival, label-only use, and no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Intrigue" does not appear as an action on the page. Lysander's trajectory is discovery and release, not scheming or plotting. If interpreted broadly as curiosity-driven exploration, it is present throughout, but the required action as named is absent. Without the specified action, the story's turns (pressing the fragment, letting go) remain intact. Functional absence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are signaled early ("storm's magnetic surges," "escondite's language") and shape the amulet's response (copper veins glow, fragment pulses). The method is present when Lysander presses the fragment to the pillar, triggering the transformation. However, the mechanics are atmospheric rather than tactical; the fields enable rather than constrain. Present in two beats and closure-adjacent, but the method could be replaced with another trigger without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is established in the opening line, its walls and gravity shape Lysander's movements and choices (pressing the fragment to the ice pillar), and it actively transforms in the climax—becoming fluid, then a question, then dispersing into void. The setting is indispensable: remove the escondite's responsive physics and the story's logic collapses. It constrains (magnetic language), enables (spatial mutiny), and charges the closure (dissolution into sky/sea/breath). Present in setup, development, and payoff with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The solar storm is mentioned in the opening ("solar storm outside bent light into knives"), its magnetic surges pulse the amulet, and it "stuttered, then stilled" at the transformation, bracketing the action. However, it does not impose a deadline or narrow Lysander's choices; it functions as atmospheric accent rather than a ticking clock. Present in setup and closure but does not tighten tactics. Lyric reprise reweights slightly but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lysander's desire to discover what happens after goodbye is stated early ("whispered, 'It wants to know what happens when you let go'"), drives his choice to drop the fragment, and is paid off in the ending ("Goodbye wasn't an ending. / It was the first honest thing he'd ever said"). The motivation is conflicted (he has spent lifetimes leaving things but never truly letting go) and visible cost appears (dimensional dispersal, loss of fixed self). Strong causal linkage and closure participation, though the internal friction could be more embodied in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone as "hushed thunder" is coherent: quiet intensity runs through the prose ("hushed thunder of a universe leaning in to hear the punchline") and modulates with pressure (the escondite hums, then shudders, then breathes; the storm stills). The tone charges the final image (void whispers back, Lysander walks forward). However, the tonal register is somewhat uniform across beats; more variation under peak pressure would sharpen the effect. Present in setup, development, and closure with good specificity.</comment>
