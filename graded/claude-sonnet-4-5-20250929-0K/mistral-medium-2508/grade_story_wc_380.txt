<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lighter's grief-driven obsession is embodied through specific, ritual actions (coffee grounds, wildflowers, the stone), and his micro-choices under pressure feel motivated. Internal contradiction is present—his continued work lighting lanterns against his compulsion to excavate memory—though the chamber scene could show more moment-to-moment hesitation. The final renunciation (emptying his pockets) carries visible cost and forecloses the path, earning the change. Minor issue: the wife's vanishing is told rather than dramatized, weakening the emotional anchor slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the opening paragraphs. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through ritual repetition, sensory density in the chamber, and the gravitational pull metaphor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when he discards the tools and accepts that memories are "taken," not lost. The cost is legible on the page—he loses his method and must begin again, knowing the futility. One meaningful deepening occurs in the chamber when the stone disintegrates and he sees her silhouette, reweighting his understanding of what he's chasing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered with tactile, olfactory detail (ozone, old pennies, salt-crusted floor) and directly constrains the lighter's action—he kneels where the pull is strongest, uses the wildflowers as compass. The docks, whale carcass, and tide provide a coherent micro-setting that charges the final image (emptying his pockets into saltwater). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor gap: the chamber's physical layout and the mechanics of the "pockets of gravity" remain slightly abstract, but the sensory signature is strong enough to elevate the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: recover his wife's vanished memories. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through the stone's shifting weight and the chamber's gravitational pull, tightening to the moment when the stone disintegrates and he glimpses her silhouette—a reversal that narrows his options and forces recognition. The final act (discarding his tools) is driven by his agency and carries visible cost: he forfeits his method but commits to beginning again. The ending leaves consequences open yet legible, with the stirring below suggesting persistent danger. Strong escalation and cost clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and event: memories as excavated rather than faded, gravity as hunger, deletion as storage. The final image—tide swallowing the grounds, the stone sinking without ripple—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (where do deleted memories go?) without stating a moral. The whale bones, lanterns, and gravitational pockets accumulate symbolic weight that recharges at closure. The piece resists easy resolution, embracing ambiguity (he'll try again, knowing it may kill him) without confusion. Minor issue: "the gravity was always hungry" edges toward explicit theme statement, but it's anchored in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and textured—diction like "grotesque blooms," "yawning wide," and "gravity pooled like ink" creates a specific perceptual signature. POV distance is stable; the lighter's professional idiom (lanterns, brass hook, wicks) and grief-soaked attention filter all sensory detail. The phrase "her name... wasn't a voice. It was a *shape*" demonstrates strong control under peak pressure. Minor slips: "lead weight" and "thick as mud" are stock phrases that slightly flatten texture in key beats, and one filter-verb cluster ("he'd seen the truth") in the backstory block reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. The opening ("moved through the docks like a shadow with a flame") and closure image (tide rolling in, "something *stirred*") are strong. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "memories didn't fade. They were *excavated*" is immediately followed by "That was why he'd started digging," restating the same idea. Template cadence appears in the pocket-inventory opening and the repetitive "The chamber was... the crystals... the air..." sequence. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in this category and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of dockside labor, grief, and speculative gravity pockets is specific and non-obvious. The coffee-grounds divination and wildflower compass offer fresh tactical detail, and the idea that memories are "stored" in gravitational anomalies transforms the familiar grief-quest premise. The lantern-lighter's occupation is well-integrated, shaping both routine and obsession. The piece takes a structural risk with heavy Accumulative pacing and a quiet ending, heightening stakes without gimmickry. Minor limitation: the whale-beaches-again framing at the end gestures toward cyclical repetition without fully dramatizing what makes the next attempt different, slightly reducing inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in opening, drives the chamber descent (middle), and makes the final disposal choice (closure). His decisions—brewing coffee, pressing flowers, discarding tools—create key turns and narrow options with visible cost. Irreplaceable: his occupation (lighting lanterns) contrasts his compulsion (excavating darkness) and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Signaled early (pockets), used in the chamber as compass (petals curl toward gravity), and return blackened at closure, reweighting their function from guide to casualty. Two distinct beats with evolving state. However, they enable rather than constrain a choice, and their specific properties (pressed, wildflowers) are somewhat swappable with other organic markers. Solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity shape stakes from the opening explanation, supply the chamber's pressure (stone lurches, crystals tremble), and drive the climactic moment when gravity "yawns wide" and the stone disintegrates. The concept alters tactics (he kneels where pull is strongest) and charges the final image (gravity is "always hungry"). Irreplaceable: the entire excavation metaphor depends on this exact mechanism. Strong causal presence across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mysterious fluctuation appears in the foreman's dismissal ("flaw in the harvest"), is embodied in the stone's shifting weight (setup and chamber), and triggers the climactic disintegration. It constrains the lighter's understanding and tactics. However, "mysteriously" is more descriptor than enacted trait—the fluctuation could be "unpredictably" or "erratically" with minor edits. Present across beats but not uniquely specified in action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Exhumation is signaled early ("he would exhume what was left of her"), drives the chamber ritual (pressing flowers, kneeling, waiting), and defines the climactic turn when he glimpses her silhouette before the method fails. The metaphor (memories are buried, not lost) structures his tactics and the final realization. Strong middle and closure presence. Minor swap risk: "retrieve" or "recover" would function similarly without breaking logic, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Coffee grounds appear early (pocket inventory, morning ritual), guide him to the chamber site (spirals "tight and desperate"), and swirl into a vortex during the climactic moment, then scatter in an unrecognizable pattern. Two to three beats with evolving function. However, the mechanics are thin—how exactly the grounds "led him" or why their new pattern matters is summary-asserted rather than dramatized. Functional but the specificity of "coffee grounds" versus any divination medium is underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber frames the dominant stake (where gravity pools), supplies the climactic pressure (crystals tremble, air tilts, facets scatter light), and delivers the closure reversal (chamber goes dull, gravity snaps back). The lighter kneels, presses flowers into the salt-crusted floor, and the environment directly alters his perception and options. Irreplaceable: no other setting would generate the gravitational and sensory conditions that define the attempt and failure. Strong across all three gates with high causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whale appears in the opening (beached at dawn, skeleton half-picked), supplies thematic weight (things forgotten and scavenged), and returns in the final section ("By the time the next whale beached, he'd be ready"), bracketing the attempt and signaling cyclical repetition. Lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake. However, the whale does not constrain a middle choice or tighten a live clock during the chamber scene—it's ornamental framing rather than active pressure. Solid setup and thematic payoff, but middle development is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized early (wife's voice vanishing, "memories didn't fade. They were *excavated*"), drives every tactical choice (coffee grounds, wildflowers, chamber descent), and is tested at closure when he sees her silhouette-scream and then discards his tools, accepting the cost. Internal friction is present: he continues his lantern-lighter duties even as obsession pulls him down. The desire shapes the final image (he'll begin again, knowing it may kill him). Strong causal and closure presence with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("gleaming silence of the crystal chamber," "silent stars") and modulates under pressure: the chamber scene intensifies into "tearing paper," ozone, and gravitational rupture, then deflates to "dull," "stale." The final image ("tide rolled in, gleaming and silent") reprises the tone and charges it with futility and persistence. Coherent across turns. However, "gleaming silence" is more poetic label than enacted sensory texture in some beats—the mechanics of silence under pressure could be sharpened. Solid but not indispensable.</comment>
