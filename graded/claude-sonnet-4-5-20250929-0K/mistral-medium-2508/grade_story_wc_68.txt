<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is rendered through contradictory impulses—hoarding relics while knowing survival demands selling them, intellectualizing his pain while physically agonizing over objects. His final choice to stand in the tunnel's mouth with the cog is earned by prior causality: his mother's death, the council's indifference, his week of hauling evidence into the vault. The embodied detail is strong ("fingers twitched," "hands bled," "voice rough as rust"), though Veyra remains a functional messenger without interior pressure. Elias's renunciation forecloses survival with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (sewer, Elias, workbench, chronometer cog). The piece follows a causal lens: Elias finds the cog → agonizes over preservation → Veyra warns of flooding → he builds his vault → confronts the Archives crew → chooses witness over escape. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias stands, the water rises, he understands witnessing trumps saving, and the cost is his life—legible in "The last thing he saw" and the clerk's dismissive record. One persistent constraint (the city's erasure machinery) shapes tactics and the final image. The cog "ticking" in silt delivers conceptual cost: the truth persists but unheard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sewer is rendered through sensory specifics (copper stench, dripping grates, brackish water, rusted iron) and layered history (plague victims' silt, child's shoe, doctor's spectacles, dockworker's bones). The environment constrains Elias's choices—he works in a vault the Archives will flood, and the tunnel's mouth becomes his final stand. The cog's weight, the rising water, and the clerk's gleaming office above all charge the ending. Spatial choreography is clear (workbench, grates, lower tunnels, tunnel mouth), and the "sedimentary layers" function as both metaphor and literal excavation site.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving truth against official erasure—is signaled early and tightens through Veyra's warning, Elias's week of vault-building, and the final confrontation. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: he moves from polishing one cog to hoarding an archive to blocking the pumps with his body. The foreman's laugh and "History's written by the dry" mark the reversal where Elias's physical stand cannot stop the machinery. The cost is unambiguous: he drowns, the clerk records "structural failure," but the cog ticks on in the silt—a trade-off between witness and survival that the story earns through prior pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the cog as "counterargument," the city's "sanitized ledgers," the sedimentary layers as truth fossilized beneath official narrative. Elias's final realization—"some things weren't meant to be saved. They were meant to *witness*"—is earned by the dockworker dream and the week of agonizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer via image: the ticking cog in silt versus the clerk's dismissive line, charging the question of whose truth endures. No moralizing; the resonance lies in the juxtaposition of Elias's choice and the Archives' oblivious record. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, filtering all detail through Elias's obsessive, literate perspective ("a rat who'd read too many books," "penitent"). Diction is specific and character-particular ("expedience," "superstitious clutter," "Garbage lasts"). Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and distinct: Veyra's pragmatic jabs versus Elias's aphoristic bitterness, the foreman's dry laugh. Psychic distance tightens under pressure ("his own pulse synced to its silent rhythm"). One brief filter-verb stack in the dream sequence ("wasn't drowning—he was *building*") does not obscure immediacy. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propels: short bursts in crisis ("The pumps started. The water rose. Elias didn't move.") contrast with layered reflection earlier. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Two minor issues: "a sound like a spark in damp tinder" (Veyra's exhale) is strained, and "The threat hung there, heavy as the cog" is near-cliché. The opening ("stank of old copper and newer lies") and closing (ticking cog juxtaposed with the clerk's dismissal) bracket the piece effectively. No loops or scaffolding; clarity remains high even in figurative moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-plague sunken city, sewer-dwelling archivist, and chronometer cog as rebellion is specific and cohesive. The narrative of preservation versus erasure is familiar, but the piece grounds it in visceral particulars (sedimentary excavation, the week of bleeding hands, the literal drowning as witness). The final twist—Elias understanding witnessing over saving—feels earned rather than imposed. Veyra and the foreman remain functional archetypes. The "ticking" cog in silt after Elias drowns is a strong, non-obvious closure image that resists tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (wannabe philosopher in sewer) is setup early, shapes two major beats (the vault-building decision after Veyra's warning, the final confrontation blocking the tunnel), and his interior philosophizing ("Garbage lasts," "Stories rot," the witness epiphany) drives the ending. His choice to stand with the cog is causally rooted in his mother's death and the council's indifference. The character is irreplaceable—his literate, obsessive perspective filters all detail and stakes. Visible cost: he drowns. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The chronometer cog appears in the opening line, is handled across four beats (workbench examination, decision not to sell, dream integration, final stand holding it up), and charges the closure ("the cog settled into the silt, ticking"). Its specific properties—pitted brass, worn teeth, "weight perfect," silent rhythm synced to Elias's pulse—make it irreplaceable as the story's central symbol of measured truth versus narrative erasure. The ticking in silt after Elias drowns delivers the conceptual cost. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5, lyric reprise +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Competing narratives (core concept) is setup early (official "mercy" vs. Elias's "expedience," new historians "rewriting everything," "sanitized ledgers") and shapes stakes: Elias's preservation effort is a rebellion against the Archives' erasure. The concept drives the vault-building decision and the final confrontation. Closure participation is strong: the clerk's dismissive record ("structural failure") versus the ticking cog literalizes the competition. The concept alters options—Elias chooses witness over escape because the narrative war matters more than survival. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4, cost +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is embodied through Elias's choices: he reads the plague records, hoards evidence methodically, and articulates his rebellion in aphorisms ("Progress is a story they tell so they don't have to say *sorry*"). The trait constrains his final choice—he stands in the tunnel with reasoned defiance rather than fleeing. However, the trait is more stated than tested under competing impulses; his rationality and rebellion align without friction. Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.4, cost +0.3. Swappability −0.3 (could be "principled defiant").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Agonize (action) is setup early ("agonized over the cog like a penitent") and drives two major beats: the week of vault-building ("worked until his hands bled, until the pain was a kind of clarity") and the dream sequence where agonizing transforms into understanding. The action is irreplaceable—Elias's extended, embodied struggle (tracing gears, bleeding hands, syncing pulse to the cog) earns his final stance. Closure linkage is strong: his realization that "some things weren't meant to be saved" crystallizes only after sustained agonizing. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through sedimentary layers" (method) is setup early (Elias traces the cog's history "through the sedimentary layers of the sewer's history—here, a child's shoe; there, a doctor's smashed spectacles") and structures his excavation work. The method shapes the vault-building beat (sorting and hiding objects by layer) and charges the ending: the cog "settled into the silt" as a new sedimentary deposit, continuing the layered record. The method is specific to the setting and irreplaceable. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6, cost +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sunken city ruins (setting) are established early ("the sunken city's ribs groaned," grates, layers of silt) and constrain all choices: Elias works in a vault the Archives will flood, and the tunnel's confined space forces his final stand. The setting provides the materials (relics buried in silt) and the threat (rising water). Closure participation is decisive: the water rises, Elias drowns, and the cog "settled into the silt" within the ruins. The setting is irreplaceable—no other environment would support the sedimentary metaphor or the literal drowning-as-witness ending. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" (timeframe) is setup early (plague victims dumped in silt, mother's death during quarantine, "the way the rich had fled") and motivates Elias's distrust of official narratives. The timeframe enables the Archives' revisionism ("rewriting everything") and the clearing of the tunnels. However, the timeframe does not tighten a live clock—Veyra warns the flooding is coming, but no countdown pressures Elias's choices. The ending confirms the plague is past context, not present pressure. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.5, closure linkage +0.3, specificity +0.3. Missing live-clock pressure −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Preserve ancient methods (motivation) is setup early (the cog as "proof that time could be measured without their sanitized ledgers," clocks declared "superstitious clutter") and drives two major beats: Elias's decision not to sell the cog and the week of vault-building. Friction appears when Veyra points out he could eat for a month if he sold it, and when the foreman mocks his stand. Closure participation is decisive: Elias's final realization shifts from preservation to witnessing, reweighting the motivation with conceptual cost. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.5, cost +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" (tone) is established early ("The sewer stank of old copper and newer lies," Elias's bitter aphorisms, the mocking drip of water) and modulates under pressure: calm reflection during vault-building, rising urgency as the pumps start, and final stillness as Elias watches the cog catch light. The tone charges the ending—Elias "didn't move," his calm refusal juxtaposed with the foreman's laugh and the clerk's dismissive record. The tone is coherent across beats and specific to Elias's literate, weary defiance. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6. Minor slip: "mocking applause" (dripping water) borders on decorative. −0.3.</comment>
