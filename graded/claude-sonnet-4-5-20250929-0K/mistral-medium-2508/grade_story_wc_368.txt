<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dye master's interiority is consistently rendered through concrete perception (the wing's iridescence, the ink moving), and the donor heart provides a bodily anchor for his search. The central motivation—understanding magnetism—remains abstract; the final realization ("the heart didn't magnetize stories. It recognized the cracks") arrives as assertion rather than through a specific on-page choice that demonstrates the insight. Embodied contradictions are limited; the character moves smoothly from curiosity to understanding without visible internal friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (dye master, floating tea house, post-transplant). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the wing's dissolution and the painted stories in the village accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration in which the protagonist's heart "settled into its new rhythm, no longer borrowed, but his own." Cost is felt (the wing dissolves, the journey exhausts him) and the final image of silence as invitation reweights the opening restlessness. One meaningful deepening occurs when he paints in the village and the villagers reach for each other, shifting his understanding from magnetism to recognition of need.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house, valley mist, and the morpho wing create a vivid micro-setting. The wing constrains choice: its dissolution into his palm marks the journey's cost and charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("its steam curling into the shape of a question mark"). Spatial choreography is clean across the tea house, bridge, and village square. The setting's verticality (floating rock, yawning valley) mirrors the protagonist's internal suspension and grounds the final invitation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dye master unfolds the wing in the village square and the stories come through him, forcing a realization that narrows his initial question. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (he chooses to travel, to paint) and the cost is visible (the wing dissolves, his arms burn). No major reversal; the discovery flows smoothly without friction or competing options that test commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the morpho wing's iridescence as caution, the heart's rhythm, the dye bleeding into patterns. The final image—silence as invitation—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The realization about "cracks where stories needed to be" grounds the abstract magnetism in concrete human need. Subtext operates in gesture (villagers' fingers brushing) and implication (the steeping cup's question mark). The ending reweights prior material with undeniable thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: diction choices ("the texture of crushed petals," "cautions written in light") sustain a lyric register without drift. POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (sight filtered through a dye master's attention to color and light). The woman's dialogue feels slightly ornamental ("You're looking for the why") but serves subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Some elevated phrasing at peak beats ("the quiet explosion of being seen") approaches overwriting but remains voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, character, or atmosphere. Minor template cadence in the opening (three consecutive "The [noun]" stems) and a paraphrase loop mid-story ("not to him, but through him" / "not for the images, but for each other") reduce propulsion slightly. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "a held breath" for iridescence works, though "the texture of crushed petals" for voice is ornamental. No causality breaks. Clarity and momentum hold through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of donor-heart transplant, iridescent wing, and dye master's craft feels specific and non-obvious. The risk—tracking intangible magnetism through literal light trails and dissolving pigment—pays off at closure when the protagonist internalizes the sun's trails. The emotional calculus (recognition over power, filling cracks over pulling crowds) avoids template resolutions. Transformation is clear: the core premise (understanding story magnetism) could not sustain the same arc with generic swaps. Bold but legible throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dye master is present throughout and his choices (pinning the wing, mixing ink, traveling, painting in the square) create key beats. His observation is active and leads to decisions (he packs vials, follows the map, paints until the wing dissolves). The final turn—carrying sun trails inside him—traces to his accumulated watchfulness. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and closure linkage all present. Moderate causal pressure; the decisions are motivated but feel guided more by accumulation than high-stakes friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in the opening, is pinned to track sunlight, returns when unfolded in the village square to catalyze the painted stories, and dissolves into his palm as the journey's cost. Four distinct beats; the wing's physical transformation (from iridescence to brittle black to dissolution) tracks the protagonist's internal arc. It shapes tactics (he follows sun trails it teaches him to read) and charges the closure (its absence allows him to carry the trails internally). Strongly integrated with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" is seeded early (the wing's light shifts "to a warning gold") and returns at closure ("iridescent and cautious, a map of all the stories he would never tell"). It shapes the middle beat when he learns to read cautions written in light. The concept influences perception more than tactics; it does not narrow a high-stakes choice on the page. Present across setup, development, and payoff; lyric reprise reweights the stake. Moderate integration; more thematic echo than operational constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is invoked once in the phrase "the quiet explosion of being seen" but does not function as a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. The protagonist's demeanor is watchful and methodical, not marked by visible friction between restraint and force. The attribute is ornamental—a single figurative moment rather than a character engine. No setup beat, no middle choice shaped by this quality, no closure participation. Functional as a descriptor but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives the central action: the dye master tracks light through the wing, paints with ink that moves and takes shape, and in the village square illuminates stories through dye patterns on cobblestones. The act of illumination is both literal (light, color) and figurative (making stories visible). Two major beats (painting the moving ink, painting in the square) and closure linkage (he carries sun trails inside). Causal pressure is strong; the method is specific and irreplaceable. The act redefines his role from seeker to conduit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails is signaled early (he pins the wing "where the dawn would strike it first" and begins "tracking the sun's path across the sky"), explicitly named by the woman's map ("its paths marked by sun trails"), and at closure he no longer needs to track externally because he carries the trails inside. Present in setup, middle travel choice, and payoff. The method shapes his journey and the ending image. Moderate causal pressure; it guides rather than constrains high-friction choices. Lyric reprise strengthens integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house is vividly described (wooden beams groaning, mist curling through gaps, lanterns of colored glass) and bookends the story. It provides a departure point and a return destination, framing the journey. The setting does not pressure a middle choice or supply resources that alter outcome; it functions as atmospheric anchor and symbolic home. Present in opening and closure but absent from the village-square turning point. Lyric resonance without operational constraint trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after receiving the donor heart" is noted ("three moons prior") but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The heart's rhythm provides interiority and motivation but time itself is vague (the journey occurs "by dawn," the village painting happens in one untracked span). No live clock alters tactics; the transplant is backstory context rather than a pressure mechanism. Setup present, minimal middle role, closure reference indirect ("the heart settled into its new rhythm"). Functional context, low causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation—to learn why some people magnetize stories—is stated clearly and drives the journey and the painting in the village square. The desire is conflicted (he wants understanding "not for power" and the heart "ached when he passed the market square"). The final realization ("the heart didn't magnetize stories. It recognized the cracks") directly answers the question. Two beats of active pursuit with visible cost (exhaustion, wing dissolution). The motivation is told more than dramatized through competing impulses, but it shapes choices and closure solidly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder is established immediately ("mist curled through the gaps, thick enough to mute the world below") and sustained through lyric diction ("steam curling into the shape of a question mark," "the quiet explosion of being seen"). Tone modulates with pressure: wonder mixes with bodily urgency when he paints until his arms burn, then returns to stillness at closure ("the silence in the tea house felt like an invitation"). Coherent through turns and charges the final image. The tone is a consistent atmospheric layer that amplifies theme without forcing moments.</comment>
