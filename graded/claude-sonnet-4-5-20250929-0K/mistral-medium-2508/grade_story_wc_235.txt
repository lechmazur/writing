<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dual-Elias structure creates interesting internal contradiction, but their motivations blur—why does Younger want to burn the scroll? The embodied emotion is strong ("feral nostalgia clawed at his ribs"), yet the final choice to "soar" feels asserted rather than earned through prior micro-decisions that foreclose other paths. The jealousy of past selves is told more than dramatized in pressure moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: the scroll's shifting glyphs and recursive time structure build density toward a pattern break when Younger burns it and Older steps outside to an empty grave. Orientation anchors (mountain cabin, Elias, post-grave timeframe) land early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis turning to release): trembling hands steady, grave empties, he soars—cost is the relinquishing of the chronicler role with visible consequence (ash, empty grave). One meaningful deepening occurs when the scroll is burned and the cycle breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cabin's "timber bones groaning," wind that "knew him," and pines "counting down" create vivid atmosphere. The grave outside and desk inside anchor spatial choreography. The birch bark scroll physically constrains choices (traced, clutched, burned), charging the final image when its ash settles and Elias steps out. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (fogging windowpane, sharp mountain air).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escape the chronicler loop—is signaled early and tightens when Younger arrives with an identical scroll. The burn decision is a meaningful reversal that narrows options (no more revisions possible). Agency is clear: Older offers the choice, Younger lights the match, Older walks outside. The cost is visible (scroll destroyed, role abandoned, hands no longer tremble) and forecloses the revision path. Accumulative pressure coheres through recursive imagery (scroll, grave, cabin) until the pattern breaks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the futility of chronicling chaos, the choice between documentation and participation—emerges through concrete action (burning the scroll) rather than statement. The final image ("Soared") reweights prior material: the glyph shifts from aspiration to reality, the myth becomes embodied without explaining itself. Subtext operates in the scroll's self-revising ink and the empty grave. No moralizing; the piece embraces ambiguity (did he really soar?) while landing a resonant answer to whether one can escape self-narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Older Elias's POV with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "sheer weight of revision," "static," "wound" metaphors recur in character-specific ways. The dialogue between Eliases is terse and goal-driven ("You're early" / "You're late"), carrying subtext about cyclical inevitability. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("chronicler who'd outlived his own story") that feels slightly authorial, but voice remains largely coherent under pressure. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and most sentences advance multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the scroll's nature is restated across multiple paragraphs (ink shimmer, revision weight, glyph transformations), and the "time as wound" concept is repeated without added pressure. Template cadence in the countdown section ("Three. / Two. / One.") is purposeful but the "(Or never here. / Or both.)" pattern recurs mechanically. Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching, occasionally obscuring causality (how exactly do glyphs rearrange themselves?). Information density is strong, but loop check fails in the scroll-description cluster.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dual-self confrontation and self-revising scroll offer a fresh angle on time-loop and writer's-block premises. The recursive structure (past/future selves meeting, glyphs rewriting) feels specific to this voice and metaphysical logic. The ending's leap from chronicler to embodied participant is earned in hindsight by the scroll-burning turn. However, the core premise echoes familiar metafictional loops (writer trapped in own story), and the timeframe element (grave with past death date) is not fully transformed—it functions as setup but doesn't constrain middle choices distinctly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias as lucid dream chronicler frames the setup (documenting dreams, carving runes) and drives two key beats: tracing the glyph and offering the scroll to Younger. The role shapes the dominant stake (escape chronicling) and participates in closure when he steps outside with steady hands, role abandoned. Cost is visible: he can no longer revise. However, "lucid dream" specificity isn't essential—"time-loop chronicler" would function identically. Present in all three gates, drives two beats, but swappability and moderate irreplaceability limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears in setup (unraveling, traced), middle (clutched by Younger, glyphs rearranging), and closure (burned to ash that settles on the desk, freeing Older's hands). It drives three distinct beats: Older traces the glyph, Younger receives it and watches it transform, Younger burns it and the scream releases both. The scroll's specific properties (self-revising ink, bark medium) matter causally: its destruction is the mechanism that breaks the loop. Removing it would collapse the story's central action. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage; only slight swappability (another medium could theoretically work) prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia is named early and shapes interiority ("jealous of past selves," longing for the whole Elias who tasted blackberry wine). It reappears in closure ("Somewhere, a past self was still jealous") and charges the final decision to abandon chronicling. However, it functions primarily as emotional color rather than tactical constraint—the plot would proceed similarly if framed as regret or despair. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance, but does not narrow on-page options distinctly. Lyric reprise reweights the stake moderately.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is signaled early (grave date three years past, "time had never been linear"), enables the dual-self meeting (Younger and Older coexist), and reappears in closure (past/future selves referenced as he soars). The trait constrains the middle beat: only chronological confusion allows Younger to appear and burn the scroll. Cost is visible: confusion traps him in recursive loops until the burn. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what specific price does confusion impose on each attempt? Present in all gates, enables key action, but lacks granular cost detail. Strong integration with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Soar" is seeded early (glyph traced, dream of flying over peaks, "wings made of memory and static"), questioned in the middle beat (Younger asks "Did you ever fly?"), and becomes the final word/action. It redefines the closure: the myth becomes real when he steps outside with steady hands. Removing "soar" would require a different symbolic endpoint. The action drives two beats (tracing, questioning) and defines closure, with visible transformation from aspiration to embodiment. Strong closure linkage and causal role; slight abstraction (how does soaring manifest?) prevents top band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Getting jealous of past selves" is named early ("feral nostalgia... jealous of past selves") and motivates Older's offer to Younger (hoping the boy will distill better). It reappears in closure ("Somewhere, a past self was still jealous"). However, jealousy shapes interiority more than tactical decisions—the plot hinges on the burn choice, not jealousy mechanics. Present in setup and closure with thematic weight, but doesn't constrain middle action distinctly. Lyric reprise reweights meaning moderately but lacks middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin anchors all action, its "timber bones groaning" and "same desk" emphasizing recursive entrapment. The cabin's isolation enables the dual-self meeting (no witnesses), and stepping outside into mountain air is the closure gesture. The desk and windowpane are handled concretely. However, the cabin could be replaced by any isolated structure; its ranger-specific properties (trails, lookout function) are unused. Present in all gates, spatially coherent, participates in closure, but moderate swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After seeing your own grave" is established early (grave outside, date three years past) and frames urgency (he shouldn't exist now). The grave reappears in closure (empty) and charges the final image: its emptiness proves he's escaped the timeline. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten middle decisions—Younger's arrival and the burn would occur the same way if the grave were absent. Present in setup and closure with symbolic payoff, but lacks middle pressure. Lyric reprise is purposeful but development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is dramatized early (scroll as "desperate attempt to distill chaos into something legible"), tested when Younger asks if the glyphs are "supposed to" rearrange, and resolved when Older says "be the one who burns the scrolls" and walks outside with steady hands. The desire drives the central conflict: chronicling traps him; abandoning it frees him. Cost is visible (scroll destroyed, role renounced). The motivation shapes three beats and closure, with clear friction between want (control via narrative) and cost (perpetual revision). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is embodied early ("Not really. But the dream had been so *convincing*.") and sustained through turns: the scroll's shimmer is met with weary recognition, the scream is unsurprising ("He'd heard it before"), yet the final "Soared" carries genuine awe. Tone modulates with pressure—clinical during the dual-self exchange, raw at the burn, elevated at closure—without breaking coherence. The tone charges the ending: jaded acceptance transforms into wonder without losing its edge. Strong tonal control and closure participation, with purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>
