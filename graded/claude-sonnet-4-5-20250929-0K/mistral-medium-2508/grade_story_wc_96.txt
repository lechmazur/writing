<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior contradictions operate simultaneously—the itch to leave versus the pull to stay—and the final gesture (giving Maren the violet) is an embodied micro-choice that forecloses flight with felt cost. However, the interiority occasionally tilts toward poetic abstraction ("stitched meaning into chaos") rather than character-particular thought, and the name-molting trait remains largely told rather than dramatized in pressure. Maren functions well as a pressure point, but her interior remains opaque; we see her actions, not her stakes. The closure choice is earned, but the path there leans on lyricism more than micro-decisions under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story opens with spatial and temporal anchors (library awning, moon rising) and tracks a continuous scene through dawn. The closure—Elias giving Maren the violet and choosing to stay—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) that crystallizes his stance against the itch to molt, and the final image ("planting something fiercer than fire") reconfigures the opening restlessness with visible cost: he accepts rootedness. The lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through layered image (tin, violet, books) to a cadence shift at dawn. Mild deduction: the middle段 loops thematic statements ("beauty could outlast anarchy," "resistance that grew like vines") without new plot pressure, slightly blunting escalation before the payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library is handled throughout—sagging awning, iron shelves, broken bars—and micro-settings (the coffee tin's false bottom, the lamp, the shelves) constrain and enable action (hiding poems, sorting books). The moon and stars frame the timeframe and charge the final dawn image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("soot and rainwater" ink, "frayed twine"), and spatial choreography remains clear. Strong showing: the violet pressed in *Songs of the Doomed* is a tactile anchor that charges the closure gesture. No occupational depth beyond "librarian" is required here, and none offered; the prison-library context remains sketched rather than systemic, but that economy fits the lyric mode and length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias will stay or molt again—is signaled early via the "itch behind his ribs" and tightens through Maren's察觉 ("You're leaving") and his half-lie. The tin's reopening and the violet exchange constitute one meaningful deepening that narrows options and culminates in his choosing to remain ("the itch quieted"). Under the Accumulative lens, this qualifies as sufficient escalation with felt cost: he forecloses flight. However, the middle third recycles thematic assertions without new tactical pressure, and the guards' future threat ("would come eventually") hovers as abstract menace rather than on-page complication. Agency is present but gentle; the final renunciation is more contemplative than crucible-tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of resistance-through-beauty emerges from concrete particulars (salvaged poems, the pressed violet, books as seeds) and the final image—"planting something fiercer than fire"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether fragile creation can survive anarchy. The tin and violet function as recurring motifs that reweight at closure. Mild penalty: several lines veer into overt thematic statement ("beauty could outlast anarchy," "revolutions softer than gunfire") rather than letting image carry subtext, and the phrase "the only things worth keeping" in the penultimate beat borders on moralizing. The wisdom arises from scene work, but the piece occasionally explains its own metaphor instead of trusting the reader.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a lyric-literary register with controlled rhythm and distinct perceptual signature ("moon clawed free," "silver wound in the sky"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Maren's "You're still here" and Elias's reply carry subtext and goal (mutual acknowledgment of stakes). Psychic distance is stable third-limited on Elias, though brief passages ("some things…were bigger than the names they wore") flirt with omniscient assertion. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but one phrase—"because the act itself was resistance"—reads as authorial interjection rather than Elias's idiom under pressure. Diction remains elevated but coherent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the flow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and sentences mostly multi-task (e.g., "its false bottom hiding not coins but brittle pages" advances object, motive, and history in one breath). Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines bracket well. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "rebuild…rebuilding" across three paragraphs, "bloom" recurring four times without pattern-teaching, and synonym churn ("molted," "molt," "molting") that restates rather than advances. The phrase "luminous thing, held together by hands" in mid-story and "planting something fiercer than fire" at the end both gesture at the same concept without fresh pressure. Template cadence in the final third ("By dawn…And if…He tucked…") flattens propulsion. Apply −0.8 for loop/scaffold density touching the closure neighborhood.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet-rebuilding-a-library frame and the name-molting quirk offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc—choosing community over drift—follows a familiar template (the loner learns connection matters). The pressed violet and false-bottomed tin are specific, verifiable details that personalize the telling, and the prison-riot backdrop adds texture. However, the central turn (restlessness versus rootedness) resolves predictably, and the "beauty outlasts anarchy" thesis arrives well-worn. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and executes competently, but transformation of the trope is modest; swap "vagrant poet" for "wandering musician" or "itinerant artist" and the arc holds unchanged. No close echoes of famous lines, but the resistance-through-art motif is well-trodden ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his final choice—staying, giving the violet—drives the closure. Setup strong (first paragraph), development shows him working with Maren (middle beats), and payoff clear (last beats). His choices matter (opening the tin, lying, then reversing course implicitly), but many beats are observational or reflective rather than decisive. Cost is present (foreclosing flight) but gentle. Mid-band fit: essential to closure, but agency is diffused across atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears in beat one (hiding poems), reopens mid-story when Elias adds the violet, and is rewrapped with twine, signaling his recommitment. Setup, development (repeated use), and payoff (symbolic container of resistance) all present. The false bottom enables concealment (a tactic), and its reopening marks the emotional pivot. However, the tin does not directly constrain a high-pressure choice—it stores rather than complicates. Solid integration, but the object is more vessel than catalyst.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is named explicitly ("survive the bloom," "they would bloom," "one bloom at a time") and thematically present as the library's purpose. Setup implied early (books as seeds), development shows books being sorted and stored, payoff in final image ("planting something fiercer than fire"). However, the concept remains abstract; it does not narrow tactics or create on-page friction. It functions as theme-claim rather than stake-shaper. Present and coherent, but ornamental to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's monthly name-molting is introduced early ("three weeks prior," "another would come soon") and the itch returns at closure, where his choice to stay implicitly resists the next molt. Setup clear, payoff acknowledged (he may molt "by morning" but it won't matter). However, the trait is told, not dramatized—no scene shows a molt, and the itch does not force a tactical trade-off; it merely colors his interiority. Label-only use without visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the story's spine: Elias has been rebuilding the library, and the entire night-scene shows him and Maren continuing that work. Setup (paragraph three: "rebuilding its purpose"), development (sorting books, adding to the tin), and payoff ("rebuilding the only way they knew how"). The action defines both the setting and the resistance-stake. However, it is continuous process rather than a single pivotal turn; removing "rebuild" language would require rewording but not restructuring. Strong presence, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The friendship and its origin (sorting books at the prison library before the riot) are signaled early via Maren's entrance and backstory ("prison librarian-turned-ghost…smuggled past the guards"). The method—collaborative book-work—shapes the entire on-page scene (sorting, shared silence, violet exchange). Setup, development (they work together), and payoff (partnership solidified) all present. However, the prison context and riot are backdrop; the mechanics of how they met do not create on-page friction or constrain a choice. Solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted library supplies the spatial frame, resources (shelves, books, lamp), and stakes (the guards will come). Setup immediate (paragraph one), development sustained (iron shelves, aisles, the lamp), and payoff charges the final image ("the library stood, a rusted heart beating"). The setting enables the resistance (no library, no refuge) and its fragility pressures the timeline. Micro-settings (tin, shelves) constrain and enable action. Strong integration; the library is nearly irreplaceable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe opens with "moon clawed free" and closes at "first light touched the shelves," bracketing a single night. Setup clear, payoff present (dawn arrival), but the clock does not tighten choices in the middle—no escalating countdown or time-pressure forcing faster moves. The passage of hours is implied ("by dawn") but not tracked beat-by-beat. The frame is coherent and charges the ending's mood, but it does not alter tactics. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Forge beauty from anarchy" is dramatized through Elias's and Maren's book-sorting, the violet exchange, and the closing image of planting. Setup (paragraph five: "beauty could outlast anarchy"), development (adding poems and flower to the tin), payoff (final lines affirm the project). The motivation shapes every beat, but it is cooperative and non-conflicted—no friction between beauty-forging and another desire tests the motive on the page. Present and coherent, but the want does not collide with cost until the molt-itch at closure, which is mild.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" is embodied throughout: rusted library, broken bars, "fractured luminous thing," "silver wound in the sky," and the final "cracks in the world where the light got in." The tone is elegiac-yet-hopeful, sustained across turns and modulating slightly (restlessness → quiet resolve). Setup immediate (opening mood), development consistent (lyric diction, recurring imagery), and payoff (final "bloom" image charges the fracture). The tone is integral to the piece's effect and indivisible from closure. Strong coherence and specificity.</comment>
