<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to help is present but underdeveloped; her internal contradiction between arriving as a stranger seeking respite and staying to build is told rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Kael's altruistic stance is consistent but edges toward archetype—his dialogue carries subtext, yet his flickering-ghost interiority remains opaque, limiting felt cost. The collective of strangers who stay is functional but largely offstage; their individual stakes never pressure Liora's choices directly. The final "We stay" moment gestures at change but lacks a visible forfeiture or prior live option foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the nebula of respite accretes through repeated gestures (bell-ringing, chalked messages, butterfly garden) rather than causal reversals. Orientation is clean by ~120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"We stay" crystallizes the communal stance—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no single on-page forfeiture or tactical shift anchors the final image. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens, yet the ending reweights meaning through assertion ("the universe breathed back") rather than a concrete, irreversible act or visible loss that makes the before/after undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet, floating arches, and butterfly garden are vivid and purposeful; the arches cast shadows that frame early mood, and the watering bell becomes a spatial anchor across beats. The soil's hum and crack constrain Liora's first encounter with Kael, and the chalked sidewalk messages recur with tactical weight. However, the nebula itself remains abstract—never grounded in sensory particulars or a constraint that alters a choice—and the final "universe breathed back" dilutes specificity at closure. Micro-setting (bell, soil, chalk) charges the middle but the macro (nebula, arches' mechanics) drifts toward postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—building a sanctuary from wreckage—is signaled early but never tightens into a live either/or choice with visible cost. The watering-bell ritual and Liora's tracing of cracks function as repeated gestures rather than escalating pressure; no reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off on the page. Kael's presence and the arrival of strangers add texture but generate no meaningful opposition or friction. The ending's "We stay" reads as a communal affirmation rather than a decision that forecloses a path, and the conceptual price (what Liora or the group sacrifices to remain) is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—collective effort as respite-making—emerges clearly from the repeated bell-ringing, chalked messages, and the final "We stay." The shift from sanctuary-seeking to sanctuary-building is coherent and specific to this premise. However, the ending's explicit gloss ("Not a place to escape to, but a place to build. Not respite from the world, but respite *with* it") summarizes the thematic insight rather than allowing the final image to carry it implicitly, and the phrase "the universe...believed her" edges toward direct statement. The butterfly garden and watering bell recur with charged meaning, but the nebula itself remains abstract, weakening thematic grounding in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Liora; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Liora notices cracks, hums, shadows—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unspooled their sorrows," "collective exhale," "brambled hope" aesthetic) that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Kael's italicized dialogue is clean and carries subtext, but his voice lacks distinct idiom; the mechanic, child, and refugees remain offstage, so no secondary-voice test applies. Free indirect style is consistent, and the prose modulates with scene intensity, yet the final paragraphs shift into declarative summary ("This was the nebula") that flattens the earned perceptual texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is vivid ("ribs of a god," "shattered moons"), but several beats rely on stock metaphors ("fruit pulsed with starlight," "bloom in reverse") and figurative stacking that slows momentum without adding density. Paraphrase loops appear: "You did it" / "No...We did" is followed by two more lines restating collective effort. The final third contains explanatory scaffold ("Liora looked...and understood. This was the nebula") that tells rather than trusts the image. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she thought," "she wanted to ask") dull immediacy in mid-pressure beats. Grammar and tense are clean; clarity remains high, but propulsion sags under decorative layering at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—ghost-gardener guiding sanctuary-building on a post-war orchard planet—combines familiar SFF tropes (benevolent ghost, rebuilding, collective utopia) without a sharp, non-obvious angle. The watering bell and chalked-message mechanics add texture but feel decorative rather than transformative; swapping them for other ritual objects would not fundamentally alter the emotional arc. The final "We stay" turn is earned by prior texture but anticipated rather than surprising. Risk-taking is minimal: the story chooses comforting synthesis over dissonance or ambiguity, and the thematic resolution ("respite with the world") reads as a median, safety-hedged insight rather than a bold stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael (altruistic ghost) is present by the first third, shapes two beats (showing the butterfly garden, instructing Liora to reexamine cracks), and appears in the final image. His altruism is asserted ("never asked for thanks") but not tested by a conflicting want or visible cost; his choices enable rather than complicate. Causal pressure is moderate—his instructions guide Liora's tracing, and his presence anchors the collective—but he does not drive a key turn or reversal. The element is functional across setup, middle, and closure, but his decisions feel reactive rather than plot-redefining.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watering bell is present by the first third (butterfly garden center), used twice (Liora strikes it once, rings it again at closure), and its sound "unfolding" into the arches establishes a purposeful mechanic. The bell's warmth and the final ringing that "carried into the cracks of the cosmos" reweight its earlier introduction. However, the bell does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; it functions as a ritual marker rather than a tool whose use forecloses an option. Setup, middle mention, and closure participation are all present, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is named early and recurs across beats (Liora's dream, the butterfly garden pilgrimage, the final "This was the nebula" realization), but it remains abstract—a thematic label rather than a force that shapes tactics or alters on-page choices. The concept's transformation from "place to escape to" to "place to build" is told in the final paragraphs rather than dramatized through a decision with visible cost. It is present in setup and closure but does not constrain middle action; swapping it for "sanctuary" or "refuge" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is implied through Liora's immediate belief in Kael ("the strangest thing was how she believed him") but never tested or made visible as a trait that constrains or enables a key choice. The attribute is asserted once in narration and does not recur; it does not shape Kael's decisions, alter other characters' tactics, or carry a cost. Present in setup as a label but ornamental thereafter.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reexamine" is present by mid-story (Kael's chalked instruction, Liora tracing fractures for weeks), and the action drives the middle beat—Liora's weeks of listening to the earth gather the drifters and refugees who become the collective. However, the reexamination does not produce a reversal or tighten options; it accumulates texture rather than narrowing a live choice. The action is causally linked to the arrival of strangers but could be replaced by "repair" or "tend" without structural loss. Setup and middle involvement are clear; closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Chalked messages on sidewalks appear by mid-story (Kael's "Reexamine the cracks" and Liora's final "We stay"), and the dawn timing is mentioned twice. The method shapes one middle beat (Liora follows the instruction) and returns at closure when Liora writes her own message. However, the mechanics do not constrain a choice or impose a cost; the medium is decorative rather than plot-critical. Swapping chalk for spoken words or written notes would require only minor edits. Setup is late (~40%), middle use is functional, closure reprise is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches are present early, anchor spatial choreography (Liora kneeling in dirt, arches humming at twilight, butterfly garden at the planet's heart), and the arches' trembling when the bell rings establishes a purposeful mechanic. The soil's war-memory crack constrains Liora's first encounter with Kael. However, the arches themselves do not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; they function as atmospheric anchors. The orchard's transformation (fruit sweeter, butterfly garden pilgrimage site) is told rather than shown affecting a decision. Setup, middle presence, and closure atmosphere are strong; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is signaled early (Liora's arrival among drifters) and the transition is marked ("strangers who had become family gathered"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock. The story spans an indeterminate period ("weeks," "decades" for Kael's prior work) without a deadline or temporal pressure that alters tactics. The transformation from strangers to family is asserted in the final third rather than dramatized through a choice with visible cost tied to timing. Present as thematic framing but does not constrain or escalate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to orchestrate collective effort is implied early ("I'm here to help") and drives the middle beat (gathering strangers, repairing channels, teaching children). However, the desire is told rather than conflicted—no on-page friction between Liora's want and a competing cost or fear. The collective forms largely offstage; Liora's role as orchestrator is asserted ("You did it" / "We did") but not tested by a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The motivation shapes the arc but lacks embodied tension or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" (soil remembering war, fruit splitting the sky, ghosts who stay as family) is coherent across the piece and modulates with pressure—Kael's flickering solidity increases as the sanctuary builds, and the final "universe breathed back" lifts the tone into affirmation. However, the tone remains stable rather than charging the final image with a new emotional cost; the ending's declarative summary ("the planet, at last, believed her") flattens the brambled texture into tidy resolution. The tone supports the concept but does not reweight the closure beat.</comment>
