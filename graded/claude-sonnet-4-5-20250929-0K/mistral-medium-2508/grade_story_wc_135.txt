<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's arc is earned through concrete choices—assembling fragments, listening to the valve, distributing the ledger—and the final toss to the child embodies renunciation with visible cost. Interiority is embodied ("hands trembled—not from cold, but from the weight") and contradictory impulses appear when he climbs away from the crowd yet engages the child. The secondary characters (fisherman's daughter, dockworker, child) apply immediate pressure and deepen his mission. Backstory of the exile anchors present stakes cleanly, but the phrase "reactively visionary" ("His vision had always been reactive, flaring brightest when the world withheld its light") reads as diagnostic label-speak in a peak beat, triggering a −0.4 deduction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise: Elias tosses the valve to the child, crystallizing options (the city will sound again, but not through him) with felt cost (his work shifts from compilation to witness). The piece follows an Accumulative lens—fragments gather density until the valve's return reweights the premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ledger becomes lighter and the valve passes to the next generation, fulfilling the RR test. The cascade of community objects (locket, teacup) deepens pressure without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ivory harbor, slick cobblestones, repurposed lighthouse, and driftwood table supply concrete micro-setting that constrains Elias's choices (he ascends the lighthouse rather than joining the docks). The valve glints in sun and is handled across multiple beats, charging the final image. Sensory selection (ocean-spray, ink and damp parchment, salt-crusted crate) reflects urgency and professional bias. The setting evolves causally—café reopens, lanterns flicker—and the harbor's pulse metaphor grounds tone without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning and deciding whether to sound the herald—is signaled early and tightens when Elias completes the ledger and chooses to pass the valve rather than blow it himself. The tightening forecloses a live option (reclaiming the herald role) with visible cost (he climbs away from the triumphant crowd). Agency operates through renunciation with on-page consequence: the valve now belongs to the child, and Elias's work shifts from archivist to witness. Pressure accumulates through community contributions (locket, teacup) and culminates in the choice on the lighthouse roof, consistent with the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: silence as fullness, the archive as heartening act, the herald's absence as a presence. The valve shifts meaning from relic to placeholder to catalyst without overt statement. The final image—Elias tossing the valve, the child catching it—offers a resonant answer to whether the city needs proclamation or listening, reweighting prior material without a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution (the valve will sound, "But not today") and invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity. The line "His vision had always been reactive" borders on theme echo but remains anchored in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with perceptual signature (ocean-spray archivist noticing salt-crusted edges, syncopated heartbeat metaphors). Diction modulates appropriately under pressure ("His hands trembled—not from cold"). The child's brief dialogue ("Blow when you're ready") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Minor register drift occurs in "reactively visionary" and "navigated...an absence shaped by the space around it," which elevate beyond the established texture during peak beats. Psychic distance shifts intentionally when the narrative pulls back to the cityscape at the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high (valve history, exile context, community contributions compressed efficiently). Two minor issues: "flaring brightest when the world withheld its light" is stock metaphor in a peak beat, and "the notes were wrong in all the right ways" leans toward cliché without added specificity. A paraphrase loop appears: "not sounded, but *navigated*" restates the absence concept without advancing pressure. Sentence openings vary, no template cadence detected. Applying −0.6 total in Q7 for figurative muddle and minor loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist-as-herald, absence-as-presence, and the valve passing to the child offers a non-obvious take on post-exile restoration. The story transforms the "return from exile" trope by centering compilation over proclamation, and the choice to withhold the sound subverts expectation. Specific details (trumpet valve mouthpiece warped, driftwood table, chipped teacup) anchor universals. The premise feels inevitable in hindsight: the city needed to remember listening before sounding. Risk-taking in the quiet, renunciatory ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a +0.3 within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias appears in the opening beat, drives the middle assembly sequence, and makes the decisive choice at closure (tossing the valve). His specific occupation (ocean-spray archivist) shapes perception and tactics throughout. Causal pressure is strong: his choice to listen rather than blow, then to pass the valve, alters the city's path. Removing this exact character would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The valve is handled in the opening crate discovery, carried to the workshop, pressed to Elias's lips to listen, displayed on the lighthouse roof, and tossed to the child—five distinct beats. Its meaning shifts from relic to placeholder to catalyst. The valve enables the final choice (to pass it rather than sound it) and charges the closure image with specificity and cost. Irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Navigated absences shapes the concept thematically (the city's silences, the ghost of a note "not sounded, but *navigated*") and informs Elias's method of compiling gaps. It appears early and returns at closure when the absence is declared "enough." However, it does not directly constrain a middle choice or alter tactics on the page; its role is more atmospheric and thematic than causal. Present in setup and payoff with thematic reweighting, but limited middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is stated once in the middle ("His vision had always been reactive, flaring brightest when the world withheld its light") and echoed in his tendency to compile what is withheld. It informs his approach but does not visibly constrain an on-page choice with cost; the trait remains more label than dramatized tradeoff. The label-speak at a peak beat also lowers integration quality. Present and thematically consistent, but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Hearten" is named explicitly in the middle ("Elias didn't just record; he *heartened*") and dramatized when he shows the fisherman's daughter and dockworker how their silences are full. This action enables the community's reengagement and primes the ending moment when Elias can pass the valve rather than retain it. The verb is irreplaceable and shapes two beats with clear cost (he shifts from solo compiler to communal witness). Strong middle and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Staggered intervals" is signaled in the middle ("he began to work in staggered intervals—first the valve's history, then the names of the exiled, then the dates the rains came") and shapes his accumulation method, which aligns with the Accumulative lens. The method does not constrain a crisis choice but does define his tactics and the story's rhythm. The final ledger's lightness and the wind turning pages reflect the method's payoff. Present in setup and middle with thematic resonance, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain anchors the opening image (slick cobblestones, salt-crusted crate) and recurs throughout (docks, lighthouse, seawall, café). The setting supplies the crate discovery, the workshop space, and the lighthouse vantage that enables Elias's final choice to stand apart from the crowd. The micro-setting (lighthouse roof, driftwood table) constrains tactics and charges the closure image. Strong setup, middle use, and closure participation with irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—after the exile ends, spanning the twenty-year gap and the ship's return—is signaled early and structures the narrative arc. The ending moment (the first official ship's arrival) tightens the decision: Elias must choose whether to reclaim the herald role now or pass it. The timeframe does not track a ticking clock within the scene but does frame the before/after closure with consequence. Strong setup and closure participation, moderate middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation to compile fragments into meaning is dramatized from the opening (tracing the crate, collecting ship logs and love letters) through the middle assembly (building the ledger, receiving community objects) to the ending choice (tossing the valve). Friction appears when Elias must decide whether compilation means sounding the trumpet himself or enabling others. The cost is visible: he relinquishes the herald role, his ledger becomes lighter, and his work shifts. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>
