<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rook's motivation is established (finding the voice, following the cylinder's path), but his interior life relies heavily on stock metaphors ("bloodhound heart," "warm, damp dark") rather than concrete embodied contradiction. The final choice—entering the dome—reads more as submission to fate than a decision that forecloses a meaningful path with visible cost. The watchers (child, mechanic) are ornamental; they apply no pressure and vanish without trace. Interiority often summarizes state ("finally understood") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression. Orientation anchors arrive early (scrapyard, Rook, phonograph cylinder). A meaningful tightening occurs when Rook finds the dome and enters, but the closure effect is atmospheric rather than a legible reconfiguration with visible cost: "finally understood" and "let the dark take him" assert transformation without showing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid on the page. The cylinder's voice and the vines guide him, reducing protagonist agency at the pivotal beat. One transition (scrapyard to fissure) is handled cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scrapyard is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail ("ribs of twisted metal," "wind carved spirals in the dust"). The dome and vines constrain Rook's final choice, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the two locations. Sensory selection is strong but tilts heavily visual; other senses (sound of wind, smell of rust/rain) appear late and could sharpen earlier beats. The micro-setting (body, cylinder, leaf) functions effectively as a pressure element.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—following the cylinder's message to find the source—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Rook locates the dome, but the final beat hinges on the vines pulling him in rather than a choice that narrows his options with visible cost. The cylinder's voice and the leaf act as guides, not obstacles; no reversal tests his commitment. The settlement's rules ("no digging too deep") are mentioned but never enforce consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovery of her bones), but coincidence (leaf melts wax, vines pull) resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of distance-as-wound/bridge emerges through image and action rather than assertion, and the cylinder's riddle structure charges the concept effectively. The final image ("world inside was a promise") attempts resonance but edges toward abstraction. Rook's arc from finder-of-the-dead to found is thematically coherent, though "finally understood" tells rather than shows the insight. The garden/war opposition and the leaf's pulsing veins offer concrete thematic anchors. Minor slip: "tinted revelation" as a concept remains oblique and under-developed on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Rook throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scent, old joints, bloodhound instinct) but could be more character-particular. Diction is lyric and controlled ("sky bled into the land," "roots whispered the names of the lost") with purposeful compression, though some phrases veer toward stock lyricism ("wild hush," "warm, damp dark"). Register stays consistent. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean. Rhythmic control is strong under pressure, but a few filter verbs ("listened as") dull immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Strong imagery ("glass dome, half-buried, its surface etched," "vines curled tight around bones") propels momentum. Paraphrase loop detected: "Distance is a wound" / "The distance had become a wound" and "The wound, a bridge" recur without added pressure—apply −0.2. Template cadence in short declaratives near closure ("The dome hummed. / The vines tightened. / The world outside was a scar.") reads as intentional patterning but flattens propulsion slightly. Stock metaphors ("wild hush," "cracked wasteland," "bleeding into") appear frequently without transformation. No causality breaks; artifacts remain in mid-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The phonograph-cylinder-as-map is a fresh synthesis; the wax-leaf object and scrapyard-garden juxtaposition offer specific, non-obvious angles. Emotional particulars (Rook's history with the woman, the stitched wounds) ground the premise. Risk-taking in lyric compression and symbolic design heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the trope of "retired finder enters liminal space and finds peace" is familiar, and the final garden/vines resolution leans on familiar mystical-enclosure imagery. Transformation is present but partial; the "resource war → garden war" shift is intriguing but under-developed in terms of stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rook is present throughout and his past as a bloodhound finder frames his motivation. His choices—turning the crank, following the path, entering the dome—are reactive rather than generative; the cylinder and vines guide him. Setup clear, middle functional, closure present but passive. Swappable with another seeker archetype with minor edits. Two beats (finding cylinder, entering dome) but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The wax leaf appears in beat one (found with cylinder), beat two (pulses warm in pocket), and beat three (pressed to dome, melts, bleeds into cracks, enables entry). Early signal strong. Development clear: the leaf constrains Rook's final action by unlocking the dome. Closure linkage solid. Cost is implied (leaf melts away, its function exhausted). Irreplaceability moderate; another keyed object could serve. Three-gate pass with decent causal pressure lifts it above 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" as core concept is oblique. The cylinder's grooves reveal a path; the dome's script flares; the light "fractured just so at dusk"—these moments gesture toward revelation but the "tinted" quality (filtered, colored, partial?) remains underdeveloped. Present thematically but does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page. Mentioned late and ornamentally. Swappable with "hidden truths" or "secret knowledge."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is applied to the cylinder's voice and Rook's instinct-following ("moved by instinct, his nose twitching"). The trait enables Rook's navigation but does not impose a visible cost or constrain a key choice. Label-only in several beats. Present across setup and middle; minimal closure tie. Functional but replaceable with "keen instinct" or "tracker's sense."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The riddle (cylinder's script describing the path) drives beat one (discovery), beat two (navigation: "the cylinder's voice kept pace, describing the way the wind bent"), and beat three (dome script as final riddle). Major turns trace to this action: Rook decodes the path, follows it, unlocks the dome. Early signal, middle pressure, closure linkage all strong. Cost: Rook's entry and "becoming the message" is the riddle's payoff. High irreplaceability; the story's logic hinges on this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The phonograph cylinder method is signaled in beat one ("grooves worn smooth," "words meant to be read...by the needle's trembling kiss"), used in beat two (Rook turns the crank, hears the voice, follows its instructions), and returns in the ending ("cylinder spun on," "needle dropped into a groove"). Mechanics matter: the grooves encode not just message but navigation. Early setup, middle functionality, closure reprise. Cost: the method transforms Rook into the next message-carrier. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The scrapyard is vividly rendered in the opening third ("twisted metal groaning," "gutted school bus," "watchers"). It provides the cylinder and frames Rook's departure but does not pressure his choices; the settlement's rules are mentioned but never enforced. The fissure/dome setting in the final third supplies constraint (dome must be unlocked). Setup strong, middle absent (wasteland is backdrop), closure present. Two locations, but only the dome alters tactics. Partial integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the last resource war" is mentioned once ("settlement had rules," "last war wasn't about oil or water," "last resource war had ended"). The timeframe provides backstory flavor but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. No live clock or deadline. Present in setup as context, absent in middle pressure, minimal closure tie. Ornamental; swappable with any post-collapse setting.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rook's desire to translate distance into closeness is dramatized: he follows the cylinder's voice ("touch each other again"), seeks the source, and finds connection (her bones, the garden, "finally...to be found"). The leaf and vines physically bridge distance. Friction is present (wasteland, old joints, settlement rules mentioned) but low-cost. Early setup, middle pursuit, closure payoff all clear. Trade-off: Rook's life ends, but the cost is framed as peace rather than loss, softening the friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Wild hush" as tone is introduced in the opening ("scrapyard's wild hush swallowed the first crackling notes") and sustained through contrasts: groaning metal vs. silence, wind howling vs. roots whispering, wasteland scar vs. garden promise. The tone modulates under pressure (discovery → pursuit → enclosure) and charges the final image ("The scrapyard held its breath. / The wasteland leaned in."). Coherent through turns, purposeful compression, and rhythmic control. High tonal specificity and closure linkage.</comment>
