<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("expectantly resigned sigh of a student who had forgotten their music"), and his micro-choices—humming the shape of a tune, placing the rosette where all can see—reveal hierarchy of values. The four remaining choir members are sketched with embodied detail (tremor, bullet-scarred folder) that serves pressure rather than ornamentation. Internal conflict is present but largely contemplative; the final choice to hum and invite joining is motivated, though the cost remains implicit rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density accrues through layered images (rosette, autumn leaves, silences), the pattern of subtraction/unlearning is taught early, and closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the group hums the negative space where music used to be, crystallizing options with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt in the thinned choir, the bullet-scarred folder, the tremor, and the acknowledgment that "they weren't a choir anymore." Orientation anchors (library, autumn, Elias at center table) land within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the contralto and others join the hum, reweighting the dominant stake from lost harmony to the possibility of it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The velvet library with stained-glass windows and autumn wind is vividly rendered and constrains the mood (traveled stillness). The rosette functions as micro-setting, handled twice (tracing, placing on table, pressing ear to it) and charging the final image when it vibrates. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (scent of aged paper, crushed oak leaves, amber light). The setting does not overtly constrain a tactical choice during conflict, but it anchors the reflective mode and modulates tone at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—braiding diverse voices into harmony after hatred unlearned the choir—is signaled early and tightens when only four remain. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elias places the rosette in the center and invites presence over loudness, prompting the others to hum the negative space. Agency is clear (decision to hum, invitation to join) and forecloses the path of silence with felt cost (fragility, thinness of voices). The contralto's arrival and the tenor's hesitant touch are micro-reversals that test commitment. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens and the final hum reweights the possibility of harmony.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—loss, subtraction, and the possibility of presence through listening to cracks—emerges from concrete particulars (rosette fragment, notation of silences, the choir reduced to four). The final image (hum as negative space, rosette vibrating) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (tenor's hesitant touch, soprano's question) and the recurring motif of subtraction/unlearning charges the closure. No thematic echo or sermon; the ending invites reflection on fragility and repair through lived detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elias; psychic distance is stable and controlled. Voice is distinct with elevated but character-consistent diction ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness"); vocabulary matches a choir teacher's perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal, natural, and goal-driven ("You're late" holds no reproach, "Just… present" completes the thought). Free indirect style is clean. Brief register elevation ("subtracted by noise," "denote what was missing") fits the reflective, musical frame without breaking legibility or POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and aural cadence. Information density is high (rosette, choir history, unlearning hatred, library setting compressed efficiently). Minor scaffolding appears in adjacent lines: "They weren't a choir anymore. They were the remnants of one" is paraphrase-loop (−0.2). Figurative language is dense ("velvet library exhaled," "autumn stripped the trees," "hatred… unlearned people") but coherent and voice-motivated, though clustering risks overwriting in a reflective mode. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of vanishing arts, subtraction as method, and the rosette as fragment is purposeful and non-obvious. The frame of "denoting silences" rather than composing melodies offers a fresh angle on loss and repair. Emotional specificity (bullet-scarred folder, tremor, "ghost of a plucked string") avoids generic templates. The ending resists the explain-everything trap and commits to its premise (listening to the cracks, humming the shape of a tune). Risk-taking in the reflective, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout; his choices (tracing the rosette, opening the notebook, placing the rosette on the table, humming) create key turns. The final decision to hum and invite the others shapes the closure unit. His "expectantly resigned" trait is embodied in action and voice. Two gates clear (setup, closure participation); middle development is observational but his placement of the rosette prompts the tenor's touch and the contralto's completion. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the cost is implied rather than dramatized with a sharp tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rosette is handled in three distinct beats: found in the donation bin, traced and pressed to the ear, placed on the table where it vibrates at closure. It constrains Elias's reflective method (listening to the hollow, notation of what's missing) and charges the final image when it vibrates as the choir hums. Early signal, middle and closure participation, and irreplaceability (the fragment as emblem of vanishing arts) all present. Cost connection is clear: the rosette embodies loss and the possibility of presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vanishing arts is signaled early (zither fragment, choir reduced from twenty to four, "subtracted by noise") and shapes the dominant stake. The concept constrains Elias's tactics (denoting silences, humming the negative space) and charges the closure when the group attempts to hold presence rather than volume. Two gates (setup, closure); middle development is thematic accumulation rather than a sharp turn. Strong thematic integration, but the concept does not force a single pivotal choice with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is embodied in Elias's opening interiority ("the weight of it familiar, like the expectantly resigned sigh of a student") and constrains his final choice to hum without loudness, accepting fragility. The trait enables his invitation ("We don't have to be loud") and shapes the group's response. Present in setup and closure; the tradeoff is acceptance of thinness over silence. Visible cost: the choir is no longer a full tapestry, and the trait accepts that limit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Denote" appears twice: Elias has been "scribbling not melodies but silences" and "trying to denote what was missing, not by adding notes, but by subtracting noise." The action frames his method and primes the final hum (the shape of a tune, not the tune itself). Setup and thematic closure are clear, but the middle beat is summary rather than a dramatized attempt. The action is signaled and pays off, but it does not redefine options in a pivotal middle beat. Lyric reprise without full causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is signaled in the opening third ("subtracted by noise," "denote what was missing… by subtracting noise") and enacted at closure when Elias hums the negative space and the others join. The method shapes his notebook work (pauses, spaces where sound used to live) and the final tactic (thin voices, not loudness). Two gates (setup, closure); middle development is implicit in his weeks of notation. The mechanics matter and constrain the ending image, but the method is not tested in a mid-scene reversal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet library is anchored early with vivid, selective detail (stained-glass amber, scent of aged paper, autumn wind rattling panes). It supplies the "traveled stillness" that pressures the group's final choice and contrasts with the noise that drove the choir apart. The setting's quiet is described as "different… the kind that held the echoes of every voice," and this quality charges the closure when the group hums. Three gates (setup, middle atmosphere, closure mood). The library does not impose a logistical constraint, but its tone and symbolic weight alter the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" is signaled as backstory (arguments over lyrics, history, pain; choir reduced from twenty to four) but the unlearning itself is not dramatized on the page. The timeframe primes the present fragility and shapes the dominant stake, but no live clock or tactical deadline tightens decisions in the present scene. Setup is clear; closure cost is felt in the thinned choir, but the "unlearning" operates as context rather than a process we witness. One gate (setup); missing middle and closure participation as an active time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "braid diverse voices into harmony" is signaled early (choir once twenty, "tapestry of accents and tempos") and dramatized in Elias's placement of the rosette and invitation to hum. Friction is visible: the group is "not a choir anymore," voices are "thin as thread," and the final hum is "the possibility" of harmony, not its achievement. The desire constrains the ending choice (presence over loudness) and the cost is legible (fragility, thinness). Three gates (setup, middle reflection, closure action); causal pressure and felt tradeoff present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is anchored in the opening ("velvet library exhaled," "stained-glass windows bleeding amber") and modulates through the piece: the library's "traveled stillness… held the echoes," the autumn wind "tapping… a forgotten rhythm," and the final "air shimmered with the weight of what they were learning to hold." Tone is coherent, purposeful, and charges the closure image. The "traveled" quality (stillness that has crossed distance, held voices) reweights the dominant stake at the end. Three gates, strong closure linkage, and rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>
