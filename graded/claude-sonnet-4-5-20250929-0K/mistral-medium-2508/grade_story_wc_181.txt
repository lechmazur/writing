<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veyra's interior is vivid and specific—her bemused hunger, the laughter at danger—but key beats rely on stock metaphors ("key" slotting into mind) and therapy-speak lite ("nonlinear inheritance" as epiphany rather than embodied pressure). The final choice to prepare the artifact for another lacks visible cost: she smiles and returns to work without foreclosing a live path or demonstrating renunciation. The cameo's mirror-reflection moment carries contradictory impulse briefly, but the ending flattens that tension into approval without consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural—blossom visits stack symbolic weight—but the closure (Veyra cataloging the cameo for "the next one") lands as Charged Poise only if we accept that preparing the artifact for another crystallizes options. The orchard's door-crossing and museum return feel like soft resets: she enters, the museum is intact, the cameo pristine, with no on-page cost anchoring the "complicated" → catalog choice. The reflection's warning ("That's dangerous") is acknowledged with laughter but never pressures a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The astral orchard is vivid and purposeful: violet blossoms show past curators, fractal spirals constrain Veyra's choices, and pollen traces equations. The bathroom acoustics detail is specific and functional. The orchard's door and the museum's return are spatially coherent. The cameo's final engraving change ("Complicated") and the pistachio shell bearing Veyra's face charge the ending image with setting-object synergy, elevating the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to pursue forbidden knowledge and how to use it—is signaled early. Veyra rejects documentation (curator #1) and destruction (curator #2), choosing curation for the next inquirer. This is a tightening under the Accumulative lens, but the pressure never forecloses a live option with felt cost: she steps through the door, finds the museum intact, smiles, and catalogs. The orchard's approval ("silent approval") and the pistachio shell cameo are atmospheric rather than costly. No price paid, no path closed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly through the orchard-library conceit: knowledge protected from weaponizers, worshipers, and those who would drown. The cameo's "Simply" → "Complicated" shift and the catalog entry ("a key that unlocks only when held by someone who understands they shouldn't turn it") offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the inquiry question. The pistachio shell bearing Veyra's face is a charged final image. Minor deduction: the orchard's "silent approval" edges toward authorial endorsement rather than ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: "bewildered eyes, same hunger," "sharp and bright" laughter, and perceptual details like sap-graffiti are character-specific. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The reflection's layered-static speech and the wind's sigh feel purposeful. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated. Minor slip: the orchard's exposition in the middle third ("protected. From people who…") briefly adopts an external narrator's summarizing register rather than Veyra's immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Density is high: most lines advance character, world, or atmosphere. Minor loop: "same bewildered eyes, same hunger—holding the same cameo" repeats "same" three times in eight words without additive pressure. Stock metaphor: "key that slots into her mind like a key." The orchard's pollen "tracing equations" and the shell "etched with her own face" are vivid. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; no filter stacks or template cadence runs that dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pistachio-shell cameo, astral orchard as library, and curator lineage synthesize into a specific, non-obvious frame. The bathroom-acoustics detail, the "simply complicated" engraving flip, and the final shell bearing Veyra's face feel earned rather than decorative. Risk: treating knowledge as protected rather than forbidden reframes the trope cleanly. Minor deduction: the orchard's direct statement of theme ("protected. From people who…") briefly edges toward exposition rather than showing through image and cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Veyra (bewildered curator) is present throughout and makes the key turn: rejecting documentation/destruction in favor of cataloging for the next inquirer. She presses the cameo to her temple, steps through the door, and writes the catalog entry—three distinct beats. However, "bewildered" as a trait is mentioned but not dramatized under pressure; her laughter and smile suggest confidence rather than confusion. The final choice lacks visible cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank appears in at least four beats: arrival, temple-press (memory vision), orchard (engraving change), and catalog tray (final entry). It drives Veyra's inquiry, changes engraving ("Simply" → "Complicated"), and appears in the closure image (shell with her face). Setup early, middle pressure, closure linkage all present. Causal pressure is moderate: it invites but does not narrow options with hard cost, preventing entry to 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is named once ("the concept slotted into her mind") and illustrated via the memory of a child whispering to a tree whose roots "rewrote the soil's history." The orchard's blossoms showing past curators gesture toward the concept, but it remains thematic overlay rather than shaping on-page tactics or stakes. Veyra's catalog entry does not hinge on nonlinear inheritance mechanics. Functional but swappable; present without constraining choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears as the cameo's engraving flip—"Simply" becomes "Complicated"—charging the orchard's shiver and the door's appearance. It is not a character trait that constrains action; it describes the artifact's state. The trait does not enable or foreclose an on-page choice with cost. Label-only metaphorical use; ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inquire: Veyra asks "What do you want?" and the wind answers; she presses the cameo to her temple and receives a memory; she touches blossoms that show past curators. These are distinct inquiry beats that shape middle pressure. The final catalog entry ("For the next one who asks") reprises inquiry as a legacy concept. Setup, development, and closure participation present. However, the inquiry could be replaced with "interpret" or "listen" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability and capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The bathroom appears once: Veyra carries the cameo there "where the acoustics were best for thinking," locks the door, and has the temple-press memory. The graffiti ("The past is a palimpsest") adds texture but does not recur or shape later tactics. No philosophical breakthrough is dramatized in that space; the memory arrives via the cameo's magic, not the bathroom's method. Present but ornamental; swappable with "quiet corner" or "archive alcove."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The astral orchard blossoming on a lonely asteroid is setup (observation dome, violet blossoms), middle pressure (three blossom touches showing curators/prison/burning museum), and closure (orchard blooms in approval; door appears; pistachio grows). It constrains Veyra's inquiry by supplying each vision and supplying the door. The asteroid context ("lonely," observatory dome) frames isolation but does not pressure choices directly. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; slight swappability of "lonely asteroid" with "remote station" prevents 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" is meta-framed in the closing line ("between the first and last page of a book no one would ever finish, a tree grew a single pistachio") and structurally enacted: the story begins with cameo arrival and ends with catalog preparation for the next cycle. Timeframe is purposeful and charged at closure, but it does not tighten on-page decisions or impose a live clock during Veyra's orchard visit. Lyric reprise present; causal pressure absent. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Pursue forbidden knowledge: Veyra has "spent seventeen years cataloging artifacts that defied taxonomy," laughs at the reflection's warning ("Danger was the point"), and steps into the orchard "where the trees grew in the shape of questions." Her final choice catalogs the cameo "for the next one who asks," framing the knowledge as protected rather than forbidden. Setup, middle dramatization (laughter, orchard entry), and closure linkage present. Friction: the orchard approves and the museum is intact, softening the "forbidden" cost and capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Brightened disquiet: Veyra's "sharp and bright" laughter, the orchard's violet pulse, and the mirror's static-layered warning create coherent unease lifted by wonder. The tone modulates from trembling fingers (opening) to smile (closing), bracketing disquiet with brightness. The graffiti wink, the orchard's silent approval, and the pistachio shell's self-portrait sustain the mood through closure. However, the ending's smile and approval tilt toward resolution rather than sustained disquiet, preventing full closure charge and capping at mid-6s.</comment>
