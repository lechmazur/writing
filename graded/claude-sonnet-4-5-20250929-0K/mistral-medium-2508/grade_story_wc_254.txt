<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation is clear and anchored in the seventeen-year banishment, but her interiority trends toward poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment she touches the quartz and lets it "rewrite her" lacks the visceral cost or micro-choice that would ground transformation in scene. Her final stance—"no longer afraid"—is asserted more than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The piece earns points for consistent voice and a credible arc from poet to boundary-dissolver, but misses the contradictory texture that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who, where, when by opening lines). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the spiral walk builds through sensory layering and motif recurrence (hum, quartz, ice) toward a final image that reweights the ban and the atrium's purpose. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the lake thaws, the atrium "unfolds," and the elders' fear is reframed—with felt conceptual cost (heresy, transformation). The cost is legible in "The elders would call it heresy" and the physical act of the ice fracturing, though the emotional price remains oblique. One tightening: her realization that "the ban had never been about keeping them out" shifts tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly rendered with synesthetic detail (hum "just beyond hearing," ice groaning, glyphs shifting). The quartz constrains Elira's choices—she walks the spiral, synchronizes breath, and ultimately kneels at the water's edge—charging the final image when the lake "answers" and thaws. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the spiral descent. The setting functions as both constraint and catalyst, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape a choice and charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—striding through boundaries once thought sacred—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elira realizes the ban was about containment, not exclusion, which reframes her agency and drives her final act at the water's edge. The cost is visible in the ice fracturing and the elders' inevitable outcry, though the piece leans more on conceptual weight than on a dramatic reversal or trade-off between competing goods. Agency reads as decision and endurance, but the escalation under the Accumulative lens is more atmospheric than conflict-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: boundaries, transformation, fear as solidifier of limits. The quartz hum, ice fracture, and "paraphrase" motif recur and reweight without overt moralizing. The final image—lake thawing, poets following, world paraphrasing itself—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without a stated thesis. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, touching, walking) and silence (the atrium's seventeen-year muteness). The piece invites reflection on authority, change, and the cost of revision. One minor slip: "boundaries were only as solid as the fear that held them" edges toward direct statement, though it remains rooted in scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, elevated register that matches Elira's identity as cloud-shadow poet. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices hum, tremor, dissolution—and the prose rhythm modulates under pressure (short clauses when she laughs, longer when she walks the spiral). Diction remains within the focalizer's plausible lexicon throughout. One friction: the elevated register ("lantern-moth hush," "aesthetically driven") occasionally drifts into a detached, curatorial tone that undercuts immediacy at peak beats. No head-hopping, and the purposeful compression (e.g., "Not broken. *Unfolded.*") is taught and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high—"breath held too long," "cloud-shadow poet," "ink in water," "lantern-moth hush"—and mostly coherent, but clusters of metaphor in adjacent lines ("dissolved like ink," "edges dissolving," "fluid and flickering") create minor muddle in the middle third. Several paraphrase loops appear: "the hum seep into her bones" / "synchronized with the pulse of the quartz" restate dissolution without added pressure. Template cadence is controlled, and the final image lands cleanly. Sentence rhythm varies, but the density of lyric devices occasionally slows momentum rather than propelling it. No major artifacts touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies (−0.8 for density and loop issues).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core premise—poet returns to sacred atrium after ban lifts and dissolves its boundaries—synthesizes exile narrative, liminal space, and artistic transgression in a purposeful frame. Elira's transformation from respectful poet to boundary-dissolver is earned through the spiral walk and quartz interaction. However, the "sacred space changes the protagonist" template is familiar, and the piece does not fully transform it through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; the elders' fear and Elira's defiance read as archetypal. The final image of the thawing lake and "paraphrase" motif offers freshness, but the emotional arc follows a predictable path from reverence to heresy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and makes the key choice to walk the spiral, touch the quartz, and kneel at the water's edge. Her realization that the ban was about containment shifts her tactics and drives the ending. However, much of her arc is told through summary ("she had spent the banishment years") rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The final stance—"no longer afraid"—is asserted more than enacted through conflicting impulses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The quartz colonnade appears in at least four distinct beats: Elira touches it, walks the spiral, lets the hum rewrite her, and reaches the tallest pillar where glyphs shift. Its hum constrains her choices (synchronizing breath, dissolving edges) and charges the final image when the glyphs rewrite themselves. The object's mechanics—vibration, frequency, glyph transformation—matter causally. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A tremor of certainty" is seeded early ("she had come back for this: the tremor of certainty") and returns in the quartz hum that travels up her arm, "unspooling the tight knot of years." It shapes her stance—certainty as boundary to step over—and appears in the ending when she walks back into the spiral. However, the concept trends more toward thematic echo than tactical constraint; it does not narrow her options or force a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" is mentioned once in the middle third ("The colonnade was aesthetically driven—every angle, every curve designed to lure the mind into softness") but functions as description rather than constraint. The trait does not enable or prevent an action with cost, nor does it return at closure. Label-only mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Paraphrase" is seeded early ("hymns were just words waiting to be paraphrased"), dramatized when Elira whispers her oldest poem and lets the quartz paraphrase it back, and returns in the final image ("the world, at last, would paraphrase itself"). The action shapes the central turn—her willingness to let boundaries rewrite her—and is indispensable to the ending's conceptual charge. Strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Dissolving boundaries" is signaled throughout: Elira's edges dissolve, the quartz blurs self and stone, the ice fractures. The method matters causally—her synchronization with the hum enables the thawing—and shapes the ending when the atrium becomes "unfolded." However, the mechanics remain atmospheric rather than tactical; the reader does not see Elira choose how to dissolve boundaries, only that she does. Strong thematic presence but mid-range causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are present throughout and constrain Elira's choices: the spiral walk structures her approach, the quartz hum enables transformation, and the lake's ice fractures as a physical consequence of her actions. The setting charges the final image when the lake thaws and the atrium "unfolds." Strong setup, development, and payoff with visible causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The seventeen-year ban and its lifting frame the story and motivate Elira's return. However, once she enters the atrium, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the spiral walk unfolds at an indeterminate pace. The ban functions as backstory rather than a live clock that shapes moves. Setup is clear, but development and payoff are weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to stride through boundaries once thought sacred"—is stated early and drives Elira's spiral walk and final kneeling. However, the friction between desire and cost is told more than dramatized; we see her confidence grow but not the internal conflict or trade-off that would elevate the motivation into high bands. The cost is conceptual (heresy) rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" is established early and held through the spiral walk with controlled, lyric pacing. The tone modulates under pressure—short clauses when the ice fractures, longer when she kneels—and charges the final image when the hum climbs an octave and the space becomes "brighter, something hungry." Coherent through turns and purposefully reweighted at closure.</comment>
