<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veyra's interiority is abstract and ornamental rather than embodied—"troubling serenity," "sigh," "breath hitched" are stock gestures without character-particular contradiction. The choice to sacrifice memory feels thematically motivated but lacks on-page micro-hesitation or competing impulse in the moment; she simply "closes her eyes" and proceeds. The ancestor's voice offers wisdom without dramatized friction against Veyra's present need. Internal conflict is asserted ("wound and a blessing both") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (Veyra, nebula garden, gear). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (petals, sonar, light-without-fire) toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at the transit threshold where the pattern breaks and cost is felt (memory forfeited, garden left behind). The final image—"stepped into the light"—reconfigures the premise with undeniable pressure. Cost is on the page (memory given, path foreclosed) and the lens holds. One deduction: the sonar-path revelation arrives abruptly without prior setup of the method's capability to "find places where light pooled without heat."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nebula garden is vivid and sensory ("ionized gas," "luminescent blooms," "frequency as her heartbeat"), filtered through Veyra's reverence. The gear—a tangible, handled object—anchors micro-setting and constrains her choice (demands memory as cost). The spatial sequence is clear (moves through garden to heart to transit edge). The final image charges when she steps into untouched light. No occupation or technical depth is needed here; the fantastical setting remains internally consistent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: escape the cycle of bloom-decay without using fire. The gear's sonar pinging narrows options by revealing one path with a cost (memory). Veyra's agency—choosing to forfeit the memory of her first bloom—forecloses return and breaks the pattern. Pressure tightens once through the reveal-and-price structure. The cost is on the page (memory taken, garden left, others will not understand). No antagonist or second reversal is required; the single deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: light vs. fire, cycle vs. breaking, borrowed vs. owned. The gear and petals recur with reweighted meaning (gear stills when chain breaks; petals exhale final sigh). The ending offers a non-literal answer—walking into light that doesn't consume—without moralizing. Subtext lives in "troubling serenity," the ancestor's murmur, and Veyra's small fragile smile. One slip: "The others would call it heresy" is slightly on-the-nose thematic flagging rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Veyra's perceptual signature is poetic and consistent ("petals of ionized gas drifting," "breath hitched"). Distance stays close-mid throughout. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated for this fantastical register. One problem: repeated sentence stems ("She carried," "She activated," "She closed," "She stepped," "She walked," "She reached") create template cadence in the second half, flattening rhythm under peak pressure. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("stretched like a sigh," "slow gravity of forgotten stars," "each notch a memory, each rotation an approximation of infinity") without pattern-teaching or payoff in a shorter piece, triggering overwriting penalty −0.5. Template cadence in second half ("She [verb]" x6 across closure beats) adds −0.5. Paraphrase loop: "the way the nebula bloomed, faded, and bloomed again, the way their own children always returned to the same questions" restates cycle redundantly. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, others ornament. Propulsion slows mid-piece with reflective summary ("Generations before her had tried...") that could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—light without fire, sonar mapping nebula, memory-cost for transit—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar SFF elements. The gear and sonar feel specific to this world. Emotional progression (longing → choice → walking forward) is legible but not deeply particular; the arc could transfer to other escape-the-cycle narratives with minor edits. The final image (stepping into light, gear stilling) has resonance but leans on poetic abstraction rather than lived-in detail. Risk-taking is moderate: lyric tone and memory-cost elevate the piece within its band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Veyra is present throughout and makes the key choice (forfeit memory, step into transit). Setup is immediate, development is the decision to activate the gear and accept cost, payoff is stepping into light. Her sentimentalism colors perception ("sigh," "quiet," "fragile smile") and the choice to break the pattern reflects character. Two beats: activating gear, forfeiting memory. Causal pressure is moderate—her choice is thematically motivated but lacks on-page friction or competing impulse in the moment. Closure linkage is strong (she walks into light). Swappability is low; her being a sentimentalist who wants to share light is specific. Cost is tied to her memory. Deduction for ornamental interiority that doesn't alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gear appears in paragraph 3 (setup), is activated mid-story (development: casts sonar, reveals path, demands memory), and stills at closure (payoff: "its work done, its purpose fulfilled in the breaking of the chain"). Three beats: carried/described, activated/spun, stilled. Causal pressure: the gear's demand for memory is the hinge that makes transit possible and foreclosing. Closure linkage: its stilling signals the pattern's break. Specificity high: brass, worn, calculating machine, ancestor's tool. Cost connection: memory forfeited to fuel the gear's function. Minor deduction for the gear being slightly passive (it "demanded" but Veyra's internal struggle with that demand is thin).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Generational patterns frame the story (ancestors mapped, children return to same questions, cycle of bloom/decay) and Veyra's goal is to break the cycle. Setup is clear (paragraph 8: "Generations before her had tried..."). Development: her choice to follow the new path instead of accepting the sigh. Payoff: "for the first time, the pattern broke." Two beats: reflection on past cycles, choice to break it. Causal pressure is moderate—the concept shapes her motivation but doesn't constrain tactics on the page; it's more thematic backdrop than active obstacle. Closure linkage is strong. Swappability moderate: could replace with "eternal return" or "fate." Cost is present (others won't understand, garden left behind).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Approximates infinity" appears once as a poetic descriptor of the gear ("each rotation an approximation of infinity") and in the penultimate line ("its calculations never quite finishing, always approximating the infinite"). Setup is present but late-ish. No middle development—it's label-only, not a property that constrains or enables action. Payoff is a thematic echo rather than causal participation. No visible cost tied to this trait. Swappability high: could describe the gear as "endless" or "perpetual" with no loss. Ornamental use; does not shape a beat or choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Transit is Veyra's goal from early on (paragraph 9: "the cost was transit—not just of distance, but of self") and the climax is her stepping into the transit path. Setup by first third (implicit in "share light beyond the garden"). Development: the gear reveals the transit route and its cost. Payoff: she steps into the transit ("stepped into the light," "stepped into the transit"). Three beats: goal stated, path revealed, transit taken. Causal pressure: the entire escalation hinges on the discovery and acceptance of transit's cost. Closure linkage is total—the story ends with her crossing the threshold. Specificity: transit is not mere travel but self-alteration and memory-cost. Cost is on the page. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sonar pinging is introduced mid-story (paragraph 4: ancestor used sonar to map nebula; paragraph 10: Veyra activates gear to cast sonar pings). Setup is by ~40% mark. Development: sonar reveals the path where light pooled without heat. Payoff: the pings dissolve at the transit edge, having served their function. Two beats: ancestor's method mentioned, Veyra's use. Causal pressure: the sonar is the means by which she finds the escape route; without it, no path. Closure linkage moderate (pings dissolve into "something brighter" at the edge). Specificity: sonar as non-visual sensing fits the fire-averse culture. Swappability low. Deduction for late introduction and summary of ancestor's use rather than on-page demonstration earlier.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The nebula garden is the story's sole location and defines the conflict: beautiful but a cage, cycling bloom-decay. Setup immediate (paragraph 1). Development: Veyra moves through it to the heart, where the oldest petals curl; the garden's structure (petals, frequencies) enables her sonar method. Payoff: she leaves it behind; the garden exhales one final petal. Three beats: arrival/description, heart location where choice crystallizes, departure. Causal pressure: the garden is both resource (light to share) and constraint (the cycle she must escape). Closure linkage strong (she does not look back; the garden continues dying). Specificity high (ionized gas, luminescent blooms pulsing at heartbeat frequency). Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Across the quiet sigh of falling petals" is poetic but vague; no explicit duration or ticking clock. The story reads as one continuous sequence (Veyra moves through garden, activates gear, steps into transit) but time is not tracked or pressured. Petals fall slowly throughout (paragraphs 1, 6, penultimate line) as a tonal/thematic marker rather than a countdown. Setup is ambient mood. No development where time narrows options. Payoff: the final petal falls as she leaves, but this is lyric closure not temporal pressure. Swappability high: could replace with "in the space between breaths" or "over a single twilight." No cost tied to time passing. Mid-low for atmospherics without mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Veyra's desire to share light without fire is stated explicitly (paragraph 5: people abandoned fire; paragraph 9: "share the garden's glow...without burning, without loss"). Setup by ~30%. Development: she seeks and finds the path that allows this (sonar reveals light pooling without heat). Payoff: she steps into light "untouched by flame" and her hands glow, cupping "the possibility of a new garden, one that did not fear the dark." Three beats: cultural history of fire-fear, goal articulated, goal achieved. Causal pressure: this desire drives her choice to break the cycle. Closure linkage total. Friction is present but thin—she hesitates briefly ("her breath hitched") but no sustained doubt or competing pull. Cost is memory, not fire-risk.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Troubling serenity" appears twice (paragraph 5: people clung to "quiet sigh of falling petals"; paragraph 14: the path hums with "troubling serenity that had always lived in her bones"). Setup by first third as a tonal anchor. Development: the tone persists through her choice—no panic, just calm acceptance. Payoff: her smile is "small, fragile" and she walks without looking back; tone remains muted. Coherence is strong; the piece never breaks into high drama. Modulation is subtle (breath hitches, smile is fragile) but the dominant mood is steady. The phrase "troubling serenity" charges the final image by linking her internal state to the path's hum. Swappability moderate: "eerie calm" or "beautiful melancholy" could substitute. One lyric reprise.</comment>
