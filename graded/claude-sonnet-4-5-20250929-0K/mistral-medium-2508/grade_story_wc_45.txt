<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's motives are clear and consistent—bone-setter habits drive her investigative approach, and her "forgiving skeptic" stance is embodied in micro-choices (picking up the tooth without screaming, pressing it to her palm). Internal contradiction is present but muted: she believes in lies more easily than truths, yet the story doesn't dramatize this tension under peak pressure. The bargain with the changeling feels sudden; the decision to "turn them into stars" lacks visible ambivalence or cost on the page, reducing the final choice's weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Closure occurs on-page: the changeling sheds its skin, the brother returns unmarked, and Liora pockets the needle knowing "some doors shouldn't stay closed." The cost, however, is asserted rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or changed relationship anchors the transformation. Lens reads as Causal-Accumulative hybrid: the tooth-to-well-to-changeling sequence links causally, but the climax relies on declarative magic ("Turn them into stars") without tactical constraint. Orientation is clean by ~80 words (Liora, hedge maze, garden).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The garden is vividly rendered—vines, pulsing flowers, stone well with tooth-aching symbols—and it constrains Liora's approach (she slips through a gap, touches the tooth, presses it to her palm to trigger the well's symbols). The well's physical properties (carved symbols, black-and-silver water forming constellations) charge the final image. Micro-setting detail (crushed mint, iron-in-rain scent) is selective and purposeful, rooted in Liora's bone-setter perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why the substitute wore her brother's shape—is signaled early and drives Liora's entry into the garden. One meaningful tightening occurs when the changeling presses its forehead to hers, flooding her with memories and reframing the problem. The final bargain ("You can have him back, but you have to make it right") lacks on-page resistance or visible cost; the changeling's compliance feels frictionless, and no live option is foreclosed at the moment of choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—mistakes as wounds that fester if unstitched, clefts that can let light in—emerges organically from Liora's bone-setting practice and the garden's wound-door logic. The final image (needle humming in her apron, hands steady, knowing "how to set the world") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "shrewdly innocent" and "forgiving skeptic" remain prompt labels that float above the action rather than being tested under pressure, and "turn them into stars" edges toward thematic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-person limited through Liora with a distinct perceptual signature (bone-setter priorities, forgiving skeptic lens). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("the garden sighed," "yearned to understand"). The changeling's dialogue ("You're not him. But you remember him.") feels natural and goal-driven. Minor register wobble: "a cleft in certainty" and "the shape of mistakes—how they festered if left unstitched" lean slightly elevated for the scene's urgency, but the voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and figurative language is selective (the garden as living entity, the well's symbols "like embers"). Template cadence appears in the opening paragraphs: three consecutive sentences begin with "It was" / "She slipped" / "She picked up," creating mild monotony. Minor paraphrase loop: "the garden answered" / "the well's symbols flared" / "the vines trembled" in close succession restates the same magic-trigger event without added pressure. No loops or scaffolding touch the closure beat, and information density is high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination—bone-setter applying wound logic to a metaphysical problem, a changeling-as-lock, mistakes reframed as navigational stars—feels specific and non-obvious. The substitute body stitched with river reeds and the charred needle as proof of borrowing add textured originality. Minor derivative element: the secret-garden-behind-maze frame and the bargain-with-faerie-creature structure are familiar, though the bone-setting metaphor transforms them. The "forgiving skeptic" and "shrewdly innocent" labels read as prompt remnants rather than lived-in traits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora (forgiving skeptic) is present throughout and her choices create key turns: entering the garden, picking up the tooth, pressing it to her palm, initiating the bargain. The "forgiving skeptic" trait is asserted in exposition ("she believed in lies more easily than truths, but she never held them against anyone") but not tested under pressure—her actions read as curious investigator without visible internal cost tied to skepticism or forgiveness. The trait shapes framing but does not constrain a choice with trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The changeling's baby tooth appears in three distinct beats: Liora finds it on the well's rim, holds it out to the changeling, and it dissolves into light at closure. Each use advances causality: finding it opens the investigation, offering it initiates the bargain, its dissolution seals the transformation. The tooth's specificity (too small for human, root damp with blood) and its role as key to the garden's lock elevate integration. It does not, however, impose a visible cost or constraint on Liora's tactics—she uses it without friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is named explicitly ("This was a cleft in certainty, a crack in the world's skin") and shapes the premise: the wound in her brother's palm became a door. It recurs thematically in the ending ("Some cracks were meant to let the light in") and anchors Liora's bone-setter logic. The concept does not constrain a specific mid-story choice with cost—it frames understanding rather than altering tactics. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is asserted in the dialogue tag ("*'You dropped this,'* Liora said, shrewdly innocent") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The line itself could be delivered without that trait. The attribute is present in the closure third but functions as label-only, not as a tactical choice that forecloses an option or imposes a trade-off. No setup or middle development; late ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Yearn" drives Liora's investigation: she "yearned to understand" why the world let something wear her brother's shape, and this desire propels her into the garden and through the bargain. The action is signaled early (paragraph ~5) and recurs implicitly at closure when she tucks the needle away, accepting the mystery's depth. It does not create a major turn or foreclose an option with visible cost—curiosity is satisfied rather than tested. Functional but mid-range; the verb could be swapped for "needed" or "wanted" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bone-setting is signaled early ("Liora had spent years bone-setting for the village—resetting fractures, coaxing limbs back to true") and its metaphor shapes her approach: she sees the changeling problem as a wound to be set, mistakes as fractures that fester. The method recurs at closure ("She had always been good at setting bones. Now she knew how to set the world"). Mechanics, however, are not dramatized—no literal bone-setting occurs on the page, and the metaphor does not constrain a tactical choice with cost. Lyric reprise without middle-beat pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is introduced in paragraph 1, pressures every beat (the gap, the well, the changeling's hiding place), and supplies the resources (tooth, well water, symbols) that shape the outcome. The garden's "wound-door" logic (her brother's blood opened it) directly enables the climax. Spatial detail is concrete and causally active: Liora slips through the gap, the well's rim holds the tooth, the undergrowth conceals the changeling. The setting is indispensable to plot and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored: "Three days earlier, they'd found the substitute body." This past event primes Liora's investigation and establishes urgency (the brother is missing, the village burned the substitute without resolution). The three-day gap does not tighten on-page decisions—no live clock or countdown pressures Liora's moves in the garden. Present-time duration is vague; the bargain and transformation occur without temporal constraint. Setup and thematic closure participation are present; middle tactical pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to turn mistakes into constellations"—is stated explicitly in the climax ("'Turn them into stars,' Liora said. 'So we can find our way.'") and recurs in the final image (the needle humming, her hands steady, knowing "how to set the world"). It shapes the bargain's form but is not dramatized through conflicted choices—Liora articulates the desire without visible cost or friction. Setup is absent; the phrase appears late (final third) as thematic declaration. Lyric resonance at closure but no middle-beat constraint.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone blends wistful nostalgia (the brother's memory, the village whole again, woodsmoke and possibility) with invention (pulsing flowers, constellation-forming well water, changeling teeth). The register is coherent and modulates with pressure: lush and unhurried in the garden, compressed at the bargain, elegiac at closure. Minor slip: the nostalgic-innovation balance is declared in motifs rather than tested through tonal friction—comfort and strangeness coexist without dissonance. The tone charges the final image (humming needle, steady hands, dream of new teeth) without contradiction.</comment>
