<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to discover meaning is legible and her barefoot choices recur, but her internal contradiction remains largely asserted ("awkward confidence") rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The scout's hollow-to-hungry shift at the end is vivid but his role is brief; the rebellion's collective agency late in the piece blurs individual cost. Embodied emotion is strong in her laugh and grip on the glasses, yet the stakes-raising choice feels more discovered than wrestled from competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: hum → touch → light → collective ignition builds density and cadence toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure lands with felt cost (the rebellion is no longer memory but shared breath, defiant liftoff), though the cost is atmospheric rather than individually visible. One meaningful deepening (stones remembered → collective reignition) is sufficient for this length, but the final beat's collective agency dilutes the protagonist's foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The repair bay's cracked concrete, rusted girders, and half-buried stone circle constrain movement and frame discovery. The opera glasses return with reweighted light (fractals, map/message/dare) that charges the ending. Barefoot tactility (grit, vibration through soles) grounds sensory hierarchy in Lena's physicality. Spatial choreography is clean and the stones' warmth/spirals/hum supply sensory specificity that narrows and then expands options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reignite the stalled rebellion via discovered meaning) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena touches the stone and the hum surges, foreclosing passive waiting and opening collective action. Agency is present (her decision to press the slab, shout, pass the glasses), but the final escalation spreads to the collective ("filled with the sound of reignition") which diffuses individual cost. The rebellion's ignition feels earned by the stone-circle discovery, though coincidence (ancient artifact untouched, suddenly active) complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the stones as forgotten ember, the opera glasses as inherited lens, barefoot grounding versus flight. "Meaning wasn't found in clean victories, but in the stubborn, thunderous act of reaching into the dark and pulling out a spark" risks abstraction but is earned by prior concrete beats (palm to slab, glasses flaring, engine coughs). The final image (ship shadow stretching defiant, Lena listening to the hum as a name) offers a non-literal answer to "how to reignite" with conceptual cost (the mess is the point, not victory). Minor slip: "thunderous serenity" and "name echoing from the edges of the sky" veer toward assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices "dust motes swirling in slanted light," "skeletal remains of engines," and feels vibration "in the soles of her feet" before hearing it. POV is stable third-limited; distance modulates purposefully (close during stone contact, wider during collective ignition). The scout's brief dialogue ("It's not over") is functional but minimal. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the moment's urgency ("a yawn in the margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity") without clear voice motivation, creating minor register drift under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the stone-circle sequence. Minor scaffold: "a vibration, not in the air, but in the soles of her feet" then "hum, deep and resonant" restates the same content; "the hum surged, climbing her arm, settling in her chest like a second heartbeat" uses template cadence (verb, gerund, gerund). Figurative density ("yawn in the margin," "awkward...like a bird with one wing askew," "thunderous serenity," "war drum made of stars") clusters without pattern-teaching, risking overwriting. These artifacts touch the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of barefoot stargazer, vintage opera glasses, ancient stone circle, and spaceport repair bay is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of rebellion-as-memory into rebellion-as-shared-breath through tactile/sonic discovery feels fresh. Risk: the stone-circle awakening borders on convenient mysticism, but the glasses' inherited history and Lena's bare-feet grounding provide earned particularity. The final image (listening rather than watching) reweights prior material. Mid-band rather than high due to the late-emerging coincidence (stones activate now) and the reliance on lyric assertion at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lena (barefoot stargazer) is present throughout; her barefoot state grounds sensory perception (grit, vibration) and her stargazing frames early hope. Her decision to press the stone and shout over the din creates two key turns. Observation alone (raising opera glasses to horizon) trends lower, but tactile agency (palm to slab) and vocal agency (shouting, passing glasses) shape the ending. Present in closure (listening to the hum) but her final stance is receptive rather than decisively choosing a new path with visible individual cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Opera glasses appear in paragraph 2 (raised to scan horizon), return in paragraph 6 (flare with light when turned toward stones), and are passed hand-to-hand in paragraph 7, becoming the ignition mechanism. Three beats, reweighted meaning (from nostalgic tool to fractal map/dare), and causal role in spreading the vision. Not indispensable—another inherited tool could serve—but the vintage/brass/smudged specificity and the light-flare transformation tie tightly to theme and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Lull in rebellion" is signaled early ("silence so thick it hummed like a dead transmission," "rebel ships had vanished weeks ago") and shapes the dominant stake: why the rebellion stalled, what can restart it. The hum's arrival directly answers the lull (forgotten how to listen, stones remember). The concept constrains tactics (no external enemy on-page; discovery rather than combat) and the ending explicitly reweights it ("The lull was over"). Core to plot logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" is labeled early ("her confidence awkward in its certainty, like a bird with one wing slightly askew") and reprised at the end ("that awkward confidence of hers"). The simile provides texture but the trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with visible cost. Her actions (stepping closer, pressing the stone, shouting) read as bold rather than awkward; no moment dramatizes the friction between confidence and awkwardness altering an outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Reignite" is the explicit goal and the climactic action: Lena's touch ignites the stones' roar, the opera glasses flare and pass from hand to hand, engines cough to life, the first ship lifts off. The word appears twice ("sound of reignition," title-level stake). Drives the final third and redefines options from stalled to collective momentum. Mechanics are somewhat mystical (why now?) but causal chain from discovery to ignition to liftoff is clear and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Ancient stone circle is signaled early (paragraph 4: "half-buried in the bay's far corner," "too strange to be scrap, too silent to be a threat"), provides the mechanism (hum through soles → palm touch → surge → thunderous roar), and its "remembered" function charges the ending ("stones didn't just hum—they remembered"). Shapes two beats (approach, touch) and closure participation (stones pulsing brighter as backdrop to liftoff). The hum's mechanics remain abstract (why stones, why now?) but the method is irreplaceable to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport repair bay is anchored early (title-level framing: "rusted girders," "cracked concrete," "skeletal remains of engines") and its neglected status enables the discovery (artifact "no one had bothered to remove"). The bay's acoustic properties amplify the hum ("shaking loose flakes of rust from the rafters," "groaning metal waking like a beast"), and the final image uses its concrete ("shadow stretching long and defiant across the cracked concrete"). Micro-setting (stones, bay's bones) alters tactics and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Margin of daylight" is signaled in the opening line and reprised at the end ("sun dipped below the horizon"). Time pressure is atmospheric (daylight fading) but does not tighten individual decisions; Lena's exploration and the collective ignition occur within the dusk window without a live clock forcing trade-offs. The timeframe provides tone (liminal, threshold) and frames the liftoff image but does not alter tactics or narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Discover meaning in the mess" is dramatized: Lena enters the bay "desperate for it to be the former" (something vs. nothing), recognizes "the universe would hide its secrets in a place everyone had given up on," and the ending declares "meaning wasn't found in clean victories, but in the stubborn, thunderous act of reaching into the dark." Motivation drives her approach to the stones and her decision to press the slab. Slight friction: the stones deliver meaning rather than Lena wrestling competing interpretations, so cost is diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" is labeled explicitly ("a thunderous serenity that filled the bay") and modulates: the opening silence "hummed like a dead transmission," the stones' hum is "deep and resonant," then "roared," and the ending layers "thunderous act" with listening (receptive serenity). Tone charges the final image (Lena listening, not watching) and coheres across escalation. The oxymoron is asserted rather than fully embodied in syntax or rhythm, and the label appears once mid-piece, reducing its pervasive integration.</comment>
