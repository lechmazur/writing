<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lydia's interiority shows embodied contradiction—the "itch in the bones" and her positioning as "never the star" versus her persistent stage hunger. The synesthesia trait remains largely decorative ("taste of burnt caramel, the scent of a violin's first trembling note") without constraining her choices under pressure. Elias arrives mid-story with minimal agency; his shift from despair to forward motion lacks visible internal struggle or micro-choices that would make the change earned on the page. The final renunciation (Lydia fading, knowing she'll return) carries some cost but the protagonist's arc feels more like repetition of an established pattern than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by ~80 words ("Lydia had been dead for seventy-three years...the hedge maze behind the old theater"). The piece operates under a hybrid lens—accumulative texture building toward a situational moment when Elias stands—and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias pockets the pills and steps forward, reweighting his options. Cost is felt ("the boy stood, pocketed the pills") but remains oblique; the "echo of his heartbeat" and Lydia's awareness that he'll "forget this ever happened" suggest ephemerality rather than a sharp before/after with visible price. The fractured-timeline premise is declared but not causally active in narrowing Elias's or Lydia's tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The orchard and maze anchor spatially with vivid, synesthetic detail ("gnarled trees heavy with fruit that shimmered like bruised silver"). Micro-setting qualifies: the apple and the coin are handled, and the path that "unspooled between the trees" guides movement. The stone bench and the hedge maze pressure Elias's isolation and Lydia's intervention, and the theater ghost light frames the ending. Sensory selection is purposeful ("petals that crunched underfoot like brittle applause"), filtered through Lydia's synesthetic POV, and the orchard's quasi-sentience ("the orchard obeyed") charges the closure beat when the trees "swayed in approval."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—luring Elias from despair—is signaled when Lydia recognizes "the set of his jaw, the hollow look in his eyes." One meaningful tightening occurs when she "pulled the timeline taut" and shows him future visions, forcing the choice to pocket the pills. The escalation is accumulative (texture building to a single decision point) rather than causal with reversals. Elias's agency is minimal; the visions and Lydia's intervention do the lifting, and his internal resistance or trade-off is not dramatized. The cost is felt but not sharp: "the path sealed shut" and he'll forget, suggesting ephemerality over a visible forfeiture that changes tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme—ghost-intervention as quiet encore, hope passed between strangers—emerges from particulars (the coin, the orchard echoes, Lydia's repeated curtain calls) without overt moralizing. The final image ("the music tasted like hope") reweights prior material with a non-literal answer. Synesthesia and the fractured timeline remain more atmospheric than thematically integrated into Elias's or Lydia's moral calculus. The piece resists false equivalence (Lydia's generosity is real, Elias's despair is not pathologized), and the quiet ending earns resonance through the orchard's approval and the violin's return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored in Lydia with stable psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture ("her voice was the sound of a record spinning backward") and perceptual signature (synesthetic coloring of every sensory moment). The register remains consistent and elevated without corporate drift; purposeful compression ("mid-bow, mid-note, mid-*breath*") accelerates at peak beats. Elias's minimal interiority when focus shifts to him ("Elias exhaled, sharp") is handled cleanly without head-hopping; his dialogue is sparse and goal-free, which fits his passivity but limits voice distinction. No dialogue feels forced or expository; the exchange is minimal and imagistic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with short bursts at peak moments and longer sentences during reflection. Information density is high in the opening ("seventy-three years...the stage still called her") but several paraphrase loops appear: "She'd worn that same expression once" echoes the prior recognition beat without advancing it, and "Some encores were quieter than others" restates the thematic claim. Template cadence appears in the closure sequence: "Some encores were... Some were just... Lydia smiled. The curtain would... And this time... She bowed anyway. The night swallowed..." The stacked short declaratives feel algorithmic and dull momentum. Figurative density ("orchard sighed—a sound that wasn't sound but the color of dusk dissolving") risks overwriting but remains legible. No grammar or tense breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ghost-mentor frame and suicidal-teen encounter are familiar templates; the piece transforms them through synesthetic texture and the orchard's quasi-sentience but not through moral calculus or a non-obvious choice. The tarot coin and fractured timeline add surface novelty without altering the arc's emotional logic: Lydia could intervene without those specifics. The quiet ending and the "echo" mechanics feel purposeful but not risky; the story hedges by having Elias forget, which softens the cost and mutes originality. Transformation test: the core arc (mentor saves despairing teen, then returns to her routine) survives with generic substitutes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lydia (encore-seeking stage ghost) is present throughout and makes one key choice: to intervene and "pull the timeline taut" to show Elias visions. Her final decision to fade and return to the theater is consistent with her pattern but not a turn—it's repetition of her established role. She drives the middle beat and shapes the ending image (bowing to the trees), meeting two integration gates. However, her choices feel more like enactment of her nature than conflict-driven decisions with visible cost; the "only the ghost in the wings" framing undercuts agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tarot coin (hand-painted, fool/king, worn smooth) appears early ("Tucked in her pocket") as an anchor prop, is handled mid-story ("rolled the coin across her knuckles, letting the echoes...bleed into the air"), and is transferred to Elias at the climax ("pressed the coin into his palm"). It meets all three gates (setup, development, closure). The coin's "echoes of its past lives" enable Lydia's intervention by grounding the visions, and the statement "It always did" (return to her) charges the closure with cyclical cost. Specificity is strong (hand-painted, winking fool/weeping king), but swappability test: another liminal object (a locket, a key) could serve similar functions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The fractured timeline is declared early ("the timeline she'd fractured the night she died") and mentioned at the climax ("pulled the timeline taut between her hands"). It does not constrain tactics or create visible obstacles; Lydia's ability to "pull the timeline taut" and produce visions is asserted without cost or friction. The mechanic is not taught—how fracturing enables this particular intervention remains unclear—and no prior beat shows her struggling with or being limited by the fracture. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than a causal lever. Missing meaningful development gate; closure participation is oblique (the path seals, suggesting temporal closure, but the timeline itself is not reweighted).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Synesthesia (the attribute) is signaled early ("Synesthesia had been her curse in life, her gift in death") and demonstrated repeatedly ("the taste of burnt caramel, the scent of a violin's first trembling note"; "the music tasted like hope"). It colors perception throughout but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The visions Lydia produces are described synesthetically ("the taste of chalk, the smell of rain"), but the trait itself is not shown as limiting or enabling her intervention—she would still press the coin and offer the visions without it. Label-only in function; the trait enriches texture but lacks causal pressure. Present in the ending image but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Intertwine" appears at the climax: Lydia "intertwined her fingers with the branches above them, pulling the timeline taut." This gesture produces the visions that prompt Elias to stand, making it central to the turn. The action is specific and irreplaceable in its theatrical staging. However, it is introduced late (past midpoint) without prior setup; no earlier beat teaches that Lydia can or must intertwine to produce effects. The mechanic feels asserted rather than earned. Closure linkage is strong (the visions directly cause Elias's choice), but late arrival and lack of grounding in prior constraints lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By producing echoes" (the method) is seeded early ("the contact sang through her: the taste of burnt caramel") and demonstrated when Lydia rolls the coin "letting the echoes of its past lives bleed into the air: the clink of a gambler's luck...the *thud* of her own body." The method enables the visions ("A memory unfurled") that shift Elias's stance. Present in three beats (apple touch, coin roll, vision sequence) and shapes the middle and ending. Swappability concern: the method reads as "showing visions" with "echoes" as flavor; a generic psychic nudge could replace it. Cost is not tied to producing echoes—Lydia fades at the end but not because of echo-production strain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mystic orchard/hedge maze is anchored early ("the hedge maze behind the old theater"; "The orchard hummed in the dark") and active across beats: Lydia plucks fruit, the maze shifts to offer a path, the center holds the stone bench, and the trees "leaned in" and "swayed in approval" at closure. Setting constrains movement (the path "unspooled," later "sealed shut") and provides the coin and visions as resources tied to place. The orchard's quasi-sentience ("the orchard obeyed") and the rule "when the garden offered a way, you took it" make it a participant rather than backdrop. Strong irreplaceability and closure charge; the trees' applause-like swaying completes Lydia's encore motif.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the business closes" (the timeframe) is implied by "the dark" and the theater context but never explicitly anchored or tracked. No clock pressure shapes choices; the encounter unfolds at an unspecified pace with no urgency tied to dawn or discovery. The phrase "the night swallowed her whole" confirms nocturnal setting but does not tighten tactics. Timeframe is present as atmosphere but does not constrain or escalate. Missing development and payoff gates; present only as vague backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to lure possibility from the brink of despair" is dramatized: Lydia recognizes Elias's despair, intervenes with the visions of future possibility, and succeeds when he pockets the pills and steps forward. Her desire is consistent with her stage-ghost identity ("the stage still called her") and shown in action (plucking the fruit, rolling the coin, pressing it into his palm). Friction exists: she knows "she was never the star of someone else's story" and that Elias will forget, which tempers triumph with cost. The motivation drives two beats (recognition, intervention) and shapes the ending. However, internal conflict is muted—Lydia's decision to intervene is never in doubt, reducing tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone (rising nostalgia) is established early through "the stage still called her," the theater ghost light, and "mid-bow, mid-note, mid-*breath*" evoking Lydia's past. It modulates with the encounter (Elias's despair introduces melancholy) and rises again at closure: "the branches clapping like an audience that would never leave. She bowed anyway." The final image ("the music tasted like hope") recasts nostalgia as forward-looking rather than mournful. Coherent across turns and present in the ending image, but the nostalgic charge is diluted by the expository phrasing ("Some encores were quieter") and the hedged cost (Elias forgets). Tone shapes mood more than it pressures choices.</comment>
