<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("sensory map," "narratives," "threads of cause and effect") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to step through the seam feels inevitable given the setup but lacks visible cost—she grins and steps forward without forfeiting anything on the page. Internal conflict is more asserted than dramatized; her "pulse quickened" and she "didn't flinch" are stock reactions. The man's reappearance and hand-holding resolve tension without friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric recurrence (shard, seam, map metaphor). Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; when is dreamlike but cued early. The closure moment—stepping through with the man, becoming "the map"—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract: "the weight in her chest wasn't fear" describes a feeling without forfeiting a live option or revealing what she left behind. The seam's redirection and shard transformation mid-scene create a micro turn, but the final step forward carries no legible price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is anchored early with vivid sensory detail: "ozone and old grease," "rusted girders groaning like bones." The green glass shard functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning (green → clear → green again) and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear—boot striking shard, palm to cargo lift, seam on far wall—and the shard's tactile presence ("burned cold") constrains her choice to close her eyes and expand her map inward. The setting pressures the protagonist's sensory method and shapes the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: "to discover the weight of a withheld truth," signaled by Liora's pocketing of the shard and her pursuit of the seam. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seam snaps shut, then reopens only after she closes her eyes and expands her map inward—a choice that narrows her options to internal perception. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off: what does she renounce or forfeit by stepping through? The man's presence and hand-holding deflate tension rather than test her commitment. Coincidence (the man waiting, the shard transforming) complicates but does not resolve, yet the final step forward carries no legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of navigation, truth, and agency emerges through the recurring "map" and "seam" imagery, with the final line "She was the map now. / And the map was endless" offering a non-literal answer to the withheld-truth premise. However, the ending edges toward abstraction: "the thrill of the next thread, the next world, the next choice" asserts rather than embodies resolution. The shard's transformation (green → clear → green again) is a purposeful pattern that charges the closure, but the man's line "I left it for you" and the hand-holding soften the cost. Thematic resonance is present but lacks the particularity that would elevate it into high bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with patterned diction ("cyclically spontaneous," "substructure of reality," "narratives, threads of cause and effect") that establishes Liora's perceptual signature early. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "the weight in her chest wasn't fear. / It was the thrill of the next thread" tells rather than embodies. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("You weren't supposed to find that," "Took you long enough"), advancing plot without deep subtext. The prose compresses well under pressure, but the final beats lean on conceptual vocabulary that slightly flattens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in descriptive beats: "the ghost of machinery," "a lattice of vibrations, scents, and the faintest electric thrum." However, paraphrase loops appear: "The weight of it was wrong—not in grams, but in *meaning*" closely echoes the later "The weight in her pocket grew heavier, not with mass, but with *promise*." Template cadence: "She pocketed the shard. / The weight of it was wrong" and similar short declarative runs in the final third create minor monotony. Stock metaphor: "like bones in the murmur of half-remembered dreams." No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, but cumulative minor slips prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The sensory-map-maker navigating parallel universes is a fresh synthesis, and the shard's transformation (green → clear → two shards) is a non-obvious turn. However, the core frame—protagonist discovers mysterious object, navigates liminal space, meets enigmatic guide—closely resembles widely used speculative templates. The ending's "She was the map now" risks abstraction without the lived particulars that would ground it. The piece commits to its lyric, accumulative design and avoids safety-middle hedging, but the final hand-holding and grinning step forward deflate risk. Transformation is partial; bolder cost at closure would lift originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora's sensory-map ability is present throughout: tracing vibrations, sensing resonance, expanding her map inward. Setup is immediate (first paragraph). Development: her choice to close her eyes and expand "in" rather than outward opens the seam (middle choice with consequence). Payoff: "She was the map now" at closure. However, her decisions are reactive rather than driving key turns—the seam appears, redirects, and reopens in response to her stance, not her active choice. No visible cost tied to her map-making constrains the final step. Two beats with causal involvement, closure participation, but low agency and no cost linkage place this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The green glass shard is handled across multiple beats: discovered (boot striking it), pocketed, transforms (green → clear), then splits into two (green and clear) before becoming whole again in the man's hand. Setup early (second beat), development (transformation constrains her choice to expand her map inward), and payoff (held up at closure, made whole, reweighted as "I left it for you"). Three distinct beats, closure linkage strong, specific cost (the shard's transformation signals the seam's behavior). High irreplaceability—removing the shard would break the closure logic. Caps allow ≥7.0; strong closure participation and beat involvement justify high placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is present as theme and backstory ("parallel universe where the sky bled violet," "threads of cause and effect stretched between worlds") and shapes the premise, but its mechanics remain abstract. The seam and "redirect" action gesture toward the concept, but how weaving functions on the page is unclear—does Liora choose which world, or does the universe "bend to meet her"? Setup clear, but development is passive (the seam acts on her), and payoff is thematic rather than tactical. Functional presence with one causal beat (stepping through), but swappable with "portal travel" or similar. Mid-band functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is mentioned once in the opening ("the pull had been cyclically spontaneous") as a label for her compulsion to visit the spaceport. It does not constrain or enable any later choice—Liora's actions are deliberate (tracing, pocketing, stepping) rather than cyclical or spontaneous. No setup of cost or trade-off tied to this trait; no development or closure participation. Present but ornamental, no causal pressure. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Redirect" appears as the man's final word in backstory ("his voice redirecting into static"), as the intercom's description ("The speaker hissed"), and crucially as the seam's behavior: "the tear *redirected*, snapping shut." This action drives the key reversal—Liora's fingers pass through empty air, forcing her to change tactics (close eyes, expand map inward). Setup in backstory, development at the seam closure/reopening, and payoff when the shard and seam return. Two beats with causal pressure, closure linkage moderate (the seam reopens but "redirect" is not named at the end). Essential to the middle turn but slightly less visible at closure. Mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Parallel universes are mentioned in backstory ("a parallel universe where the sky bled violet") and implied by "worlds brushing against this one" and "weaving between worlds," but the method is not signaled or demonstrated until the very end ("The air on the other side smelled of rain and burning paper"). No setup of how the method works, no development (Liora does not attempt to navigate universes mid-scene), and payoff is arrival rather than mechanics. Late appearance, ornamental mention in backstory, no causal constraint. Functional but replaceable with "portal" or "dimensional travel." Below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is anchored immediately ("rusted girders," "ozone and old grease," "dying lights") and supplies concrete resources: the green glass shard on the floor, the collapsed cargo lift Liora touches to sense resonance, the far wall where the seam appears. Setup strong (first paragraph), development (cargo lift enables her to trace the man's voice, spatial layout guides her approach to the seam), and payoff (the spaceport dissolves at closure, but its sensory particulars charge the final image by contrast with "rain and burning paper"). Three beats, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage present. Setting shapes tactics and the final image; removing it would weaken but not break the story. High functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears once in the opening line as atmospheric description, not as a timeframe. No clock, no ticking pressure, no dramatized passage of time that alters tactics. The piece's present-tense urgency is clear, but "half-remembered dreams" functions as tone rather than temporal constraint. Present as flavor, absent as functional timeframe. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To discover the weight of a withheld truth" is signaled in Liora's recognition of the shard ("She knew this fragment") and articulated explicitly: "This was why she'd come: to discover the weight of a withheld truth." Setup early, development when the shard transforms and she must choose to expand her map inward, and payoff when the man says "I left it for you" and the truth is reframed as intentional gift rather than withheld secret. Two beats, closure linkage moderate. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized in conflicted choices—Liora pursues without friction or competing desire. Functional with closure participation, but low embodied cost. Mid-band.</comment>
