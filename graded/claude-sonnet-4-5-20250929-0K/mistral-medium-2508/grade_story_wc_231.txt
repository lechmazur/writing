<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior shows purposeful observation (the boutonnière investigation, the stranger's trembling hands) and the final choice to "let the light do the rest" with embodied cost—the boutonnière crumbles by dawn. However, most character work remains reflective rather than embodied: "Elias was an eccentric by necessity" tells rather than shows, and key realizations ("memories weren't his," "some memories weren't meant to be kept") arrive as assertions rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The ending gesture forecloses a path but the journey to it lacks visible micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes accumulative/textural mode clearly: pattern is taught early via fragments (the flower, the log, the stranger's eyes), and the closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when Elias "lets the light do the rest," reweighting the premise of memory-keeping with felt cost (the boutonnière crumbles, the memory is "finally free"). Orientation is clean by ~120 words. The accumulation tightens through investigation beats and the saltwater steeping, but the central turn—understanding that memories are passed vessels—arrives via summary reflection rather than through a dramatized choice that narrows options, weakening escalation under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, nautical twilight, and lighthouse form a coherent micro-setting filtered through Elias's observer role. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "slick with the breath of the sea," "dried storms and shipwreck sand," "sea sighed against the pilings." The boutonnière's physical transformation in saltwater and the Fresnel lens adjustment constrain the final beat, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (dock → workshop → lantern room). No occupation-level depth is required here, and the environment shapes rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early and tightens through investigation: the flower steeping reveals "fragments of a face," Elias grasps that "memories weren't his," and he chooses to pass them on. Under accumulative lens, the deepening reweights the boutonnière from relic to vessel. However, the key realization arrives through summary reflection ("Elias understood now") rather than a pressure-test choice that forecloses a live option with visible friction. The cost—letting the memory go—is legible at closure but not fought for on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (the duty to witness and release borrowed suffering) emerges organically from the lighthouse keeper role, the boutonnière's transformation, and the final image of light as passage. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "Some memories weren't meant to be kept. They were meant to be passed on." The motif of borrowed memory accumulates through particulars (the 1902 log, lavender scent, saltwater steeping) and reweights at closure. One slip: "the keeper of forgotten things" edges toward prompt-speak, and the final paragraph inches close to thematic summary ("finally free") but avoids full sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is specific: "the way the tide hesitated," "the way seagulls fell quiet," "gaps" as method. Diction is elevated but voice-consistent ("opal dock," "breath of the sea," "driftwood voice"). The stranger's whispered line carries natural subtext. Register holds under pressure; no head-hopping. One minor slip: "That was the trouble with borrowed memories: they never quite fit" edges toward helpful-narrator commentary rather than staying strictly interior, but it's brief and the texture recovers immediately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is often lyric and purposeful: "stretched into the mist like a half-remembered dream," "soft but persistent, like the pulse of the beacon." Information density is high and momentum steady. However, several craft issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("the way the stranger's pupils had dilated… as if the memory belonged to someone else" / "The memories weren't his. They were echoes"), template cadence in reflection blocks ("the way X, the way Y, the way Z" repeated across two paragraphs), and figurative density in non-peak beats ("vein of forgotten bone," "threaded with a hundred borrowed goodbyes") that risks overwriting. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping penalty per the non-closure rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse keeper + borrowed memories + physical flower transformation is specific and non-obvious; the saltwater steeping and light-as-passage create fresh inflection. Execution transforms the familiar "keeper of lost things" trope through tactile particulars (the workshop jars, the Fresnel lens, the flower unfurling into face fragments). Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "keeper of forgotten things" whisper and memory-vessel framing echo common metaphysical-keeper templates; stronger lived detail or moral calculus would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elias present throughout; his observation shapes investigation beats (the gouge, the nets, the 1902 log) and his choice to "let the light do the rest" closes the story. Setup clear, middle development via steeping/investigation, closure participation via final lens adjustment and decision. Two gates solid, closure linkage present. However, most turns trace to reflection rather than high-pressure decisions that alter tactics under constraint, and his eccentricity remains told rather than embodied in micro-choices. Causal work present but not indispensable; swappable with a similar observer role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Boutonnière introduced early (opening beat), handled in ≥3 beats (pressed into palm, traced under magnifying glass, steeped in saltwater, pinned back, crumbles by dawn), and its transformation drives the central revelation. Setup, development (steeping unfurls fragments), and payoff (worn at closure, crumbles) all present. Causal pressure: the flower's preserved state and saltwater reaction unlock the memory mechanism. Closure linkage strong: final wearing and crumbling charge the passage image. Specificity high (Edelweiss, preserved petals, saltwater reaction). Cost tied to its disintegration. One friction: the mechanics of how it reveals faces/emotions remain abstract, limiting full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Borrowed memories named and thematically present; the story hinges on the premise that memories pass from soul to soul. Setup via stranger's gesture and Elias's realization, development through steeping revelation, payoff in final release. However, the concept functions primarily as backstory explanation and theme rather than shaping on-page tactics or choices with visible cost. The flower's mechanics do the work; "borrowed memory" itself remains label and metaphor. Functional but swappable with similar metaphysical-transfer concepts. No direct cost tied to memory-borrowing on the page; the flower's disintegration carries the price.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" attributed to the lamp's glow ("soft but persistent, like the pulse of the beacon") and used to describe the final memory. Setup present (lamp lit), payoff in final paragraph ("soft, persistent, and finally free"). The trait echoes the lighthouse's function and Elias's method. However, it remains descriptive label rather than constraining or enabling action with cost. No middle beat where persistence alters tactics. Lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly but does not impose tradeoff. Present and thematically coherent but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Investigation drives the middle: Elias observes absences (gouge, lavender nets, 1902 log), steeps the flower, and traces its petals under magnifying glass. Setup clear, development across multiple beats, investigation method shapes revelation. However, the investigation unfolds via summary reflection rather than pressured real-time choices; the flower steeping happens in one paragraph without tactical friction or cost. The ending traces more to passive understanding ("Elias understood now") than investigative agency that redefines options. Functional and present but not indispensable; revelation could arrive through other means with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Method signaled early: "Elias had spent the last seventy-two hours investigating… by observing the absences." Examples provided (gouge, nets, lighthouse log, preserved flower). Setup and development present; the method frames the investigation and primes the reader for the saltwater reveal. Payoff indirect: the understanding that memories are echoes traces to gap-observation. However, the method itself does not mechanically shape attempts or impose cost; it's a lens for narration rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Swappable with "close attention" or "careful study" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Opal dock introduced in opening line, mist established as filter, location anchors opening and closing beats ("Below, the opal dock gleamed"). Setup strong, payoff solid (final image: "the opal dock gleamed like a vein of forgotten bone"). The dock serves as threshold where the stranger vanished and light reaches. Mist functions as atmosphere supporting "witnessed isolation" tone. However, the dock does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome; Elias's key actions occur in workshop and lantern room. Micro-setting viable but the dock itself remains postcard frame rather than tactical pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Nautical twilight named in opening line, establishing time window. However, time remains static backdrop; no ticking clock tightens decisions, no tactical shifts tied to advancing hour. The boutonnière "would crumble by dawn" provides future endpoint but does not pressure present choices. Present and thematically apt (transition light supports passage theme) but functionally ornamental. Swappable with "dusk" or "evening" without structural impact. Missing middle development and closure participation as active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation clear from stranger's opening gesture and explicit by midpoint: Elias investigates to decode "something unsaid." Setup solid, development via investigation beats, payoff when he grasps the plea and chooses to pass the memory on. The desire drives investigation and final choice. However, friction between want and cost remains minimal on the page; Elias moves smoothly from curiosity to understanding to release without visible internal conflict or tradeoff. Told and dramatized in acts but not tested under contradictory pressures. Functional and essential to arc but lacks the friction or complication that would elevate score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone of witnessed isolation established early ("half-remembered dream," "tending the beam," "man who noticed gaps") and sustained through "Lighthouses were built for witnessing isolation" and the closing image of light, dock, and "borrowed goodbyes." Coherent across turns, modulates subtly with investigation and revelation beats without breaking mood. The final image charges the tone: Elias as witness allowing passage. However, tone remains relatively static—one continuous melancholic register without sharp modulation under pressure. Strong thematic fit and closure charge, but lacks the dynamic range that would push into high 8s.</comment>
