<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's obsession with the color of sound is established early and drives him into the wreck, but his interior life remains diffuse—reading waterlogged journals and wandering feel more like atmospheric gestures than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The climactic choice to light his own lantern and "sign" a vow lacks embodied cost; we see him pocket a key and strike flint, but the stakes of renunciation or what path is foreclosed remain abstract. The faceless figure's declaration that "the color of sound isn't found—it's made" lands as an epiphany delivered rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. Interiority is vivid in places ("his pulse thrumming in his throat") but drifts into label-only metaphor ("cobalt despair, amber longing") without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elias, lamplighter) and where (pier, *Marigold* wreck) within the opening, meeting the test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: lanterns, colors, sound, and the library accrue symbolic weight toward a final reconfiguration. However, the closure unit—Elias lighting his own lantern and the figure dissolving—offers conceptual repricing (vows are shown, not spoken; sound-color is made) but the cost remains implicit and atmospheric rather than legible on the page. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early (metronome boots, swinging lantern, rising sky lanterns) and pays it off with the final glow "threaded with hues he had no name for," but the causal link between finding the key, opening the door, and his choice to light a new lantern feels elliptical rather than motivated. The "vow Elias had just signed in silence" is asserted in summary, not shown as a decision that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken *Marigold* library is rendered with vivid, selective detail: "brine and old promises," "pages fused into brittle sculptures," the silver-thread hum on the single intact volume. The skeleton key and its keyhole "gleamed, untouched by rust" function as micro-setting that gates Elias's passage into the frozen-lantern vision, directly shaping the middle turn. The sky-lantern festival provides a visual and temporal frame, and the contrast between the festival's amber glow and the violet-gold hues beyond the door charges the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (pier → shallows → hull → library → door), though the transition back to the pier after the door dissolves is abrupt and could disorient briefly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and coheres through Elias's progression from journal obsession to the library door. Pressure tightens when he finds the key, unlocks the door, and confronts the figure's challenge, narrowing his path to a single choice: light his own lantern. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than agent-driven; Elias wades, ducks, finds, and unlocks in a sequence of discoveries rather than decisions under friction. The cost of his final act (releasing the lantern, dissolving the vision) is implied—his light "no longer yellow but threaded with hues"—but what he forfeits or what path closes remains abstract. The figure's assertion that "the color of sound isn't found—it's made" reframes the stake conceptually, yet Elias's choice to light the lantern feels inevitable rather than a trade-off with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the accumulation of images and the closure reconfiguration: vows are shown not spoken, truths wait rather than hide, and the synaesthetic quest resolves into creation rather than discovery. The returning motif of lanterns shifts meaning—from utilitarian work to festival spectacle to the frozen violet-gold vision to Elias's own chromatic flame—and the final line "the sound of the waves crashing below didn't just roar—it *shimmered*" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the figure's signing (silent communication of a luminous vow) and in Elias's pocket of the key without immediate explanation. The piece resists overt moralizing and allows ambiguity (what exactly did Elias vow? what cost attends his new sight?), though the last two paragraphs edge toward thematic summary with "some truths aren't hidden—they're *waiting*."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtering all perception through Elias's lamplighter idiom and synaesthetic obsession. The prose carries a consistent lyric texture—"boots left no prints on the salt-crusted deck," "lantern swinging like a metronome," "beam cutting through dust motes like a blade through veil after veil of half-truths"—that suits the atmospheric, Accumulative lens. The figure's silent signing is a strong formal choice that enacts the "luminous vows are shown" theme. However, several figurative constructions drift into elevated register ("cobalt despair, amber longing," "a chorus of creaking timber and sighing metal… vibrating in his bones with hues he almost recognized") that feel slightly exterior to a working lamplighter's vocabulary, especially under stress. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the door, wider at the festival), and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, with strong opening and closing images. Sentence variety supports the lyric accumulation, and the piece avoids major loops or scaffolding. However, figurative density is high throughout, and several metaphors stack without clear payoff: "boots left no prints" (immateriality?), "lantern swinging like a metronome counting down to dawn" (urgency or routine?), "beam cutting through dust motes like a blade through veil after veil of half-truths" (mixed vehicle—beam as blade cutting veils). In the climactic library sequence, phrases like "pages fused into brittle sculptures of lost knowledge" and "the *Marigold* groaned around him, a chorus of creaking timber and sighing metal, each note vibrating in his bones with hues he almost recognized—cobalt despair, amber longing" pile decoration onto a beat that would gain from compression. The transition "—until Elias stood alone on the pier again" uses an em-dash to leap across a causal gap, obscuring how the vision dissolved and what immediate action or realization prompted his return. No major grammatical errors, but the elevated diction in peak beats reduces immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of lamplighter, sunken library, skeleton key from a burned hotel, and synaesthetic quest is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock fantasy templates. The silent signing of vows by a faceless figure is a fresh formal choice that enacts theme rather than stating it. The story commits fully to its lyric, Accumulative design and follows the logic of metaphor-as-world-rule (sound bleeds into hue, silence has shape). However, the conceptual repricing at closure—"the color of sound isn't found—it's made"—echoes familiar craft-vs-discovery dichotomies, and the emotional arc (lonely obsessive finds validation through solitary enlightenment) is archetypal. The piece takes structural risk with its elliptical transitions and high metaphor density, which heightens atmosphere without obscuring clarity at closure, earning +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choices (wading into the shallows, ducking under the hull, opening the door with the key, lighting his own lantern) drive the sequence. He appears in the opening paragraph, constrains his own path by seeking the *Marigold*, and participates in the closure by releasing the lantern. However, most of his actions are discoveries or responses to what he finds rather than decisions under friction; the key choice (lighting the lantern) feels inevitable rather than a contested turn. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (moderate) +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection (implied) +0.2 = base ~7.2. Swappability (another seeker-figure could perform similar moves) −0.5, summary-only vow in final paragraph −0.5 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The skeleton key tag is introduced at midpoint (the lectern scene), used to unlock the door in the next beat, and its origin (the burned *Grand Mirage* hotel, guests' final whispers) adds backstory pressure. It appears in three functional beats: discovery with the passage quote, pocketing, and unlocking the door. Early signal (second third) −0.3, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (gates the vision) +1.2, closure linkage (opens the door that leads to the figure and Elias's choice) +1.0, specificity (hotel crest, tarnished tag, "luminous vows" passage) +0.6 = ~7.9. Swappability (any key could unlock; the hotel backstory is mentioned but not leveraged in the ending) −0.5 = 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Luminous vows frame the piece: the passage "Luminous vows are not spoken, but shown" is quoted at the lectern, the figure signs rather than speaks, and Elias's final act is lighting a lantern (a visual/luminous gesture). The concept shapes the closure reconfiguration (vows shown, not spoken) and is seeded early in the title-like framing. Early signal (lectern passage, ~midpoint) +0.5, two beats (lectern quote, figure's signing) +0.9, causal pressure (moderate—concept informs closure but doesn't narrow options mid-scene) +0.8, closure linkage (the silent vow is asserted in the final paragraph) +0.9, specificity +0.5 = ~6.6. Late first appearance (second third) −0.3, summary-only vow ("the vow Elias had just signed in silence" is told, not shown) −0.5 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is mentioned once in the figure's dialogue: "You've been hiding behind the truth." The trait is asserted rather than dramatized—Elias's prior behavior (lighting lamps, reading journals, wading into wrecks) could be read as seeking or wandering, not hiding. The attribute does not constrain an on-page choice or enable a tactic; it functions as thematic accusation without visible cost. Late first appearance (final third) −0.8, ornamental (no action tied to it) −0.8, label-only −0.3 = base ~3.0. One beat (figure's line) +0.4, conceptual link to closure (the figure's challenge prompts Elias to light the lantern, arguably stepping out from hiding) +0.7 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Signify" appears twice: the figure signs with their hands, and the narrator states Elias "signed in silence" (his act of lighting the lantern). The figure's signing enacts the "luminous vows" theme and is a key beat that delivers the conceptual turn. Elias's own "signing" is summary-only and occurs off-page between the vision dissolving and his return to the pier. Early signal (figure's signing, final third) −0.6, two beats (figure's hands, narrator's assertion) +0.9, causal pressure (the figure's signing reframes Elias's goal) +1.0, closure linkage (Elias's act is framed as a signed vow) +1.0, specificity (silent hand-signing vs. spoken vows) +0.6 = ~6.9. Summary-only for Elias's own signing −0.4, late arrival (figure appears in final third) −0.6 but transformation of prior material +0.8 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By wandering purposefully" is embodied throughout: Elias wanders the pier nightly, wades into the shallows, wanders deeper into the library. The method is signaled in the opening line ("wandered the pier") and structures his entire approach—he does not search systematically but moves with lantern-like rhythm toward what calls him. Early signal +0.7, three beats (pier, shallows, library depth) +1.4, causal pressure (his wandering brings him to each discovery) +1.0, closure linkage (he releases the lantern upward, a final wandering gesture) +0.8, specificity (contrasts with directed search) +0.5 = ~7.4. Swappability (another movement verb—drifted, roamed—could substitute without altering structure) −0.6, method is shown but not explicitly named or leveraged as a conscious tactic −0.9 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken *Marigold* is introduced early (paragraph 5), described with vivid detail (brine, swollen books, silver-thread lectern), and gates Elias's discovery of the key and door. It appears in four beats: snagged lantern on rigging, wading inside, finding the volume, and finding the door. The setting directly shapes his path and the closure (the door opens from within the library). Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure (library contains key and door; its collapse hides the door) +1.4, closure linkage (door is found here; library "wasn't a ruin; it was a crucible" reframes the space at closure) +1.2, specificity (sunken ship + library is a unique combination; books as "brittle sculptures") +0.7 = ~8.4. Swappability (another hidden archive could serve similar function) −0.6 = 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sky lantern festival frames the story: lanterns rise in paragraph 4, one snags on the *Marigold*, and the festival-goers cheer as the last lantern winks out in the penultimate paragraph. The timeframe provides visual spectacle and a loose clock (Elias's journey occurs during the release), but it does not tighten tactics or create urgency—Elias could perform the same actions before, during, or after the festival. Early signal +0.6, two beats (rising lanterns, final cheer) +0.9, closure linkage (the festival's end coincides with Elias's return and relit lamp) +0.7, specificity (amber glow, frozen lanterns in vision contrast with real ones) +0.5 = ~6.7. Swappability (another event—fireworks, a storm—could frame the night) −0.7, no causal pressure (time does not narrow options) −1.2 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Discovering the color of sound is Elias's stated obsession, seeded in paragraph 2 and reinforced by the journal reference to "frequencies could bleed into hue." The motivation drives him into the wreck and to the door. However, the desire is more atmospheric than conflicted—Elias never doubts, weighs cost, or faces friction between this want and another need. Early signal +0.7, three beats (journal, library groaning with "hues he almost recognized," figure's reframing) +1.4, causal pressure (quest drives plot) +1.0, closure linkage (his final lantern glows with unnamed hues, fulfilling the quest symbolically) +1.0, specificity (synaesthetic quest) +0.5 = ~7.6. Told-only in exposition (paragraph 2) rather than dramatized in choice −0.6, no visible friction between wants and costs −0.6 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" as tone is realized through quiet, suspended imagery: boots leave no prints, the lantern swings like a metronome, the sky lanterns hang motionless, the figure is faceless and shimmering, and the waves finally "shimmered" rather than roared. The tone is consistent—hushed, luminous, unhurried—and modulates subtly (the library "groaned," the door turned "with a sound like a held breath released") without breaking into loud action. Early signal (opening line's salt-crusted deck and swinging lantern) +0.7, present throughout (no tonal breaks) +1.0, closure linkage (final shimmer charges the quiet ending) +1.3, specificity (hush is not silence but suspended sound made visible) +0.6 = ~7.6. Single static mood (consistently hushed without escalation into sharper urgency or fear) −0.5 = 7.1.</comment>
