<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The custodian's interiority is concrete and driven by contradictory impulses—she seeks meaning in coincidences while knowing retrocognition only shows missed pasts. Her renunciation of rescue in favor of pattern recognition feels earned through prior causality. Internal conflict is embodied ("teeth ache," "quiet in her own ribs") rather than summarized. The backstory about her mother's face is well-anchored and tilts her present choice, though the reflective load approaches the BRR ceiling without quite exceeding it since it primes the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening climb; the pavilion hums, the world has collapsed, and she carries the prism. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers coincidences (prism shattered when transmission died, hush settled when she touched it, constellations match her mother's birth night) until the beacon flare reweights the dominant stake. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): she sees "the shape of it—the meaning in the fractures" and steps into wind with the mended crystal, the pavilion's song "not gone." Cost is visible—she accepts another solitary climb tomorrow, foreclosing hope for human connection but embracing the work of meaning-making. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass tower with "spiral stairs…worn thin by centuries of salt wind" and the humming pavilion whose walls sing constrain her climb and charge the final image. The star-path grooves are handled tactilely ("fingertips…remembered the rhythm") and enable the rekindling. Sensory detail is purposeful: the wind's scent of rain, the perpetual dusk, the beacon cutting through it. The body-as-micro-setting qualifies (her ribs mirror the hush) and the pavilion's song reappears at closure, anchoring her decision to return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: rekindle the beacon to align coincidences and find meaning in collapse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prism mends and the beacon flares, narrowing her interpretation from "bringing the past back" to "seeing the shape of it." The realization that "the stars had aligned…and for one thistle-blown moment, the world had meant something" reconfigures her endurance—she'll climb again because "if the beacon could flare once, it could flare twice." Agency is decision with visible cost: she chooses solitary repetition over despair. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the enacted coincidences (prism break/transmission death, hush settling when she touched it, constellation alignment) rather than statement. The closing insight—"it had never been about bringing the past back…It had been about seeing the shape of it"—is earned by the beacon's flare and reweights prior material without moralizing. The final image of stepping into wind "the pavilion's song…never gone" offers a resonant, non-literal answer: meaning persists through pattern recognition, not rescue. The story avoids the "thematic echo" trap by dramatizing the realization through the light's geometry rather than articulating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: she notices star-path grooves, the hush's pulse, coincidences as threads. The prose rhythm modulates under pressure ("The prism groaned. / Then…it *mended*") without breaking voice. Filter verbs ("convinced," "heard") are voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue, so those bullets are moot. One mild register slip: "retrocognitively blessed" reads clinical for the ruined-world idiom, though it's plausibly a relic term she'd internalize. Psychic distance tightens cleanly at the beacon flare and the final step into wind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and rhythm accelerates at the beacon flare ("The star paths…ignited, one by one…The prism groaned"). Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "thistle-blown moment" conveys fragility and stakes). Minor scaffold: "Of course it had never been…It had been about…" is a paraphrase loop across two lines (−0.2). Stock metaphor "cut through" (beacon through dusk) and one elevated diction slip ("retrocognitively") in a charged beat (−0.3 combined). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Propulsion is strong through the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognition as seeing "pasts you'd missed" rather than altering them is non-obvious and specific. The coincidence-as-meaning frame (prism fractures align with transmission death, constellation geometry, the hush) feels inevitable in hindsight and grounded in star-path mechanics. The choice to make the beacon's song "not gone" rather than a one-time rescue elevates the ending. Risk-taking (lyric compression, elliptical timeline) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. No close echoes of famous texts detected; the emotional truth of solitary pattern-work under collapse reads authentic. Proximity to "lighthouse keeper in ruins" is transformed by the retrocognition mechanic and coincidence theology.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The custodian's decision to trace the star paths and her final choice to climb again tomorrow drive the two key turns. Setup by title and opening paragraph, development when she kneels and follows grooves, payoff when she tucks the mended prism and steps into wind with renewed purpose. Causal pressure is strong; her action with the prism enables the beacon flare, and her interpretation shift (from rescue to pattern-seeing) forecloses despair. Cost is visible: she commits to solitary repetition. All three gates met, two beats, closure linkage, and cost qualify her for the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prism is handled in the opening (carried in her palm), the tracing beat (pressed against the fracture), the mending beat (groans and mends), and the closing beat (tucked into her coat). Early signal, three beats, causal pressure (its mending enables the beacon), and closure linkage (she carries its mended weight as "familiar as her own ribs"). The fracture's specificity (hush inside, teeth-ache pulse) is irreplaceable. Cost connection: the prism's repair reweights her understanding. Eligible for 8.5+ but the swappability of "crystal" for another relic object at early conception caps it slightly below.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" is introduced early, pulsing in the prism's crack and mirroring "the quiet in her own ribs." It appears in the middle when she presses her palm against the fracture ("The hush…thrummed against her bones") and at closure when its "quiet murmur" replaces the scream. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is oblique (the hush enables the mending but its mechanics are thin). Lyric resonance reweights the dominant stake (silence as pre-sound, not absence) and the final murmur charges her decision to return. Two gates solidly met, one gate partial. No causal pressure that narrows options; the hush is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Retrocognition is signaled early ("retrocognitively blessed…seeing echoes of what had been") and constrains her childhood attempt (she saw her mother's face "in some other time"). At closure it enables her insight: "the pasts you'd missed" rather than rescue. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is summary-only (the gift "was just another kind of loneliness"). The trait does not visibly narrow options in the main scene; it contextualizes her interpretation but does not force a trade-off on the page. One beat (childhood memory) plus thematic payoff without mid-scene constraint qualifies for mid 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rekindling the beacon is signaled early ("If she could rekindle the light, just once"), drives the middle turn (tracing star paths ignites them, the prism mends, the beacon flares), and transforms the ending (the light's pattern proves coincidences align, prompting her to return). All three gates met, two beats, high causal pressure (the rekindling produces the alignment proof), and closure linkage. The action is irreplaceable; swapping "rekindle" for "repair" would require major structural edits. Cost connection: the flare reweights her solitude from despair to purpose. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Star paths are introduced early (carved into the glass floor), drive the middle beat (she traces the grooves "until her skin remembered the rhythm," igniting them one by one), and the beacon's light falls "in a pattern that mirrored the constellations above." Setup, development, and payoff all present. Causal pressure is strong: the method enables the rekindling. Specificity is high; the grooves' tactile memory and geometric alignment with constellations are irreplaceable. Cost connection: the paths' alignment proves her coincidence thesis. All three gates, two beats, closure linkage, and high irreplaceability qualify for the 7.0–8.4 band, upper range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass pavilion hums throughout, providing the sensory signature ("low, resonant, like…breathing") and the closing song ("the pavilion's song fading behind her, but not gone"). The star-path floor is a tactical resource (she traces it to ignite the beacon). Setup in opening paragraph, development when the paths ignite and "climbed the walls like vines," payoff when the song persists. All three gates met. The humming constrains her choice (she must be there to trace the paths) and the final song charges her decision to return. Two beats, causal and closure linkage, and cost connection (the song's persistence = meaning's persistence) qualify for 7.0–8.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The post-collapse timeframe is signaled early ("civilization collapsed into the bones of the earth," "the last transmission died," "skeletal remains of the old world") and contextualizes the stakes (she seeks meaning amid ruin). At closure the "first [rain] in years" and her acceptance of tomorrow's climb show time as ongoing constraint. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is atmospheric rather than tactical (no live clock tightens decisions). The timeframe shapes motivation but does not narrow options within the scene. Lyric reprise (perpetual dusk → rain scent) reweights the stake. Two gates, one beat (closure rain), no mid-scene clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to prove coincidences have meaning is signaled early ("maybe the coincidences would align") and dramatized through conflicting impulses: she seeks pattern despite knowing retrocognition shows only missed pasts. The beacon's alignment (prism break/transmission death, hush settling, constellation match) tests her thesis on the page. At closure she laughs "sharp and disbelieving, because of course" and commits to seeking "another thread to pull." Setup, development (the alignment enumeration), and payoff (her renewed purpose) all present. Cost is visible: she accepts solitary repetition over human connection. All three gates, two beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thistle-blown hope is established through diction ("salt wind," "dying light," "perpetual dusk") and modulates at closure (wind carries rain, the song is "not gone," "maybe—just maybe—the future did too"). The tone coheres through turns: fragile optimism survives the realization that rescue is impossible because pattern-seeing suffices. At the beacon flare the tone shifts from ache to sharp laughter to quiet resolve. The final image charges the tone (stepping into wind, song fading "but not gone") with Charged Poise. Setup through opening imagery, development in the "thistle-blown moment" line, payoff in the persistent song. All three gates, strong closure linkage, tone modulation under pressure.</comment>
