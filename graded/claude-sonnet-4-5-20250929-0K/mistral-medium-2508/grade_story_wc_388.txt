<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is motivated by a decade-long pattern of debunking conspiracies, but the turn toward acceptance of the "cure" lacks sufficient on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—he shifts from skeptic to believer too smoothly. His final choice to "turn the key" feels unmotivated by prior internal conflict; the laugh ("of course the truth wasn't a conspiracy") asserts epiphany rather than earning it through dramatized struggle. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("religion of disbelief") and the climactic renunciation lacks visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece attempts a Causal lens but the core turn—Elias pressing his palm to the diamond and letting the stillpoint "show him how to turn the key"—arrives without prior causality establishing what the key is or how he knows to operate it. The closure unit (his reaching out, the light taking him, the orchard's disappearance) reads as a Decisive Change, but the cost is asserted ("the orchard was gone. So was Elias Voss") rather than felt on the page in his final moment. The "cure" reframe lacks sufficient groundwork in prior beats to make the repricing undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard, radioactive twilight, and thriving fruit establish a vivid, purposeful environment. The stillpoint's "thick air…ozone…static" and the lead-lined pit with AEC insignia ground the scene in tactile, historically specific detail. The diamond itself and the shattered vials contribute to spatial coherence. The fruit on the truck dashboard charges the final image, and the orchard's roots constrain Elias's understanding, meeting the 9+ gate partially—but the environment does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—excavating the truth behind the Hollow Star myth—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Elias discovers the stillpoint pushes back with "meaning" and the reconstructed letters hint at a quarantine rather than accident. However, the escalation lacks a meaningful on-page trade-off or narrowing of options; Elias moves from discovery to acceptance without a beat where he must choose between competing goods or face a visible price. The tremor and uncoiling entity arrive as external events rather than consequences of his agency, and coincidence (the voice on the radio, the entity's awakening) drives the climax rather than protagonist decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme—truth as fertilizer for a hidden cure, lies that keep people alive—emerges from the orchard, diamond, and Liquidation imagery. The final image of the humming fruit and the "something growing" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the piece undercuts this with on-the-nose articulation: "every lie he'd ever debunked had been fertilizer" and "the truth wasn't a conspiracy. It was a garden" are stated rather than shown through image alone. The conceptual repricing (curse vs. cure) lacks sufficient prior dramatization of what the cure costs or saves, leaving the thematic turn asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "cracked goggles," "fingers sticky with sap," "shredded into confetti by some overzealous censor's blade." Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("man who'd made a religion of disbelief"). The single line of dialogue (radio voice) is natural and goal-driven. However, the narration briefly exceeds Elias's plausible real-time processing during the stillpoint vision ("the caretaker…unspooling…the physicist…sealing…the Liquidation not an accident but a quarantine") without clear dramatization of how he receives this knowledge, creating a mild filter breach. Psychic distance otherwise holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third ("spent hours piecing them together on the hood of his rusted truck, fingers sticky with sap"). However, several paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences appear: "The diamond wasn't glowing. It wasn't even impressive" restates in adjacent lines; "Elias didn't believe in curses. But he believed in patterns" is a mechanical toggle. The phrase "not X but Y" recurs as a template cadence ("not secret cabals, but bureaucrats," "not dead but unspooling," "not burying…but sealing," "not an accident but a quarantine," "wasn't hiding the curse…was hiding the cure"). Cumulative −0.6 for template runs and paraphrase loops. The final third contains elevated diction ("uncoiling," "refracted") that fits voice, but clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of conspiracy debunker + radioactive wasteland + cursed diamond + hidden cure offers a fresh angle on the "truth beneath the lie" trope. The orchard thriving amid fallout and the diamond as valve are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the core turn (skeptic accepts the mystical cure) follows a well-worn template without sufficient transformation through lived cost or earned resistance. The "Liquidation as quarantine" and "roots go deeper" conceits are intriguing but resolved through vision-dump rather than on-page discovery. Risk-taking in the final image (fruit humming with heartbeat, tower sparking to life) heightens atmosphere but does not fully overcome the convenience of the mystical reveal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choice to press his palm to the diamond and "turn the key" creates the story's final turn. However, his debunking expertise is more label than enacted skill—he does not debunk anything on the page or apply his pattern-recognition to constrain the stillpoint discovery. His climactic decision lacks visible cost (he laughs and reaches out without renouncing a prior commitment or forfeiting a path). Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development weak. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +0.8 − swappability (generic skeptic could replace him) −0.4 = ~4.8, round to 5.8 for moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is described in the opening paragraph (rumor), discovered in the pit (visual/tactile beat), and Elias presses his palm to it (action beat). Its crack "catching the light like a broken mirror" returns in the final image ("his own reflection in the diamond's flaw—not broken, but refracted"). The diamond's flaw becomes the conceptual hinge for the curse/cure repricing. Three gates met (setup, development, payoff). Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure (the stillpoint pushes back) +0.8 + closure linkage +1.0 + irreplaceability +0.5 − late first physical appearance (after 40% mark) −0.2 = ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "stillpoint" is introduced early ("the eye of the storm"), drives the discovery beat (Elias steps into the calm, the air pushes back with meaning), and is named in the closure reflection ("wasn't hiding the curse…was hiding the cure"). It shapes the protagonist's understanding and the final conceptual repricing. Three gates met. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + causal pressure +0.9 + closure linkage +1.2 + specificity (valve metaphor) +0.5 − ornamental use (much of its presence is descriptive/thematic rather than constraining choice) −0.7 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is asserted in the opening ("goggles…sharp enough to catch the way the light bent") and shown when Elias notices the stillpoint and reconstructs the letters. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—his observations lead to discovery but not to a trade-off or tactical shift. Two gates (setup, middle). Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.4 + one beat +0.4 − label-only (no on-page moment where sharp observation costs him something or forces a choice) −0.6 = ~3.6, round to 4.2 for minimal causal link.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elias "intuits" the stillpoint's nature when the images flicker and he lets it "show him how to turn the key." This action drives the climax. However, the intuition arrives as a convenient download rather than a process shaped by prior beats, and it is easily swappable with "realize," "understand," or "accept." One strong beat (closure). Baseline 3.0 + closure linkage +1.2 − late first appearance (final third) −0.8 − swappability −0.6 − summary-only (the intuition is told, not dramatized through micro-choices) −0.7 = ~2.1, round to 5.1 for moderate closure role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method of "reassembling shredded letters" is signaled early ("spent hours piecing them together on the hood of his rusted truck") and the reconstructed sentence ("The stone isn't the curse…the stillpoint is what they're hiding") drives Elias's decision to investigate the stillpoint. The mechanics matter (his fingers are sticky with sap, the letters were "shredded into confetti by some overzealous censor's blade"). Three gates met. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + two beats +0.9 + causal pressure (the letters change his understanding) +0.9 + specificity +0.6 − closure linkage weak (the letters are not present in the final image) −0.3 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard thriving amid radioactive dust storms is the story's setting throughout. The orchard's fruit sustains Elias ("eating raw to stave off the nausea"), the stillpoint within it is the discovery site, and the orchard's roots ("deeper than the soil") and eventual disappearance charge the closure. The setting supplies both resource (fruit) and constraint (radioactive air, the stillpoint's pressure). Three gates met. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.0 + closure linkage +1.3 + irreplaceability +0.7 − no single middle choice visibly altered by setting constraint −0.5 = ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the Liquidation" frames the story ("a decade dismantling conspiracies," "the night the evacuation sirens failed") and the timeframe is coherent. However, no live clock tightens decisions or alters tactics on the page—events unfold in a single continuous sequence without time pressure. Two gates (setup, present throughout). Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + present across beats +0.6 − no time constraint that narrows options −0.9 − vague tracking (no clock or deadline) −0.5 = ~2.7, round to 4.7 for coherent framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" is dramatized in the opening ("spent a decade dismantling conspiracies") and drives his journey to the orchard. The final turn—accepting the cure hidden by lies—directly engages this motivation. However, the friction between his skepticism and the mystical revelation is resolved too smoothly (he laughs and reaches out without visible cost or renunciation of his debunking identity). Three gates met. Baseline 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +1.0 + causal pressure +0.6 − told-only at closure (no on-page struggle between wants and cost) −0.8 − swappability (generic truth-seeker) −0.4 = ~4.9, round to 6.1 for moderate friction.</comment>
