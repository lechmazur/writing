<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tide dancer's interiority is present but remains abstract throughout—"penance for reading the tides too well" and the exile are told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to inscribe the verse is signaled early but lacks visible cost or foreclosed options; the character moves smoothly toward her goal without friction. Embodied emotion is sparse; the text favors lyric register over specific physical sensation under pressure. The ending gesture ("she let it come") reads passive rather than as a micro-choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are delayed: who, where, and when cohere only after multiple paragraphs of lyric description, though the piece teaches its accumulative pattern early enough to avoid the full Orientation Test penalty. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pressure accrues through image density and cadence rather than causal linkage. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—the verse completed, the body transformed—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legible in a specific forfeited option or consequence. The piece signals its lyric mode early and sustains it, yet the final image reweights prior material more through tone than through a felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden, blackened pond, and waterlilies supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through the POV's ceremonial focus. The moonstone dust and pond reflection function as micro-setting that constrains the verse-inscribing action. The garden's sensory details—crushed nightshade, petals unraveling—modulate with the ritual's progression and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves; the heron's disappearance and the pond's reflection both serve the method and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to inscribe a cosmic verse and "fledge"—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through image density and ritual progression rather than through reversals or narrowing options. No on-page tightening forces a trade-off; the protagonist moves toward her goal without impediment or visible price paid in the moment. The ending crystallizes her transformation but does not foreclose a live alternative or show a cost that alters tactics. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece deepens atmosphere but lacks a meaningful escalation that narrows choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—transformation, exile, and reclaiming agency through art—emerges organically from the verse-inscribing ritual and the protagonist's severance from the sea. The final image reweights prior material, positioning the ink as "home" and exile as "a door left ajar," but the thematic answer remains slightly abstract rather than grounded in a specific on-page cost. No overt moralizing; subtext operates through the verse fragment and the garden's sensory progression. The piece invites reflection yet edges toward symbolic convenience with the heron's vanishing and the convenient alignment of stars and verse.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric texture: "blade unsheathed," "obsidian grace," "the cold weight of something finally true." Psychic distance remains controlled; the narrator's perceptual signature is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, matching the ritual's gravity without unmotivated register drift. No dialogue on the page. Free indirect style is clean; the piece sustains its ceremonial cadence under pressure without flattening into summary. A few filter verbs ("she had always known," "she would call") are voice-consistent and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm and sentence variety support the ceremonial tone; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Minor overwriting in the opening ("like a blade unsheathed," "where the last light bled into shadow") and a few near-paraphrases ("the pause between breaths, the hollow where the wind failed, the space a heartbeat left behind") slow momentum without obscuring causality. The verse fragment ("I was the shore before the wave decided to return") and the final parenthetical aside ("They would call it heresy, later") add texture but edge toward decorative. No severe loops or template cadence; clarity is maintained. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty while others linger in atmosphere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of exile, body-as-canvas, and celestial verse offers a fresh angle on transformation narratives. Specific details—moonstone cabochon dust, the nostalgia ban, the heron's disappearance—ground the fantasy premise in concrete particulars. However, the emotional arc and ritual progression follow a familiar outline: preparation, invocation, transformation, affirmation. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode and the stakes feel coherent, yet the ending's inevitability reduces tension. The "obsidian grace" tone and the verse's metaphysical stakes read slightly generic within the fantasy-poetic tradition. No derivative template, but the transformation feels more expected than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tide dancer is present throughout and her skill shapes the ritual's method (observing gaps, reading tides). She makes the decision to inscribe the verse and completes it, but the choice does not pivot tactics or foreclose a live option; the arc is linear. Two beats: preparation and completion. Present in setup and closure; missing a middle complication where her skill must adjust under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moonstone dust appears early, is handled in the inscription beat, and returns in the final image as the ink shimmers. Three touches across setup, middle, and closure. It constrains the method—"spontaneously anchored"—and charges the verse's permanence. However, its properties do not narrow options or create a visible cost; it enables smoothly rather than forcing a trade-off. Strong presence but mid-integration due to lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elective exile is stated early ("exiled by choice") and contextualizes the protagonist's severance from the sea. It shapes her motivation and the stakes of the verse as a new belonging. Present in setup and thematically reprised at closure ("exile was just another word for a door left ajar"). However, the concept does not constrain a middle choice or force a visible cost on the page; it remains atmospheric. Two gates (setup, closure); functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Spontaneously anchored is introduced early with the dust "refusing to scatter" and returns in the inscription beat where the dust "bit deep" and the verse becomes permanent. Two beats; present in setup and middle. The trait enables the ritual but does not create a tradeoff or constrain an alternative; it functions as magic-system consistency rather than as a pressure point. Functional but replaceable; any binding mechanism could serve.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fledging is the central goal signaled early and completed at closure. The protagonist "would fledge" in the opening third, and the final paragraph confirms "she had fledged at last." The action defines the arc and the verse-inscribing beats are its dramatization. Three beats: anticipation, ritual execution, and affirmation. The term is specific and irreplaceable; the story would lose coherence without it. Strong causal role and closure linkage; the cost is conceptual (transformation) rather than forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Observing gaps is introduced early ("the method demanded silence, demanded gaps") and demonstrated in the heron beat and the pond-reflection beat. The method shapes the ritual's mechanics and is reprised at closure ("becoming the gap itself"). Three beats: setup, two demonstrations, and thematic closure. The method is specific to the protagonist's skill and differentiates this ritual from generic magic. Causal role is present but the method does not force a cost or narrow options; it enables smoothly. Two-and-a-half gates; lyric reprise lifts it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The twilight garden under stars is anchored early, supplies the pond and waterlilies as tools, and the stars "lean closer" at closure. Three beats: setup, resource (pond reflection), and closure charge. The setting shapes the ritual's sensory texture and the verse's cosmic scope. Spatial details are consistent and the garden's atmosphere modulates with the ritual. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or create a cost; it functions as backdrop and mood rather than as pressure. Solid presence; mid-integration due to lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban is mentioned once in backstory ("when the nostalgia ban still held the coast in its grip") and the word "after" in the final third ("beyond the ban"). Two touches; both are told rather than dramatized. The timeframe does not tighten tactics or create urgency; the ritual proceeds without temporal pressure. The ban contextualizes the world but does not alter the protagonist's choices on the page. Missing middle development and closure participation; late second mention does not count as payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation to pen a cosmic verse is signaled early ("Tonight, she would fledge. Not with wings, but with ink") and sustained through the ritual beats. The verse fragment is inscribed mid-story and the closure affirms the body as canvas and the verse as ongoing ("The first line of the next verse was already forming"). Three beats: setup, execution, and affirmation. The desire drives all on-page action and the final image recharges it. Friction is light—no competing want or fear—but the motivation is specific and indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Obsidian grace appears in the verse fragment ("a sigil of obsidian grace") and the tone—ceremonial, precise, weighted—is sustained throughout with controlled diction and cadence. The tone modulates slightly from anticipation to completion but remains within a narrow ceremonial register. It charges the final image ("the ink shimmered, alive") and coheres with the stakes. However, the tone is somewhat static; no sharp contrast or pressure-driven shift. Present in setup, middle, and closure; functional and coherent but not indispensable to the arc.</comment>
