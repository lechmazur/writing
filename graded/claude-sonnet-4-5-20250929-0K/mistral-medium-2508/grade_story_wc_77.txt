<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lysander's motivation is clear (confront the cursed doppelgänger), but interiority relies heavily on stock Gothic phrasing ("the rust of old secrets," "resuscitation's cruel spark") rather than character-particular thought. The final choice—lunging through the thing to pull out the filmstrip—reads as physically embodied, yet the stakes remain abstract; we never see what living with the curse actually costs him in daily terms. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("I'm not here to fight" as a lie) but not deeply inhabited. The whispering advisor appears only in reported speech, diluting her pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (the funhouse accumulates imagery—mirrors, filmstrip, luminance—that reweights at closure). Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final wink and the cloak-only photo reframe Lysander's relationship to fear and his cursed state. Cost is present but oblique: he now "carries the repulsive allure" and the game "remembered how to play," implying an ongoing burden. The orientation is clear (abandoned funhouse, post-resuscitation). One meaningful deepening occurs when he pulls the filmstrip and the funhouse "exhales." The Orientation Test is satisfied early. No causality breaks, but the closure's conceptual cost could be sharper—pointing to a visible trade-off on the page would lift this.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The funhouse setting is vivid and specific: breathing mirrors, peeling wallpaper, burnt sugar and copper scent, the tilted tea table with dream dictionary. Spatial choreography is clear (ticket booth → mirror → spiral hallways → center). The opera cloak clasp is handled twice (adjusted at the start, clicked shut around the ember at the end), constraining the final image. The setting pressures choice: the oil-like mirror yields, the spiral of cursed photographs forces confrontation. The final puddle reflection charges the exit. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Gothic idiom. The micro-setting (clasp, mirror, filmstrip) functions as constraint and closure charge, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: confront the doppelgänger to end the photographic curse. One meaningful tightening: Lysander lunges through the thing and pulls the filmstrip, which causes the funhouse to shudder and the thing to dissolve. Agency is present (the lunge, the choice to let the filmstrip burn). Cost is legible but muted: the clasp "now held a new kind of hunger," implying an ongoing burden, and the final "Next" suggests unfinished business. The escalation is clear under the Accumulative lens (mirrors weep, the funhouse exhales, the reflection winks), but the price is more conceptual than visceral. The advisor's voice and the final lipstick "Next" imply Lysander has entered a cycle rather than escaped, which reweights but doesn't fully dramatize the trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: fear as the bed itself, not the monster; the trick of letting fear believe it has won; the filmstrip as stolen life-moments. The final image (cloak with gleaming clasp, "Next" in lipstick) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Lysander has learned to play the game, but the game owns him now. The advisor's line "Fear isn't the dark. It's the hand that thinks it's holding the flashlight" is evocative but borders on stated thesis. The wink and the carried "repulsive allure" resist moralizing, yet the conceptual cost remains oblique—what exactly has he sacrificed by winning? The filmstrip as motif (life stolen, burned, reweighted) does accumulate pressure and charge the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lysander. Voice is consistent Gothic-ornate ("lingering luminance," "razor dragged across glass"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-rooted ("unbosom," "photograpically cursed," "repulsive allure"). The advisor's dialogue ("You're bleeding into the negative") and the thing's speech ("Why are you armed with a whisper?") carry subtext and feel distinct from narration. Perceptual signature is present (Lysander notices mirrors, filmstrips, the clasp), but filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "watched") cluster in the middle beats without voice-motivated purpose. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance is controlled. The ornate diction serves atmosphere but occasionally stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: "lingering luminance of a thousand laughter-turned-screams," "the peeling wallpaper," "a fistful of blackened filmstrip, the negative of his own heartbeat." Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence, creating density without always advancing pressure. Stock metaphors recur: "dawn broke like a bruise," "the air smelled of burnt sugar and copper pennies." Template cadence: "The funhouse shuddered. / The advisor's voice slithered... / The mirrors began to weep." Paraphrase loop: "letting the filmstrip unspool" is restated as "watching as the frames burned." The Loop/Scaffold Screen flags synonym churn ("resuscitation" appears four times with slight variation). Information density is high, but momentum drags under ornament. The final paragraph loops ("Lysander adjusted the clasp. / The game wasn't over. / It had only just remembered how to play") without adding new knowledge. Apply −1.2 for density/coherence overwriting and template cadence in Q7; artifacts touch but do not obscure closure, so no higher escalation. Disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core premise—photographically cursed man confronts doppelgänger in funhouse via filmstrip retrieval—synthesizes Gothic tropes (cursed reflection, abandoned carnival, resuscitation) with the twist of pulling out the filmstrip as a literal act. The advisor, dream dictionary, and "trick fear" motive add specificity. The final wink and "Next" offer a non-obvious turn: Lysander hasn't escaped but entered a cycle. However, the Gothic ornament feels stock (mirrors, ravens, opera cloaks, burnt sugar) and the emotional arc (man confronts dark self, wins but at cost) is familiar. The transformation is present but incremental. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications, avoiding safety-middle hedging. Risk-taking is moderate; the ornate voice heightens atmosphere but doesn't radically subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The whispering advisor appears in two beats: funeral instruction (reported speech) and the wall-voice post-lunge. She provides setup (the mission) and thematic commentary ("Fear isn't the dark..."), but makes no on-page choice that alters Lysander's tactics. Her instruction is fulfilled off-page. Functional but replaceable; a letter or inner voice could substitute. Missing development and closure participation as an active agent. Cap 3.4 per missing middle development. Late use (wall-voice) and summary-only reduce further to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The opera cloak clasp (raven's beak) appears in three beats: adjusted at entry, loosened before the lunge, clicked shut around the ember at closure. It constrains the final image (gleaming beak full of stolen stars) and carries symbolic charge (hunger, containment). Early signal, middle use (loosened as preparation), closure linkage (holds the ember, reweights the clasp as container of new power). Causal pressure is moderate; the clasp enables the containment but doesn't drive the lunge itself. Specificity is high (tarnished, hinge stiff, raven's beak). Cost is implied (new hunger). Eligible for ≥6.1 with all three gates; strong closure linkage and specificity lift to 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lingering luminance appears as descriptor (carnival screams, filmstrip frames burning) and thematic echo (the advisor's line about darkness, the clasp gleaming with stolen stars). It shapes atmosphere and the final image's charge but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics. The filmstrip's luminance is central to the retrieval beat, but "lingering" as a quality is ornamental. Setup is early (first paragraph), payoff is present (gleaming clasp), but middle development lacks causal force. Cap 4.6 per missing setup constraint (it appears but doesn't shape a middle choice). Lyric reprise and closure linkage raise slightly to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Photographically cursed: established early (snapshots show light-smear), recurs in the spiral hallway (cursed likenesses), and is reweighted at closure (photos will still curse him, but his reflection doesn't flinch). It frames the stake and the advisor's mission. Cost is visible (can't be photographed normally, social/identity loss implied). However, the curse doesn't constrain a tactical choice mid-scene—Lysander's lunge and filmstrip retrieval would proceed identically without the photo curse. The curse is a premise more than a lever. Early signal, thematic payoff, but weak middle development. All three gates minimally present; causal pressure is low. Score 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unbosom: the advisor instructs "Unbosom the thing that wears your face." Lysander fulfills this by lunging through the thing and pulling the filmstrip from its chest, which causes dissolution. The action is the climactic turn and drives closure. Early signal (advisor's instruction), middle setup (the lunge), closure consequence (thing dissolves, funhouse exhales). Causal pressure is strong. However, "unbosom" as a verb is slightly ornamental—"confront" or "expose" would work similarly. Specificity is moderate. Cost is tied (filmstrip extraction leads to new hunger in clasp). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; score 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Paradoxical notes in a dream dictionary: the dictionary appears on the tilted tea table mid-scene. Lysander reads one circled passage ("Fear is a lockpick; shame is the door it opens" and "To trick fear, you must let it believe it's already won"). This frames his tactic (lunging through rather than fighting) but is not mechanically essential—he could reach the same insight through the advisor's earlier instruction or his own reasoning. The dictionary provides thematic setup but does not shape multiple beats. Setup present, weak development, no closure linkage. Cap 3.8 per swappability and single-beat use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned carnival funhouse: the setting is the scene. It supplies the breathing mirrors (entry portal), the spiral hallways (confrontation path), the central chamber (showdown site), and the shuddering/exhaling structure (consequence). The funhouse's geometry and yielding mirror enable Lysander's approach; its dissolution signals victory. The setting pressures every choice and provides the charged final image (ruins glistening, puddle reflection). Early anchor, continuous involvement, closure charge (exhale, exit into dawn). Spatial choreography is coherent. The funhouse is indispensable to story logic. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, and cost. Score 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>After the resuscitation: timeframe is signaled early (doctors called it a miracle, photos since that night) and recurs (the filmstrip shows "his last breath, the resuscitation's cruel spark"). It frames Lysander's cursed state and motivates the confrontation. However, "after" is static—no countdown or tightening window pressures tactics. The resuscitation is backstory, not a live clock. Setup is clear, thematic payoff at closure (filmstrip frames), but no middle tactic alteration. Missing development gate. Cap 4.6; lyric reprise and cost connection raise to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>To trick fear into revealing its weakness: Lysander's goal is stated by the advisor ("trick fear") and demonstrated in the lunge ("I let you trick yourself"). The tactic (lunging through rather than fighting) enacts the motive. The dream dictionary passage reinforces it. Desire is dramatized in the peak beat and pays off at closure. Internal friction is minimal—Lysander pursues the goal without visible competing wants. Early signal, middle choice (the lunge), closure payoff (fear tricked, but game continues). Causal pressure and cost are present (new hunger, ongoing cycle). Strong involvement and closure linkage; limited internal conflict keeps it from higher band. Score 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Repulsive allure: the phrase appears explicitly at closure ("carrying the repulsive allure of a man who'd learned..."). Tone throughout balances Gothic beauty (mirrors breathing, silver weeping, luminance) with grotesque detail (wet paper chest, blackened filmstrip, burnt sugar/copper scent). The final wink and gleaming clasp embody allure; the new hunger and "Next" embody repulsion. Tone modulates with pressure (ornate at entry, compressed at lunge, charged at exit) and charges the final image. Setup is present throughout, closure linkage is strong, but the explicit label at the end risks stating rather than embodying. Coherent modulation and closure charge; label-only final mention is a friction. Score 6.2.</comment>
