<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is richly textured through her perceptual lens—measuring "quiet spaces between what was recorded and what was remembered"—and her methodology is character-particular. However, motivation remains primarily told rather than tested: her desire to understand the henge never faces a concrete on-page obstacle or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The final choice to "listen" rather than step through reads more as contemplative stance than dramatic agency that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction and embodied struggle under pressure are absent; she moves through discovery without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through overlapping film reels, shifting shadows, and the map's tear, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara's palm on the pillar and the projector's shutdown crystallize her understanding that silence is a language. Cost is felt conceptually—she returns with "no proof, only quiet certainty"—and the henge's hum "still thrumming in her ribs" charges the final image. Orientation anchors (vault, henge, Elara) land early. One deduction: the "whispered chapel" as moment rather than place arrives late and feels asserted rather than earned through prior causality, slightly softening the closure's inevitability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault, henge stones, and brass-framed lenses supply vivid, purpose-driven detail that constrains Elara's method and charges the final image. Sensory selection—"drips from the ceiling," "breath fogging the glass plates," "vault's silence"—reflects her professional attention and urgency. The projector, parchment, and pillar function as micro-setting that shapes her discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The vault's physicality directly enables the closure moment when she presses her palm to the stone and the frescoes shiver.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake—interpreting the uncharted lands via the henge's silence—is signaled early and tightens when Elara overlays the films and discovers the temporal threshold. The flicker "above" the henge and the realization that "the map wasn't a boundary" constitute a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page obstacle opposes her; discovery unfolds without resistance, friction, or visible price paid in the vault. Agency at closure is renunciation ("She didn't step through. Not yet") but the cost of waiting versus crossing is conceptual rather than felt as a lived trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—measuring the unmeasurable, silence as conversation—emerges organically from Elara's method and the henge's properties without overt statement. The map's tear as "invitation" and the final image of rain "scouring the stones clean" offer resonant, non-literal closure that reweights the premise. Subtext operates in the films' discrepancies and the "whispers in the silence between seasons." One slip: "the unknown wasn't a void. It was a conversation" teeters on the edge of thematic echo, though it avoids prompt language and stays grounded in her embodied realization at the pillar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "the kind [of silence] that hummed in the gaps between drips," "tools of a map framer who measured the world...in quiet spaces." Diction—"methodically curious," "not mistakes but choices"—fits Elara's professional idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening when she leans into the projection and exhaling when she steps into rain. One minor slip: "the shape of it—the echo of a door swinging open on hinges no one had oiled in centuries" momentarily drifts into elevated metaphor that strains against the practical framing established earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high ("Not the absence of sound, but the kind that hummed..."). However, several passages loop conceptually: "silence wasn't empty. It was waiting" / "silence wasn't an absence, but a presence" recycle the same idea. Template cadence in the final third: "It felt like a key. / Elara turned off... / Outside, the rain began..." repeats short declarative + noun structure across three beats without purposeful pattern-teaching. Filter-verb density ("feeling the vibrations," "pressed her palm") in the climax slightly dulls immediacy. Overwriting is mild but present: stacked metaphors ("embers in a dying fire" + "door swinging open on hinges") without clear vehicle coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, temporal thresholds via film comparison, and the henge as time-marker rather than space-marker offers a fresh angle. The "map tears at the threshold of when" is a non-obvious insight that feels earned in hindsight. However, the broader frame—lone scholar discovers hidden truth in ancient relic via patient methodology—follows a familiar template. Transformation is present but incomplete: the story's emotional and conceptual arc would survive with different names (archaeologist, sundial, acoustic recordings) without fundamental restructure. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation and quiet closure elevates slightly within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's perceptiveness drives the method (overlaying films, noticing shadow discrepancies) and the key turn (realizing the tear marks "when" not "where"). Her decision to listen rather than step through shapes the ending image. However, her choices unfold without on-page friction; observation dominates, and the final "listen first" is contemplative rather than a high-stakes decision that alters tactics under pressure. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is thin. Causal role in one major beat plus closure participation lands mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The henge is present in setup (description of its sound-curve properties), middle (filming it, overlaying footage), and payoff (palm on pillar, stones humming, frescoes shivering). It shifts from relic to temporal marker, reweighting prior material. Its specific properties (sound curvature, shadow behavior) enable Elara's discovery. Three gates met; two distinct beats; closure linkage strong. Minor friction: its mechanics are told more than dramatized in action. Scores high but lacks the irreplaceability push for top band—another temporal device could substitute with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Whispered chapel" is introduced early as reputation/myth, returns in Elara's realization ("The whispered chapel wasn't a place. It was a moment"), and charges the ending ("the whispered chapel...in the marrow of her bones"). The concept reweights the map's tear and shapes her final stance. Two gates clear (setup, payoff); middle development is conceptual rather than tactical. Lyric reprise elevates into low-6 band, but the concept does not constrain a mid-scene choice with visible cost, limiting higher range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" appears in one line ("her method was simple, methodically curious") and fits her behavior (slow projection, frame-by-frame comparison). However, it remains label-only; no on-page moment shows the trait constraining a choice or costing her an alternative path. The attribute could be swapped for "patient" or "meticulous" without structural change. Present and logically consistent, but ornamental. One gate (setup mention); no middle or closure participation as a distinct trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reopen" structures the entire action: Elara reopens the chapel's silence by overlaying films, which reopens her understanding of the map's tear and the temporal threshold. The verb recurs with shifted meaning at closure when "the tear...stitched itself closed in her mind's eye" yet the vault "exhaled" open. Three gates met; the action drives two beats (film overlay, final realization) and charges the ending. Strong causal role. Minor cap: the mechanics lean conceptual; a near-synonym like "unlock" or "decode" could substitute with modest reframing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is signaled early (two reels, monk 1923 vs. surveyor 1989), executed in the middle (shadow pooling vs. climbing, the flicker), and delivers the key insight (seasonal timing → temporal threshold). The method's mechanics matter: no audio forces reliance on light/shadow; decades-apart timing reveals the pattern. Three gates met; two distinct beats; causal pressure high. Her third reel filmed "that morning" and pointed "at the tear in the map" completes the method and enables closure. Irreplaceability strong—no other method fits the henge's temporal properties as precisely.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault supplies the henge, the projector setup, and sensory anchors (drips, stone smell, glass plates fogging) that ground every beat. The vault's silence and the frescoes' shivering directly enable and dramatize the closure moment. Three gates met; the setting constrains method (she needs the vault's darkness and the henge's position) and charges the final image (rain resumes as she exits). Spatial particulars—projector, pillar, satchel—alter tactics. High integration; just shy of indispensable because the core discovery could occur in another enclosed relic site.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The "spot where a map tears" is the conceptual hinge but functions as a spatial/conceptual metaphor rather than a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The equinox/seasonal timing matters to the henge's operation, but Elara is not racing a clock or constrained by a closing window on the page. Time is vague; "that morning" anchors her third reel but no urgency or countdown alters her tactics. Two gates weakly met (map tear mentioned early and at closure); no middle pressure. Functional but replaceable as a timeframe; it operates more as theme than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interpret silence with empathy" is enacted throughout: Elara listens to the henge's hum, refuses to step through until she listens, and understands silence as "a language." The motivation shapes her method and final stance. However, it is never dramatized in friction—no moment where empathy costs her speed, certainty, or safety, nor a temptation to force an answer instead of waiting. Two gates met (implicit in setup method, explicit at closure); middle beat is method-execution without conflict. Desire is shown but not tested under pressure. Lands mid-band on lyric coherence and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is embodied in the vault's enclosed safety (shielded) and Elara's receptive listening (openness), and recurs explicitly in the final line: "shielded, open, and finally, understood." Tone modulates with pressure—quiet patience in the projection, held breath at the flicker, exhale at closure. The oxymoron charges the ending image and integrates across beats. Three gates met; coherence strong. One friction: the explicit label in the final paragraph edges toward thematic statement rather than pure tonal effect, slightly reducing subtlety. Still, the tone demonstrably shapes the narrative texture and final resonance.</comment>
