<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and character-particular (mathematician's lens on recursion, proof-speak in crisis). Internal conflict operates live when she reaches the door: the trembling fingers and "could step through" beat show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice—pressing the door, turning back—is earned by prior causality (the chipped die as deliberate flaw, her proof about closed systems), and the cost is visible: she leaves the smooth die behind and accepts perpetual motion as choice rather than trap. Minor deduction: "grim optimist" and "balancedly daring" read as labels without sufficient embodied pressure testing those traits in micro-choices before the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through pattern (staircase loop, dice, proof fragments) and accumulates density until the rupture moment when the chipped die stutters and reveals the flaw in the loop. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend): Lena presses the door, chooses the climb, accepts perpetual motion as choice rather than failure—cost is legible in leaving the smooth die and the café opportunity. Orientation anchors (Lena, staircase, gray haze) land within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening: the shift from "infinite" to "recursive with a flaw" reweights her understanding and tactics. Lens holds cleanly; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The staircase as micro-setting charges the final image: the steps "reassemble beneath her feet" after she turns back, making the environment a responsive partner to her choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (stone thud, dice clatter, gray haze, burnt coffee scent at the threshold). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (upward spiral, twenty paces above, sideways leap, door ajar). The chipped die functions as setting-scale object, constraining her choice when it stutters and reveals the loop's flaw. Minor gap: the café behind the door receives scent and sound but no visual anchor, slightly undercutting the threshold moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to understand the staircase/missed opportunity, later reweighted to choosing the climb itself. One meaningful tightening: the chipped die's stutter narrows her options from abstract proof to concrete sideways leap, forcing the door to appear. Agency is clear: she hurls the dice, runs sideways, presses the door, turns back—each decision forecloses a path. Cost is visible: leaving the smooth die, abandoning the café threshold, accepting perpetual motion as her stance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the dice experiment and the rupture discovery. No coincidence resolves; the door appears because she acts on her proof.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the chipped die as deliberate flaw, the rupture as texture rather than system failure, perpetual motion reweighted from prison to choice. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—pressing the door without stepping through, choosing the climb because she wants to—without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the gesture (trembling fingers, palm warming the wood) and the final line's shift from understanding to desire. The piece invites reflection on missed opportunities as formative rather than reclaimable. Minor deduction: "Some opportunities were only opportunities because they slipped away" flirts with thematic summary, though it remains image-anchored and stops short of sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with free indirect touches ("perpetual motion wasn't a failure. It was a choice") that stay voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is consistent: mathematician's lens (recursion, closed systems, proofs), physical anchors (dice in palm, uneven edge biting skin). Diction matches the focalizer's lexicon (theorem, infinite recursion, elegant but useless) without register drift. No head-hopping. The proof whispered aloud and the final shift from "understand the system" to "wanted to" track internal pressure cleanly. Minor deduction: "The pain was a anchor" (missing article) and a few filter-verb clusters ("she had been climbing," "she'd realized") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is strong; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Rhythm varies naturally (short beats at the rupture: "She ran." "The world tilted."). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Clarity is consistent. Minor deductions: "The rupture wasn't in the math. It was in the texture." reads as template-cadence parallelism without added pressure. Filter-verb stack in the opening third ("had been climbing," "had been," "had once tried," "had come") slightly flattens immediacy. "A anchor" is a typo. The "not upward, but sideways" and "not the theorem, but the moment" constructions repeat the same syntactic pattern within close proximity, creating mild mechanical echo.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of infinite staircase + mathematical proof + chipped die as deliberate flaw feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of perpetual motion from futility to choice is earned through the recursive/rupture distinction. Emotional truth (trembling at the threshold, pressing the door without entering) avoids generic templates. The sideways leap and the chipped die's stutter are fresh inflections that grow from prior particulars. Risk-taking (abstract mathematician navigating metaphysical space through proof logic) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Minor deduction: the "grim optimist" and "balancedly daring" labels feel like prompt artifacts rather than emergent characterization, and the café threshold moment (voice saying "You walked out before the discussion even started") verges on convenience plotting—the exact past moment materializes a bit too neatly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's choices drive key turns: hurling the dice, running sideways when the chipped die stutters, pressing the door, turning back to the stairs. Her final decision—accepting the climb as choice rather than solving the system—alters the story's meaning and forecloses the café opportunity with visible cost (leaving the smooth die). Early signal present (mathematician who "leapt but always landed"). Causal pressure: her proof about closed systems enables the sideways leap. Closure linkage strong. Minor friction: "grim optimist" is more label than dramatized trait shaping a beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dice appear in ≥3 beats: opening (rolling in her palm), the throw (smooth vanishes, chipped stutters and reveals the loop flaw), the ending (chipped in her pocket, smooth left on threshold). The chipped edge constrains her choice—its stutter triggers the rupture discovery and the sideways leap. Reweighted meaning: from proof token to deliberate flaw she chooses to carry. Causal pressure high; closure linkage direct. Specificity: the chip matters (it caught on something, it stutters). Cost tied to leaving the smooth die behind. Strong integration across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perpetual motion shapes stakes and tactics throughout: frames the climb ("perpetual ascent without progress"), her whispered proof ("Perpetual motion isn't movement. It's the illusion of choice within a closed system"), and the ending reweighting ("Perpetual motion wasn't a failure. It was a choice"). The concept alters her options—realizing the staircase is recursive with a flaw enables the sideways leap. Closure linkage strong: her final stance embraces perpetual motion as chosen rather than imposed. Not merely thematic echo; it changes her understanding and forecloses the café path. Early signal, middle development, payoff present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring" appears once as Dr. Veyra's label ("a mathematician who leapt but always landed on solid ground") and is echoed in Lena stepping onto the staircase "without hesitation." The sideways leap could illustrate daring with balance (calculated risk based on proof), but the trait is not foregrounded or shown constraining a choice with visible cost. Swappable: the same beats would work if she were called "methodical" or "intuitive." Functional but replaceable; no beat turns on this exact attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rupture" anchors two key moments: the original rupture ("Before she'd realized the equations weren't just abstract; they were a map") that caused the staircase to appear, and the discovery that "The rupture wasn't in the math. It was in the texture." The second use drives the turn—she shifts from infinite to recursive, enabling the sideways leap. Causal pressure present; closure linkage indirect (the rupture insight enables the door to appear). Setup in backstory, development in the texture realization, payoff in the leap. Could be more indispensable; "break" or "flaw" would function similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs signal early (theorem on infinite recursion, equations scrawled on walls) and return at the rupture beat: she whispers her proof aloud, and it guides her realization that the staircase is recursive with a flaw. The proof enables the sideways leap tactic. Closure linkage moderate: the final choice is framed as accepting the system rather than solving it via proof. Two-gate presence (setup, development); payoff is oblique—she stops proving and starts choosing. Functional but not fully weight-bearing; the method shapes one major beat but doesn't drive the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The infinite staircase pressures every choice: it frames the climb, supplies the steps as testing ground (the creak revealing a seam, the step where the chipped die strikes), and reassembles beneath her feet in the ending image, literalizing her acceptance of perpetual motion. Spatial choreography is clear and constrains action (upward spiral, twenty paces, sideways leap). The setting is not backdrop; it is the puzzle she solves and the system she chooses to inhabit. Strong setup, development (the creaking step, the die's landing point), and payoff (steps reassembling). Indispensable: remove the staircase and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture the texture of a missed opportunity—not to reclaim it, but to hold its weight" is signaled early and tested at the café door threshold: she could rewrite the moment or press the door without entering. The final choice—turning back with the chipped die—dramatizes the shift from capturing to accepting the texture. Friction present: trembling fingers show want vs. cost. Closure linkage direct; the ending line ("she wasn't climbing to understand the system. She was climbing because she wanted to") reweights the initial motivation. Cost visible (forfeiting the café, leaving the smooth die). Strong integration across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone "boundless confinement" coheres across beats: the staircase is infinite yet a loop, the gray haze refuses resolution, Lena's breath is steady despite no fatigue. Modulates with pressure: the laugh when she discovers the flaw is "sharp and breathless," the door moment is quiet and tense, the ending shifts to "lighter now" without breaking the paradox. Charges the final image: "The staircase welcomed her, its steps reassembling beneath her feet"—boundless (perpetual) and confining (chosen system). Setup, development, payoff all present. Tone is not static; it reweights from trap to embrace. Strong integration.</comment>
