<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and her final decision to hurl the fragment and then design edges carries agency with visible cost. However, interiority leans heavily on elevated poetic register ("texture," "seam," "when") that abstracts emotional stakes rather than grounding them in embodied contradiction. The woman's warning and dissolution provide pressure, but Liora's internal conflict remains largely declarative rather than dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final laugh and understanding feel asserted more than earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Liora's realization that "texture wasn't something to discover but to survive" reweights the premise, and her shift to designing edges forecloses the path of solving centers. Cost is legible in her physical collapse and the act of destroying the fragment. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the photographs begin fading and the garden shudders, escalating to the spiral staircase and temporal trap before the climactic throw and reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden, blackthorn hedge, and hyperbolic geometry constrain Liora's navigation and charge the closure image when she steps "beside" the maze to design edges. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—ozone, crushed lavender, vines pulsing like veins—and filtered through Liora's professional lens as maze designer. Spatial choreography remains clear through the climb and final bridge scene. However, the hyperbolic geometry and fractal patterns function more as atmospheric texture than mechanical constraint that alters a specific tactic mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping temporal entrapment and understanding time's texture—is signaled early and tightens when Liora climbs into the photograph and realizes she's "trapped in when." Her decision to run sideways along the hyperbolic curve and hurl the fragment is driven by protagonist agency and narrows options with visible cost (collapse, destroying the fragment). The woman's warning and the photographs' screaming voices provide pressure. One clear reversal occurs when the fragment unravels and the maze resets, reweighting Liora's understanding and future approach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Liora's journey: time as texture to survive rather than solve, the futility of seeking centers versus designing edges. The halo fragment, photographs, and garden's geometry are concrete particulars that carry thematic weight without overt statement. The final image—stepping beside the maze to design edges—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the grandmother's warning and the woman's dialogue ("the garden doesn't remember names, only textures") edge toward thematic echo, and "the texture wasn't something to discover but to survive" risks direct articulation in a key moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's perceptual signature is consistent—professional maze-designer idiom blended with elevated poetic register. Focalization remains stable in close third, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during high-pressure beats (climb, confrontation, throw). However, diction uniformly operates in a high register throughout ("quaking reverie," "retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry") that doesn't shift under peak stress, and the woman's dialogue shares Liora's elevated syntax rather than creating voice distinction. Filter verbs ("realized," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy significantly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high in description and action. However, multiple artifact patterns cluster in peak beats: "It was X" constructions appear repeatedly ("It was a corridor," "It was unfolding," "It was something to survive"), synonym loops around "texture/seam/grain," and elevated register persists uniformly without modulation ("retrocognitively trapped," "quaking reverie," "hyperbolic geometry") even during physical action sequences. Some paraphrase drift occurs between "the maze wasn't a maze anymore" and the immediate description of corridor/photographs. These patterns apply −0.8 baseline for spread across beats, −0.3 additional for touching the closure realization, totaling −1.1 from a mid-7 baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of maze design, temporal physics, fading photographs, and living architecture creates a coherent premise that feels specific to this narrator and world. The shift from "solving centers" to "designing edges" offers a fresh angle on entrapment narratives. Hyperbolic geometry and the halo fragment's hunger are non-generic particulars. However, the core emotional arc—protagonist trapped by obsessive searching, gains wisdom to shift approach—follows a recognizable template that the specific details elevate but don't fully transform. Risk-taking in structure and imagery heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora as maze designer is established immediately, her professional lens shapes perception throughout (fractal patterns, hyperbolic geometry), and her final decision to design edges rather than solve centers directly emerges from her expertise. Her choice to run sideways and hurl the fragment are key turning points. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in at least four distinct beats: arrival (humming in satchel), pressing into soil (triggering the garden's shudder), burning during confrontation, and the climactic hurl that unravels into filaments. Its "hunger" and ability to distort time drive escalation. The final unraveling directly enables the photographs' restoration and Liora's realization. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fading photographs appear early, trigger Liora's realization about erasure, become the corridor she must navigate, disintegrate to transport her into the past, and are restored at closure when the fragment unravels. They shape stakes (preserving memory/past) and tactics (the need to escape before being trapped). Present across all three gates with moderate causal pressure and clear closure participation as they "flickered back into focus."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is used as a label for the woman's condition and frames the danger Liora faces, but the mechanics of how one becomes trapped or what specific constraint it imposes on action remain abstract. The woman "frays at the edges" as a visual cue, but no on-page action by Liora is directly enabled or constrained by this specific attribute beyond motivating her escape. Present in setup and middle, weaker closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Disintegration appears in at least three key beats: photographs disintegrating into gold motes (triggering the temporal shift), the woman beginning to fray (establishing the trap's mechanism), and photograph dust on Liora's sleeves (marking aftermath). The photograph disintegration directly enables the unfolding/transport and redefines Liora's understanding that "disintegration wasn't destruction." Strong beat involvement and thematic reweighting, though somewhat swappable with "fade" or "dissolve" mechanically.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned in setup (maze's heart) and figures in Liora's escape tactic ("ran sideways along the hyperbolic curve"). However, the specific mechanics of how hyperbolic geometry enables her escape versus ordinary running remain ornamental—descriptive flavor rather than a constraint that shapes tactical choices with visible cost. Present in two beats but largely as atmosphere; the causality could function with "twisted paths" instead.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is established immediately, its vines trigger the spiral staircase when the fragment is pressed into soil, the bridge provides the physical location for the climactic throw, and Liora stands on it at closure deciding her future approach. The garden's "shuddering" and the vines' recoil/surge directly alter available paths. Strong setup, development, and closure presence with causal pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Liora's desire to "discover the texture of time" is signaled early (realizing time "wasn't a line but a texture"), drives her unbuild project and fragment use, and culminates in the realization that texture is "something to survive" not discover. The motivation shifts meaningfully at closure. However, friction between this want and competing costs remains somewhat abstract—her physical collapse is the primary visible price, but competing desires or fears aren't dramatized in conflicting choices during the climb or confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone maintains a dreamlike, heightened register throughout ("quaking reverie," "ozone and crushed lavender," "voices rising into a chorus") that coheres across beats and modulates appropriately during the climb's intensity and the final stillness. The garden's "sigh" and bridge's "gentle sway" at closure charge the final image with tonal resonance. The consistent elevated diction and rhythm support rather than undercut pressure, and the final shift to future-looking calm feels earned.</comment>
