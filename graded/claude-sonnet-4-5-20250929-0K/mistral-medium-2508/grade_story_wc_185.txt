<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eldrin's interiority is embodied and specific—"unspooling the tension in his own bones" and the stone warming against his skin ground his sensory experience. His motivation (preservation over escape) shapes his actions consistently, and the final choice to "keep listening" after the storm changes represents earned endurance with visible cost. Minor issue: the energy beings lack distinct agency or resistance that would deepen the relational crucible; they flicker and recoil but never press back with individuated pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Eldrin, harmonic caves, post-arrival timeframe). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory detail and the bloom of hush accumulates meaning until the final image reweights the caves as conversation rather than conflict. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the storm becomes lullaby, the beings harmonize, and fresh cracks promise new language—with conceptual cost (mutual silence replaces dominance). One meaningful deepening occurs when the bloom "sang...in invitation," transforming resistance into door.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain Eldrin's method (reading echoes in stone and ice) and supply the materials for his conjuring. The echo chamber stone, frozen seep, and ripple-marks are handled tactilely across multiple beats and charge the final image: "ripple-marks...shivering, rewriting themselves." Sensory selection is purposeful—dim light, cold, moisture, low thrum—and filtered through Eldrin's mapkeeper lens. The caves function as both setting and living archive, shaping every choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserving the bloom of hush as the "last unbroken verse") is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the bloom unfolds, the beings recoil, then Eldrin chooses invitation over weapon, narrowing his stance with visible cost (mutual listening replaces solitary control). The final act—pressing the stone to his chest—is Eldrin's decision, and the beings' harmonization follows as earned consequence. Agency is clear; coincidence complicates (the ice groans, fissure splits) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (communication as two-way listening, not conquest) emerges from the bloom's function as "door" rather than "wall" and the final image of "hammered into repose by the weight of mutual silence." The echo chamber stone and ripple-marks recur with shifting meaning: first archive, then active co-creation. No overt moralizing; the ending answers the central question (how to stop the storm) by reconceiving it as conversation. The particular tactile details—ice cracks, stone pulse, breath fogging—ground the abstraction without sloganeering.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tight to Eldrin's perceptual signature: he reads echoes, traces fingers along walls, listens to silence. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("ripple-mark mapkeeper," "bloom of hush," "hammered into repose") but voice-motivated by his role. Distance modulates purposefully—closer during conjuring ("unspooling the tension in his own bones"), wider during the beings' response. Psychic certainty matches what Eldrin can know; when the beings "had not expected," it's inferred from their visible flicker, not unearned omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives during high pressure ("The ice groaned. A fissure split"), longer accumulative sentences during conjuring. Information density is high—most lines advance image, action, or thematic layer. Minor loop: "The bloom of hush wasn't gone. It was growing" near the end restates rather than advances; "He would map that, too" and "The stone pulsed once, softly, as if nodding" feel like scaffold confirming closure already landed. No figurative muddle; metaphors (trapped lightning, breath curling like question mark) are coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of mapkeeper-as-listener, silence-as-invitation, and energy-beings-seeking-harmony is non-obvious and grows from specifics: crack patterns, echo stones, the bloom's dual nature. The premise (preservation via listening rather than resistance) feels fresh within its fantasy frame. Risk-taking in the accumulative design and the choice to make antagonists harmonize rather than vanquish elevates without obscuring clarity. The "hammered into repose" tone is distinctive. No close echoes of famous lines detected; transformation of the "mapkeeper" archetype through ripple-reading is specific.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eldrin appears in the opening line, traces walls, kneels by ice, conjures the bloom, understands its invitation, stands, and chooses to keep listening. His decisions—to conjure, to recognize the bloom as door, to press the stone to his chest—drive the key turns and the final harmonization. He shapes setup, middle choice (conjuring), and closure (accepting mutual conversation).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in paragraph four, "pulsed gently luminous," is pressed to ice (paragraph eight), warms and glows during conjuring (paragraphs twelve–thirteen), goes dark after its work (paragraph sixteen), then pulses again in the final beat. It enables the bloom's conjuring, constrains the method (must "drink in the moisture, the cold, the memory"), and charges the closure reprise. Three distinct beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bloom of hush is introduced in paragraph five as "rare and fragile quiet beneath the chaos," becomes Eldrin's goal (paragraph eleven), unfolds in his mind as "sphere of perfect silence" (paragraph twelve), sings as invitation (paragraph fourteen), causes the beings to recoil and harmonize (paragraphs fifteen–eighteen), and grows in the final image. It shapes stakes (preservation), tactics (conjuring), and the closure concept (conversation vs. weapon). Irreplaceable; the story's entire arc hinges on it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes the stone in paragraph four and its "glow deepening" in paragraph twelve enables the conjuring (drinking in moisture and cold). The luminosity signals the stone's active state and constrains the method—it must warm and glow to work. Present in setup and middle action; the trait matters for the conjuring beat but does not reappear at closure. Two beats, functional constraint, but not indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Conjure" is named in paragraph eleven and executed in paragraph twelve ("by unspooling the tension in his own bones, letting the stone pull the quiet from the ice"). The bloom unfolds, the beings recoil, and Eldrin's choice to recognize it as invitation (not weapon) hinges on what conjuring revealed. Major turn traces to this action; the method (stone + ice + breath) is specific and irreplaceable. Three gates met, causal pressure high, closure shaped directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ice crack examination is introduced in paragraph nine ("examining crack patterns in ice revealed the weight of what had passed"), applied on-page when Eldrin presses the stone to ice (paragraph ten: "fractures spiraled inward, a whisper of resistance"), and fresh cracks form at closure ("tiny, deliberate, like the beginning of an answer"). The method is signaled early, used to locate the bloom's source, and returns as proof of new language. Three beats, causal and closure linkage solid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The harmonic caves frame the entire story (opening line, "hummed with the breath of the world"), provide the walls Eldrin traces, supply the frozen seep and ice, and become the site of the final harmonization. The caves' acoustic properties enable the bloom and the beings' song; their library function motivates Eldrin's preservation goal. They shape stakes, constrain method (must read the stone's memory), and charge the closure image ("caves felt like home"). Setup, development, payoff all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrived" is established in the opening line and contextualizes the current storm. Eldrin's goal (find the eye/preserve the bloom) depends on this recent disruption. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—no countdown or urgency tied to duration. It sets the situation but does not pressure tactics. Present in setup, informs stakes, but not a live constraint in middle or closure beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eldrin's motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" (or "eye of the storm," paragraph ten) is dramatized through his active search, conjuring, and final choice to accept mutual silence over solitary preservation. Paragraph eleven states "His motivation wasn't escape. It was preservation," and the ending fulfills this by transforming preservation into shared listening. The motivation is conflicted (preservation vs. invitation) and the cost (giving up singular control) is felt. Three beats, closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Hammered into repose" appears in the penultimate paragraph, describing the "new language" forged by "mutual silence." The tone throughout is contemplative and measured—even during the bloom's unfolding, the prose remains controlled ("slow and measured," "quiet thrum")—and modulates slightly at the climax (shorter sentences: "The ice groaned. A fissure split") before settling into the final lullaby image. Tone is coherent and charges the closure metaphor. Late explicit mention, but the quality pervades and lands with thematic weight.</comment>
