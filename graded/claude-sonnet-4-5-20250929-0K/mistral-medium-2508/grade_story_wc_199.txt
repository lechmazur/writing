<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora's baseline traits (orderly, sacred task) are established, but her interior life remains thin—we see actions (climbing, building, eating the leaf) without embodied contradiction or struggle. The transformation at the end (bark skin, thorn fingers) arrives without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path; she simply accepts and continues sorting. Micro-choices exist (placing the speck, stepping onto the ladder) but lack friction or competing wants that would reveal hierarchy of values. The piece leans on symbolic gestures rather than dramatized internal conflict under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The story anchors who (Liora) and where (floating arbor) early; when (the hush) is abstract but atmospherically consistent. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the moonstone speck unfolds, monuments dissolve, arbor transforms into grove—density increases and the final image (Liora sorting saplings, understanding every leaf-word) reconfigures her role with a shift in capability. However, cost is conceptual and felt rather than visible: no path is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (role deepening) but the price—what she gives up to become arbor-keeper—remains oblique. One meaningful tightening occurs (speck → key → transformation ladder) under the lens, meeting minimum scope.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ashen arbor with dangling roots, parchment sky, and monuments is vivid and purposeful. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting: it constrains her choice to climb and charges the final transformation when pressed to the sapling's bark. Spatial choreography (branch, crown, ladder of roots, ledge, grove) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is selective (warm as breath, humming seeds, bark splitting along silver veins) and filtered through Liora's task-focused attention. The arbor's transformation—roots forming a ladder, then vanishing to become a grove—alters her environment causally and supplies the new workspace at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the leaves' message—is signaled early and pursued through the speck-as-key revelation. One tightening occurs when Liora places the speck atop her seed tower and the arbor responds with glowing runes, narrowing her options to climb or remain. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by her agency: the monuments melt and dissolve on their own, the arbor forms the ladder without her forcing it. The final choice to eat the sapling leaf and accept transformation lacks visible friction or trade-off; no live alternative is dramatized. Cost is implied (she becomes part-arbor) but not legible as a sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—transformation as continuation, sorting as recognizing readiness—emerges from the speck unfolding, monuments dissolving, and Liora's role shift. The final image (sorting saplings, understanding every leaf-word) offers a resonant answer to the premise without stating a moral. The moonstone speck recurs with reweighted meaning (dust → key → embedded star → sapling catalyst). However, the arbor's whisper "begin" and Liora's realization that sorting is "about recognizing which stories were ready to take root" edge toward overt thematic statement rather than pure implication. The last paragraph ("Prophecy was a seed, and she would sort it carefully") risks summary but the saplings humming different tunes and falling leaves salvage concrete particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is task-oriented (fingers deft, seeds that hum, leaves spelling runes) and voice remains lyric-elevated throughout. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "the hush wasn't a pause after all. It was an inhale" modulates naturally with the beat. No head-hopping. The elevated register (iridescent, filament, First Song, cabochon) stays consistent with the fable-like world. Minor slip: "She had always known the work of sorting was never truly about order" briefly steps into hindsight summary rather than present realization, but recovery is swift. Purposeful compression and fragment structures ("Not for locks, but for the language") serve the lyric mode without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Figurative density is high ("sky was the color of old parchment," "breath between what had been and what would be," "neither seed nor sorter") but largely coherent and voice-consistent. Two pattern concerns: scaffold phrasing in the monument passage (stacked pebbles *for*, thimble of salt *for*, lock of hair *for*) creates template cadence, and the phrase "not dust" / "not an end" / "not a pause" recurs as negation setup. The arbor's groan, bark splitting, leaves falling, monuments dissolving sequence is clear and propulsive. Information density is solid—most lines advance atmosphere or plot. The final grove image with humming saplings and falling leaves recharges prior motifs cleanly. Deduct −0.5 for template runs and −0.2 for negation stems; no loops obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The floating arbor, monuments to transformed beings, and the speck as key to leaf-language offer a specific synthesis rather than stock fantasy tropes. The hush as inhale and sorting as recognizing story-readiness are fresh angles. Risk-taking (eating the leaf, bodily transformation, arbor vanishing into grove) heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, the transformation-as-vocation arc and the mentor-sapling whispering "begin" echo familiar quest-initiation beats. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows the speck's implications through each beat. Emotional specificity (placing speck in cheek hollow where grandmother hid stones) grounds the lyric mode. Not derivative, but the core trajectory—ordinary person discovers magical key, ascends, transforms, assumes new role—is a widely used template, transformed here by the arbor's particularity and the sorting metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Liora's choices (prodding the speck, climbing, building the seed tower, placing the speck, stepping onto the ladder, eating the leaf, jumping) drive each turn. Setup early, involved in multiple beats (discovery, tower-building, ladder ascent, leaf-eating, transformation), and present at closure (sorting the saplings). However, observation dominates over high-cost decision: she accepts each invitation (speck unfolds, arbor responds, sapling whispers) without dramatized friction or alternative. Her agency enables progression but does not force a trade-off. Causal but not indispensable—another character could follow the same steps. Mid-band for functional causal role without irreplaceability or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Moonstone speck appears early (≤20%), handled in at least four beats: prodding on palm (unfolds), tucking in cheek, placing atop seed tower (arbor responds), pressing to sapling bark (transformation). Its properties matter: iridescent, shudders, pulses warm, becomes embedded star, acts as key. The speck enables the climb, decodes the runes, and catalyzes the final transformation. Closure directly involves it (glowing palm pressed to bark). Swappability is low—its moonstone nature and fragment-of-First-Song backstory tie to the arbor's response. Cost: no visible sacrifice tied to using it; Liora's transformation is facilitated rather than priced. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, minor friction for ornamental backstory mention and lack of tied cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Regional folklore of First Song fragments is mentioned once as backdrop for the speck's origin but does not shape Liora's tactics or constrain her choices. The monuments (nymphs, merchant, child-turned-wind) gesture toward folklore but dissolve without altering her path. Folklore frames the speck's plausibility but is not dramatized as a living system with rules she must navigate. Present and coherent with tone, but replaceable—"ancient magic" or "sky-shard" would serve the same function. Functional ornament without causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" manifests on-page: monuments (pebbles melt to water, salt rises as specter, hair becomes wind-child) and Liora herself (eats leaf, skin becomes bark, fingers grow thorns, becomes part-arbor). Setup in first third via monument descriptions, developed when they dissolve mid-story, and Liora's transformation anchors the closure. The trait enables her final role (sorting saplings as part-arbor) but no visible cost or trade-off is dramatized—she accepts transformation without hesitation. Present in all three gates, causal participation in closure, but the ease of transformation lowers irreplaceability: no on-page struggle or price legible. Solid integration without felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prodding occurs twice with consequence: first prod unfolds the speck into a filament (reveals it as key), second prod makes the arbor answer (roots form ladder). Both beats are pivotal—without the prods, no unfolding, no ladder, no ascent. The action is specific and verb-distinct; easily recognized across beats. However, swappability is moderate: "touched," "pressed," or "activated" could substitute with minor edits. Cost is implicit (each prod commits her further) but not visibly priced. Strong causal role in two major turns and closure setup, minor friction for partial replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Monument-building is signaled early (pebbles, thimble, hair lock already present at the crown) and Liora builds her own: a tower of seeds with the speck at its peak. The act triggers the arbor's response (bark splits, runes glow, monuments dissolve), a key turn. At closure, the method continues: she sorts saplings (building anew). The mechanics—choosing by song/hum, stacking with intent—shape her approach. Present in setup, drives one major beat, and recurs transformed at ending. However, the early monuments are found rather than built by her on-page, so the method's mechanics are only half-demonstrated. Strong development and closure linkage with moderate setup clarity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor with floating roots is anchored early and pressures every beat: Liora perches on swaying branches, climbs to the crown, monuments cradle in branches, roots coil upward to form ladder, arbor vanishes and becomes grove. The arbor's transformation is the pivotal environmental shift—without it, no ladder, no ascent, no new workspace. Its properties (floating, root-forming, leaf-spelling, vanishing) are unique and irreplaceable. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The arbor supplies resources (ladder, runes, sapling) that determine outcome. Strong setup, multiple beat constraints, and closure-essential transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"The hush" is named and described atmospherically (breath between past and prophecy, sky color, falling leaves) but does not function as a ticking clock or impose deadline pressure. Time is vague: "today," "when she reached the top," "when she landed" lack urgency or duration cost. The hush frames mood and world-state but does not tighten Liora's decisions—she proceeds at her own pace without temporal constraint. Present throughout, coherent with tone, but replaceable—"twilight" or "the stillness" would serve equally. Functional backdrop without causal grip on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Liora's desire to decode the leaf message is signaled early (her task is sacred, today her fingers stilled, she understood the speck was a key) and pursued through each beat: prodding the speck, climbing, building the tower, reading the runes with fingertips, climbing the ladder. At closure, she succeeds: "This time, she understood every word." The motivation drives her choices consistently. However, friction is minimal—no competing want, no doubt dramatized. The desire is clean and uncontested rather than conflicted. Cost is implicit (transformation required) but not felt as sacrifice. Strong setup and development with moderate dramatization of internal tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" as tone is partially present: the arbor's gentle monumentalism, seed-humming, Liora's smile, the sapling speaking her name, and the grove's varied tunes suggest quiet wonder. The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (wonder → awe at runes → acceptance at transformation). However, "mossy" (organic, slow, verdant) fits better than "delight"—the piece leans lyric-grave rather than joyful. The final image (leaves falling, saplings humming) carries understated satisfaction but not overt delight. Tone supports closure and is purposeful, but the specific descriptor is only half-matched. Functional integration with partial tonal mismatch.</comment>
