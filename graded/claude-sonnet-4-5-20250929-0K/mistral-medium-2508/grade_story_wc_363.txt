<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The spinner's motivation is clear and embodied through weaving action, but her interior life remains static across decades—grief without contradictory impulses. The lover's response at the end introduces a second character whose renunciation mirrors hers, adding a symmetry that feels conceptually satisfying but lacks on-page friction or micro-choices under pressure. The sacrifice is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; we see dedication but not the moment-to-moment cost of choosing to stay.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (spinner, orchard, bamboo forest) arrive early; the piece teaches a mosaic pattern across decades and POVs by the midpoint. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—his weaving mirrors hers, reweighting the premise of distance and sacrifice—with felt cost (another lifetime, orchard waiting). One tightening: the bead's discovery and integration into the tapestry narrows her options and sends the message. The lens holds, but the lover's segment introduces new spatial/temporal coordinates (city of glass) without a clear transition cue, creating brief disorientation before the mirroring becomes legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard, bamboo, and apple tree anchor the spinner's world with vivid, selective detail (skeletal branches, loam, bark sealing over bones). The city of glass and ozone appears abruptly without sensory grounding or spatial choreography, functioning as an abstract counterpoint rather than a lived-in constraint. The bead and loom serve as micro-setting, constraining her choice to weave the message and charging the final image when he begins his own thread.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: carrying the message across impossible distance. One meaningful tightening: cracking the bead releases the "raveling silence" as thread, enabling the tapestry's completion and forcing the trade-off (message carries, sender stays). The cost is legible on the page—her bones woven into roots, his reply requiring another lifetime—and escalation is driven by her agency. The lover's mirror action deepens rather than resolves, sustaining pressure into the final image (orchard waits, loom hums).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars of weaving, distance, and sacrifice without overt statement. The silver thread and tapestry motifs recur with reweighted meaning (her work, his reply, the traveler's find), and the final image—loom humming, orchard waiting—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of bridging impossible distance. The cost (lifetimes, embodiment in the forest) is conceptual and felt, avoiding moralizing. Minor slip: "Some sacrifices were too vast for words" edges toward thematic echo, though it remains character-filtered rather than authorial.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose establishes a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("raveling silence," "the shape of sound," "distance"). POV remains stable in the spinner's segment; the lover's section shifts cleanly at a section break with consistent third-person limited. Diction is elevated and consistent, voice-motivated for a fable-like register. One weakness: "tree sap amber" is redundant (amber *is* fossilized resin), and "stoically sparkling" strains coherence—stoicism is a stance, not a visual quality. These minor register slips do not obscure the overall effect but reduce precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several lines loop or overwrite without advancing pressure: "a raveling silence that coiled like smoke" and "the raveling silence that now lived in his lungs" repeat the same metaphor across beats. "The fabric drank the silence" mixes liquid and thread metaphors without clear vehicle. Template cadence appears in the middle ("The bead had been waiting. / She knew the legends" / "The loom was her anchor, her method")—short declarative stems that stall momentum. The closure image (loom hums, orchard waits) is clean and propulsive, so non-closure accumulation cap applies: −0.8 for loops and metaphor muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of weaving, silence-as-thread, and multi-lifetime communication feels specific and non-obvious, with the mirror structure (her tapestry, his reply) earning the ending in hindsight. The fable-like voice and metaphysical stakes are executed with commitment. Minor deduction: the "jigsaw puzzle edges found in rummage sale boxes of the universe" is a strained contemporary simile that clashes with the timeless orchard setting and risks quirk-for-quirk's-sake. The piece takes risks (decades-spanning mosaic, abstract concept as material) that heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present early, central to all beats (threading, finding bead, weaving silence, hanging tapestry), and her choice to crack the bead and complete the work drives the closure. "Wistful" is label-only; the trait does not visibly constrain or enable a specific action with cost, though her grief and dedication shape all moves. The character is essential but the specific attribute "wistful" is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Introduced in beat two (found in loam), handled in beat three (cracked open), woven in beat four, and its essence (silver thread) reappears in the traveler's find and the lover's dust. The bead enables the tapestry's completion and is causally necessary to the message's transmission. Strong closure linkage (his fingers dusted with silver) reweights its meaning. High irreplaceability: removing it breaks the story's central mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Introduced early ("hush of time's unraveling"), returns as the bead's essence ("raveling silence"), woven into the tapestry, and becomes the material the lover plucks ("raveling silence that now lived in his lungs"). It shapes the mechanics of the message and recurs in the final image (loom's hum). The concept alters tactics (she must find something to spin the silence) and charges closure. Mild swappability: "unraveling" could be another abstract quality without major structural change, though "raveling" (tangling/untangling) is more specific.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" appears once as a descriptor for the bead. It does not constrain or enable any action; "sparkling" suggests warmth/life (the bead is warm, holds the orchard's pulse), but "stoically" (enduring pain without complaint) is a stance, not a visual quality, and contributes nothing to the causal chain. Label-only use; easily cut without impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled in the opening (loom spinner, threading silver strand) and returns explicitly in beat five ("recommencing a ritual they'd abandoned in grief"). The action of weaving drives three beats (threading, weaving silence, completion) and the lover mirrors it in the ending (weaving his own thread). Removing "recommence" specifically would not break the story—she could simply "weave"—but the ritual aspect and resumption after grief add thematic weight and tie to the closure image (loom hums again).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mentioned once in beat four ("fragments of something greater, jigsaw puzzle edges found in rummage sale boxes of the universe"). It frames the bead as a bridging piece but does not shape mechanics or tactics; the actual method is weaving silence into thread. The image is ornamental and the contemporary "rummage sale" register clashes with the timeless orchard setting. Swappable with "fragments" or "shards" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orchard and bamboo forest anchor the spinner's world early and recur across beats (apple tree, loam, skeletal branches, roots). The setting supplies the bead (buried in loam) and becomes her final resting place (bones woven into roots), participating in closure. The bamboo sways in the final line, completing the frame. The setting constrains her choice to stay and charges the ending image. Mild penalty: the city of glass is introduced late without grounding, weakening spatial coherence in the lover's segment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Time's unraveling" is introduced early and recurs in the title phrase. Decades pass on the page (years folded, traveler finds thread later, lover's reply will take another lifetime), but time does not tighten tactics—no clock forces decisions. The temporal sweep is thematic and structural (mosaic across lifetimes) rather than a pressure mechanism. The timeframe enables the concept and participates in closure (orchard waits, patient), reaching mid-band via lyric resonance without causal urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Signaled in the opening (lover lost to time's unraveling, never stopped searching for the seam) and drives every beat: finding the bead, weaving the silence, completing the tapestry, choosing to send it. The cost (sender must stay) creates friction, and the message's success (reached him) validates the sacrifice. The lover's mirroring choice (weaving his reply) extends the motivation into closure. High causal necessity; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone is established early (forgotten orchard, lover lost, silent plea) and modulates with pressure: discovery (warm bead, pulse of bloom), desperate precision (cracking with teeth, working through night), and quiet endurance (did not weep, known the cost). The final image (orchard patient, loom hums, he sits and weaves) charges "latent sacrifice" without declaring it. Coherent across turns; the tone of measured, inevitable cost supports theme and closure without flattening into static mood.</comment>
