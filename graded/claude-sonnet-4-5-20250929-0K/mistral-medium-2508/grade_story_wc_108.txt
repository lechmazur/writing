<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to reclaim proof of her identity drives the plot, but her interior contradictions remain told rather than enacted in real time. The phobia of open water is referenced repeatedly yet never constrains an on-page choice or compounds pressure. The girl character appears solely to deliver exposition and prompt Lena's pivot, functioning as a device rather than a pressure source. Emotional vocabulary ("coiled tighter," "clawed at her ribs") leans on stock metaphor without specific embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens: Lena receives the cast message, which points to the shell's voice, which directs her to the ledger that proves her existence. The closure unit—walking out with proof—qualifies as Decisive Change with felt cost (she must bleed, face the archive alone, accept that fear remains). However, the girl's appearance and the ledger's exact location both arrive without prior setup, weakening the because/therefore chain. The Orientation Test is waived; spatial anchors (library, shelf, ladder) are clear by the opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars establishes vivid atmosphere and the ladder groans under Lena's weight, tying setting to action. The shell and ledger function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure image. Yet the library's physical logic is thin—why is a child wandering alone in a closed, rusted building? The setting supplies resources (ledger, cast) but does not meaningfully constrain Lena's choices or force tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving Lena exists legally and professionally—is signaled early and drives the search. The cast's decrypted message provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options and points to the ledger. Closure cost is legible: Lena bleeds onto the shell and walks away from the water phobia still intact. However, no on-page decision faces genuine opposition or trade-off; the ledger simply awaits retrieval once the clue resolves. The girl never resists, the security guard never appears, and Lena's phobia is invoked but never tested in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—vulnerability as strength, fear as "the current you learned to ride"—is articulated explicitly in the final paragraph rather than emergent from scene choices. The shell and cast operate as thematic tokens (erasure, messages, paired halves) without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. The closing image of walking out with the ledger offers declarative certainty ("She was ready to dive") that undercuts ambiguity. The line "the very things they called weaknesses were the cracks that let the light in" is a Thematic Echo in the final third, triggering deduction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and Lena's perceptual signature (stunt-diagram thinking, translating cast marks into "pressure here, pivot there") provides character-specific filtering. However, the narration slips into over-articulated interiority during peak beats: "The betrayal coiled tighter" and "vulnerability wasn't weakness" read as meta-commentary. Dialogue with the girl is functional but lacks subtext or tension; her lines deliver information without pursuit or evasion. Voice modulates under pressure but relies on familiar intensity markers (sharp laugh, rough voice).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The opening anchors voice and stakes effectively, but figurative density in high-pressure beats often muddles rather than sharpens: "the water still terrified her. But she knew, now, that fear wasn't the enemy. It was the current you learned to ride" stacks abstraction at closure. Paraphrase loops appear: "That she could face the water…That vulnerability wasn't weakness" rehearse the same idea across adjacent lines. Template cadence runs dominate transitions: "She wasn't X. She wasn't Y. She was Z." The shell's pulse and Lena's breath are recycled cues without fresh sensory detail. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance knowledge, but scaffold phrases ("Her stomach dropped," "voice rough") recur without variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—stunt double discovers identity erasure via magical whispering shell and child's coded cast in rusted library—stitches multiple familiar elements (mysterious artifact, cryptic helper, hidden ledger) without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The phobia-ridden protagonist's arc follows a recognizable template: betrayal → mystical guide → proof → empowerment. The closing certainty ("she was ready to dive") resolves complexity into a tidy binary. Removing the library or shell and substituting a different archive/clue would leave the emotional arc unchanged, signaling high swappability. No bold structural risk or perspectival choice heightens stakes; the piece opts for safe synthesis over fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lena's stunt-double identity and phobia shape backstory exposition but do not constrain on-page choices. She climbs a ladder (stunt skill implied) but the phobia of open water never forces a tactical trade-off in this library setting. Present in setup and ending, absent from middle development where her skills could narrow or enable options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell appears in three beats: Lena grips it at opening, the girl identifies it mid-scene, and Lena presses blood to its edge to unlock the ledger voice at closure. It enables the key turn (ledger location) and charges the final image (warm against her skin). Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage present, but the shell's mechanics (why blood? why paired halves?) remain ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal structures the inciting situation (Jacob's fraud erased Lena legally) and the ledger discovery reweights her proof of existence. However, the betrayal itself is backstory; on-page action centers on decryption and retrieval rather than processing the transformation. The concept shapes stakes but does not alter tactics in scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is invoked as career summary ("built a career on adaptation") and claimed at closure ("by outwitting a system"), but no on-page moment shows Lena adapting under constraint with visible cost. She decodes the cast and climbs the ladder—both straightforward applications of skill without trade-off. Label-only trait without demonstrated friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Outwit" drives the major turn: Lena decrypts the cast marks using stunt-diagram logic, then follows the shell's clue to retrieve the ledger. The action is signaled early (her history of outwitting fear) and payoff at closure (outwitting the erasure system). Swappable with "decode" or "solve" without major edits, capping integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on the child's cast provides the key causal link to the ledger location. The method is signaled when Lena receives the cast, executed in one beat ("her fingers traced…until the marks resolved"), and its result shapes the ending. However, the mechanics are compressed into summary ("loops and lines that might've been letters") without demonstrating the decryption process on the page, reducing felt specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The rusted library supplies the ledger and ladder, and stars frame the opening and closing images. The setting provides the resource that resolves the plot but does not pressure Lena's choices or force tactical adaptation. Postcard framing (stars, iron shelves, groaning floorboards) establishes atmosphere without altering the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering you're not who you thought" structures Lena's emotional premise and drives her search for proof. However, the discovery itself is backstory (the email), and no live clock tightens decisions in the library scene. Time functions as motivational backdrop rather than escalating constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation to prove vulnerability is power is articulated explicitly in the final third ("proving that the very things they called weaknesses were the cracks") but never dramatized through conflicted choice. Lena's phobia is referenced but does not create on-page friction or cost. The desire is told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" captures the texture of Lena's voice at opening ("fingers trembling," "voice steadier than her pulse") and modulates through the search to declarative resolve at closure ("she was ready to dive"). The tone coheres across turns and charges the final image, though the closing certainty flattens the trembling ambiguity established earlier.</comment>
