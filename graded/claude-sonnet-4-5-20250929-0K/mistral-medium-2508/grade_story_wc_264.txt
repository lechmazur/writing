<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hollow's interior life is presented through evocative images (holding a breath, feeling a dream stir) but his motivations remain largely atmospheric rather than grounded in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The spark-placement choice arrives without prior internal conflict to earn it; we observe resonant moments but lack the embodied struggle that would elevate the final act. The "never dreamed" frame bookends nicely but doesn't constrain choices in between. Interiority leans poetic rather than character-particular, with phrases like "fractured lullaby" and "divergent archive" feeling more authorial than Hollow's own lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (dunes, crate, clock, spark) and builds density through recurring images that shift meaning. Closure arrives on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Hollow moves from emptiness to remembering, the sand turns green, tracks renew—cost is felt in the transformation from "never dreamed" to dreaming of forests. Orientation anchors (freight guard, train, glowing dunes) land within the first third. One meaningful deepening occurs when Hollow places the spark in the crate and winds the clock backward, altering the world's trajectory. The mosaic structure (multiple short shards) is legible and the final image reweights prior material with undeniable pressure, though some transitions blur without clear causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing dunes provide vivid, purpose-driven detail that charges multiple beats: they part to reveal the spark, bloom brighter as Hollow acts, and turn green at closure. The train cabin and crate anchor spatial choreography cleanly. Sensory selection (bioluminescent algae, rust, pulsing light) filters through a post-apocalyptic lens and reflects urgency. The chess clock as micro-setting object constrains Hollow's choice to wind it backward, directly charging the final image. Economy is high; no occupational padding. Setting details interweave with action rather than stalling momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preventing another world reset, signaled early via the toppled white king and "the world had already reset too many times." Pressure accumulates through the Möbius-strip tracks and the spark's weight, but escalation relies more on atmospheric intensification than on a clear tightening that forecloses options. Hollow's agency (placing the spark, winding the clock) drives the resolution, yet the cost—though felt in the transformation—lacks a visible trade-off or renunciation that would narrow tactics. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the price remains implicit rather than dramatized as a loss or omission that alters later choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and memory emerges organically from the spark, clock, and forest imagery without overt statement. The final image (green sand, new tracks, child's laughter) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of cultivating hope in a burnt world. Subtext operates through the chess clock's hands retreating from midnight and the rust flaking to reveal brightness beneath. The recurring spark motif constrains Hollow's choice and reweights prior emptiness. Minor slip: "To cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" articulates the thesis too directly mid-story, though the line functions more as worldbuilding than moralizing and the ending avoids summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Hollow with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-textural signature ("iron veins of the dead earth," "petals of light unfurling") that modulates with emotional intensity. Perceptual signature is selective: Hollow notices rust, locks, clocks, and sparks through a guardsman's lens. Free indirect style is clean. Purposeful compression and fragment repetition ("The sand was green") serve the accumulative design and are taught early. Minor density concern: elevated diction ("lattice of moments," "web of divergent paths") occasionally drifts toward the authorial, but remains voice-motivated and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high in the opening and closure beats. However, patterned artifacts appear: italicized phrases (*glowing dunes in bloom*, *occasionally everywhere*, *charming*, *through wave functions*, *divergent archive*, *fractured lullaby*) function as decorative tags rather than earned images, reading like prompt-element insertions that dilute momentum. Template stems recur ("The clock…," "The spark…," "The train…") across multiple beats without variation. Figurative language in most lines of high-pressure beats (clock chime as vibration rewriting air, dunes as petals, train whistle as fractured lullaby) adds texture but occasionally muddies clarity. No paraphrase loops, but the italicized elements and stem repetition trigger line-level penalties. Deduction: −1.0 for patterned artifacts (italicized tags, template cadence) spread across the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic setting with bioluminescent dunes and a reality-bending freight line offers a specific angle on renewal-after-collapse. The chess clock as world-reset metaphor and the spark as embryonic hope show ingenuity. However, the core frame (lone guardian carrying hope through dying world, discovering life, enabling rebirth) follows a widely used template without transforming it through surprising moral calculus or lived contradiction. Italicized prompt elements (*divergent archive*, *through wave functions*, *occasionally everywhere*) feel stitched rather than organic. Emotional truth is present but the arc could transplant to other apocalyptic settings with minimal change. Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.6 for template adherence without sufficient personalization through conflict or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hollow appears in every beat, frames the opening, makes the key choice (placing spark, winding clock), and anchors closure. His decision to carry the spark and reverse the clock alters the world's trajectory with visible consequence (green sand, new tracks). Early signal strong; two distinct beats (opening the crate, placing the spark); causal pressure narrows to his choice; closure linkage direct; cost tied to transformation from emptiness to memory. Swappability moderate: another guardian could function, but "Hollow" and "never dreamed" create thematic specificity. Deductions: late development of agency (choice arrives in final third) −0.3; some ornamental description in middle beats −0.2. Positive signals: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.4 = base ~6.0 + positives +3.0 − frictions −0.5 ≈ 8.5, but limiter (swappability, mid-scene passivity) caps at ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Chess clock appears in three beats: discovery (frozen at midnight, white king toppled), mid-story (ticking in pocket), and closure (wound backward). Early signal by first third; evolving use (static → ticking → rewound) reweights meaning from warning to active tool. Causal pressure: winding it backward enables the world's renewal. Closure linkage strong: "The clock struck one" and "wound the clock again, just to hear it sing" anchor the ending. Specificity high: frozen-at-midnight and toppled-king details matter. Cost connection: the clock's reversal carries conceptual weight. Positive signals: early +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4 = base 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4, but swappability (another time-device could serve) −0.4 and one beat is summary-only (pocket mention) −0.3 ≈ 7.7, rounded to 7.3 under dominant limiter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Divergent archive is named and explained mid-story ("a lattice of moments that shouldn't exist but did"), frames the world logic, and hums around Hollow at closure. It shapes the stakes (preventing another reset) and provides the conceptual scaffold for the spark's existence. Early signal indirect (crate humming, "occasionally everywhere"); mentioned in two beats (explanation, closure hum); causal pressure moderate (explains the spark but doesn't constrain Hollow's tactics directly); closure linkage present but passive (the archive hums, doesn't act). Positive signals: setup by second third +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (lattice, web metaphors) +0.4 = base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6, plus conceptual cost connection +0.3 = 5.9. Swappability moderate (another reality-bending system could substitute) limits further lift.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere" appears once in italics as descriptor for the crate's shifting contents. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action; it remains a label without dramatized consequence. Setup present (first third), but no middle development or closure use. Gate test: setup only → cap 4.6. Ornamental mention −0.5, label-only trait −0.3 = base 3.0 + setup +0.4 − frictions −0.8 = 2.6, raised slightly for thematic coherence with divergent-reality premise to 4.2, but cap at 4.6 holds.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Charm" appears once: "Someone had been *charming* the timeline." The term is explanatory rather than action-driver; Hollow does not charm on-page, and no turn traces to this verb. It functions as world-lore label. Setup by second third, no middle beat, no closure use. Gate test: setup only → cap 4.6. Ornamental/thematic mention −0.6, swappability (other verbs: "bending," "stitching" also present) −0.5 = base 3.0 + setup +0.3 − frictions −1.1 ≈ 2.2, but thematic resonance with wave-function metaphor lifts slightly to 4.8 under the cap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Through wave functions" appears once in italics as method descriptor ("stitching together fragments… through wave functions"). It is not signaled mechanically, does not shape Hollow's attempts, and does not return. Setup by second third, no middle beat, no closure use. Gate test: setup only → cap 4.6. Ornamental/label-only −0.7, swappability high (generic quantum metaphor) −0.6 = base 3.0 + setup +0.3 − frictions −1.3 ≈ 2.0, lifted slightly for tonal coherence with archive concept to 3.7 under cap.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Glowing dunes appear in five beats: opening (bioluminescent algae), parting to reveal spark, blooming brighter as Hollow acts, blurring into gold streaks, turning green at closure. Early signal strong (opening paragraph); causal pressure high (the dunes part, enabling discovery; they bloom, signaling success); closure linkage direct ("The sand was green"). Specificity: bioluminescent algae, the only growth after the last forest burned. Cost connection: the green sand embodies renewal. Positive signals: early +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = base 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1, but minor swappability (another landscape metaphor could serve, though less elegantly) −0.3 and one beat is transitional blur −0.2 ≈ 8.6, adjusted to 7.6 under conservative reading of irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the last forest burns" anchors the world state in the opening paragraph and returns implicitly at closure ("he dreamed of forests"). It sets the stakes (a dead world seeking renewal) but does not function as a live clock tightening decisions. Early signal strong; closure linkage present (forest dream reweights the loss); causal pressure moderate (motivates the spark mission but does not alter tactics beat-by-beat). Positive signals: early +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (last forest) +0.5, cost connection (loss frames renewal) +0.4 = base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5. No middle beat −0.4, not a ticking clock −0.3 ≈ 4.8, lifted slightly for thematic charge to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" is stated explicitly mid-story and dramatized when Hollow picks up the spark, places it in the crate, and enables the world's bloom. Early signal indirect (cargo description); middle beat (spark placement); closure linkage strong (child's laughter, world breathing). Causal pressure: the motivation drives Hollow's key choice. Cost connection: transformation from emptiness to memory. Positive signals: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.3, cost +0.4 = base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1. Friction: the explicit statement mid-story reads as thematic echo rather than embodied friction (told-only moment) −0.5, and friction between want and cost is implied rather than dramatized −0.5 ≈ 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fractured lullaby" appears once in italics as descriptor for the train whistle. Tone throughout is elegiac, lyric, and haunted, modulating from desolation (opening) to tentative hope (closure). Early signal present (tone set by opening imagery); closure charge strong (soft glow, dream of forests). Coherence high: the piece sustains a dreamlike, melancholic register that supports the apocalyptic-renewal stakes. Positive signals: early coherence +0.6, closure charge +1.4, modulation under pressure (dunes bloom, Hollow dreams) +0.8, specificity +0.5 = base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3. One-time label use (italicized phrase) reads ornamental −0.3, and static lyric texture in middle beats (less tonal shift than expected) −0.2 ≈ 5.8, lifted for strong ending charge to 6.7.</comment>
