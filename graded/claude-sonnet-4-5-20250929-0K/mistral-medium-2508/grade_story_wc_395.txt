<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and her brother's disappearance drives choices consistently. The interiority during the archive exploration shows concrete thought patterns ("They didn't just store data. It *consumed* it"). However, her decision to accept deletion at the end feels insufficiently motivated—the leap from discovery to willing erasure lacks the embodied hesitation or fear that would ground such a terminal choice. The final "smiled" and acceptance reads as convenient closure rather than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens: Lena's query triggers the file, which leads to coordinates, then the crystal pull that restores memories and flags her for termination. The recurring numbers function as breadcrumbs that tighten options. Closure arrives on-page with a decisive change—Lena chooses deletion to join the archived—and the cost is death/erasure. One weakness: the mechanism by which the patch "vibrates with stored sound" and Elias speaks through it is introduced late without prior setup, creating a small causality gap at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive setting is rendered through sensory specifics—"servers pulsing with ghost-light," "firewalls flaring like angry stars"—and the neural lace provides embodied tech interaction. Server Farm 26 coordinates anchor the climax spatially. The patch functions as micro-setting, warm against her palm and vibrating at the key moment, constraining her choice to engage. Slight dock: the transition from terminal to hologram corridor lacks spatial grounding, making the final approach feel abstract rather than navigable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding Elias and the truth of the Astraeus erasure—is signaled early and escalates through the query notification, the numbers trail, and the override confrontation. The system's resistance ("Access denied") creates a clear obstacle Lena must choose to breach, raising stakes to termination. The crystal insertion is a decisive act with immediate consequence: files flood back, alarms wail, flagged for death. The cost is legible and immediate. One micro-turn when the numbers rearrange to reveal her mother's birthdate deepens emotional pressure without diluting the primary drive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of institutional erasure versus personal memory emerges organically from Lena's work and the Astraeus cover-up. The recurring numbers and the archive's recursive loop create a pattern that shifts meaning at closure when Lena joins the deleted. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "the place where the lost things went" and "the door was open" feel slightly didactic. The lullaby and forgotten songs motif charges the ending but "The song played on" as a closing beat leans declarative rather than leaving the reader to infer resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lena's perceptions. Diction stays consistent—"ghost-light," "data graves," "recursive loop"—building a tech-haunted voice. The whispered line "I know what you're doing" and Elias' paradoxical speech through the patch maintain clarity of focalization. Brief filter-verb stack in the middle ("She pulled up… her pulse syncing… The screen dissolved") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't obscure action. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts effectively under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance plot or atmosphere. The opening "hummed like a dying star" establishes voice immediately. However, template cadence appears in three consecutive "The [noun] [verbed]" constructions mid-story ("The feed cut… then reformed… Lena's hands shook. The **missing persons**…"). Minor paraphrase loop: "deleted lived on as whispers" and "echo of forgotten songs" restate the same concept adjacently. No major loops touch the closure beat, keeping the final paragraph clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The corporate memory-keeper protagonist and recursive archive setting offer a fresh angle on digital haunting. The patch as audio storage device and numbers as breadcrumb trail show specificity. However, the core beats—protagonist uncovers conspiracy, system tries to silence them, protagonist chooses martyrdom—follow a familiar template. The willing deletion ending, while thematically apt, is a well-worn choice in archive/AI stories. Transformation is present but partial; swapping the archive for another institution wouldn't fundamentally alter the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's role as corporate memory keeper is introduced immediately and frames every beat: she curates silence, discovers the buried query, uses override codes, and ultimately accepts deletion. Her professional access enables the search; her job's irony—paid to bury what she's now resurrecting—charges her final choice. The role is indispensable; a different profession wouldn't grant the same access or thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The patch appears in the notification image (setup), is zoomed and examined for the number sequence (middle beat constraining the search), and vibrates with Elias' stored voice at the climax, enabling communication. Lena presses it to her chest in the final paragraph, a tactile anchor for her acceptance. The singed edges and half-melted insignia carry specificity. Removing it would break the numbers trail and the brother's voice mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Astraeus-7 cold case is the inciting query, Elias' disappearance motivates Lena's entire search, and the missing-persons revelation—"not just the crew" but "every trace of them"—redefines the stakes at midpoint. The concept recurs in the deletion logs, the crew holograms, and the final restoration. The story's closure hinges on reversing the erasure and Lena joining the missing. Essential to logic and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" describes the display once in the opening paragraph as "her one concession to sentiment." It signals character detail but never constrains a choice or returns with reweighted meaning. The trait could be cut or swapped with another modifier without altering plot or closure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lie is specified: "Lena had spent years learning how *EchoNet* **lied** about its gaps." This past knowledge enables her present search—she knows files are redirected, not erased. The system's deletion of the crew is the story's central injustice. Her final act undoes the institutional lie by restoring the files. The concept recurs and drives multiple beats, though "lie" as an action is more thematic frame than discrete plot move.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The numbers appear in the notification image, on Lena's coffee cup, in deleted video timecodes, and frost on her window—establishing the "everywhere" pattern early. She inputs the sequence as coordinates, which unlock the feed and later the subdirectory. The numbers rearrange twice to reveal her mother's birthdate and the childhood home combination, each shift advancing understanding. The method shapes every search beat and the ending. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The social network archive houses the ECHO_OF_FORGOTTEN_SONGS subdirectory where deleted files persist. Lena's terminal access, the deep-search protocol, Server Farm coordinates, and the algorithm's resistance all pressure her choices. The setting's mechanics—redirection, recursive loops, firewalls—are signaled early and constrain tactics throughout. The archive's "consumption" of data reframes the stakes. Removing this setting would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" names the subdirectory and evokes the lullaby motif. It anchors the archive's liminal space thematically but doesn't function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The "12 years ago, today" timestamp adds specificity to one feed, but no live clock pressures Lena's moves. The phrase is more metaphorical setting than temporal constraint. Functional but replaceable as a time element.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lena's drive to find "where deleted files go" is stated in the closing paragraph and implied throughout: she pulls corrupted logs, seeks the redirected audio, and follows the numbers trail to the hidden subdirectory. Her final realization—"she'd finally found what she'd been **motivated** to seek"—names the desire explicitly. The goal shapes every search choice and the ending. Slightly late for full credit, but the desire is dramatized in action and costs her life.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone of "sensed absence" permeates: "ghost-light," "data graves," "the dead stayed buried," the lullaby no one recognized, and the crew "unwrote" yet persisting as whispers. The archive's hum and silence bookend the piece, and the final "archive was silent" after restoration charges closure. The tone modulates from investigative to elegiac without breaking coherence. It directly supports the theme and final image, making it integral.</comment>
