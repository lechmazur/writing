<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyra's interiority is embodied through the clipboard's weight and her physical control ("fingers unclenching, voice a river over rocks"), and her tactical use of the past signature creates pressure. Kael's internal conflict emerges through contradictory impulses—reaching for the blade while his voice "unravels, already human." The final renunciation ("You'll break this one too") carries visible cost, though Kael's arc compresses quickly. Minor slip: "muster the part of you that still believes in mornings" edges toward abstraction without sufficient grounding in his prior concrete stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (terrace, midsummer, two negotiators) by the second paragraph. The escalation follows an Accumulative lens: Veyra invokes the past signature, Kael's hand moves toward the blade, then toward the pen—a meaningful tightening that narrows his options through her tactical reminder. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael signs with visible ambivalence, the cost legible in "his voice was already unraveling," and Veyra's walk away with the "quiet violence of hope" reweights the dominant stake. The inferred lens holds; one credible deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The terrace's stones, skeletal vines, and cracked mosaic create spatial coherence. The ebony clipboard—smooth grain, notched edge—is handled in multiple beats and its tactile weight constrains Veyra's grip and ritual staging. The midsummer sun and lavender/gunpowder scent charge the final image. However, the "slow dance of celestial bodies" and stars remain ornamental metaphor rather than active environmental pressure on choice, limiting the 9+ gate despite strong micro-setting work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (treaty signing vs. futility) is signaled immediately. Escalation tightens through Kael's reach toward the blade, Veyra's invocation of his past words, and his final trembling signature—one meaningful choice that forecloses the option of immediate violence. The cost is legible: "his voice was already unraveling, already human" and Veyra's acknowledgment "You'll break this one too." Agency drives the turn; the signing is earned by prior causality. No second reversal is required at this length, and the Accumulative lens holds.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (the cyclical, flawed nature of redemption) emerges through concrete particulars: the notched clipboard, Kael's remembered words, the ritual's repetition. The final image—"Redemption wasn't a single act. It was the slow, flawed beauty of choosing to try again"—teeters on the edge of explicit statement but is anchored by prior action and the ebony's "quiet violence of hope." Subtext operates in Kael's tremor and Veyra's refusal to look back. Minor penalty: "installments, carved into wood and bone" edges toward thematic echo in the closing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization on Veyra; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the signature exchange, slight zoom at the walk away). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Kael's "bring stronger ink" is simultaneously threat and acceptance. Voice is consistent with elevated diction ("operatively gentle," "celestial bodies") that fits a ritualized negotiation context. Minor slip: "his voice was already unraveling, already human" leans on "already" twice in quick succession, creating mild template cadence in a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings alternate, and figurative language ("river over rocks," "dry wind through skeletal vines") serves character perception. Information density is high, with most lines advancing character or atmosphere. However, "The stars kept dancing" and "the universe offered no guarantees" edge toward stock metaphor, and "the quiet violence of hope" + "the slow, flawed beauty of choosing to try again" in the final section layer abstractions densely without fresh embodiment. Paraphrase appears: "Veyra did not look away" / "She did not look back" functions similarly across beats. Deduction −0.5 for figurative density and mild loop in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The negotiator-with-clipboard frame and notched-treaty ritual offer specificity, and the past-signature gambit is a non-obvious tactical turn. However, the war-weary negotiator and cyclical peace premise trend toward familiar templates ("seventeen wars," broken treaties) without sufficient transformation through unique world logic or moral calculus. The "operatively gentle" training and celestial-dance framing add texture but do not fundamentally distinguish the emotional arc from prior negotiator narratives. Transformation test: plot and arc could transfer to different names/places with minimal loss, indicating mid-band freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyra (forever war peace negotiator) drives two key beats: invoking Kael's past signature to create pressure, and her tactical use of the pen/ritual to force his choice. Her walk away with the clipboard shapes the closure image, reweighting "the quiet violence of hope." The character's decisions alter tactics and narrow Kael's options. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in setup (description, notches), is handled in the ritual beat (Veyra sets it down, Kael reaches for it), and returns in the final image ("tucked under her arm, heavy with names and notches"). Its notched edge tracks treaties and failures, constraining Veyra's ritual and charging the closure with accumulated cost. Three distinct beats; closure linkage and irreplaceability are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The price of redemption shapes the dominant stake (signing vs. futility) and is dramatized through Kael's trembling signature and Veyra's acceptance of likely failure ("You'll break this one too. Probably."). The concept drives the middle choice and appears in the closing paragraph ("the price of redemption was never paid in full"). However, the final articulation leans toward thematic echo rather than pure dramatization, limiting the score. Setup, middle pressure, and closure presence are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is labeled early ("the way she had been trained—fingers unclenching, voice a river over rocks") and appears in Veyra's tactical calm during the signature exchange. However, it does not create a visible on-page tradeoff or constrain a key choice; Veyra's gentleness succeeds without cost. The trait colors her method but remains functional rather than essential. Setup and middle use are present; cost connection is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Muster" appears at the peak beat: "I want you to muster the part of you that still believes in mornings" directly precedes Kael's reach for the clipboard. The action redefines his options and drives the turn from blade to pen. Early setup is absent, but the action's causal role in the closure turn is strong. Middle and closure participation are met; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ritual significance is signaled early ("the weight of the ritual," ink from ashes, pen from olive branch) and shapes Veyra's staging ("dipped the pen, the ritual's weight pressing into her bones"). The ritual frames the entire negotiation and constrains Veyra's method. However, its mechanics do not alter a key choice or narrow options; Kael could sign without the ritual's symbolic apparatus. Setup and middle framing are strong; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ancient terrace at midsummer is anchored early and provides spatial coherence (cracked mosaic, skeletal vines, stones that "hummed with names of the dead"). The setting's history charges Veyra's invocation of the past and frames the closure image (shadows, midsummer sun in gold). However, the terrace does not supply a resource or constraint that alters a key choice. Setup, atmospheric pressure, and closure presence are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The celestial bodies' "slow dance" is mentioned in setup and closure ("The stars kept dancing") but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions. The midsummer sun provides atmospheric framing but no deadline pressure. Time remains vague and untracked; the negotiation could compress or extend without altering tactics. Setup and closure cameo are present; causal pressure and middle development are absent. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Veyra's motivation (to anchor ideals in practice) is dramatized through her ritual staging, her invocation of Kael's past words, and her acceptance of likely failure at closure ("This was how ideals became practice"). The desire creates friction between symbolic ritual and pragmatic futility, driving her choice to proceed despite doubt. Setup, middle choice, and closure are present; causal pressure and cost connection are strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Flawed beauty is coherent through turns: the ebony clipboard's "polished grief," lavender and gunpowder in equal measure, Kael's trembling signature, and the final image of "the slow, flawed beauty of choosing to try again." Tone modulates with pressure (elevated ritual diction, dry humor at "bring stronger ink") and charges the closure. The tone is consistent, purposeful, and integral to the final image's resonance.</comment>
