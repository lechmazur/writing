<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena's motivations are clear and consistently rooted in inherited debt and filial duty, with embodied emotion ("watch fob warm against her palm"). Her agency drives the climactic confrontation through calculated deception. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between hunting trust-breaking and becoming her father, though this could deepen further. The final renunciation—walking away with the sound "memorized"—earns credible closure, though the embodied cost at the peak moment leans slightly toward告 summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Papa's deal → his death → Lena's trap → Veyne's exposure follows motivated linkage. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis (she walks away carrying the sound, foreclosing revenge's continuation) with visible cost—she must live with that knowledge. Orientation anchors early (pier, market, Veyne's stall). One tightening suffices: the escalation from offer to laugh to market judgment. Minor issue: "By sunrise, the harbor would take what it was owed" tells rather than shows the cost mechanism, slightly softening immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the pier is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("tar and stolen rum," "lantern light") and constrains Lena's approach—she uses the stall setting to close distance and the market's unwritten rules anchor the final threat. The watch fob functions as micro-setting, charging both opening and closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The "anise on his breath" detail sharpens proximity and threat in the confrontation beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (avenge father/settle debt) is signaled immediately and drives all tactics. The tightening occurs when Lena's false-starts bait transforms into the laugh—"the first crack in the ice"—narrowing Veyne's options and crystallizing his exposure. Agency is hers: the trap, the timing, the refusal. Cost is legible: she must carry the knowledge of trust breaking and relinquish direct vengeance, accepting the market's justice. The market's rules provide the persistent constraint that shapes her method.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme (inherited debts, the cost of closure, trust as fragile architecture) emerges from action rather than statement. The watch fob shifts meaning across beats—heirloom to bait to talisman—charging the final image. "Some debts weren't meant to be paid in coin" risks platitude but is anchored by prior specifics. The ending offers non-literal answer: she captures the sound but must live with it, reweighting the opening hunt. Minor slip: "She'd made her peace with the breaking" edges toward summary where image alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lena with consistent perceptual signature (notices edges, weight, quiet). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("syrup-thick murmur," "feather on the scale"). Dialogue carries subtext and pursues goals effectively in the confrontation. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under pressure. Two slips: "curiously steadfast gaze" is told attribution rather than shown behavior, and "the exact pitch of a man realizing he'd been outplayed" over-explains what the scene dramatizes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively and information density is high in action beats. Figurative language is controlled ("like a noose," "the first crack in the ice") and serves pressure. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "sound of trust breaking" is restated across three separate paragraphs without added nuance, and "Papa had taken the deal. / Now Lena knew why" is immediately followed by near-restatement. Template cadence in the closing: "She didn't need... She'd carry it... She'd made her peace..." Stack of declarative "she" stems flattens momentum in the final paragraph. No artifacts touch closure image itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise (avenging father's betrayal at underground market) follows familiar noir-revenge architecture, but the "sound of trust breaking" as literal hunt objective and the pirate-market truce rules add fresh specificity. The false-starts method and market-justice resolution avoid cliché execution. Veyne's exposure through his own greed is earned rather than convenient. The watch fob as silent/broken timepiece gains thematic charge. Transformation is present but the emotional template (bereaved daughter, calculating trap, walking away) remains recognizably conventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena appears in setup, drives the middle trap-laying through calculated choices (offering routes, deploying the ledger/map/name), and her laugh triggers Veyne's realization. Her decision to walk away rather than use the knife crystallizes the ending. Removing her exact role—moonshine runner's daughter with inherited routes and debts—would break the causality of her access and leverage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in beat one (crouched, clutching it), beat two (dangles between them "like a noose" during confrontation), and beat three (tucked back, "silent weight"). It carries inherited meaning and charges the closure image. However, its causal role is moderate: it signals her identity and loss but does not constrain her tactics or alter Veyne's response—she could deploy the same trap without it. The "don't tick no more" exchange adds thematic weight but not plot pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Truce of hush" is setup early (Papa's deal: "run one last load... no questions asked"), shapes Lena's understanding of the betrayal, and becomes the lever in the climax—"you broke a truce of hush, you answered to the tide." The market's enforcement of this rule provides the mechanism for resolution. Removing the concept would require a different justice system and betrayal framework; the specific broken-silence code is weight-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" appears once as label in paragraph six ("her curiously steadfast gaze making men assume she was either fearless or foolish. She was neither"). It sets up her calculated demeanor but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—her steadfastness is told rather than tested under pressure. The trait could be inferred from her actions without the label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Thwart" drives the core plot: Lena's goal is to thwart Veyne, her tactics (false starts, the laugh, the refusal) execute the thwarting, and the climax hinges on his exposure. The action is causally central and irreplaceable at this scale. A minor friction: the market's enforcement does some of the thwarting work off-page ("By sunrise, the harbor would take what it was owed"), slightly diffusing her agency at the resolution beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"False starts" are signaled in setup ("She'd come armed with false starts"), detailed in the middle beat ("a ledger of fake debts, a map to a cache that didn't exist, the name of a rival"), and their cumulative effect—tipping him "toward the edge"—enables the laugh that cracks his confidence. The method is specific, causal, and shapes her approach across beats. Removing it would require a different trap architecture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pirate market is anchored early (paragraph five), provides the rule-set that enables resolution ("you broke a truce of hush, you answered to the tide"), and the physical space (Veyne's stall, proximity for the whisper) enables the confrontation choreography. The "beneath the pier" detail adds constraint—it's hidden, governed by older codes. The setting is functional and drives the ending mechanism, though the rotting-pier imagery itself is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is setup in the title concept, invoked at closure ("By sunrise, the harbor would take what it was owed"), and the dawn image bookends the piece ("the first hint of dawn," "pale morning"). However, the timeframe does not visibly tighten Lena's tactics—she does not race a clock or alter her approach due to time pressure. It functions more as atmospheric frame than constraint, though the symbolic closure at dawn adds thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "capture the sound of trust breaking" is setup early (paragraph three), pursued through observation of Veyne's tells (paragraph nine), achieved at the laugh ("That was it—the moment"), and integrated into closure ("She'd carry it like the fob"). The hunt structures her tactics and the captured sound becomes the cost she must live with, providing both goal and price. The motivation is specific, dramatized across beats, and shapes the ending's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" modulates across the piece: the pier "groaned," market "hummed," Lena moves through "shadow" and quiet calculation, Veyne's "syrup-thick murmur" carries threat, and the ending mixes relief ("sigh of relief," cigarette, "finally rest") with the burden of carrying the sound. The tone supports pressure without tipping into pure dread or comfort. The final image—smoke curling "like a question no one needed to answer"—sustains the unease within rest, charging closure effectively.</comment>
