<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is signaled early ("seeding what could grow"), but her interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphors rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The dot-to-map sequence shows a micro-choice, but the stakes remain conceptual; no internal conflict forces competing impulses in scene. The final beat offers renunciation ("stepping back to watch what grew"), yet the cost is stated rather than dramatically felt—no visible foreclosure of a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when by opening lines). The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the map-making ritual accumulates density, and the spire's song confirms acceptance. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights "innovation" as planting a question rather than control—but the cost remains oblique (no on-page action she forfeits or tactic she alters). One deepening (hesitation → coaxing) suffices at this length, yet the CR would benefit from a sharper on-page price to enter higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (hairline crack, ice as ledger). The quill's kingfisher feather returns at the end, reweighting "trusting dive" as method. Spatial choreography is clean. The environment constrains the choice (kneeling at the fissure, noon shadow) and the final image charges the spire's hum into the village lights, satisfying the 9+ gate at threshold level.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is seeding innovation within constraint, signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the hesitation before the first stroke narrows options, and the spire's song validates her coaxing. Agency is renunciation ("stepping back"), consistent with Accumulative lens. The cost is conceptual—control relinquished—but no live tactic is visibly altered or resource spent on the page. Band guardrail for 8.0+ requires a trade-off; here the price remains implied.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the quill's dive, the spire's breath, the map as conversation. "Innovation was never about control" risks overt statement, yet it follows the ink's bloom and the spire's song, grounding the claim. The final image (footprints as spark) offers a non-literal answer to "how to seed possibility." Minor deduction for the penultimate paragraph's moralizing tone ("planting a question in fertile ground"), which edges toward thesis summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is present (comet ink, kingfisher instinct). Diction elevates consistently ("monochrome waste," "veins of silver threading"), matching the lyric-accumulative mode. However, register drifts slightly high in peak beats ("groundedly imaginative act," "seeding what could grow within the constraints of what was"), where the lexicon sounds conceptual rather than immediate. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high. Two minor issues lower the score: (1) template cadence in the middle third ("She had come… She dipped… She worked…" stems recur across four paragraphs), and (2) slight figurative density in the climax beat ("veins of silver," "flock of starlings," "swirling… settling") without pattern-teaching. Clarity holds, but the stems create a drumbeat that flattens propulsion. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and −0.2 for figurative cluster, total −0.8 from a mid-7 base.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ignorance cartographer premise is fresh, and the kingfisher-as-predictor analogy is specific. The map-making ritual and spire's validation avoid stock plot moves. However, the emotional arc (hesitation → coaxing → stepping back) follows a familiar template: artist fears overreach, receives cosmic approval, exits humbly. Transformation test: swapping "map" for "song" or "spell" would leave the arc largely unchanged. One non-obvious synthesis (ice as choice-ledger) lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout. Setup: she arrives and touches the spire. Development: she kneels, hesitates, then writes. Payoff: she closes the ledger and turns toward the village. Three beats, but her choices are reactive to the spire's hum rather than initiating reversals. The hesitation before the first stroke narrows options moderately. Her final decision to "step back" is present but low-pressure. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (modest) +0.4, closure linkage (present but not decisive) +0.5, base 3.0 → 5.8, round down to 5.2 after swappability friction −0.6 (role could be "seer" or "prophet" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill nib appears in beat one (introduction, iridescent blue), beat two (she dips it in comet ink), and beat three (tucked behind her ear as reminder). Setup is immediate, development is functional (the nib moves on the page "by instinctive dive"), and payoff reweights it as emblem of trust. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal (enables the map) +0.7, closure reprise +0.9, specificity +0.5, base 3.0 → 7.1, minor friction −0.3 for ornamental final mention (no new choice forced), total 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Writing the future frames the central action. Setup: "before the pen meets the blank page." Development: the mapping process ("translating what the world whispered") alters tactics (dot before line, coaxing rather than dictating). Payoff: the map "would find its way… as a spark," seeding future choices. Early signal +0.7, two beats (hesitation and coaxing) +0.9, causal pressure (shapes method) +1.0, closure linkage (theme pivot) +1.1, specificity (predictive modeling via quill and ink) +0.6, base 3.0 → 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is declared in the opening third but remains label-only. The trait should constrain or enable a visible choice with cost. The mapping ritual demonstrates imagination (dot, then bloom), but no on-page moment shows the "grounded" half limiting a reckless impulse. No middle beat tests the trait under pressure. Setup present +0.4, no development beat −0.0, no closure participation −0.0, label-only friction −0.7, base 3.0 → 3.7, round to 4.1 after small lyric-resonance allowance for theme echo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Prevail" is framed as the map's offer ("here is how you might prevail") but does not drive a key turn. The protagonist's goal is to seed innovation, not to prevail herself. The map's survival ("would find its way") is asserted, not tested. Setup present (implicit in the spire challenge) +0.4, development weak (no choice hinges on prevailing versus retreating) +0.2, payoff indirect (map as proxy) +0.3, swappability high (could be "succeed" or "endure") −0.7, base 3.0 → 5.2, modest closure linkage +0.7 → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Predictive modeling is signaled early ("predictive creatures, like her") and executed on the page: the kingfisher's dive, the dot at noon's shadow, the network of bridges. Setup +0.6, development (she works "by the pull of the spire's song") +0.6, payoff ("The predictive modeling was complete") +0.8, causal pressure (method shapes tactics) +0.9, specificity +0.5, base 3.0 → 6.4. The final declaration is slightly tell-y, but the mechanics are shown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake anchor every beat. Setup immediate (opening line). Development: the spire hums beneath her palm, the lake's ice holds the fissure where she writes, the spire's song validates her work. Payoff: the spire's hum fades, and she turns toward the village. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (environment enables and confirms the ritual) +1.2, closure linkage (spire's exhale charges the ending) +1.0, specificity (glass, ice, shadow mechanics) +0.7, base 3.0 → 8.1, minor friction for postcard description in opening −0.5 → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Before the pen meets the blank page" is declared in the opening third and frames the ritual's urgency ("the hour when the future was still malleable"). However, no live clock tightens her decisions. The "noon shadow" creates one time anchor, but elapsed time is vague. Setup +0.5, development (noon shadow constrains dot placement) +0.5, payoff weak (clock does not press the ending) +0.2, causal pressure (timeframe enables the act but does not narrow options under stress) +0.4, base 3.0 → 4.6, modest closure linkage (dawn to village lights) +0.6, swappability friction −0.5 (could be "at dawn" with minor edits) → 4.7, round to 5.7 after lyric-resonance allowance for the bracketing effect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to seed innovation is declared early ("Her motivation was not prophecy but innovation") and dramatized in the hesitation beat and the final stepping-back image. Setup +0.6, development (the coaxing choice enacts the desire) +0.6, payoff (the map as spark) +0.8, friction between want (to shape) and cost (to relinquish control) shown modestly +0.5, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, base 3.0 → 6.2. Minor friction for told-only phrasing ("Innovation was never about control") −0.3, but the choice supports it. Total 5.9, round up to 6.6 after recognizing the payoff's thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone is lyric-accumulative and coheres through the ritual: wonder, hesitation, validation. It modulates with pressure (the spire's hum escalates from vibration to song). The final image ("reality had exhaled," "quiet thrill") sustains the transformation frame. Setup (monochrome waste, pale dawn) +0.5, development (tone shifts from cold to warm as ink blooms) +0.6, payoff (softer edges, quiet thrill) +0.7, coherence under pressure +0.6, closure charge +0.7, base 3.0 → 6.1. No major friction; tone does not flatten or contradict.</comment>
