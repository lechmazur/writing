<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lior's interior life is textured with embodied sensation (parasol tip digging into palm, bones humming), and the ice-crossing beat demonstrates agency under pressure. The grandmother's initials reveal (*Endings Matter*) lands as convenient epiphany rather than earned realization—it's ungrounded in prior dramatized struggle and reads as authorial convenience. The cancellation decision lacks visible cost or trade-off on the page; we're told she postpones but don't see what she forfeits or confronts internally at that pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: silence → ice-crossing → laugh → initials discovery → cancellation forms a pattern of reweighting. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (stance shift toward "slow unraveling"), and the final image ("space between breaths") charges prior material. The initials twist feels planted rather than causally inevitable—it arrives to solve rather than complicate, weakening the earned quality of her reversal. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph; one meaningful deepening (ice-crossing forces the laugh) tightens her relationship to endings.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina, groaning hull, jagged canal, and parasol tip as divining rod all ground the piece in tactile immediacy and constrain the ice-crossing choice. The village, trawler galley, and fjord are filtered through Lior's attention (silver glinting, salt and rain scent). The parasol tip returns in the final beat, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography across the ice crack is clear and the frozen setting pressures her test of solidity versus fragility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to proceed with the clinic appointment—is signaled early and tightens through the ice-crossing beat, which narrows her stance from "learning endings" to risking connection. The laugh is a meaningful micro-turn. However, the cancellation itself happens off-page between paragraphs without visible trade-off or friction; we're told the reason ("wrong kind of ending") but don't see her weigh what she loses by staying. One on-page tightening (ice-crossing) plus one told pivot limits escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—solace as "the space between breaths" rather than chased resolution—emerges through the ice-crossing, the dog's nuzzle, and the final fjord image without overt moralizing. The parasol-tip initials (*Endings Matter*) veer close to Thematic Echo, offering a thesis-like reframe, though it's indirect enough to avoid heavy penalty. The final image ("fold in patience where you learned to stay") resonates but edges toward abstraction. The piece resists tidy closure and commits to ambiguity, earning its quiet ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is concrete ("ice pressed against eardrums," "grip on reality loose," "bones humming"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific (e.g., "trawling for meaning," "room she'd outgrown"). The laugh startles *her*, not the reader—good internal distance calibration. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Purposeful compression in the time-ellipsis between cancellation and final morning maintains coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high (heirloom detail, false-name sign-up, clinic booking compressed efficiently). However, two paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "she didn't tell them she was a euthanasia tourist, that she'd booked a slot... that she was here to learn" restates the same fact; "not because she was afraid, but because" is template phrasing. The initials discovery beat (*E.M.* → *Endings Matter*) stretches plausibility and reads as authorial nudge rather than organic find. No major figurative muddle, but "fold in patience" in the final line verges on abstraction without concrete anchor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—euthanasia tourist finds reason to postpone through disaster-relief volunteering and an ice-crossing test—synthesizes familiar redemption-through-service and threshold-crossing beats without sharp transformation. The ice-walking, parasol tip as divining rod, and dog rescue offer textural freshness, but the arc (despair → small act of courage → epiphany → life-affirmation) follows a well-worn template. The initials reveal is convenient rather than inevitable. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes at a solid level, yet the emotional calculus and final reweighting feel familiar rather than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lior's status as euthanasia tourist frames the dominant stake (clinic cancellation) and is signaled early. The ice-crossing choice is causally linked to her learning "the sound of approaching endings," and the cancellation decision grows from that test. However, the cancellation itself happens off-page as summary; we don't see her wrestle with the choice in scene. Setup strong, middle involved, closure participation present but told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Parasol tip appears in three distinct beats: opening (digging into palm, tracing pattern), ice-crossing (testing thickness, divining rod, dog sniffs it), and final morning (tucked in pocket as talisman). It constrains the ice-test choice and charges the closure image. The initials discovery (*E.M.*) reweights its meaning but feels convenient rather than inevitable. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named explicitly only in the final paragraph as thematic summary rather than dramatized on-page through choices. The ice-crossing demonstrates patience under pressure, but the concept doesn't shape tactics or narrow options—it's applied retroactively as interpretive frame. Present thematically but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated early and demonstrated in the ice-crossing ("moved as if the ice were solid ground"). This trait enables the risk-taking but doesn't impose visible cost or constraint—it's portrayed as pure asset. Label is followed by one illustrative action, but no trade-off emerges. Functional but one-dimensional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Trawling (both literal disaster-relief work and metaphorical search for meaning) is signaled early, frames her volunteer role, and motivates her presence at the marina. The ice-crossing and final realization ("trawling for the wrong kind of ending") both key off this action. However, the disaster-relief work itself remains backdrop; we don't see her bandaging or listening to stories in scene. Two-gate participation (setup strong, closure reweighted) with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is named and provides social context (villagers, child, fishermen's stories) but its mechanics never constrain a choice. We're told she bandaged frostbitten fingers and listened to stories, but those actions don't appear on the page or shape the ice-crossing decision. Setup present, no middle development, closure absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is anchored early (groaning hull, frozen plates shifting) and directly generates the central complication (overnight ice-split, jagged canal). The ice's thickness and the gap between marina and shore constrain the crossing choice and supply the test that triggers the laugh. Setting returns in the final beat (thawing fjord) and charges the closure image. Strong three-gate integration with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" is noted in the opening ("bones humming with the same quiet frequency as the ice") but the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions. The piece spans three weeks backward, one morning forward, then an unspecified "last morning." Time is loose rather than live; no countdown or clock pressures tactics. Present as marker, absent as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated explicitly and motivates the clinic booking and volunteer work. The ice-crossing dramatizes a confrontation with ending (testing fragility), and the final realization reweights this desire ("slow unraveling"). However, the shift from death-seeking to life-affirming happens between paragraphs as summary rather than through on-page friction. Setup and closure strong; middle development told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Windborne solace is embodied in the opening silence, the laugh that "belonged to someone who still expected good things," and the final image ("scent of salt and distant rain," "space between breaths"). Tone modulates from held-breath pressure to release without tipping into sentimentality. The "door closing softly" in the final beat harmonizes with solace rather than dread. Coherent through turns and charges the closure image, though the abstraction in the final line ("fold in patience") slightly diffuses specificity.</comment>
