<question>1</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Elias's affliction (skin paling, joints stiffening near dishonesty) is vividly embodied and constrains his choices throughout. His decision to write ungilded truth at the end demonstrates earned change, though the interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("his throat tightened" repeats as a go-to emotional cue). The final renunciation—not opening the new fragment—feels motivated by the Archive journey, but the visible cost could land more concretely on the page rather than being implied through metaphor.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The story follows a clear causal chain: fragment → map assembly → Archive descent → writing truth → refusal to gild. Orientation anchors (Veridion, greenhouse domes, Elias's studio) arrive early and remain stable. The closure—Elias choosing not to gild and refusing the new fragment—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost (the hollow desk, empty inkwell, decision to "begin again" without his former craft). One small slip: the zinc plate's "etchings worn away" reads slightly convenient, as if the map consumed itself to manufacture symbolic closure rather than earning it through Elias's agency.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse domes, toxic sky, and underground Archive are rendered with precise, pressure-laden detail: "air smelled of damp earth and something older—like the first breath after a long-held scream." The zinc plate's physical warmth and sharp edges constrain Elias's handling across multiple beats. Spatial choreography (studio → postal chute → tunnel → cavern → pedestal → studio) tracks cleanly. The setting charges the final image: the groaning domes contrast with Elias's lighter breath, making the cost of honesty tangible.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue gilding truth or embrace raw candor—is signaled early and tightens through the map assembly, Archive discovery, and writing sequence. The pedestal's question ("What did you come to say?") deepens pressure by forcing articulation. However, the escalation feels somewhat linear rather than a true reversal or complication; the Archive grants permission rather than testing Elias's resolve against a counterpressure. The final choice (not opening the new fragment) forecloses his old craft with felt cost, meeting the length's requirement for one meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The theme—truth's cost and the burden of unsent candor—emerges through concrete particulars: the Archive's suspended letters, the zinc plate as key, the choice to let words bleed. The final image ("some messages weren't meant to be read—only written") reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to whether honesty can be controlled. The gilded-leaf motif recurs with purpose, constraining Elias's earlier choices and being renounced at closure. Minor slip: "some truths were seeds" in the Archive leans slightly abstract, though the surrounding action grounds it.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Single POV (Elias) remains stable throughout. Voice is consistent and textured: "blisters under a sky choked with copper haze," "air itself had turned to brine." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the Archive sequence. One friction: the narration occasionally over-explains what the dramatization has shown ("He couldn't lie. Not even in the polite, necessary ways"), and a few filter phrases ("his throat tightened") recur without variation. The final paragraph's shift to declarative simplicity ("He didn't open it") effectively signals change in stance.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong imagery: "letters...curling like dying petals," "words bleed." Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Two friction points lower the score: (1) minor paraphrase loops ("He wrote until his ink ran dry, until the letters around him stilled" repeats structure without added pressure), and (2) a few figurative constructions stack without breathing room ("blisters," "choked," "poison," "brine" cluster in the opening paragraph). Sentence variety and rhythm support urgency, and no grammatical errors appear.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The combination of a truth-bound calligrapher, a shredded postal map, and an Archive of undelivered honesty is specific and non-obvious. The piece avoids stock epiphany templates by grounding the turn in physical action (writing, relinquishing gilding) rather than declaration. The ending's choice—refusing to read new messages, only to write—offers a fresh inflection on redemption arcs. Minor deduction: the "letters as seeds" and "toxic sky" imagery occasionally drift toward familiar genre markers (post-apocalyptic decay, symbolic vegetation) without fully transforming them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Elias's choices drive every major turn: assembling the map, descending into the Archive, writing without gilding, refusing the new fragment. His affliction constrains tactics (he must avoid dishonesty), and his profession (calligrapher) charges the final renunciation. The character is present in setup, middle, and closure with visible costs tied to his decisions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The zinc plate fragment appears in four beats: slipped under door, used to anchor the map assembly, pressed to the pedestal (triggering the letters' chorus), and returned smooth (etchings worn away). Its jagged edges, warmth, and evolving state (sharp → warm → smooth) constrain handling and charge the closure image as a "key" whose lock was Elias's tongue. Strong causal work and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Candor shapes the dominant stake (gilding vs. raw truth) and drives the Archive's thematic pressure. The pedestal's question and Elias's choice to "let the words bleed" dramatize the concept. However, "in small moments" is less visible; the piece foregrounds large gestures (the Archive descent, the final renunciation) rather than micro-beats of everyday candor. The concept is present and causal but not always granular.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The affliction (skin paling, joints stiffening near dishonesty) is established early, embodied concretely, and constrains Elias's past choices (why he received the fragment, why he crafts gilded words). It is referenced in the opening and implicitly governs his avoidance of "the polite, necessary ways others did." Cost is visible: his profession exists to work around the trait. Setup and middle gates clear; closure participation is oblique (the trait enables the arc but isn't foregrounded in the final image).</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Reread" anchors two beats: Elias rereads the half-finished letter at the start and again at the end, this time choosing not to gild. The second rereading directly produces the story's final turn (letting words bleed, beginning again). The action is specific and irreplaceable at closure. However, it competes with "write" (the Archive sequence) as the more dominant action; "reread" serves as framing device rather than the engine of all major turns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The shredded map is found under floorboards, pieced together on Elias's desk with the zinc plate as anchor, and its assembly enables the entire descent sequence. The mechanics matter: jagged pieces, brittle paper, the process of fitting fragments. The method shapes middle tactics (the puzzle-solving) and is referenced at closure when the plate's etchings are "worn away—as if the map had only ever been a key." Setup, development, and payoff all clear with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The greenhouse city and toxic sky frame the entire narrative, anchor orientation, and provide the physical/atmospheric pressure that makes the Archive's underground refuge meaningful. The "greenhouse domes groaned under the weight of the toxic sky" returns in the penultimate paragraph, contrasting with Elias's lighter breath and charging the cost of his choice. The setting is present in setup and closure; middle use is lighter (the studio and Archive dominate). Strong closure linkage and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"After the oasis dries" is mentioned once in exposition and establishes the world's desperation (people dig for gold/water). It provides context for why the Archive matters and why Elias's honesty is costly in a world of scarcity. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions on the page; no clock or deadline forces Elias's hand. Present in setup, weak in development, absent in closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The desire to find where lost conversations go motivates Elias's entire journey: assembling the map, descending into the Archive, discovering the letters, and ultimately choosing to write truth without delivery. The motivation is dramatized through action (he "went at dusk," "squeezed inside," "began to write") and tested by the pedestal's question. Friction between desire and cost is visible (his craft is renounced). Setup, middle, and closure all engaged; strong causal pressure.</comment>
