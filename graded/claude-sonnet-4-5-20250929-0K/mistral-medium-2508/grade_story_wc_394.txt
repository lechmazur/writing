<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pip's steadily curious nature is embodied in concrete actions—prying the arrow free, testing new wing designs, leaping repeatedly despite crashes—but the motivation reads more as label than contradiction. The "yearning algorithm" concept and her dismissal of other gliders' warnings suggest internal conflict, yet no genuine competing impulse acts simultaneously in scene; she simply iterates. The final choice to leap again after the workshop collapses feels consistent but not earned by a visible trade-off with felt cost. The repeated crashes and modifications demonstrate endurance, but the piece never dramatizes a moment where curiosity conflicts with survival or doubt in a way that narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Pip, a cart glider), where (workshop above acid sea), and what (testing flight modifications) by the first two paragraphs; the ~120-word test passes. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated test-crash cycles, the kaleidoscope image reweights her approach, and the arrow tip's integration marks a shift. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"She was *conducting*" crystallizes a new relationship to flight, the workshop's collapse becomes "the first draft," and the final leap with the arrow melted into her chestplate reconfigures prior material. Cost is felt (the workshop destroyed, her body partly rebuilt with "two borrowed" fingers) and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening (from falling to conducting) is sufficient at this length, though the conceptual cost could be more undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating workshop, acid sea, kaleidoscope, and Pip's patchwork body are vivid and purpose-driven. The arrow tip and kaleidoscope constrain her choices—she peers into it for blueprint guidance, pries the arrow free to repurpose it, and the sea punishes failed attempts. Spatial choreography is clear (workbench, ceiling kaleidoscope, sea below, cliffside perch). The final image of her perched on ruins with "two borrowed" fingers grounds the ending in tactile consequence. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Pip's priorities (gears grinding approval, acid sea burping). The workshop's destruction alters the environment causally. Micro-setting (her own frame, the arrow tip) functions as constraint and charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—achieving flight that transcends falling—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens through repeated crash-test cycles and culminates when the new wings "listened" and she transitions from falling to conducting. The arrow tip's integration and the kaleidoscope's blueprint moment deepen her approach. Agency is visible in her decision to lash the arrow to her chestplate and leap despite the other gliders' warnings. Cost is legible: the workshop collapses, her body requires borrowed parts, and she must transliterate herself back together. However, the escalation reads more as iterative density increase than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible trade-off. The final leap after the workshop's destruction demonstrates commitment but doesn't dramatize a competing fear or sacrifice in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Pip's iterative pursuit of flight that "doesn't exist" and her transformation of failure into method. The "yearning algorithm" and "irreverent awe" avoid direct statement, instead embodied in her repeated leaps and the line "She called it the first draft." The kaleidoscope's fractured prophecy and the arrow tip as "compass for the already lost" layer meaning without overt symbolism. The bell that remains silent at the end—"Good. That meant there was still work to do"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: achievement is process, not destination. The final image of her leaping again after the crash reweights prior material (falling as conducting) without moralizing. The conceptual cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Pip throughout, with distinct perceptual signature—her focus on gears, joints, frequencies, and the workshop's "vibration." Diction is compressed and idiosyncratic ("cart glider," "yearning algorithm," "transliterate herself back together") without register drift. The prose modulates with pressure: short bursts during the flight sequence ("She wasn't falling. She was *conducting*.") contrast with the more contemplative opening. Free indirect style is clean. One slip: the final paragraph's "irreverent awe was just another word for *Tuesday*" breaks voice with a colloquial meta-joke that clashes with the established lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate ("groaning," "skimmed," "burped"). However, figurative language clusters in several beats without clear pattern-teaching: "rusted prayer," "fractured light spin stories," "unspooled the sky's seams," "conducting" (metaphor for flight). The kaleidoscope and arrow tip descriptions veer into elevated diction ("frequencies no ear had yet grown to hear") that strains clarity under pressure. Minor template cadence in the middle section: "She pried it free... She lashed the arrow... Then she kicked off." The final leap sequence is propulsive, but the overwriting in the kaleidoscope beat and the "irreverent awe" tag slightly dull momentum. No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of steampunk aesthetics (workshop, gears, brass) with the cart-glider protagonist and iterative design philosophy feels specific rather than generic. The "yearning algorithm" as framing device and the arrow tip as compass offer fresh angles on the inventor archetype. The transformation from falling to conducting is earned in hindsight through the kaleidoscope blueprint and arrow integration. However, the core premise—lone inventor iterating toward breakthrough against skeptical peers—is a familiar template. The acid sea, floating workshop, and "bell no one hears yet" add texture but don't fully transform the underlying arc. Emotional specificity in Pip's grin at the silent bell and her willingness to crash again elevates the execution. Risk-taking in the compressed, lyric style and the non-traditional closure (Charged Poise) adds ~+0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pip is present from the opening and her choices drive all key turns: peering into the kaleidoscope for blueprint guidance, prying the arrow free and lashing it to her chestplate, kicking off the workbench to test the new wings, and leaping again after the workshop collapses. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. She is causally active in at least three beats (kaleidoscope consultation, arrow integration, final leap). The closure image—her perched on ruins, grinning at the horizon—is shaped by her prior decisions. Cost is visible (workshop destroyed, body rebuilt with borrowed parts). However, the arrow's integration and the transition from falling to conducting feel more inevitable than chosen; no live competing option is dramatized. The specificity of her choices (lashing the arrow to chestplate) adds irreplaceability. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.4 = strong integration; swappability friction −0.5 (another inventor could follow similar arc); late dramatization of trade-off −0.3 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arrow tip is introduced early ("hunter's arrow tip lodged in her left wing-strut") and handled in at least three beats: initial description as souvenir, held to the light as "compass for the already lost," lashed to her chestplate where it "pulsed," glowed during the flight, and melted into her chestplate by dawn with its runes now part of her algorithm. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. It constrains her approach (she must pry it free, repurpose it) and charges the closure (melted into her, "recalculating"). The object's transformation (from lodged to integrated) is causally tied to her shift from falling to conducting. Specificity is high—obsidian, etched runes, "hunger"—and it could not be swapped without losing thematic resonance. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4 = strong case for upper 7s; minor swappability friction −0.4 (another relic could serve) = 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "yearning algorithm" is named twice ("core concept gnawing at her gears," "now part of her yearning algorithm, recalculating") and frames Pip's iterative process, but it remains more thematic echo than on-page constraint. The concept is setup (first third), absent in middle development, and returns at closure to name the recalculation. It does not visibly narrow options or enable a specific tactic; the mechanics of the algorithm are never dramatized. The closest causal link is the loop of *almost* that keeps her modifying her frame, but this is told rather than shown constraining a choice. The final mention charges the closure image slightly by naming the persistence, but the concept could be removed and the story's logic would hold with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.5, thematic resonance +0.3; label-only use −0.7, swappability −0.6, missing middle development (cap 3.4 waived by lyric reprise allowance) = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" is named twice ("her steadily curious nature had led her here," "against her steadily curious heart") but functions more as label than constraint. The trait motivates her presence in the workshop and her repeated leaps, but no on-page moment dramatizes curiosity creating a cost or trade-off. She adjusts the arrow, peers into the kaleidoscope, and leaps again—all consistent with curiosity—yet the trait is not tested against a competing impulse (caution, doubt, exhaustion) in a way that forces a visible choice. Setup present, middle development weak (trait enables but does not constrain), payoff is a label reprise without reweighting. Early signal +0.4, two beats (implicit) +0.6, causal pressure (weak) +0.3; label-only −0.8, no visible cost −0.5, swappability −0.6 (another trait like "persistent" or "inventive" could substitute) = 4.8. Missing middle development cap 3.4 waived by opening setup, but the weak dramatization limits upper range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Transliterate" appears three times: adjusting the arrow after trying to "transliterate gravity's rules," the kaleidoscope images that "transliterated her doubts into something sharper," and the closing promise to "transliterate herself back together." The action shapes two beats (kaleidoscope consultation yields blueprint, final self-repair frames persistence) and charges the closure by reframing crash-and-rebuild as method. However, the mechanics of transliteration remain metaphorical—what exactly is being converted and how? The concept could be swapped for "decode," "transform," or "rewrite" without structural loss. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, thematic charge +0.4; metaphorical vagueness −0.6, swappability −0.7, ornamental middle use −0.5 = 6.1. The lyric reprise elevates it past pure ornament.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope is bolted to the ceiling, Pip peers into it and cranks it to see "fractured light spin stories" and a blueprint for a wing that "pulled" air. This consultation enables the breakthrough (new wing design), meeting setup and middle development. The image of "fractured prophecy" recurs at closure to explain her skimming the sea. Setup +0.6, middle development (blueprint) +0.8, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage (weak—mentioned but not active) +0.5, specificity +0.4; late first use (appears after ~30%) −0.3, summary-only mechanics (we don't see her applying the blueprint on the page) −0.6, swappability (another vision tool could serve) −0.6 = 5.9. The mechanics matter in principle but are not fully dramatized in the build or test sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop is vividly present from the opening ("hung above the acid sea like a rusted prayer, its brass ribs groaning") and supplies resources (workbench, kaleidoscope, Vex's tools) that enable Pip's work. The acid sea punishes failed attempts and the workshop's collapse at the climax—chains snapping, structure tipping—creates immediate consequence and reframes wreckage as "the first draft." She perches on the ruins by dawn. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The floating structure and corrosive sea together constrain her attempts and pressure her tactics (repeated crashes, limited materials). The setting is irreplaceable—acid sea and floating platform define the stakes and closure image. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.8, cost +0.5 = strong case for ~7.6; no major frictions apply.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Throughout the evolution" is named once in the middle and frames the repeated crash-test cycles. The timeframe implies iterative progression (past crashes referenced, "by dawn" future anchor at close), but no live clock tightens decisions within the single night depicted. The piece compresses multiple prior attempts into the opening, then focuses on one breakthrough leap and the final morning. Setup is vague (past evolution told, not timed), middle development shows one night's work, and payoff jumps to dawn without tracking elapsed time during the flight or rebuild. The iterative structure shapes stakes (failure is normalized) but does not create urgency. Early framing +0.4, thematic contribution +0.5, closure anchor (dawn) +0.4; vague tracking −0.5, no tactical pressure from time −0.6, swappability (another duration frame could work) −0.5 = 5.5. The lyric allowance keeps it above ornamental, but the clock never constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to ring a bell no one hears yet" is introduced early (kaleidoscope's "bells that sang in frequencies no ear had yet grown to hear") and recurs at the climax ("the moment the air itself would ring a bell no one hears yet, a frequency that unspooled the sky's seams") and closure ("The bell was still silent. Good. That meant there was still work to do"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The desire drives her repeated leaps and frames the breakthrough as incomplete, charging the final image. However, the bell is more metaphor than dramatized goal—what would success look, sound, or feel like? The cost of pursuit is visible (crashes, rebuilt body, workshop destroyed), but the want itself is abstract. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.5; abstraction −0.6, told-only desire (no scene shows her yearning in conflict) −0.7, swappability (another impossible goal could substitute) −0.7 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Irreverent awe" is not named until the closing beat ("irreverent awe was just another word for *Tuesday*"), but the tone is embodied throughout: the workshop as "rusted prayer," Pip ignoring the other gliders' warnings, the acid sea's burp, her grin at the silent bell, and the repeated leaps despite crashes. The tone modulates from contemplative (kaleidoscope consultation) to propulsive (flight sequence) to wry (final leap and "Tuesday" line). Setup is implicit (opening voice), development is sustained across beats, and payoff names and charges the final image. The tone is coherent and supports the theme of persistence through failure. Embodied throughout +1.2, modulation under pressure +0.9, closure charge +1.0, specificity +0.5; late naming −0.2, final-line meta-joke slightly jars voice −0.4, swappability (another tone label could fit the same beats) −0.5 = 7.2. The execution is strong but the explicit naming in the tag undercuts the otherwise implicit embodiment.</comment>
