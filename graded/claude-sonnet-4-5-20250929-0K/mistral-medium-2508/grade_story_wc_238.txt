<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is established early and drives key choices, but her interior life often defaults to metaphor-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The relationship with Elias provides genuine pressure at the perfume-use beat and the final planting exchange, but the resolution arrives quickly after one major choice with limited on-page struggle. Elias's trembling hands and deflating-bellows exhalation offer physical specificity, yet emotional progression leans on declarative turns ("It hurts." / "Good.") that tell state more than they dramatize internal friction. The final mutual gesture—passing the shovel—earns the shift but could have been deepened by one more micro-choice that costs either character something visible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening lines; no penalty applies. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: perfume magic weaves through archive and orchard, building density until the final image of saplings and the humming pavement reweights the apology motif. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the trees fall, yet the earth and the characters remember the current, and the empty vial becomes a talisman of reconnection. Cost is visible—the orchard is destroyed, the apology required magical expenditure, and both characters must plant anew—but the final paragraph's explanatory framing ("She never told them…" / "Some metaphors were better left unsolved") partially externalizes what the prior image already conveyed, slightly diluting immediacy. One meaningful tightening occurs when the perfume's tendrils drag up "every unsent letter" and Elias admits pain, narrowing the path to mutual planting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive's "yellowed paper and old roses" scent anchors early, and the orchard's falling apple concretizes the stakes. The perfume bottle constrains Mara's method and charges the closure (the empty vial on Elias's desk), satisfying the 9+ gate for recurring-object integration. Spatial choreography is clear—back room, table, orchard outside, then dawn planting—and sensory detail (sharp green tang of sap, bitter unripe fruit) reflects urgency. Minor gap: the city's bulldozing plan and the archive's physical connection to the orchard remain slightly abstract; we never see equipment or officials, which would have sharpened the temporal pressure and grounded the threat in concrete proximity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is the overdue apology and the orchard's survival, signaled in the opening third. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara pours the perfume and its magic drags up "every unsent letter," forcing both characters into painful honesty ("It hurts" / "That means it's working"). The resolution—mutual planting—is earned by Mara's choice to step into the current and Elias's reciprocal touch of the tendril, with visible cost: the perfume is spent, the trees still fall, and both must begin again. Agency is clear, but the escalation is compact; a second micro-reversal (e.g., Elias initially refusing the bottle, then reconsidering when a tree shudders) would have added another pressure point and deepened the climb to closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—imperfect miracles, reconnection, and the value of gestures even when outcomes fail—emerges through the perfume's mechanics, the falling orchard, and the final saplings. The empty vial and the humming pavement offer a resonant, non-literal answer to whether apologies can repair harm: they can't undo damage, but they seed new growth. Subtext operates in Elias's deflating-bellows sigh and Mara's refusal to simply say sorry, letting the magic's cost speak instead. The final paragraph's explicit thematic gloss ("Some miracles don't need to be perfect. They just need to be true.") borders on moralizing; the image of saplings and pavement-hum already carried the weight, and the added commentary slightly over-articulates what was felt. No Thematic Echo penalty (the line occurs in a later-context aside, not peak closure), but it nudges the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature—metaphors as tools, the perfume bottle as extension of her craft—is consistent and voice-specific. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("You always did love your metaphors" / "Words are easy. This?"), carrying subtext and advancing plot. Rhythm modulates appropriately: short declaratives during the perfume's surge ("It hurts." / "Good."), longer descriptive cadences in the opening and closing frames. Minor slip: the final aside paragraphs ("Later, when the city asked…" / "She never told them…") shift into summary-explanatory mode, slightly loosening the tight third-limited texture that held through the main scene. The shift is brief and doesn't disrupt the core voice, but it introduces a reportorial distance that wasn't present earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and imagery is specific ("liquid twilight," "sharp, green tang of sap," "deflating bellows"). Information density is high in the perfume-use beat: each line advances both metaphor and physical action. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected in peak beats. Minor issues: The opening's "yellowed paper and old roses" is evocative but slightly stock; the phrase "thicker than perfume, something that shimmered" uses a weak "something" construction. The final paragraphs shift into summary-explanatory mode with multiple exposition sentences ("Later, when the city asked…" / "She never told them…" / "Elias called it…"), introducing scaffold that dilutes the closure image's immediacy. These artifacts don't obscure causality but do reduce propulsion in the final third, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The gossip-column exorcist with a perfume-bottle tool and metaphor-as-method premise is fresh and specific, not a template. The perfume's "current" mechanic—apologies carried like leaves in a river—offers a non-obvious synthesis of magic and emotional repair. The orchard-as-stakes provides concrete urgency, and the ending's mutual planting transforms the apology motif into forward action. The concept avoids derivative fantasy tropes by grounding magic in interpersonal cost and irreversible loss (trees still fall). Minor limitation: the perfume's mechanics and the "currents" metaphor, while vivid, remain somewhat abstract; one more concrete detail (e.g., how the tendrils physically feel to Elias, or what Mara sacrifices beyond the bottle's contents) would have sharpened the ingenuity and pushed the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's role as gossip-column exorcist frames her skillset (untangling curses, silver-tipped pen, perfume bottle) and motivates her arrival. Her key choices—bringing the bottle, pouring it, refusing to simply apologize verbally—drive the central beat and the mutual planting at closure. She appears in setup, middle (perfume use), and ending (planting). Her occupation's metaphor-as-method directly enables the reconnection magic, making her role indispensable to the closure. Slight swappability: another mediator archetype (ritual specialist, charm-worker) could fill similar beats with minor edits, but the "gossip-column" specificity and the bottled-apology mechanic are tightly knotted to her past accusation and her craft.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The perfume bottle is handled in setup (described, half-full of twilight liquid), the central beat (Mara pours it, tendrils emerge and weave through archive and orchard, spending its contents), and closure (the empty vial on Elias's desk as a talisman). Its unique property—carrying apologies "the way a river carries leaves"—directly enables the reconnection magic and shapes the middle turn. The bottle's emptiness at the end is a visible cost that alters the characters' future options (no second use) and charges the final image. Removing it would break the story's logic; no other object could perform its function without wholesale rewrite. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability justify high score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles is signaled early ("It's not a cure… It's a current. You have to meet it halfway") and governs the perfume's mechanics: the magic can't undo the accusation or save the orchard, but it reconnects Mara and Elias and seeds new saplings. The concept shapes stakes (the apology is costly and partial) and tactics (both must "step in" and endure pain). It appears in setup, middle (the perfume's use and the trees' fall), and closure (saplings grow fast, but the orchard is gone; the vial is empty). The final aside—"Some miracles don't need to be perfect. They just need to be true."—explicitly names the concept, which slightly reduces its subtlety but confirms its centrality. Strong integration across all beats and clear cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Advises through metaphors" is demonstrated in Mara's dialogue ("It's a current. You have to meet it halfway" / "It's the hush before the cutting") and Elias's observation ("You always did love your metaphors"). The trait constrains her method—she uses the perfume's symbolic mechanics rather than direct speech—and enables the central reconnection. It appears in setup and middle, but its cost is indirect: the metaphor-heavy approach frustrates Elias momentarily, yet he engages anyway. The trait is visible and consistent, but swappable with "uses ritual objects" or "speaks in riddles" with minor edits. Functional but not fully irreplaceable; the metaphors charge the tone but don't alter the plot's skeleton.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is the dominant action: Mara seeks to reconnect with Elias via apology, and the perfume's magic reconnects them to each other and the orchard to the earth's memory. The action is signaled early (Mara arrives to deliver the miracle), drives the middle beat (perfume tendrils weave through archive and orchard, forcing mutual honesty), and defines closure (they plant together, and the saplings reconnect to the lost trees). The final image—the orchard humming beneath pavement—literalizes reconnection as the story's culminating effect. Removing this action would collapse the plot; no other verb (e.g., "forgive," "heal") could replace it without rewriting the perfume's mechanics and the ending's metaphor. Strong causal role and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Induced currents" is the perfume's method, signaled early ("It's a current. You have to meet it halfway") and demonstrated in the middle beat when the poured drop spreads and rises in tendrils that coil around Elias's wrist and weave through the archive. The mechanics matter: the current drags up "every unsent letter" and forces pain, requiring both characters to step in rather than passively receiving a cure. The method shapes the central attempt and its cost. Slight abstraction: we see tendrils and warmth but not granular sensory detail of how the current feels beyond "warm as a pulse" and pain. The method is functional and specific, but one more concrete image (e.g., the current's texture, temperature shift, or sound) would have made it fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sheet music archive anchors the opening and provides the back room where Mara and Elias meet. Its atmosphere ("yellowed paper and old roses") sets tone, and the archive's connection to the orchard (Elias tried to save it by selling scores) motivates the conflict. The setting supplies the perfume's staging ground and the spatial choreography (table, shelves, walls, orchard outside). The archive's stacks of fugues and handwritten scores reflect Elias's work but don't directly constrain a choice in the middle. At closure, the archive fades; the final image shifts to the orchard and saplings. Functional and purposeful, but the archive itself (versus the orchard) doesn't shape the ending, limiting its causal reach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The orchard's impending demolition at dawn is signaled early ("the city planned to bulldoze at dawn") and tightens the timeframe: Mara and Elias must reconcile before the trees fall. The hush—"before the cutting"—is named and pressures the central beat ("This is the hush before the cutting. The last chance to say what matters"). The trees fall on-page during the closure sequence, and the dawn arrives as they plant. The ticking clock drives urgency and shapes the final image (new saplings grow where old trees stood). Time is tracked and its expiration has visible consequence (orchard destroyed), making it essential to the escalation and closure. Strong integration across setup, middle, and ending with clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's overdue apology is the dominant motivation, signaled in setup ("she'd accused him—publicly, recklessly") and dramatized in the middle when she brings the perfume as "a miracle. An imperfect one." The apology is conflicted: she refuses to "just say sorry" and instead uses the costly perfume, which drags up pain for both. The motivation shapes her choices (bringing the bottle, pouring it, offering to plant together) and faces friction (Elias's initial skepticism, the magic's cost). At closure, the apology is answered mutually through planting. The motivation is present in all three beats, drives causal pressure, and incurs visible cost (perfume spent, trees still fall). Strong integration with clear stakes and trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is coherent: the prose balances lyric imagery (liquid twilight, tendrils, humming orchard) with physical cost (trembling fingers, ragged breath, falling trees, shovel-passing). The tone modulates appropriately: dreamlike in the perfume's magic, blunt in the dialogue ("It hurts." / "Good."), elegiac at closure (saplings and pavement-hum). The tone charges the final image by holding tension between beauty (new growth) and loss (destroyed orchard). Minor slip: the final aside paragraphs ("Later, when the city asked…") shift into summary-explanatory mode that slightly loosens the grit, favoring ethereal reflection over immediate texture. The tone is purposeful and supports pressure, but the closing frame's distance prevents full integration.</comment>
