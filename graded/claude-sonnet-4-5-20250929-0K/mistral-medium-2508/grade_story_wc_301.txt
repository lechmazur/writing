<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is embodied through concrete actions—tracing maps, squeezing bellows, walking—and his interior state (fog vs. clarity, guilt over his sister) drives his journey without diagnosis-speak. The medication decision and move toward the bridge show contradictory impulses (method vs. grief, refusal vs. need) acting simultaneously. Minor slip: "daringly methodical" arrives as a sister's quote rather than demonstrated through on-page micro-choices under immediate pressure, though the walk and bellows handling support it. The ending choice (turning right) forecloses the mapped path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates graffiti fragments, map references, and bellows touches across two locations (station → bridge) with clear spatial and temporal anchors by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias moves from the station's reflective loop to the bridge, where squeezing the bellows and choosing to turn right crystallizes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: he forgoes the mapped route, accepts the cost of not looking back). Cost is legible in "turned right" after the graffiti's brave/sorry fork and "didn't look back." No causality breaks; the sister's letter and fire backstory anchor his guilt without stalling present pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The station's crumbling booth, peeling map, sagging roof, and ivy-choked platform ground early anchors (who/where/when clear by paragraph two). The bellows function as micro-setting: their patched leather, weight, and creak constrain Elias's movement and charge the bridge scene when he presses his forehead to them. The bridge pilings and dried riverbed supply the final spatial constraint that forces his turn. Sensory hierarchy reflects his chronicler lens (water stains, ink fading, cracked earth). The ivy "parting" at the end uses setting to validate his choice without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding self-forgiveness via the path the map doesn't show, signaled early through graffiti and the sister's absence. One meaningful tightening: stopping medication sharpens immediacy ("before he decided to start the medication again"), and walking to the bridge narrows options to brave/sorry (graffiti fork). At the bridge, squeezing the bellows and turning right is a protagonist-driven decision that forecloses the mapped route with felt cost (not yet forgiveness, but a beginning). No coincidence resolves; the path emerges from his refusal to look back. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through recurring objects (map, bellows, graffiti) that reweight his stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (self-forgiveness, complicity, the gap between maps and lived truth) emerges through the dried river, failed predictions, and graffiti wisdom without thesis statements. The sister's line "You mapped the rivers, but you never learned to swim in them" is a past letter, not a present sermon, and the bellows' "sound like a door opening" offers metaphor without declaration. The ending's "Not forgiveness. / Not yet. / But a beginning" resists tidy closure while the right turn and parting ivy deliver a resonant non-literal answer. Minor slip: "Some bridges don't cross water" borders on gnomic echo, though it's attributed to graffiti and pays off in the dried riverbed image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds tight to Elias's perceptual signature: chronicler detail (ink fading, water stains), proprioceptive awareness (joints protesting, boots crushing ivy), and a rhythm that compresses under pressure ("He didn't play. / Instead, he pressed his forehead..."). Diction stays consistent (stubbornness, betrayed, groaning tape) without register drift. No dialogue on the page, so no need to test voice distinction. Slight textural monotony in mid-section paragraph openings ("He'd taken," "He pressed," "He'd found"), but variety recovers in the bridge sequence. Filter verbs ("thought of," "wondered") are sparse and voice-motivated. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the bellows moment and the turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short fragments at the bridge: "Not forgiveness. / Not yet." alongside longer accumulative sentences earlier). Information density is high: most lines advance setting, character state, or graffiti motif. Minor loop: "The accordion bellows" re-described across three beats (cracked leather, tape, weight) without full transformation until the bridge; the repetition serves accumulation but risks redundancy. No figurative muddle; "old bruises" sky and "door opening" bellows remain clear. Sentence openings show variety (participial, subject-first, prepositional). One weak passive: "had been" in "had been both, once" could tighten to "was both, once." Proofreading clean; no tense slips or unclear antecedents.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The river-chronicler premise (drought, failed maps, graffiti wisdom in a station) synthesizes familiar redemption-journey material through specific occupation detail (stain reading, timetable analysis) and the bellows as physical anchor. The third-bridge graffiti fork (brave/sorry) and the ending's right turn offer a non-obvious inflection: forgiveness deferred, method (maps) renounced, current accepted. Risk: heavy reflection load and lyric pacing could flatten, but the piece teaches its pattern early (graffiti fragments, station catalog) and pays it off at closure. Transformation test mostly passes—swap "river" for another lost resource and the sister/fire/diversion guilt still holds, but the chronicler lens and map/land gap feel specific. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening (river chronicler by trade, stopped medication to know what's beneath the fog). Development: his observation of graffiti and map shape his walk to the bridge, though the middle beats are more reflective than decision-driven. Payoff: at the bridge he chooses to turn right rather than follow the map, a decision that alters tactics. Cost: visible in "didn't look back." The trait drives the walk and final turn but much of the middle is interior catalog rather than acute choice under pressure. Causal pressure +0.9, beat involvement (station decision to walk, bridge turn) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.5; late-middle reflection without immediate micro-choice −0.3, swappability (another guilt-driven seeker could make similar moves with edits) −0.4. Rounds to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: present paragraph three (cracked leather, yellowed tape, stubbornness). Development: Elias squeezes them twice at the station (not a tune, just breath; "would the station answer?"), carried to the bridge (weight uneven, tape groaning), and pressed to his forehead at the bridge (creaking, "sound like a door opening"). Payoff: the bellows moment precedes the turn, charging the closure image. The tape and cracked leather recur with evolving meaning (scar, burden, door), though the object's properties don't directly constrain the final choice—he doesn't play. Beat involvement +0.9 (three touches), closure linkage +1.0, early signal +0.6, specificity (tape patch, church basement origin) +0.5; not causally indispensable to the turn (he could decide without them) −0.6. Rounds to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph two (peeling map, faded ink, routes abandoned). Development: Elias presses his palm to the map (Blackthorn River location), and the graffiti references ("third bridge") link to map gaps. The map's failure (doesn't show the new banks, lies) frames his need to walk unmapped paths. Payoff: "the path the map didn't show" and turning right off the map. The concept shapes stakes (truth vs. falsehood, prediction failure) and the final choice rejects mapped routes. Beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure (map failure drives the walk) +1.0, early signal +0.6; some middle reflection is abstract rather than tactical −0.4, the map itself is static object after paragraph two (not revisited in hand) −0.7. Rounds to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph seven as sister's past description ("daringly methodical"). Development: the trait is claimed to structure his approach (years alluding to truth, chronicling) but not demonstrated through on-page micro-choices that pit daring against method under immediate pressure. Payoff: the walk to the bridge and right turn could read as daring (off-map) while the bellows ritual reads as methodical, but the link is inferential. No visible tradeoff where method costs daring or vice versa in a closure beat. Label-only in middle −0.6, late explicit mention (past midpoint, no friction dramatized before bridge) −0.5, lyric reprise (sister's voice → turn) +0.4, beat involvement (walk, turn) +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, swappability (another complex trait could fit) −0.5. Rounds to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph six ("years alluding to the truth in his chronicles—hinting at drought's causes... never named himself among the guilty"). Development: alluding shapes his past evasion and current need (graffiti as oblique truth, map lies). Payoff: the ending's choice is indirect—turning right rather than declaring forgiveness—embodying allusion as tactic. The action recurs conceptually (hinting, graffiti fragments, "a beginning" rather than resolution) and defines his method. Beat involvement +1.4 (past evasion, graffiti reading, bridge non-speech), causal pressure (evasion is the wound driving the walk) +1.2, closure linkage (ending's indirection mirrors alluding) +1.4, specificity +0.6; the action is conceptual rather than physical, reducing irreplaceability slightly −0.6, swappability (another evasion verb could fit) −0.4. Rounds to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph six (graffiti in locked women's lavatory: "The river remembers what you burned"). Development: three graffiti fragments guide his interpretation and the brave/sorry fork structures the bridge choice. Mechanics matter: the graffiti are found, read, and their aphoristic form supplies the path he follows. Payoff: "Some bridges don't cross water" half-erased line appears just before he steps forward; "the ivy parted" suggests external validation of graffiti wisdom. The method (bathroom wisdom) is signaled early and recurs, though it's passive reception rather than active decoding. Beat involvement +0.9 (three distinct quotes), early signal +0.7, causal pressure (fork informs turn) +1.0, closure linkage +0.9; the graffiti are found objects, not tools Elias manipulates, reducing agency slightly −0.5, swappability (any oracular fragments could serve) −0.6, summary-only for the lavatory discovery −0.3. Rounds to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one (last train decades ago, rusted tracks, ivy) and continued through paragraphs two–five (crumbling booth, sagging roof, broken turnstile, platform swallowed by green). Development: the station's decay and ivy pressure Elias to leave before it's "claimed entirely," and the ivy's parting at the end validates his choice. The bridge (paragraph penultimate) supplies spatial constraint (pilings, dried trench) that forces the turn. Payoff: "the ivy parted for him" charges the final image with environmental response. Beat involvement +1.4 (station catalog, ivy threat, bridge geography, ivy parting), causal pressure (decay timeline tightens walk urgency) +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, early signal +0.8, specificity (crumbling booth, turnstile, pilings) +0.7; some catalog in middle (roof, graffiti walls) is atmospheric without immediate tactical constraint −0.5, slight swappability (another ruin could serve) −0.3. Rounds to 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph four (stopped medication three weeks ago). Development: the timeframe supplies urgency ("before he decided to start the medication again") and brackets the window for clarity. Payoff: the walk is "a day's walk" before rains come, and the ending's choice occurs before fog wins. Time tightens decisions moderately but isn't tracked beat-by-beat (no clock in station, bridge arrival unmarked by hour). Beat involvement +0.6 (medication mention, rains deadline, fog threat), causal pressure (clarity window narrows options) +0.8, closure linkage +0.7, early signal +0.6; vague "three weeks" and "day's walk" without on-page time passage tracking −0.6, the rains/fog deadline is mentioned once and not revisited at bridge −0.5, swappability (another health or resource deadline could serve) −0.4. Rounds to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph two (map press to Blackthorn River, last saw sister before argument/fire) and six (path to self-forgiveness). Development: guilt over failed prediction (flood, mill) and unspoken words drives the walk; graffiti brave/sorry fork externalizes the internal conflict. Payoff: "Not forgiveness. / Not yet. / But a beginning" and turning right toward sorry rather than away. The motivation is dramatized through concrete choices (walk, bellows press, turn) with friction between wanting clarity and fearing cost. Beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure (guilt is the wound forcing motion) +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost (forgiveness deferred, path unchosen visible) +0.6, early signal +0.7; some middle reflection tells guilt rather than enacting conflicted micro-choices −0.5, the sister remains off-page, reducing immediate relational friction −0.5. Rounds to 7.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Setup: opening tone mixes solace (ghost train, ivy) with raw (crumbling, rusted, patched tape). Development: tone modulates from reflective catalog (station) to embodied urgency (walk, "old bruises" sky) to quiet resolve (bellows press, turn). Payoff: "Not forgiveness. / Not yet. / But a beginning" and "didn't look back" deliver raw solace—comfort without erasure of cost. The tone charges the final image by balancing ache (map failure, sister loss) with forward motion (ivy parting). Coherence across turns +1.2, modulation under pressure +1.0, closure charge +1.4, specificity (cracked earth, groaning tape, damp stone scent mix solace and rawness) +0.8; some middle passages (graffiti catalog, backstory summary) flatten into exposition rather than tonal pressure −0.5, "raw solace" is inferential rather than unmistakable in every beat −0.4. Rounds to 7.5.</comment>
