<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("hush," "rewoven echoes") rather than concrete contradiction under pressure. His motivations—wanting to "change the beginning" and retrieve his father's name—register thematically but lack embodied cost or visible tradeoff when he performs the climactic act. The final choice (taking the name, descending) feels gestural rather than foreclosing a live option with felt consequence. Minor: "boy who cried wolf's son" premise seeds expectation but never pressures a lie/truth dilemma on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches a lyric-accumulative lens early (copperlight imagery, whispers, lattice transformations) and delivers Conceptual Repricing at closure: Elias claims "Nothing...just the light" becomes truth, reweighting his father's legacy. Cost is legible—he's now complicit in the deaths, carrying a secret the village won't believe—and the final return ("this time, it's yours") reconfigures his stance from retrieval to authorship. Orientation waived: lighthouse prison, reef, and dawn are anchored by line 2. One meaningful deepening occurs (lattice unfolds, name extracted). Slight lens waver mid-piece (causal climb mechanics coexist with textural drift) keeps this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and copperlight pulse anchor early and pressure Elias's climb (iron bars, cracked glass spiral, rusted gears). The lattice as micro-object constrains the ascent and charges the ending when it "knits itself back together." Sensory hierarchy (salt-thick voices, warm wood, cool pane) filters through urgency. The scuffs on the door and the gearworks recur with specificity, shaping both entry and the discovered bodies. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving his father's name to rewrite legacy—is signaled early and tightens once: lattice unfolds, Elias plucks the name with cost (complicity in deaths, warden's arrival). The reversal (claiming "Nothing" becomes truth) narrows his public options and charges the return. Pressure accumulates through whispers and copperlight flicker. Agency is present but the climb itself unfolds without visible tradeoff (stamina, injury, tool failure); the cost crystallizes only after extraction. One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length, but the lack of mid-climb friction or visible price (time, fatigue, discovery risk dramatized in action) keeps this from 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (inherited lies, authorship, truth's mutability) emerges through lattice mechanics and the "cry wolf" lineage without thesis statements. The copperlight-to-blue beam shift and the name's warmth ("stayed warm") charge the ending with non-literal resonance. Subtext operates in the warden/villagers' contrasting labels ("accident"/"curse"/"start") and Elias's grin. The final "this time, it's yours" invites reflection on complicity and recursive storytelling. Slight penalty: "hush" as concept is asserted more than dramatized, and "echoes could be rewoven" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression ("rusted needle in the throat of the sea"), elevated diction consistent with Elias's myth-steeped interior. POV remains stable third-limited. Dialogue (whispers, Elias's exchanges) carries subtext and goal pursuit. Minor friction: figurative density is high throughout ("knots that shouldn't hold but did, sustaining impossibilities") and occasionally stacks without grounding action, risking ornamentation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooms in at lattice touch, pulls back for aftermath). No head-hopping; filter verbs ("pressed," "whispered") fit the register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high in the climb sequence. Loop check flags minor paraphrase: "The lattice shuddered. The wood split—not broke, but *unfolded*" and "creaked...groaned" for the same object across close lines. Figurative language pervades peak beats (lattice unfolds into parchment-thin truth, copperlight pulse, scream frozen mid-breath) without always advancing causality, edging toward ornamentation. No fatal clarity breaks. Template-cadence note: several adjacent sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Elias [verb]" in the middle third; count ~4 instances over 6 lines, triggering −0.4. Closure image ("copperlight in his teeth") is vivid but the line-level density throughout leans decorative.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of confessional lattice, lighthouse prison, and inherited-liar premise is specific and non-obvious. The "cry wolf's son" angle transforms the trope by making truth the final lie. Copperlight-to-blue flicker and names-in-wood mechanics feel fresh. Risk: lyric compression and mosaic structure (before/noon/aftermath shards) heighten stakes without obscuring closure. Slight penalty: the "echoes could be rewoven" conceit and climactic name-extraction read as mildly adjacent to magical-confession or inherited-curse templates; transformation is present but not fully inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (the boy who cried wolf's son) is present throughout and drives the key choice (extracting the name, claiming "Nothing"). Setup: introduced line 2. Development: his climb and lattice interaction constrain mid-action. Payoff: his lie ("Nothing...just the light") and return with the name close the piece. However, the "cry wolf" lineage is seeded but never pressures a lie/truth dilemma in a choice beat; it operates thematically rather than forcing a tactical fork. Specificity moderate; could be "inheritor son" with minor edits. Two beats (climb choice, final claim) + closure linkage + early signal elevate; swappability and lack of cry-wolf friction on tactics lower.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lattice from confessional is handled across three beats: Elias carries it (warm from sin), presses it to the wall (it sticks), climbs using its gaps, witnesses its unfolding into names, and it knits back after. Setup: paragraph 3. Development: climb depends on lattice structure; unfolding reveals father's name. Payoff: lattice "never spoke again" but hums at return, shaping the recursive ending. Specificity high (confessional origin, gold veins, parchment-thin truth). Cost tied: the lattice's mechanics enable the theft and implicate Elias in the deaths. Early signal + three beats + closure charge + causal pressure + irreplaceability push high; slight friction from the ending cameo ("never spoke again") being summary rather than dramatized action prevents 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is named once (paragraph 6: "chasing *hush*—that rare, trembling silence between a held note and a scream"). Setup: first third. Development: the hush "came then, real and absolute" before name-extraction, but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. Payoff: absent from ending; the concept is fulfilled passively rather than shaping the final image. The warden calls Elias's need "madness," but Elias's goal is framed as "thread the labyrinth with his own story" (Q9 I), and hush operates as ambient goal rather than stake-altering pressure. Functional presence in one beat (pre-extraction pause) but replaceable; could be "silence" or "stillness." Two gates (setup, mid-touch) + lyric resonance in tone allow ~4.2; lack of closure linkage and causal role cap further rise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the lattice's knots (paragraph 4: "knots that shouldn't hold but did, sustaining impossibilities the way his father's stories had once sustained their village"). Setup: present. Development: the lattice does stick and hold Elias's weight, but the trait is label-only—no visible tradeoff (lattice nearly fails, forcing a choice) or cost tied to the impossibility on the page. Payoff: the lattice knits itself back, but "sustains impossibilities" is not invoked or reweighted at closure. Swappable with "magic" or "unnatural grip." One beat (climb hold) + setup meet two gates, allowing ~3.8; ornamental use and lack of closure role prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Hover" appears once as physical action: "hovering just shy of falling, just shy of belief" during the climb. Setup: mid-first-third. Development: the line captures Elias's literal climb state and thematic suspension (belief/disbelief), but does not drive a turn—he does not choose to hover or un-hover, and the next beat (whispers start) is not caused by hovering. Payoff: hovering is not reprised or reweighted at closure. The action is vivid but decorative; could be "clung" or "balanced" with no structural change. One beat + thematic coloring allow ~5.4; lack of causal role and closure linkage cap at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" is the method of entry. Setup: paragraph 5 ("The door...never locked, only left ajar, its scuffs worn smooth by decades of hesitant fingers"). Development: Elias slips through; the scuffs recur at exit ("scuffs on the door framing his exit like a wound"). Payoff: the ending notes "the door still ajar, the scuffs still waiting" when he returns. The scuffs do not constrain entry (door is open) or shape tactics (no lock-picking, no risk coded in the scuffs themselves), but they charge the exit image and prime the return. Early signal + two-beat reprise (entry, exit, return mention) + lyric charge allow ~6.1; lack of mechanical constraint or cost (the door is always open) prevents 7+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison off jagged reef pressures throughout: location anchors early (paragraph 1), the tower's verticality structures the climb, cracked glass spiral and gearworks supply the discovery site, the reef's teeth frame the stakes ("Below, the reef waited, teeth bared"), and copperlight beam mechanics (copper-to-blue flicker) charge the ending. Setup: immediate. Development: climb logistics, glass interaction, and bodies-in-gears depend on lighthouse architecture; the offshore isolation and "before dawn" timeframe create urgency. Payoff: beam flicker and reef's held breath close the piece. Early signal + three beats + closure charge + causal pressure + irreplaceability push to 8.2. Minor: the prison cells and warden are mentioned but not staged as obstacles, slightly reducing constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" (noon discovery) is announced early (paragraph 9: "first body would be found at noon") and reprised at ending ("bodies were found at noon, just as Elias knew they would be"). Setup: first third. Development: the ticking clock pressures Elias's ascent and exit ("for now, the air hummed with the weight of what hadn't happened yet"; "They were coming"). Payoff: noon discovery anchors the aftermath and Elias's complicity. The timeframe tightens one choice (descent speed) and primes the final irony (he returns despite knowing the cost). Early signal + two beats + closure linkage allow ~6.7; the clock is tracked but not shown altering multiple tactics (e.g., no moment where dawn light forces a choice or near-miss timing), preventing higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is named as Elias's motivation (paragraph 6: "thread the labyrinth of the tower with his own story"). Setup: first third. Development: the lattice interaction and name-extraction dramatize the goal, and the final "this time, it's yours" explicitly shifts from threading his story to offering others the same. Payoff: closure reconfigures the motive from retrieval to recursive authorship. Friction: the desire is told more than shown in conflicted micro-choices—Elias climbs and extracts without visible hesitation or want-versus-cost fork in action. Early signal + one key beat (name extraction) + closure charge allow ~6.3; lack of on-page friction (competing desire, doubt, second thought) prevents 7+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" governs tone throughout: the copper beam pulses at opening, copperlight paints Elias's shadow mid-climb, the beam flickers blue at closure, and "copperlight in his teeth" charges the final grin. The tone is lyric, deliberate, and layered with dread under surface calm (repose shadowed by bodies-to-come). Setup: immediate (paragraph 1). Development: copperlight recurs in lattice glow, the pre-extraction hush, and aftermath. Payoff: blue flicker and copperlight grin modulate the repose into charged inevitability. Tone modulates with pressure (shifts from slow pulse to flicker, from calm to grin) and charges the final image. Early signal + three beats + closure charge + tonal coherence push to 7.4; slight abstraction in "repose" (the word itself never appears on the page, inferred from cadence and imagery) prevents 8+.</comment>
