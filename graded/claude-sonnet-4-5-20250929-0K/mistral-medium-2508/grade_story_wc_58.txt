<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior is present but largely static: he observes, interprets, and concludes without genuine internal conflict or cost. The prince's brother exists only as an absence—no relationship friction or stakes test occurs on the page. The final decision to "board the next ship" arrives without prior contradiction or choice architecture that would make it feel earned rather than declared. Embodiment is thin; "the thread grew warm in his palm, pulsing like a heartbeat" and similar moments feel asserted rather than grounded in sensory particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (Elias, garden, post-departure city). The piece operates in an Accumulative/Textural mode: pressure accumulates through layered images (thread, garden, locket) toward a final assertion that "healing was not a place, but a direction." However, the closure unit is primarily told rather than shown—Elias's epiphany and the promise to tell the princess lack a decisive on-page moment with visible cost. The locket discovery functions as a beat but does not narrow options or alter Elias's trajectory; he was already writing the brother's story. Cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible in a final image or action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is vivid and purposefully atmospheric, with skeletal vines, weeping willow, and loam providing concrete anchors. The stone bench and willow charge the locket discovery, and the harbor returns at the end to frame Elias's next move. Spatial choreography is clean (garden corner, bench, harbor). However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—no environmental detail forces a choice or alters Elias's tactics. The garden waits passively rather than pressing him.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias chronicling the prince's absence to help the princess heal—is signaled early but never tested or complicated. No reversal occurs: Elias finds the locket, interprets it, and will deliver his conclusion without friction or trade-off. The piece declares escalation ("The thread grew warm… pulsing like a heartbeat") but the mechanics remain vague and cost-free. The final assertion that "he would be ready to board" introduces a new goal without prior setup or visible price. Pressure is asserted through metaphor rather than dramatized through narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—absences as explanations, healing as direction—emerges through recurring images (thread, ships, garden) and the premise of "obituaries for the living." However, the final paragraphs shift into overt thematic summary: "healing was not a place, but a direction," "some stories were not meant to be finished," and the catalog of metaphors (thread as compass, obituaries as maps) state rather than dramatize insight. The core concept of "explained absences" resonates but is told more than enacted. Subtext is present in the locket's smudged portrait, yet the ending leans heavily on articulated wisdom rather than a non-literal final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct textural signature: "the way a mother's voice cracked," "geography of healing," "cartographer of the spaces between departure and return." Perceptual filter remains stable throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-bound—Elias as an "obituary writer" would plausibly think in metaphor, yet phrases like "lonesome splendor" and "the kind that promised storms or revelations" feel slightly outside his lexicon under pressure. No dialogue present to assess. Free indirect style is clean; focalization does not leak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "sails swallowing the horizon like a sigh," "the sky was a bruise of violet and ash," "branches dragging the ground like fingers tracing a wound." While evocative, the metaphors occasionally mix registers or compete for attention, flattening momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "he would listen. He would write." and the catalog in the final third (thread as compass, obituaries as maps, garden as waiting). Several sentences in the closing section restate the same thematic content without advancing pressure. Template cadence is visible in parallel "Like the thread. / Like the tide." structures. Elevated diction persists in peak beats without clear POV motivation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—writing obituaries for the living to map grief's geography—offers a fresh angle and the occupation is specific. The thread as physical relic and narrative compass is a purposeful synthesis. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution follow a predictable template: the empathetic chronicler discovers an artifact, interprets absence as presence, and promises the bereaved that loss is not an ending. The final image of Elias walking to the harbor to board "not as a traveler, but as a cartographer" delivers a tidy metaphorical answer rather than a surprising or inevitable turn. Risk-taking is limited; the piece opts for lyricism over bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias (the traveler who writes obituaries for the living) is present throughout and his occupation frames the premise. He discovers the locket, interprets the prince's absence, and decides to board the next ship. However, his choices are largely observational and conclusory rather than pressure-tested. The decision to board appears in the final third without prior setup or visible cost. Two beats (locket discovery, harbor walk) involve him, but neither forces a trade-off or alters tactics under constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The palace carpet weft thread appears in the opening (Elias finds it in the garden), returns when he presses it to his lips, grows warm to guide him to the locket, and is pocketed. It recurs in the final section as "compass." Present across four beats with evolving use (discovery, intimate act, guidance, metaphor). However, the mechanics of how it "pulls" him remain vague, and its role at closure is metaphorical rather than causally active. Removing it would require rewriting the locket discovery, but the specific "weft thread" detail is not irreplaceable—any relic could function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The core concept (explained absences) is named early and shapes Elias's trade: "listen for the shape of absence," "chronicle her brother's disappearance… in the gaps between his last known steps." The locket's smudged portrait and the declaration "He stayed away because some absences are explanations" enact the concept. However, the concept operates more as theme than as a constraint on tactics—Elias does not struggle with how to "explain" absence or face a cost in doing so. It charges the premise but does not narrow his options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "vividly descriptive" is enacted in the prose itself (figurative density, sensory detail) and applied to the prince's portrait in the locket: "his face vividly descriptive in its defiance." The phrase is used once, descriptively, without constraining or enabling an action. It does not alter Elias's choice or impose a cost. Label-only use that gestures toward the story's textural mode but does not function causally.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The action "intimate" is dramatized when Elias presses the thread to his lips: "an intimate act, projecting presence where none remained." This moment occurs early (second third) and is framed as purposeful ritual. However, it does not drive a major turn—Elias continues to the locket discovery without the act altering his options or imposing visible cost. Swappable with another gesture (e.g., holding the thread to his chest) without structural impact. Present and thematically coherent but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The method "by projecting presence" is named once in the phrase "projecting presence where none remained" and implied in Elias's practice of writing "in the gaps between his last known steps." The mechanics are not shown—Elias does not demonstrate how he projects presence, nor does the method constrain his approach or generate friction. The thread guides him physically (warm pulse), but that mechanism is distinct from "projecting presence." Method is asserted rather than enacted or tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is anchored early and vividly rendered (skeletal vines, weeping willow, loam, stone bench). Elias kneels, finds the thread, follows it to the locket, and returns at the end to the idea that "the garden… would wait." Present across three beats (opening, locket discovery, closing metaphor). The setting provides atmosphere and a spatial anchor for the locket discovery, but it does not pressure Elias's choices—he could have found the locket anywhere. The garden functions as a charged location but not as a constraint or resource that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last ship sails" is established in the opening line and reprised in the closing: "long after the last ship had sailed." It creates a post-departure atmosphere and frames Elias's decision to board "the next ship." However, the time constraint does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page—Elias works at his own pace, and no clock presses him. The timeframe is more setting than active pressure. Present in framing but does not function as escalation or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the geography of healing" is named explicitly ("mapping the geography of healing") and shapes Elias's occupation and interpretive lens. He seeks to chronicle absence and tell the princess "that healing was not a place, but a direction." However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—Elias does not struggle with how to map healing or face a cost in pursuing it. The motivation frames his role but does not generate friction or a visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tone "lonesome splendor" is named once as the princess's phrase and enacted throughout: lyric, melancholic, elevated diction, vivid yet mournful imagery (sails swallowing the horizon, skeletal vines, bruised sky). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (quiet observation to warm pulse to declarative insight). However, the tone remains largely static in affect—lonesome splendor pervades without sharp contrast or breakdown under pressure. It charges the final image ("the wind still moved through the trees") but does not shift decisively to reconfigure meaning. Consistent and purposeful but not transformative at closure.</comment>
