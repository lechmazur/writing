<comment>Elias's interior landscape shows purposeful constraint—his "hunger... to shape the unseen" drives the seed-planting choice and the veil crossing—but the girl's sharp ribs and fading are told rather than embodied in micro-choices that reveal her stake. The protagonist's final departure carries visible cost (leaving the orchard, accepting "debt"), yet the villagers' sudden eye-shine and the children's instant recognition feel like emotional arithmetic rather than earned contradictory states. Interiority leans on stock metaphor ("calloused hands," "quiet, stubborn roots") without the perceptual signature that would lift it into high credibility.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph; the veil crossing teaches a permeable-worlds premise early enough to hold. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias departs, leaving the sapling and apple with conceptual cost: "debt" and the echo of loneliness), yet the cost remains abstract—no line specifies what Elias forfeits beyond his presence. The accumulative lens (density increase via the orchard blooming, children recognizing colors, saplings whisperId language of light) holds through the ending, but the final beat ("wonder was not something you kept") drifts into theme-statement rather than image-driven repricing.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The parapet, waterfall mist, and moss-slick stones function as micro-setting that enables the veil crossing; the apple's "colors no one had names for" charges the closure image by constraining the villagers' recognition. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (juice "thick, electric" on fingers during the succor beat), and the orchard's silver-leafed sapling anchors spatial consequence. Slight generic drift: "gnarled apple trees," "threadbare dress," and "firelight" lean toward stock texture rather than the perceptual filter that would distinguish Elias's professional eye from a catalog.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (preserve wonder's color) signals early and tightens when the seed "was not meant for soil"; the girl's fading and Elias's pruning-to-give choice narrow options with visible price (his departure, the debt acknowledged). The tightening is sufficient for the accumulative lens, yet the escalation curve flattens after the succor beat—Elias's final decision to leave "by dawn" occurs off-page, and the villagers' consumption of the apple feels coincidental rather than a protagonist-driven reversal. Cost at closure is conceptual (debt, loneliness echo) rather than the felt trade-off that would anchor higher bands.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Theme (wonder as passage, not possession) emerges through the seed's journey and the apple's shared shine, avoiding overt thesis until the final paragraph—but "wonder was not something you kept. It was something you passed through" articulates the moral rather than letting the sapling and whispering language embody it. The seed's return with reweighted meaning (girl clutching it, sapling sprouting) offers purposeful recurrence, yet the children's instant recognition and the villagers' silence feel like thematic convenience rather than earned irony. Subtext operates in "Some doors open inward" and the girl's "They fade here," but the closing aphorism ("They always do") undermines ambiguity with tidy certainty.</comment>

<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature shows in "every cut was a conversation," "capturing essence... in the curve of a branch," and the pruning knife "humming against his thigh." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the veil crossing, pulling back for the villagers' consumption), yet diction slips into elevated register at peaks—"insatiable craving to shape the unseen," "the quiet, radiant hush of what might grow"—that reads more authorial than the calloused pruner's lexicon. The girl's dialogue ("They fade here") carries naturalism, but her voice and Elias's converge in the closing whisper-language metaphor without distinct idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Information density is high in the veil-crossing and succor beats; "juice that bled onto his fingers was thick, electric" compresses sensation and consequence efficiently. Template cadence surfaces in adjacent lines: "The villagers would call it a miracle. / Elias would call it a debt. / That night..." and "The trees would not forget. / Neither would the girl." Paraphrase loop: "wonder was not something you kept" is restated as "passed through, like a knife through flesh, like a seed through soil" without added pressure. Figurative density in the final third ("echo of what it had touched," "quiet, radiant hush," "language made of light") stacks metaphor without concrete payoff, triggering −0.6 for patterned artifact in a closure beat and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The veil as permeable layer (not another place) and the seed "not meant for soil" offer fresh inflection on portal fantasy; the pruner's skill (capturing essence in branch angles) particularizes his method beyond stock "wise elder" framing. Yet the core arc—crossing to a fading realm, giving sustenance, returning transformed—follows a widely used template (mentor's sacrifice for a liminal child) without the non-obvious moral calculus or lived occupational detail that would transform it. The apple's unnamed colors and the children's instant recognition provide surface novelty but lack the irreversible cost or perceptual shift that would make the synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Elias's pruning knowledge frames expectation (intro), enables the succor choice (slicing fruit to paint the girl's wrists), and his departure decision alters the orchard's state (sapling, apple on windowsill). Present in all three gates with causal pressure in two beats and closure linkage via the apple's effect. Specific cost: leaving the orchard and accepting debt.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Seed handled in opening (pulsing in palm, "not meant for soil"), pressed into girl's palm mid-story with instruction to plant "where the veil is thin," and clutched to her chest at disappearance. Drives two beats (veil crossing trigger, girl's restoration path) and shapes closure indirectly (sapling sprouting "where none had been"). Early signal, two-beat involvement, causal enabler, irreplaceable (grandmother's heirloom with "doors open inward" rule).</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Veil crossing occurs on-page, the "another layer" mechanic is taught, and Elias's return with the sapling proves passage consequence. Shapes two beats (crossing in, emerging gasping) and participates in closure (sapling as proof of debt, villagers' eye-shine as carried wonder). Causal pressure: the veil "resisting just enough" signals cost. Not fully indispensable—mentor-sacrifice arc could function with a single realm—but the layered-world rule alters tactics (painting juice to restore edges).</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Labeled in opening ("insatiable craving to shape the unseen") and shown in mid-story choice (painting juice to "give" rather than take), but the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Elias's creativity enables success without friction. Present in setup and development, absent from closure participation (final departure reads as renunciation, not creative act). Swappable: "wisdom" or "compassion" could replace with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Succor (painting juice on girl's wrists to sharpen her edges) is the story's hinge: it dramatizes Elias's method, enacts the "give" reversal, and enables the girl's restoration and seed-planting mission. Present in development and indirectly in closure (sapling result, villagers' shine as carried succor). Causal pressure high, irreplaceability strong (no other action restores the girl), cost visible ("theft, a kindness with teeth"). Not in final image itself, capping upper reach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Signaled early ("capturing essence... in the curve of a branch, the angle of a cut") and enacted mid-story (slicing fruit, painting juice as essence transfer). Shapes one key beat (succor) and primes closure (villagers "ate it," eyes holding "impossible shine"). Mechanics matter: essence must be liquid, applied, and consumed. Not present in final image (saplings whispering is effect, not method), limiting closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Parapet's moss-slick stones and cleft enable veil crossing (one beat), waterfall's "breath gathered into shimmering veil" supplies the passage mechanism. Present in setup and development, absent from closure (ending focuses on orchard below, not parapet). Lyric reprise: waterfall's song "rose like a question" before Elias's departure, reweighting the site as invitation rather than threshold. Swappability moderate: any threshold near water could function, but "beside a waterfall" ties mist to veil visual.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Time anchored as "first light of spring" and "morning" when seed pulses; urgency implied by "its time had come" and "by dawn, he was gone." Does not tighten decisions—no countdown or competing deadline pressures Elias's crossing or departure. Present in setup, vague in development (no clock during veil sequence), and absent from closure participation (orchard "bloomed that year" is summary, not live time). Static mood marker rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Desire dramatized in Elias's lifelong work ("tending for half a century," "coaxing trees to hold the light"), tested when he sees fruit "dimmed" in the other layer, and enacted via succor (painting to restore color). Present in setup, development (one choice), and closure (apple's "colors no one had names for" as preserved wonder). Friction: leaving creates debt and loneliness echo, yet the cost reads conceptual rather than a felt trade-off between wants. Causal pressure sufficient for mid-band, specificity strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>Tone established early ("trembled," "whispered secret," "quiet defiance," "hush of budding hope") and sustained through veil crossing ("shimmering veil," "glowed like captured sunsets") and closure ("quiet, radiant hush," "saplings whispering... in a language made of light"). Modulates with pressure: urgency during succor beat tightens syntax, final paragraph returns to lyric hush. Charges final image via "radiant" and "whispering" cadence, though the consistency borders on static (no tonal break under peak stress). Coherent across turns, purposeful at closure.</comment>
