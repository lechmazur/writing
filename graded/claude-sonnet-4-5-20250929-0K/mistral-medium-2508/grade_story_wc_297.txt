<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's choices drive the narrative (entering the maze, pressing the clipping to her scar, running across the bridge), but her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. Phrases like "purposefully curious hands" and "dreams that had clawed at her ribs" feel more like atmospheric labels than lived internal conflict. The final transformation ("scars glowed, the pain transmuting into something like flight") asserts change without dramatizing the foreclosed path or visible cost that would earn it. Motivation remains coherent but lacks the micro-choices under pressure that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a single POV and teaches its lyric-accumulative pattern early (scars as compass, maze as loom). Closure arrives on the page: Liora becomes the covenant's keeper, her shadows no longer rooted, dreams intersecting with the world. However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—"the oldest scar had begun to bloom" suggests transformation but doesn't specify what path has been foreclosed or what tangible price she's paid. The encounter with future-Liora introduces a reversal ("You're early... not ready to be uneclipsed") that complicates but then resolves too smoothly. Under an Accumulative lens, the density increases and the final image reweights prior motifs, but the felt cost needed for high-band closure is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade, willow, and hedge maze are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (scent of damp earth and crushed violets, air thick with anxious elation). The maze's shifting paths and Liora's scars as navigation tools tie environment directly to choice and escalation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (kneeling at the dais, running across the root bridge). The glade's final exhalation and the silver leaf tucked behind Liora's ear charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge the final moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uneclipsing the covenant by finding the intersection—is signaled early and drives Liora's journey into the maze. Pressure tightens when her scars guide her inward and the chasm opens, forcing her to run across the bridge. The encounter with future-Liora introduces a reversal ("not ready"), but the resolution feels too accommodating: future-Liora simply gifts the insight, and Liora awakens with the sprouted clipping, her goal achieved without a clear trade-off. The ending reconfigures her state (shadows no longer rooted), but the cost of that transformation—what specific path or desire was foreclosed—remains abstract. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs, but the price lacks the on-page visibility needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the scars-as-maps motif and the idea that listening to past wounds enables future transformation. The maze as loom and the covenant as something "waiting for someone to heed the right echoes" avoid overt moralizing. However, future-Liora's line "The covenant was never broken, it was waiting" edges toward explicit thematic statement rather than letting the final image speak alone. The sprouted silver leaf and blooming scar offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, but the piece occasionally relies on prompt-adjacent phrasing ("intersection of dreams," "eclipsed covenant") that reads more like scaffolding than lived particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with a lyric, heightened register that suits the visionary protagonist. Perceptual signature is consistent (scars burning, dreams clawing, shadows rooted), though the diction occasionally drifts into decorative elevation ("voice like wind through reeds," "eyes two crescent moons") that privileges atmosphere over specificity. Future-Liora's dialogue carries subtext but stays within the established tone. The prose modulates under pressure (short bursts during the bridge run), and no head-hopping occurs. Minor filter-verb stacks ("pressed," "reached," "stepped") in high-pressure beats slightly dull immediacy but don't break distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense, but several patterns undercut momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "She wasn't just walking; she was heeding" restates content without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the opening third with repeated "Her [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("time's greedy mouth," "pain transmuting into something like flight") cluster in peak beats, and elevated diction ("anxious elation," "nautilus shell") occasionally clashes with urgency. The loop/scaffold debt and figurative muddle in high-pressure moments lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Clarity remains intact, preventing deeper penalties, but density and propulsion suffer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—scars as navigational tools, a maze that shifts, a covenant eclipsed by time—synthesizes familiar fantasy elements (visionary quests, hedge mazes, future echoes) without a transformative angle. The emotional arc (wounded seeker becomes keeper) follows a recognizable template. Specific details (cobalt glade, yew clipping, root bridge) add texture but don't fundamentally reframe the central conceit. The piece commits fully to its lyric register and earns coherence, yet the core turn—Liora meeting her future self and being told she's "the only one who ever listened"—feels more like validation than a non-obvious synthesis with hindsight inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora (root-bound visionary) is present throughout and makes key choices: entering the maze, pressing the clipping to her scar, running across the bridge, and tucking the silver leaf behind her ear at the end. Setup is immediate, middle beats involve active decisions under pressure, and the closure shows her transformed state. Her choices create the major turns, meeting all three gates and demonstrating causal pressure and closure linkage. The attribute "root-bound" is more metaphorical label than trait that constrains a visible choice, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The maze topiary clipping (twisted yew sprig) is handled in multiple beats: carried in her pocket, pressed to her wrist to trigger a vision, used as "a key turning in an invisible lock" during the bridge run, and reappears sprouted with a silver leaf at the end. Setup occurs early, middle beats show active use that enables tactics, and the closure image (silver leaf tucked behind her ear) reweights it. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, though the mechanics of how it "unlocks" remain slightly abstract, preventing the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant is the story's central concept, framing the quest and appearing in the opening, future-Liora's dialogue ("covenant isn't ready to be uneclipsed"), and the final line ("the eclipsed covenant had found its keeper"). It shapes the dominant stake throughout and participates in closure. However, the covenant's exact nature and what "uneclipsing" entails remain abstract; the concept functions more as thematic backdrop than a constraint that alters tactics in specific beats. Present across all three gates but more evoked than operationalized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" appears once as a descriptor for Liora's hands when she brushes the clipping. The trait is not shown constraining or enabling a choice elsewhere; it reads as momentary flavor rather than a characteristic that drives action or costs. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Heed" and "heeding" recur throughout: Liora has "heeded too late" in the past, she listens to the willow's whispers, her body becomes "a compass calibrated by every mistake," and future-Liora tells her she's "the only one who ever listened to the scars." The action shapes her navigation through the maze (heeding her scars' pull) and defines the resolution (becoming the keeper who listens). Setup is early, middle beats demonstrate the method in use, and closure hinges on her capacity to heed. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; swapping "heed" for a generic "follow" would weaken thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method—linking through scars—is signaled early (scars as maps, the maze "weaving fate from the threads of those who dared to link through their wounds") and demonstrated when Liora presses the clipping to her scar to receive a vision. Her scars burn and guide her through the maze, and the final image shows "the oldest scar had begun to bloom." The method shapes her attempts and is essential to the closure transformation. All three gates are met with clear causal involvement, though the exact mechanics of "linking" remain somewhat metaphorical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is present in the opening, where it "hummed with the weight of a future" and "pulsed with anxious elation." The glade's atmosphere (dusk bleeding into night, air thick with scent) supports tone and the willow serves as an anchor point. At closure, "the glade held its breath... in reverence." The setting supplies emotional texture but doesn't constrain a tactical choice in the way the maze does. Setup and closure participation are clear, but middle development is more atmospheric than action-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the future arrives early" is referenced in the opening ("a future that had already arrived") and the penultimate line ("The future had arrived early, but this time, she was ready"). The paradoxical time concept contributes to tone and the meeting with future-Liora, but it doesn't create a ticking clock or time pressure that alters Liora's tactics. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance, but missing concrete middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Liora's motivation—to find the intersection of dreams—is stated in the vision ("Find the intersection, or the covenant stays eclipsed") and resolved in the final paragraph ("her dreams finally intersecting with the world's"). The desire drives her entry into the maze and her run across the bridge. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized through conflicting wants; we see her pursue the goal but not wrestle with competing costs or fears that would create visible friction. Setup and closure are present; middle friction is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Anxious elation is named in the opening ("the glade pulsed with anxious elation") and echoed in the closure's reverent breath-holding. The tone modulates slightly during the bridge run (urgency) and the encounter with future-Liora (sadness and knowing), but the blend of anxiety and elation remains a consistent atmospheric layer rather than a dynamic charge that shifts with each beat. Coherent and present at key moments, though not as intensely variable under pressure as the highest scores require.</comment>
