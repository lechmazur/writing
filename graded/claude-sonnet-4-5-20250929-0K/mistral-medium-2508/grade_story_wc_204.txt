<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "compress eternity" is present but remains abstract rather than grounded in lived contradiction. The final choice—stepping onto the clouds and releasing the whisper—carries conceptual weight but lacks embodied cost or micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses in scene. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("reality had become negotiable," "he had finally printed something true") rather than character-particular perception under pressure. The shift from operator to agent of rupture is told rather than dramatized through escalating choices with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear lens (Accumulative/Textural: the whisper's release and library's dissolution reweight the premise) and delivers an on-page Conceptual Repricing—Elias moves from containing whispers to freeing them, with the library's shattering and his dissolution marking cost. However, the closure cost reads as abstract starlight rather than a felt price: no specific capability, relationship, or lived consequence is forfeited on the page. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough; one meaningful deepening occurs when Elias understands "the system wasn't the world. It was him," though this pivot is asserted rather than discovered through choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and sea of clouds supply vivid, purposeful imagery that charges the final dissolution. The frost patterns function as a micro-setting element, constraining Elias's decision to unstopper the bottle and press the page. Spatial choreography remains clear across press, shelves, and windows. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than as a constraint that shapes tactics; no tool, distance, or environmental feature limits his choices in a way that alters outcomes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—whether to release the destabilizing whisper—is signaled early and drives the arc. The tightening moment ("the rupture came...from Elias himself") narrows options and leads to his dissolution, but the escalation is asserted rather than forced by a prior constraint or trade-off. No on-page reversal tests his commitment; the library's collapse and his smile suggest earned closure, yet the cost (his vanishing into light) feels decorative rather than a visible forfeiture of a live option or relationship. Agency is present but the price legibility is low.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the whisper/containment/release arc and the library-as-system metaphor without overt moralizing. The final image—"the world, at last, began to rustle"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of awakening versus stasis. However, the prompt phrase "rustling awakenings" appears nearly verbatim in the printed text and again in the final line, crossing into thematic echo (−0.5). The conceptual cost (system collapse, Elias's dissolution) is legible but remains abstract rather than rooted in specific, felt particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-person limited to Elias, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("his fingers tracing the spines of volumes that hummed") but leans on elevated register ("liquid time, siphoned from moments the world had forgotten") that occasionally drifts from embodied interiority into narrated abstraction. The prose modulates with pressure, compressing at the rupture, but some peak-beat lines ("he had finally printed something true") read as thesis rather than thought. No dialogue present to evaluate naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>High figurative density in many sentences without pattern-teaching ("frost on the windows formed patterns no blade of grass should ever mimic: jagged, pulsing, like veins beneath translucent skin") muddies immediacy (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "wasn't just printing words—he was compressing eternity" restates the motivation without added detail (−0.2). Template cadence in the final third: "The library began to dissolve...The sea of clouds swallowed him...The clouds below began to stir" repeats "The [noun] [verb]" openings across adjacent beats (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("books unraveling into silk threads") and elevated diction ("eternity," "starlight") pervade the closure, reducing specificity. Total artifact debt exceeds −1.2; applies only in Q7 per routing rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The glass library floating on clouds and the letterpress operator who prints with "liquid time" offer surface novelty, but the arc—custodian releases contained force, shattering the system—closely matches familiar writing templates (keeper frees the trapped power). The whisper-as-destabilizer and "reality becomes negotiable" premise lean on abstraction rather than specific lived stakes or non-obvious moral calculus. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece follows a linear compression arc without transformation of its fantasy tropes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes one key decision—to press the whisper onto the page—but his role is primarily reactive observation until the final third. The choice to release the whisper is signaled, executed, and followed by dissolution, touching setup, middle, and ending. However, the specificity of "cryptic letterpress operator" does not constrain tactics; any custodian role would serve. Late penalty (−0.3) for the decisive turn occurring past midpoint; ornamental occupational detail (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bottled whisper appears early (setup), is placed on the press and actively bled onto the page (middle beat), and is released in the ending when Elias folds the page and lets it unfurl. Three beats with causal involvement. However, the bottle itself vanishes after unstoppering; the whisper's properties (destabilizing systems) are told rather than shown altering Elias's tactics. Closure linkage is strong but specificity is mid-range—any volatile containment object could substitute with minor edits. No visible cost tied uniquely to the bottle's use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Rustling awakenings" appears as printed text on the page mid-story and echoes in the final line ("the world, at last, began to rustle"), but the concept functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. Elias's goal is to "compress eternity," not to engineer awakenings; the rustle imagery is ornamental recurrence. No middle beat where the concept constrains a choice or alters options. Present in setup and closure but only as motif, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Destabilizes perfect systems" is the whisper's stated attribute and motivates Elias's choice to press it when the frost signals a rupture. The trait enables one on-page action (the pressing) and is implied in the library's collapse, but the mechanics remain abstract—no visible demonstration of how destabilization works or what perfect system is at risk beyond the library itself. The attribute is functional but replaceable (any dangerous force would serve). Present in setup and middle, minimal closure specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The rupture is signaled early (frost patterns), prepared through the pressing sequence, and executed on the page when Elias realizes "the rupture came...from Elias himself" and the library dissolves. The action drives two key beats (pressing the page, dissolution/release) and directly shapes the ending. Cost is visible in the library's destruction and Elias's vanishing. Specificity is strong—no other action could deliver this exact closure image. Early signal, middle involvement, and closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Patterns in morning frost appear on the windows as a signal early and recur when they crack to reveal other libraries, but the method itself (reading frost patterns) does not shape Elias's tactics—he identifies the rupture and proceeds to press the whisper without the frost constraining his options. The patterns function as atmospheric motif rather than functional method. Present in setup, ornamental in middle, absent from closure mechanics. Swappable with any visual omen.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The glass orchard library on a swirling sea of clouds anchors the story from the opening line and provides the material that dissolves in the ending (glass walls running like wax, shattering into starlight). The setting supplies vivid imagery and is present across all three gates, but it does not pressure Elias's choices—he could perform the same action in any contained archive. The clouds rise to meet him at closure, contributing to the final image. Specificity is high for atmosphere but mid-low for causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After reality becomes negotiable" establishes the story's premise and is referenced when Elias notes "reality had become negotiable again," but the timeframe does not function as a ticking clock or constraint on his tactics. No urgency is dramatized; Elias proceeds methodically. The phrase is present in setup as context but does not tighten decisions or alter his moves. Ornamental use (−0.7); no middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's desire to "compress eternity into a moment" is stated early, drives his decision to press the whisper onto the page, and is fulfilled in the closure line: "he had finally compressed eternity—into the space between one breath and the next." The motivation touches all three gates and enables the central action. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—no friction between this goal and a competing need. Functional but lacks embodied struggle on the page.</comment>
