<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's characterization is rooted in craft (wax caster, silver work) and regret over unrecorded dialect. The motivation is clear and the final renunciation—letting names change rather than holding tight—foreclosures the path of preservation-as-stasis. However, interior texture leans toward elevated abstractions ("the shape of their absence," "chiseling regrets from her own ribs") that feel more thematic than embodied, and the emotional progression from guilt to forgiveness reads smooth rather than contradictory under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early—braided rope, punched card, ceremonial reconfiguration—and accumulates density through the recombination ritual. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elira accepts that preservation is transformation, dissolving the card into the sanctum's bones and walking away unburdened. Cost is legible in the dissolution of the physical artifact and the foreclosure of her prior stance. One substantive deepening—names move from echoes to living heat—suffices for this length. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (sanctum, kneeling, punched card scrap).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glacier sanctum, aurora, and ice establish a vivid sensory environment filtered through craft vocabulary (wax, silver, crevasse). The ceremonial rope and punched card function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elira's ritual and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent: kneeling, rope coiled, walls weeping, aurora pulsing. However, the setting description sometimes stalls momentum with lyric phrasing ("blue-dark," "snowmelt ardor given form") rather than being woven through goal-directed action, and the professional craft detail (lost wax casting) is signaled but not mechanically constraining on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve forgotten names while forgiving herself for prior silence. The tightening occurs when Elira unravels and reconfigures the rope, threading the card's perforations into its core—an irreversible act that transforms the names from static echoes into "living heat." This narrows options (the card dissolves, foreclosing physical preservation) and reweights the cost (she must let go to preserve). The sanctum's trembling and the aurora's response provide external pressure that coheres under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: her decision to reconfigure drives the escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation requires transformation, forgiveness entails release. The rope's reconfiguration, the dissolved card, and the final image of warmth in her pockets all answer the thematic question without stating it. "Letting the names change" versus "holding tight" crystallizes through the ritual action. The closing line—"the wind, for once, answered"—offers a resonant, non-literal payoff. Minor dip: the penultimate paragraph's thematic echo ("It had given her a name of her own to carry: *the one who let the lost be found*") veers close to articulating the thesis, though it remains embedded in image rather than direct moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited on Elira, and perceptual signature reflects her craft background (wax, flame, silver, casting). Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the ritual frame. However, diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("the long white," "snowmelt ardor," "marrow") that reads more authorial than character-particular under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt the names *move*") are sparse and voice-motivated. No head-hopping, and the final image holds focalization cleanly. The elevated register is consistent but lacks the grit or idiosyncrasy that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"sleeping serpent," "breath of the lost," "marrow," "embers in snow," "second heartbeat"—which charges the ritual atmosphere but risks opacity in peak beats (the rope's illumination sequence stacks metaphors: "glow of a sound made visible, snowmelt ardor given form"). Several phrases loop conceptually: "names rose," "names move," "names it cradled," "names would remain." Template cadence appears in mid-story paragraphs with repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openers. Sentence-level propulsion is slowed by the lyric layering; the story reads as textural accumulation rather than forward drive, which suits the lens but caps momentum. No major clarity breaks, but the density taxes immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of craft ritual (lost wax casting, ceremonial rope braiding) with cryogenic preservation and memory transcription is specific and non-obvious. The punched card scrap as memory storage and the rope reconfiguration as preservation method feel fresh. However, the emotional arc—artisan guilt resolved through symbolic ritual—is familiar, and the glacial sanctum setting leans toward fantasy-postcard genericness (aurora, ice, ancient carvings). The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, and the "preservation is transformation" insight is earned. Risk-taking in the elliptical, lyric structure elevates without obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's identity as lost wax caster seeds her metaphorical framework ("the way a lost wax casting remembers the hollow it once filled") and her regret (hands too busy shaping silver to cup words). Her decision to unravel and reconfigure the rope—an irreversible craft act—drives the key turn and closure. The trait constrains her past (craft over recording) and enables her present ritual. Present in opening, middle choice, and closure image. Cost is visible: the card dissolves, foreclosing physical preservation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The punched card scrap appears in paragraph two (early setup), is held and traced by Elira, then woven into the rope's core at the climax, and dissolves in her grip as the memory is transcribed. Three distinct beats: initial handling, reconfiguration, dissolution. The object's perforations encode "the cadence of a voice," making it irreplaceable as the memory vessel. Its dissolution is the visible cost that enables the names' transformation. Causal pressure is strong; removing it breaks the ritual logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Transcribed memory frames the story: the card holds memory as perforations, and the climax is the transcription of that memory into the sanctum's bones. The concept drives the central action (weaving card into rope) and shapes the ending (dissolution as transcription). However, the mechanics remain metaphorical rather than tactile—how perforations "become" names in the ice is gestured at ("the sound of a sound made visible") but not clarified. Present in opening, middle, and closure, but operates more as thematic premise than on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is label-only in the opening ("her fingers—still gentle despite decades of wax and flame") and does not constrain or enable a later action with visible cost. The gentleness is asserted as a trait but never tested under pressure; Elira's hands unravel and reconfigure the rope, but the text does not show how gentleness (versus, say, precision or strength) alters her tactics or creates a tradeoff. The attribute is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Illumination occurs at the climax when the recombined rope strands bleed light, triggering the sanctum's trembling and the names' rising. This action is the pivotal turn: light makes the names audible and tangible ("their vowels warming the ice"), enabling Elira's realization and the final transcription. The action is irreplaceable—without illumination, the names remain inert perforations. Present in the middle escalation and directly shapes the closure image (the aurora's response, the warmth Elira carries). Causal pressure is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ceremonial rope is introduced in paragraph five, and the method—unraveling and reconfiguring the braids, pulling the card's perforations into the rope's core—is explicitly dramatized at the climax. The rope's strands are "time itself," and the reconfiguration is the mechanism that transforms the names from echoes to living heat. The method is irreplaceable: without the rope and its reconfiguration, the ritual has no vessel. Present in setup (coiled serpent), middle (the act of unraveling), and closure (seamless braids holding embers). Specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum under aurora is anchored in the opening line ("carved from the glacier's heart") and recurs throughout: the sanctum trembles, the walls weep, the aurora pulses and flickers. The setting provides the ritual space and environmental pressure (ice, cold, aurora's light) that charge the closure image. The sanctum's "hum" bookends the story, and the final paragraph positions Elira walking away from the sanctum toward the horizon, completing the spatial arc. The setting is irreplaceable as the ritual's container and the names' final home.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after forgiving yourself" is thematic rather than temporal. The story's present action is the ritual itself, during which forgiveness is achieved; the opening states Elira "had come to forgive herself," suggesting the timeframe precedes closure. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—there is no clock pressure. The forgiveness is resolved by the ending ("absolution," "heart light"), but the "after" does not constrain the on-page moves. The element is present as theme but not as a temporal stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve forgotten names is seeded in paragraph three (the punched card holds names "no living tongue could recall") and drives every beat: Elira's regret over the lost dialect, her decision to reconfigure the rope, the names rising as chorus, and the closure image of names humming beneath the ice. The friction between preservation and transformation (holding tight versus letting change) is dramatized through the ritual's cost: the card dissolves, foreclosing static preservation. The motivation is irreplaceable and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" is invoked once in the middle ("the glow of a sound made visible, snowmelt ardor given form") and tonally echoes in the closing warmth ("the warmth of the names in her pockets"). The tone is elegiac and ardent throughout, modulating from regret (opening) to warmth (closure). However, the phrase "snowmelt ardor" itself is not reprised or reweighted at the ending, and the tonal shift is smooth rather than charged by a discrete pressure point. The tone is coherent but not indispensable to the final image.</comment>
