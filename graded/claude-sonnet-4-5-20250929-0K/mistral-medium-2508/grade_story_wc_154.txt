<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena's translator identity is embodied through precise gestures—unknotting the child's crayon marks, reading negative space in the photo—with clear internal contradiction between her role as "grafter" and her chronic pain. The boy's arrival creates pressure, but Lena's response feels predetermined rather than chosen under duress; her gift of the coral reads more as priestly benediction than a trade-off with visible cost. Minor embodiment slips: "her pulse steady" during the photo examination tells rather than shows calm under pressure. The ending gesture (walking toward the mist) suggests endurance but doesn't foreclose a path on the page with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens—Lena decrypts grief artifacts in a liminal space—and delivers Charged Poise at closure when she stands and walks toward "other broken things," reweighting her role from single case to iterative practice. Orientation anchors arrive early (atrium, dusk, Lena with coral and cast). However, the cost remains oblique: the ending posture suggests continuation rather than foreclosure, and the "ribs singing" callback doesn't materially narrow options. The nurse's exposition and the boy's arrival feel coincidental rather than causally linked, weakening the because/therefore chain even under a situational read.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The atrium's mist, ivy "like old barbed wire," and twilight violet-gold ceiling create a charged liminal zone that mirrors Lena's role as threshold interpreter. The coral fragment's "labyrinthine grooves" and the cast's smudged surface function as micro-settings that constrain her method (tracing, decrypting) and recur at closure when the coral passes to the boy. Spatial choreography is clean: bench, boy approaching from mist, siren beyond glass. The anesthetic's dulling effect and "ribs singing" anchor bodily pressure. The final image—smudges glowing "like embers"—transforms prior detail into a charged symbol without forcing it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lena's need to "graft new meaning" onto trauma artifacts—is signaled early and tested twice (cast, photo). The boy's request intensifies the pattern but doesn't escalate difficulty; Lena's coral gift resolves his need without visible trade-off or tactical adjustment. Her choice to walk toward the mist suggests iterative endurance (Earned Stasis), but no live option is foreclosed on the page. The shrapnel memory and anesthetic detail prime physical cost but don't constrain her final moves. Pressure coheres under the situational lens yet lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows her options or forces a sacrifice scaled to closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of translation as grafting—reweighting trauma into bearable meaning—emerges through concrete acts: tracing smudges, reading negative space, passing the coral. The final image (smudges glowing "like embers cupped in careful hands") offers a resonant answer without stated moral, suggesting fragile survival. Subtext operates cleanly in the boy's "They say you can fix things" / "I unknot them" exchange. Minor slip: "The static was just the sea, answering" edges toward consoling epiphany rather than earned ambiguity. The piece resists false equivalence—Lena's craft has limits, the father is dead—and the coral's reprise from burden to gift reweights prior material without thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with perceptual signature tied to Lena's translator lens: "unknotting," "decrypting," "negative space." Diction stays within her register ("grafter," "dialect of grief") with purposeful compression ("mortar fire stuttered"). Dialogue is spare and goal-driven; the boy's thin voice and Lena's economy ("I unknot them") distinguish speakers. Minor register slip: "lotus-hearted ache" (from tone requirement) appears nowhere in the text, suggesting prompt divorce. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the cast and photo beats. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs ("her translator's instinct unknotting") serve voice. No head-hopping; focalization locked to Lena throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("He clutched it") alternate with lyric accretion ("here, a shoulder; there, the curve of a smile")—and figurative density is high but mostly coherent. However, stacked metaphors in the opening ("light bled," "glass ceiling into a bruise," "mist coiled") and repeated "like" constructions ("sounds like the radio," "ivy curled like old barbed wire," "like embers") create template cadence. Paraphrase loop: "The anesthetic had just taken hold, dulling the ache" / "restless" restates without advancing pressure. The coral's "labyrinthine grooves mirroring the atrium's archways" mixes scale (micro coral / macro archways). Minor scaffold: "Around them, the atrium held its breath, too" externalizes rather than showing tension. Propulsion is strong in dialogue beats but drags in the reflection-heavy second paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—translator as grief-grafter using physical artifacts—offers a fresh synthesis of occupation and metaphor, elevated by specific craft detail (brain coral grooves, crayon-smudged cast, black-marker photo). The coral's transformation from Lena's talisman to the boy's anchor feels earned rather than convenient. Risk-taking in sustained lyric compression and the anesthetic frame heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor derivative note: the wise healer in a liminal twilight space echoes familiar templates, though the "unknotting" vocabulary and concrete method (tracing condensation, negative space) personalize execution. The ending's quiet reconfiguration (smudges glowing) feels inevitable in hindsight, meeting the originality test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's identity as conflict-zone translator (Mindanao, rebels/medics, mortar fire) is present in backstory and shapes her perceptual method ("unknotting," "decrypting"), enabling her to parse the cast and photo. Her choice to gift the coral and walk toward the mist drives the ending, though the decision feels consistent with established pattern rather than a turn under pressure. Two functional beats (cast, photo) plus closure participation. Swappability: could be trauma therapist or grief counselor with minor edits; the "translator" specificity matters less than "interpreter of loss."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Brain coral fragment is handled in three beats: opening (Lena tracing grooves), middle (grounding her during cast work, "ridges bit deeper"), and closure (pressed into boy's palm with instruction to "run your fingers over the ridges"). Its labyrinthine texture enables the "sea remembers the shore" metaphor and constrains her method (tactile decoding). Early signal, causal pressure (grounds her), and closure linkage with reweighted meaning (burden → gift). High irreplaceability due to specific grooves and sea origin. Final line confirms the boy's pocket-weight as "the first true sentence," cementing its charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shared anxieties" appears thematically (child's fear of static voice, boy's grief, Lena's wounds) but doesn't constrain tactics or create on-page friction between characters. The concept is echoed rather than dramatized; Lena and the boy don't negotiate conflicting fears, and no choice pivots on acknowledging shared experience. Present across beats as background texture but functionally replaceable with "grief" or "trauma" without structural loss. Development and closure gates weak; setup marginal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is demonstrated once concretely: Lena reads "the unsaid" in soldier twitches and widow tea—perceptive yet open to others' pain. The trait enables her to decode the cast and photo but doesn't create visible trade-off or cost; her innocence isn't tested or compromised on the page. Label confirmed in line two but not constrained by pressure. Functional in one beat (cast), marginal in another (photo), absent from closure action. Swappable with "empathic" or "perceptive."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Unknotting drives two major beats: Lena "unknotting the child's fear like a cipher" in the cast scene and decoding the boy's photo by tracing "negative space." The verb is signaled in dialogue ("I unknot them") and recurs in the final summary ("where the shapes of other broken things waited to be unknotted"). Causal pressure: the method enables her to reweight the artifacts and gift the coral. Closure linkage strong. Swappability: "translate" or "decode" would require only minor edits, but "unknot" carries physical/tactile specificity that suits the coral and grooves.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Decrypting the cast's smudged crayon marks is dramatized on-page: Lena traces condensation over the smudges, reading "a spiral for the way fear tightens the throat; a jagged line for the sound of a door kicked in." Setup clear, method shapes the first major beat, and the ending confirms the smudges "began to glow," charging the closure image. However, the method is used only once in detail; the photo beat shifts to "negative space" rather than repeating the decrypt mechanics. Development gate weak (one beat). Specificity high; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors every paragraph: violet-gold ceiling, stone bench, ivy, mist coiling at ankles, glass overhead, siren beyond. The setting provides liminal atmosphere and recurring imagery (mist as threshold, ivy as barbed wire) but doesn't constrain choice—Lena could perform these acts elsewhere. The final move (walking toward the mist) charges the image but isn't forced by the space. Setup strong, development marginal (no spatial obstacle or resource), closure participation moderate (backdrop, not cause). Micro-setting (coral, cast) does more causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the anesthetic kicks in" is mentioned in the opening ("The anesthetic had just taken hold, dulling the ache in her ribs") but never tracked or used to tighten decisions. No clock pressure, no escalating numbness or cognitive drift, no scene duration constraint. The timeframe is ornamental; the story unfolds in an untracked twilight with no urgency beyond atmospheric mood. Setup present, development absent, closure absent. Swappable with "at dusk" or "during her shift."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena's desire to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is dramatized in her rewriting the cast's message ("Your father's last word was your name. The static was just the sea") and telling the boy his brother "was holding them." The motivation shapes both major beats and the ending (walking toward "other broken things"). Internal friction appears in her chronic pain and the anesthetic's partial relief, suggesting cost. Closure linkage strong: the grafting ethic defines her iterative role. Swappability low; the specific verb "graft" (surgical, botanical) ties to her translator/healer synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache"—tender grief rooted in beauty and impermanence—is sustained through diction ("breath fogging," "embers cupped in careful hands"), imagery (coral grooves, smudges glowing), and restrained syntax. Tone modulates with pressure: lyric density in reflection, clipped dialogue in the boy's arrival, quiet resolve at closure. The ache coheres without flattening into single mood; Lena's ribs "singing" and the siren's wail layer pain with purpose. The ending's glow image charges the tone without sentimentality. Minor slip: "lotus-hearted" never appears on the page, suggesting prompt gap, but the tonal effect is present.</comment>
