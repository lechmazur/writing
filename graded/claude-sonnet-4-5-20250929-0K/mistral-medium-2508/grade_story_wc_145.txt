<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is vivid and embodied—her atlas-editor wit and precise observation ground her perspective. However, her final choice lacks visible internal conflict; she steps forward with only a smile, no dramatized contradiction between fear and resolve. The endurance/acceptance reads more as mystical destiny than a choice that forecloses a path with felt personal cost. Kael remains a backstory sketch without on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: condensation patterns, the phrasebook fragment, and river convergence accumulate toward the ice-cracking moment and Lena's step forward—a Charged Poise that reconfigures her role from seeker to herald. Orientation anchors quickly (outpost, frozen lake, Lena's profession). The cost is conceptual (she vanishes into the lake, sealing behind her) and legible in the final image, though the emotional price remains oblique. One meaningful deepening is present and closure lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake center, and condensation on glass provide tactile constraint: the ice's thinness and the dock's creaking inform Lena's final approach. Sensory detail—wet stone scent, black glassy ice, breath fogging—is selective and grounds the mystical turn. The outpost's "groaning in relief" charges the closure image, and the ice sealing behind her makes the environment active in the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where the rivers begin"—is signaled early and drives Lena to the ice. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presses her palm to the surface and the ice sighs, narrowing her options to stepping forward. The cost is legible (she vanishes, the falcon carries nothing back), but her agency at the peak reads more as mystical invitation than a trade-off between competing goods. No reversal tests her commitment; the water parts and she accepts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: water's memory, the pattern of tributaries, the phrasebook's "beginning" and "end." The final image—Lena stepping onto dissolving ice, sealing behind her—reweights the quest from geographical curiosity to existential origin without stating a moral. The herald motif recurs with cost (she becomes what she sought). Subtext operates in gesture (the smile, the released page) and the falcon's empty return.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; Lena's perceptual signature—condensation tracing, ink-stain cuffs, editor's precision—is distinct and consistent. Diction ("quiet catastrophe," "worrying tranquility") is controlled and voice-motivated. The water's voice in the dead tongue avoids head-hopping by remaining external stimulus. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from observational opening to intimate interior at the ice, and the final image holds coherent focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and prose is dense with sensory and thematic work. However, elevated register occasionally drifts from atlas-editor grounding ("worrying tranquility of the dawn," "quiet catastrophe") without clear POV motivation. Minor paraphrase loop: "The rivers didn't begin upstream. They began *here*" closely echoes Kael's "don't start here… drawn here" without added pressure. The closure image is vivid and propulsive, but figurative density in the water-blooming passage risks slight opacity. No major scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of hydrological mystery, dead-tongue phrasebook, and mystical convergence is specific and non-generic. The editor-as-herald twist feels earned in hindsight via her pattern-seeking profession. However, the "herald comes when the breath stills" prophecy and water-as-sentient-origin lean on familiar mystical-quest templates. The falcon messenger and frozen-lake-threshold are recognizable fantasy tropes executed with care but not fully transformed. The final step forward and ice-sealing image carry fresh visual charge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lena's atlas-editor identity frames her pattern-recognition approach and is present in two beats: tracing condensation and releasing the phrasebook page. Her wit is label-only ("dry as the ink stains") without shaping a key choice. The step onto the ice is a culmination but her profession's constraint on tactics is modest; she observes and accepts more than she decides under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dog-eared phrasebook page appears early (falcon delivers it at dawn), returns on the table with its curled edges described, and Lena releases it onto the water in the closure beat where it dissolves and rewrites currents. Three distinct beats with causal involvement. However, the dog-ear itself (the corner lingered over "beginning" and "end") does not constrain a choice; the page as a whole does the work. Specificity is present but irreplaceability is partial.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Singular convergence shapes the premise: Kael's sketch of tributaries converging, Lena's realization that rivers "begin *here*," and the ice cracking at the center where water unfolds. The concept is present in setup and closure, altering Lena's understanding and the story's stakes. However, it does not constrain middle tactics; she waits rather than navigating competing convergence points. The conceptual cost is legible (rivers reverse, she vanishes) but the on-page pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is signaled via "her hands that didn't tremble" and her calm step onto the ice, but the trait does not enable or constrain a key choice with visible cost. It reads as label-only competence without friction. No moment where overconfidence or under-confidence alters tactics. The trait supports tone but remains ornamental to the plot's turns.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Herald" is signaled early (Kael's phrase), dramatized at the water's declaration ("You are the herald"), and fulfilled in Lena's step forward that seals the ice and releases the falcon empty—three beats with escalating causal weight. The action redefines her quest from finder to instrument, and the closure depends on her accepting the role. Removing "herald" would require fundamental rewrite of the ending's logic and the story's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Condensation appears in three beats: Lena traces it on the window, her breath fogs it into a delta pointing north-by-northwest (shaping her approach), and "condensation on her skin" rearranges into symbols at the ice. The mechanics matter: breath as signal, pattern as map. The method is present in setup and middle, and charges the ending when symbols form on her skin. Removing it would weaken the story's sensory and thematic through-line, though the ice-cracking could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake are present in every beat: the opening anchors them, the outpost's pinned findings drive Lena's understanding, and the lake's thin center ice is the site of her final choice. The setting constrains her physically (dock, ice thickness) and the outpost "groans in relief" at closure, charging the final image. The environment is indispensable to the story's spatial and thematic logic; a different location would require substantial rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the falcon returns" frames the inciting incident at dawn and tightens the sense of culmination (the falcon departs empty at the end, bracketing the action). However, time pressure is not felt in the middle; Lena moves at her own pace without a clock forcing choices. The timeframe is functional for setup and closure participation but does not shape tactics. Swappable with "after receiving the page" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lena's desire to find where the rivers begin is established early ("Her job had always been to find where things began"), drives her to the outpost and onto the ice, and culminates in her realization and step forward. The motivation is dramatized in two key beats (palm on ice, step into water) and carries conceptual cost (she becomes the origin rather than mapping it). Friction between intellectual quest and existential transformation is present but could be sharpened.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is signaled in the opening ("silence," "parchment sky") and returns in the final line ("worrying tranquility of the dawn"). The tone modulates subtly—stillness that "wasn't absence but anticipation"—and the oxymoron charges the closure by making peace unsettling. However, tone does not escalate or break under pressure; it remains consistently hushed. The phrase in the final line feels slightly imposed rather than emergent from the image itself.</comment>
