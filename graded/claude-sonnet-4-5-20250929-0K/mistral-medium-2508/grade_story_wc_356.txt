<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is concrete and embodied through her olfactory sensitivity, driving her theft and cultivation choices. Internal conflict emerges in her hunger versus the Elders' disapproval, though the resolution feels somewhat easy—the Elders soften and the village accepts her transgression without visible cost to relationships or status. The final insight about trust arrives cleanly but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the peak beat. Grandmother's voice and the journal provide texture, but the character arc from defiance to community acceptance smooths over potential friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Liora, treetop village, stolen seed, immediately establishing stakes. The causal chain—theft, planting, bloom, Elders' arrival, Liora's realization, village acceptance—holds under a hybrid lens tilting accumulative/textural at closure. The flower functions as both plot driver and conceptual mirror, delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration when Liora recognizes serenity in the sway itself and the village unlocks the vault. Cost is visible (theft, confrontation, redefinition of serenity) and the ending image—new bridge, unlocked vault, tea—reweights the premise with trust as the undercurrent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the flower's perfume forces truths to surface, narrowing Liora's path from defiance to integration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The treetop village is vivid and specific: bridges swaying, tide below, bark and salt scent, walkways vibrating with the bell. The corpse flower—its husk pulsing, musk of rotting honey, tendrils black as a bruise, silver-veined petals—acts as micro-setting that constrains Liora's choice and charges the closure (new bridge strung with vines). Sensory hierarchy reflects Liora's olfactory obsession. The "tide's thought" and "moon's third face" establish a lyric world logic without over-explanation, though spatial choreography of the Elders' arrival and the balcony-to-village geography could be slightly tighter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and pursued through the theft, planting, and bloom. Pressure tightens when the Elders arrive and the flower's perfume forces truths to surface, narrowing Liora's options from secrecy to confrontation. The resolution is earned by Liora's recognition and the village's unlocking of the vault, though the Elders' "disapproval softening like wax" could carry more visible friction. One meaningful tightening (flower as mirror, not wisdom) reweights the stakes. Agency is clear: Liora plants, interprets, and extends the bridge; the village responds with trust. Cost is present but mild—no loss of status, only reframing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—serenity within motion, trust as wisdom's undercurrent—emerges organically from the flower's mirror function and Liora's realization. The journal's doodled language of loops and leaves, the grandmother's "write what the hands forget," and the final petal pressed into violet ink charge the closure without stating a moral. The corpse flower vines on the new bridge offer a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the Elders' silent disapproval softening and the unlocked vault as communal trust. The final line ("just another name for trust") borders on thematic statement but remains grounded in the scene's pressure and Liora's tea-steam doodle callback.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters through Liora's olfactory sensitivity: "rotting honey, buried secrets," lavender grief, fig deceit. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the planting and bloom. Diction is largely voice-consistent, though phrases like "the turning tide's thought" and "the wildflower hush of a village breathing" elevate register slightly beyond strict character lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the eldest's "You sought wisdom" carries subtext. The prose reflects Liora's herbalist mind through precise plant and scent language. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high—"bridges swaying like vines in the tide's slow breath," "scent coiled like smoke," "disapproval softening like wax." Some metaphors stack without clear pattern-teaching: "veins of the turning tide's thought," "the sway itself—the wildflower hush of a village breathing, of roots tangling in the dark." Register drifts toward lyric elevation in multiple high-pressure beats (Elders' arrival, closure), and several lines ("the first tendril broke soil at midnight, black as a bruise, unfurling with a sigh") approach purple without obscuring clarity. Minor paraphrase loop: "She pressed the seed to her palm" / "She planted the seed" / "She plucked a petal and pressed it" recycles "pressed" as a gesture. Information density is generally high, but the figurative load in consecutive sentences ("perfume wrapped around them, thick with visions" / "fears curling like smoke" / "stepped closer, journal clutched") could be pruned. No major loops or scaffold, but cumulative density in peak beats triggers a modest deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The treetop village with tidal rhythm, olfactory herbalist, and doodled journal language offer specific synthesis. The corpse flower as mirror rather than wisdom source transforms the "forbidden knowledge" trope. Emotional truth in Liora's hunger and the village's eventual trust feels earned, though the Elders' quick softening and unlocked vault lean toward convenience. The journal's family custom and the final bridge of corpse flower vines provide fresh inflection. Risk-taking in the lyric register and tidal world logic heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, though some phrasing ("the turning tide's thought") borders on obscurity. The ending's trust-as-undercurrent synthesis feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora's choices—theft, planting, stepping closer to the flower, plucking a petal, hanging the new bridge—drive all major turns. Setup is immediate; she acts in at least four distinct beats (theft decision, planting midnight, petal into journal, bridge at evening) and her final action (bridge with vines) charges the closure. Causal pressure is strong; without her agency the village's trust-shift would not occur. Visible cost: confrontation with Elders, redefinition of serenity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed appears in the opening, is planted at midnight, blooms by morning, its petals are plucked and pressed into the journal, and vines from it string the new bridge at closure. It functions as both plot catalyst (theft, bloom) and thematic mirror (not wisdom, but reflection). Its evolving state—pulsing husk, black tendril, silver-veined bloom, petal ink, bridge vines—shapes tactics and charges the ending image. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with visible cost (Elders' confrontation).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "undercurrent of wisdom" is named in the final line and operates thematically throughout: the seed "whispered to bloom only under the gaze of the moon's third face—a wisdom too sharp for reckless hands," the flower's perfume as truth-dragging force, Liora's realization that the flower isn't wisdom but a mirror. It reweights the premise at closure ("undercurrent of wisdom... just another name for trust") and shapes her interpretation, though the concept remains more thematic echo than on-page constraint that alters tactics. Cost is conceptual (reframing serenity and wisdom) rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Liora's olfactory sensitivity is signaled early ("olfactorily sensitive to the point of obsession, able to parse the grief in wilting lavender or the deceit in overripe figs") and demonstrated when she inhales the seed's musk ("rotting honey, buried secrets"). It enables her recognition of the flower's perfume as truth-bearing ("sweet and suffocating, like the hush before a storm") and informs her herbalist identity. However, it does not visibly constrain a choice or impose a tradeoff on the page—she does not, for example, suffer from overwhelming scent or make a decision because of olfactory overload. Present in setup and development but lacks closure participation or felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Journalizing (sketching the seed's spiral, pressing the petal into the journal, writing the final line, recalling grandmother's doodle) appears in three beats and frames the story's thematic closure. The journal carries the family's doodled language, which Liora uses to parse truth ("the way her mother's hands trembled," "the exact shade of green that meant forgive me"). The petal-pressing and final written line ("the undercurrent of wisdom... just another name for trust") deliver the conceptual repricing. Strong causal role, though the journalizing itself does not constrain or enable a middle choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The family custom of doodling on wrapping paper interiors is seeded early ("her journal, its pages wrapped in brown paper, the interiors scribbled with generations of doodles—her family's custom, a language of loops and leaves") and referenced at closure ("the first doodle she'd ever traced—her grandmother's hand, steadying hers"). It provides thematic texture (silent language, trust across generations) but does not mechanically shape a choice or tactic in the middle beats. The method is ornamental description until the ending reprise, which reweights meaning without demonstrating irreplaceability—another family ritual could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The treetop village setting is vivid and present throughout: balcony, bridges, tide below, central bell, walkways. It supplies the context (Elders' vault, village gathering) and enables the final image (new bridge strung with vines). The swaying bridges and tidal rhythm metaphorically support the theme of serenity within motion. However, the setting does not impose a tactical constraint—Liora's choices would play out similarly in another magical village. Micro-setting (balcony, pot of crushed moonstone) provides atmosphere but does not alter the conflict's outcome. Present in all three gates but lacks high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "turning of the tide's thought" is poetic and recurs ("the tide turned," "the tide's thought turned again") but functions more as atmospheric motif than a clock that tightens decisions. The bloom occurs "at midnight" and "by morning," and the Elders arrive "as the bloom yawned open," establishing a rough sequence. Evening brings the new bridge. The tidal rhythm metaphorically supports theme (motion, sway) but does not impose urgency or alter tactics—Liora does not race a deadline. Setup is present; development and payoff are thematic rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Liora's motivation—to cultivate serenity within motion—is named early ("the serenity she craved, the stillness inside the sway") and drives the theft and planting. It is tested when the Elders arrive and the flower forces truths to surface, leading to her realization that "serenity... wasn't in stillness, but in the sway itself." The motivation is dramatized through action (planting, confronting the Elders, hanging the bridge) and reweighted at closure with visible cost (confrontation, redefinition). Strong friction between want (stillness) and discovered truth (motion as serenity).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "wildflower hush" tone is established through diction ("damp bark and distant salt," "rotting honey," "thin as parchment," "wet earth and old bones") and maintained across turns. The prose modulates with pressure: quiet observation during planting, sensory density during the bloom, softer closure with tea-steam curling. The tone charges the final image ("the sway of the trees felt like an embrace") and coheres with the serenity-in-motion theme. Some elevation ("the turning tide's thought," "wisdom too sharp for reckless hands") risks preciousness, but the overall hush remains consistent and purposeful.</comment>
