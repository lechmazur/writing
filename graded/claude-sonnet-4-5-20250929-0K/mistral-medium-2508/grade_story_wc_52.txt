<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The widow's interiority is concrete and embodied—"her hands learning the language of absence," the carving as containment rather than resurrection. Internal contradiction operates through the tension between practical daily rhythm and profound loss, shown in micro-choices like keeping the final lion rather than selling it. The renunciation at closure (letting the lions go "one cut at a time") is earned by the accumulating particulars of her craft and grief. Minor slip: the "half-gone herself" line edges toward diagnostic label-speak, but the embodied work surrounding it maintains credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: widow, loft, morning routine by the second paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through the ritual of carving, each iteration reweighting her relationship to loss until the final lion stays on the windowsill, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with visible cost: she stops selling, accepts the lesson of impermanence). The cost is legible in the shift from market sale to solitary keeping, and the closing lines reconfigure the opening stakes ("learning how to let them go"). One meaningful deepening through the girl's question and the widow's response, then the decision to place the final carving in light rather than currency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The loft functions as micro-setting throughout: rain-beaded skylight filters light onto the widow's work, the ladder becomes a daily threshold, sawdust clings "like a second skin." The ash blank is handled across multiple beats, its grain and resistance shaping her physical engagement. The final image—lion on the windowsill catching morning sun, rain droplets scattering light—charges closure by transforming the setting from workspace to shrine. Spatial choreography remains clean (loft above, kettle below, ladder between) and the widow's movements through this vertical geography anchor each transition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—containing/releasing the husband's memory through carving—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the widow decides not to take the mid-leap lion to market. The girl's question functions as a micro-turn that crystallizes the widow's understanding ("Here and gone"), and the final choice to keep the carving forecloses the prior pattern of selling, a renunciation with visible cost (no market income, but a lesson harvested). Agency is embodied in the decision to place the lion in light rather than currency. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each carving attempt deepens her engagement with impermanence until the resolution becomes inevitable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—the impossibility and necessity of holding what is passing—emerges through concrete particulars: the lions "stepping out of the wood, never fully there," the widow's hands learning absence, the final carving placed in sunlight rather than sold. The girl's question and the widow's answer offer subtext rather than thesis. The ending reweights all prior material: "learning how to let them go / One cut at a time" provides a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The rust-hued peace and the match "striking with a sound like a lion's yawn" carry symbolic weight without shouting. No thematic echo or summary paragraph; the concept is enacted rather than explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly throughout with perceptual signature rooted in craft ("the knife biting into the blank," "crystallized time," "rust-hued peace"). Diction remains controlled and character-particular—the widow's vocabulary favors tactile and visual precision. The single dialogue exchange with the girl is naturalistic and purposeful, advancing the thematic question. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during carving work, a step back during the tourist-market summary. Minor density concern: "hauntingly practical rhythm" and "rust-hued peace" edge toward elevated register but remain voice-motivated and legible within the lyric mode the piece establishes early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "the match striking with a sound like a lion's yawn" carries action, sensory detail, and thematic echo). A few figurative constructions risk overwriting: "minutes slowing as her fingers traced the memory of his voice" stacks metaphor on metaphor, and "steam curling into the shape of things she would never name" hovers near opacity. The "crystallized time" phrase recurs without clear mechanical grounding, a minor scaffold artifact. Opening and closing lines are strong, and the loop check is mostly clean, but the density of figurative language in peak beats (dream sequence, final carving) occasionally blurs propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—widow as carver processing grief through craft—transforms familiar material through specific detail: ash wood grain, the husband's death from "stillness" rather than claws, lions mid-leap that never fully materialize. The widow's refusal to weep and her "half-gone" state avoid sentimentality. The market transaction with the ink-stained girl and the final decision to keep the carving offer non-obvious turns grounded in prior particulars. Risk: the lyric mode and extended reflection might flatten momentum in less skilled hands, but here the accumulative design supports it. The ending's quiet authority—letting go "one cut at a time"—feels earned rather than imposed, though the broader widow-processing-loss frame remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; her daily climbing, carving, and selling routine frames the story. She makes the key closure choice: to place the final lion on the windowsill rather than sell it, altering her prior pattern and enacting the lesson of letting go. Her decisions shape all major turns—selecting the blank, pressing through the first cut, answering the girl, keeping the lion.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (second paragraph) and handled across multiple beats: cradled in her arms, first cut resisting, shaping into haunch and spine, turned to light at closure. The blank's grain and resistance constrain her physical engagement. The final carved lion placed on the windowsill reweights the blank's meaning from commodity to lesson. The blank is causally active in escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Shapes stakes from the opening line ("fractured like old glass") and drives the widow's repeated carving attempts. The girl's question crystallizes it: "why the lions always looked like they were stepping out of the wood, never fully there." The widow's answer and final choice enact the concept with visible cost—she stops selling and accepts impermanence. The concept constrains her tactics (each carving an attempt to contain) and charges the closure image (learning to let go). Indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The phrase "hauntingly practical rhythm of her days" appears mid-story and describes the widow's daily routine. It constrains her behavior—she continues carving despite grief, a practical endurance—and the trade-off (emotional numbness for functional continuity) is visible on the page. The trait enables her to reach closure: the practical act of placing the lion in light rather than market. Present in closure participation through the steady descent and kettle-lighting that bookend the story.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Signaled early ("Each carving was an attempt to contain him") and drives every major beat: selecting the blank, making the first cut, shaping the lion, answering the girl's question, and the climactic decision to keep the final carving. The action of containment redefines options at closure—she shifts from selling (external circulation) to keeping (internal acceptance), enacting the lesson. The widow's entire arc traces to this verb; swapping it would dismantle the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears once in the middle: "She worked through crystallized time, the minutes slowing as her fingers traced the memory." The phrase signals the widow's immersive focus during carving, a perceptual shift that matters to her engagement with grief. It does not recur or constrain later choices, and its mechanics remain abstract (how does time crystallize?). Present in one beat, purposeful within that moment, but not essential to closure or escalation. Lyric resonance without structural weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening line and active throughout: the skylight fractures light onto the widow's work, the rain beads return in the closing lines to "scatter light across the floor in rust-hued peace." The loft's vertical separation (carving above, kettle below) structures her daily rhythm and the ladder becomes a threshold. The final lion placed on the windowsill transforms the loft from workspace to shrine, charging closure. The setting constrains her solitary practice and supplies the light that illuminates the final image. Essential across setup, middle choices, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mentioned in the opening ("while the kettle boiled below") and closing ("the kettle had gone cold"), framing the carving session. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or track visibly across beats—the widow's work occurs in "crystallized time" that abstracts duration. No live clock alters tactics. The kettle functions more as spatial anchor (below the loft) and ritual bookend than active timer. Present but not pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("Each carving was an attempt to contain him... as a lesson harvested from loss") and dramatized through conflicted choices: the widow continues carving despite knowing she cannot truly hold him, sells the lions to tourists who mistake grief for artistry, then finally keeps one to enact the lesson of letting go. The friction between wanting to contain and needing to release drives escalation. The closure choice—placing the lion in light—embodies the harvested lesson with visible cost (no sale, but acceptance). Motivation shapes all key turns.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The phrase "rust-hued peace" appears in the final paragraph, describing light scattered across the floor. Tone throughout is elegiac and restrained—the widow "never wept," works with "hauntingly practical rhythm," and the prose maintains lyric distance without sentimentality. The tone modulates subtly: clinical during the husband's death summary, tactile during carving, tender at closure. The rust-hued peace charges the final image by synthesizing grief (rust as decay) and acceptance (peace). Coherent through turns and purposefully weighted at the end.</comment>
