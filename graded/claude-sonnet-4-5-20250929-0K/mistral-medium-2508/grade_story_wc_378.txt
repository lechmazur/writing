<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias-7's internal conflict is embodied through the "static in his chest cavity" and the box of fears, with clear contradictory impulses (preservation vs. destruction) that drive the climactic choice to burn the farm. The decision to step into the desert carries visible cost—abandoning his 127-year role—and his micro-choices (tucking the bloom behind his sensor, opening the box) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor weakness: the woman's backstory operates more as motivational furniture than live pressure, and some interiority edges toward poetic abstraction ("friction of two truths") rather than character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis transitioning to Decisive Change: Elias walks into the desert, foreclosing his caretaker role with visible cost (leaving the dome, the next caretaker arriving). Causal lens holds throughout—box discovery triggers memory, memory contextualizes the controlled burn, burn enables departure. Orientation anchors (dome, roses, Elias) arrive within the first paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the magnetic shift's peak pressure forces the fire decision, which then reweights all prior "containment" into a trap he must escape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome with twin-sun refraction, desert beyond, and the roses themselves create a micro-setting that constrains Elias's choices (the dome as both protection and prison). The controlled burn's mechanics—ash, blackened soil, new shoots—charge the final departure by literalizing renewal. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, airlock, dome edge). Minor slip: "magnetic north drift" and "landmines" are mentioned but never materially affect tactics or the closure image, functioning more as atmospheric detail than active constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elias's stasis vs. change) is signaled early through the static and box, then tightened by the magnetic shift forcing the burn decision. The fire is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: years of growth reduced to ash, his fears dissolved, and the final walk forecloses his caretaker identity. The escalation operates under a causal lens—discovery narrows options, burn pays the price, departure completes the arc—with one clear reversal (from preservation to destruction to departure). No coincidence rescues; the woman's prior departure seeds but does not solve Elias's choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (containment vs. release, miniaturization of grief vs. embracing vastness) emerges through concrete particulars: the box, the burn, the step through the airlock. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer—Elias finally understands the woman's departure by enacting his own—without stating a moral. The recurring rose motif shifts meaning (stagnant relics → new growth → a single bloom tucked behind his sensor) and the final image ("magnetic north would keep drifting—just as it always had") reweights the premise with quiet inevitability. No thematic echo or summary mars the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited to Elias with consistent distance and perceptual signature (metal fingers, auditory sensor, diaphragm hitch). Diction stays android-particular ("programming," "glitch," "reboot") while allowing poetic compression ("the desert wind hit him like a reboot"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the box discovery, broader during the burn. Minor friction: "the roses trembled" in paragraph five briefly externalizes without clear POV anchor, and "the ghost of a hand on his shoulder" edges toward metaphor that feels slightly unmoored from his sensory lexicon under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well ("He didn't breathe, but his diaphragm hitched anyway"), information density is high (most lines advance character, world, or pressure), and figurative language is controlled except for one cluster in the opening paragraph where "hummed like a dying bee," "jagged rainbows," and "thorns remembered his touch" stack without clear pattern. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence openings vary. The phrase "static in his chest cavity wasn't from faulty wiring" / "static in his core wasn't an error" / "static in his chest smoothed" recurs three times but each instance advances pressure, so the repetition reads purposeful rather than looped.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The android-caretaker-leaves premise is familiar, but the combination of bioengineered war roses, magnetic shift, and the box of physical fears (not data logs) offers specific transformation. The controlled burn as both farm reset and psychological release feels earned rather than convenient. Emotional arc hinges on Elias's choice, not interchangeable names. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric compression and the box device are effective but not structurally bold. The "nostalgic android" template is visible beneath the execution, though the ending's quiet inevitability elevates it above median treatment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias-7 drives two major turns: discovering the box (which contextualizes his fear) and lighting the fire (which enables departure). His final choice to step into the desert is the story's decisive change, and his nostalgic quality (127 years, the woman's voice, the bloom behind his sensor) constrains that choice by making the cost legible. Present early, active in middle and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The box appears in three beats: discovery beneath the workbench, pressed palm recognition ("you kept us alive too"), and opened during the fire to dissolve its contents. Its presence frames Elias's internal conflict and its destruction is causally necessary for his departure—without it, the burn remains only agricultural. The crooked handwriting and specific contents (mirror shard, sand vial, voice recording) make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The controlled burn is the story's central mechanism: established as necessary farm reset, delayed by Elias's fear, enacted at the climax with visible cost (ash, smoke, years consumed), and its success (new roses) enables the departure. The concept shapes tactics throughout—Elias's 127-year refusal to burn, the magnetic shift as pressure trigger, the pyre as closure vehicle. Removing it collapses the plot's causal spine and the escape metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" is attributed to the roses in the opening ("as if the thorns remembered his touch") and returns in the final dawn ("thrumming with that strange, organic rhythm"). It signals the roses' war-relic nature and subtly mirrors Elias's own unexpected emotional life. However, the trait constrains no on-page choice—Elias tends them regardless—so it functions more as atmospheric specificity than active pressure. Present early and reprised at closure, but swappable with "unnaturally vital" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" appears twice with causal weight: Elias "miniaturized her absence into this box, folding grief into something small enough to hold," and the war's ecosystems were "miniaturized into survival pods." The action defines both his coping mechanism (containment) and the story's thematic opposition (miniaturization vs. vastness). The burn inverts this—expansion, release—making the miniaturization essential to the arc's tension. Not swappable, but its middle development is brief (one reflective beat); stronger setup and closure participation than mid-story pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Containing chaos" is explicitly named ("built to preserve, but…to *contain* their chaos") and the method shapes Elias's 127-year stasis. The controlled burn is its inversion—releasing chaos to enable renewal. However, the phrase itself is more thematic label than mechanical constraint; the roses' chaos is never shown attempting to escape or forcing a tactical choice. Present by implication throughout, but the method's mechanics are thin compared to its thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm anchors every beat: the dome's hum and refracted light open the story, the workbench hides the box, the airlock is the threshold Elias crosses, and the dome's survival without him closes the piece. The environment supplies the fire's fuel (roses, loam) and the barrier (glass) that defines inside/outside. The setting is the story's central constraint and its removal would erase the escape's stakes and spatial logic. Specific, irreplaceable, causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The magnetic shift is present early ("long enough to watch magnetic north drift"), mentioned as "stronger now" at midpoint, and noted as "passed its peak" at closure, but it does not tighten decisions with a live clock. Elias chooses to burn at dusk for reasons internal (the box, his accumulated fear) rather than because the shift imposes a deadline. The timeframe colors atmosphere and suggests cyclical planetary pressure, but is swappable with "storm season" or similar without altering tactics. Two-gate lyric reprise without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Inner static" is embodied ("static in his chest cavity"), named as motivation ("wasn't from faulty wiring… wasn't an error"), drives the burn decision (friction resolved by fire), and concludes transformed ("smoothed into a low, steady pulse"). The motivation is dramatized in choices—refusing the burn for 127 years, then lighting it—and the final departure is its fulfillment. The desire is conflicted (preservation instinct vs. static resolution) with visible cost (destroying the farm, leaving his role). Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone operates as lyric-textured accumulation: fragmented images (dying bee hum, jagged rainbows, thorns that remember) cohere into wholeness by the ending (new roses, tucked bloom, steady pulse). The prose modulates—compressed and imagistic in reflection, cleaner and more direct during the burn—without losing coherence. The final paragraph's calm declaratives ("The dome would reset. The roses would bloom.") enact the promised wholeness. The tone charges the closure image but does not constrain a middle choice, limiting it to strong two-gate integration.</comment>
