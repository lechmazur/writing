<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fisher's cool-headed resolve is demonstrated through consistent embodied restraint ("didn't flinch," "exhaled, slow and measured"), and his choices accumulate toward the final renunciation—letting the echo go. Internal conflict appears primarily in the backstory with his daughter, but present-beat contradictory impulses are limited; the protagonist moves through the garden's violence with steady composure rather than layered ambivalence. The final act of letting go reads as earned by the thirty-year hunt and the rail spike's completion, though the cost remains mostly implied rather than viscerally dramatized in present sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates charged images—humming soil, sleepwalking stars, the goddess's mouth—toward a final cadence shift when the fisher releases his daughter's echo and the stars "stayed still." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the protagonist's refusal to turn when "a child's hand" brushes his sleeve forecloses the pursuit with felt cost. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening beat. One persistent pattern break (constellations sleepwalking → snapping into place → will sleepwalk again) tightens the central question and the ending image of mending nets under blackness charges prior material, though the midpoint transition from garden to dock lacks a clear temporal or spatial cue, slightly blurring continuity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is rendered through specific, purposeful detail: grooves that hum, stems swaying to subsonic pulses, soil that refuses to hum in one spot. These details constrain the fisher's tactics (he digs where silence appears, drives the spike to silence the goddess) and the rail spike returns warm from the forge, then cold in his pocket, charging the final image. Spatial choreography across garden, tree, hollow, dock remains legible. The "feral lullaby" sensory filter is consistent and voice-appropriate, though the scent of reeds at the end feels slightly convenient as an ambient echo rather than an object with prior setup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to silence the impostor echo wearing his daughter's voice and reclaim agency over grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rail spike strikes the hollow and the goddess's mouth whispers back, forcing the fisher to command silence; this narrows options and the constellations snap into place with visible cost (blackened stems, the echo "too sharp to keep"). The final renunciation—letting the last echo drown—forecloses the thirty-year pursuit. However, the goddess's defeat reads somewhat convenient: "voiced silence... as a command" and she simply "was gone" without prolonged struggle or visible tactical adaptation, slightly undercutting escalation intensity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between echoes to catch and echoes to release, grief as recursive pattern, and the cost of letting silence endure. The rail spike's transformation from tool to talisman, the recurring phrasing "which echoes to catch and which to let drown," and the final image of darkness smiling back all reweight the opening question without moralizing. The phrase "feral lullaby... that rocks cradles and drowns regrets" skirts abstraction but remains grounded in the garden's hum. No overt thematic echo in the final paragraph; the quiet ending—nets mending, lantern extinguished, smile exchanged with the dark—answers the central tension through image and renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains tightly controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: the fisher notices frequencies, gaps in sound, soil vibration. Diction is purposefully compressed and rhythmically varied ("cool-headed even when the sky bled frequencies," "absence of sound become a question"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the goddess encounter and opening slightly at the reflective dock beat. A few lines approach ornamental lyricism—"wet silk," "sleepy giants"—but these remain voice-motivated and do not obscure action. Minor filter-verb density in one passage ("He'd seen it before... patterns break themselves") slightly dulls immediacy but does not pervade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance image, choice, or atmosphere. The paraphrase loop "The choice didn't matter. / What mattered was..." in the penultimate section is a visible scaffold; "He smiled. / It smiled back." reads as template closure cadence. Stock phrasing: "like a plucked string," "like wet silk," "smooth as river stones" are functional but unoriginal. No major causality breaks, and the closure beat remains clear. Overall line-level craft is strong with purposeful compression, but the accumulated minor artifacts and one explicit loop prevent entry into the 7.5+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-as-medium, constellations as animate patterns, and the goddess-of-echoes premise feels specific and non-obvious; the rail spike as both tool and symbolic anchor transforms utility into thematic weight. The closing image—darkness that smiles back—charges prior material with earned inevitability. However, the "grief journey with mystical confrontation" frame follows a recognizable template, and several images (sleepwalking stars, feral lullaby, teeth smooth as river stones) read as evocative but not entirely fresh. The piece commits fully to its premise and takes risk in sustaining metaphor throughout, lifting it within the 7–8 range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cool-headed fisher: present throughout, frames expectation early, drives two major beats (plunging the spike to silence the goddess, releasing the final echo at dock), and his restraint shapes the ending's charge. His observation and composure enable the final renunciation with felt cost (thirty years foreclosed). Swappability is low; a volatile or grief-stricken protagonist would fracture the tone. Introduced in the opening line, involved in mid-conflict pressure, present at closure. Minor deduction: his choices largely flow from established disposition rather than forcing a visible tactical trade-off under competing impulses on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rail spike: introduced early ("beside a rusted rail spike"), used in two distinct beats (struck into earth to scream the garden, plucked free to let the echo bleed), returns cold in his pocket at dock, and the final line proposes melting or reusing it—charged with unresolved potential. Its warmth from the forge and cold burn bookend the piece, and it enables the goddess's defeat. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; removing it would require rewriting the confrontation and ending image. Deduction: its mechanics (why warmth, why cold) remain slightly ornamental rather than causally specified, and the threat "Or he would use it to dig" feels more atmospheric than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations: signaled in paragraph four, used to externalize the pattern-breaking that prompts the fisher's action, and they snap into place after the goddess is silenced, then threaten recurrence at the end. The mechanic shapes one key turn (zigzagging stars correlate with the echo's imposture and seal shut when silence is commanded). However, the constellations function more as atmospheric stakes-marker than direct constraint; the fisher's tactics center on the soil and spike, not the sky. Lyric reprise in the closing beats reweights the cyclical tension but does not charge a final choice with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Transliterates emotions: mentioned once in paragraph two ("Each ripple in the soil transliterated emotions—low thrums of grief, sharp spikes of joy") but never returns or constrains a subsequent beat. The fisher reads the soil's hum and the pebbles spelling his daughter's name, yet the mechanics of transliteration versus ordinary sound remain undifferentiated on the page. No on-page cost or trade-off tied to this trait; it reads as world-building flavor rather than a lever that alters tactics or options. Swappable with "the garden broadcasts emotions as sound" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Zigzag: appears in paragraph four when the constellations' "paths unravel into jagged zigzags," triggering the fisher's recognition that "patterns break themselves" and the world leans toward danger. This observation prompts his decision to act (digging, confronting the goddess). The zigzag signals disorder but does not itself become a tool or mechanic; its primary function is atmospheric diagnosis. Present early, shapes one causal link (seeing the zigzag → driving the spike), and the stars "stuttered" when struck—moderate beat involvement. Swappability: "unraveling" or "fracturing" could serve similarly; the zigzag is apt but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voicing silence: introduced in paragraph ten ("voiced silence, letting the absence of sound become a question"), used twice—first as question to elicit the pebble-name reply, then as command to convulse the goddess's mouth and seal the constellations. The method is signaled, mechanics matter (silence as speech-act under pressure), and it drives the climax. Strong closure linkage and causal necessity; without this method the confrontation lacks mechanism. Deduction: the concept is poetic but the on-page cost or risk of voicing silence (why this works, what it demands of the fisher) remains abstract rather than embodied, and its first use reads slightly convenient—no failed attempt or friction before success.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sound wave garden: introduced in the opening line, anchors all action through the midpoint, supplies the soil that hums and refuses to hum (directing the dig), provides the tree where the daughter is buried, and yields the hollow where the goddess's mouth opens. The garden's restless breathing and subsonic pulse constrain the fisher's movement and tactics. It returns in the penultimate paragraph as the settling "feral lullaby" and frames the cyclical threat. Strong setup, middle use (digging, spike, bleeding echo blackens stems), and closure presence. Irreplaceable; no generic setting could support the sound-emotion mechanics or the goddess's manifestation. Minor deduction: the transition to the dock in the final third shifts setting without clear spatial or temporal anchor, slightly blurring continuity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>When patterns break themselves: stated in paragraph five as the condition that signals danger ("when patterns break themselves, the world leans too close to the edge of meaning") and implicit in the constellations' zigzagging and the garden's restlessness. The timeframe prompts the fisher's action tonight. However, the duration of "tonight" and the sequence of beats (how long the digging, the confrontation, the walk to dock, the mending) remain untracked, and no countdown or escalating temporal pressure tightens decisions on the page. The cyclical threat ("the pattern would break again") recurs at the end but functions thematically rather than as a live clock. Setup and thematic reprise present; middle development as active constraint absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To catch the echo of a goddess: stated early ("He'd spent thirty years chasing that whisper") and dramatized when the pebbles spell the daughter's name, the mouth whispers it back, and the fisher confronts the impostor echo. The motivation drives two beats (digging toward the hollow, commanding silence) and the final renunciation (letting the last echo go) forecloses the quest with felt cost. Internal friction appears in the memory-versus-action contrast and the trade-off between holding and releasing. Deduction: the desire is told more than shown in conflicted micro-choices on the page; the fisher's steady composure flattens the want-versus-cost friction into a linear arc rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Feral lullaby: named once late in the piece ("frequencies settling into a feral lullaby, the kind that rocks cradles and drowns regrets") and implicit in the garden's restless hum, the teeth smooth as river stones, and the dark that "smiled back." Tone is coherent—eerie calm, ritualized grief, quiet menace—and modulates appropriately with pressure (tightening during the goddess encounter, easing at the dock). The oxymoron charges the ending image with the blend of comfort and danger. However, the explicit label arrives late (past midpoint) and the tone operates more through accumulated diction than through a recurring phrase or motif that reweights prior beats. Strong closure linkage; moderate setup and development.</comment>
