<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interior world is vivid and grounded in concrete actions—burning the portrait, scattering ashes with precision, wearing the mask made from her mother's teacup. The sister's accusation and Liora's response ("I reveal what they already were") provide glimpse of internal contradiction, though more micro-choices under pressure would deepen agency. Embodied emotion is strong (the mask's edges biting, the weight shifting), but the peak choice—burning because she "understood him too well"—feels more asserted than dramatized with visible cost in that moment. The renunciation is present but could be more causally earned through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered images—ashes, powder, mask fractures—that accumulate toward a pattern of deliberate dissolution and re-presentation. Orientation anchors (gallery, Liora kneeling, mask, ashes) arrive early and remain stable. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Liora will continue this cycle in the next city, the mirage will hold "for now," and the cost is the perpetual fracture, the itinerant artist who never stops scattering. One meaningful deepening occurs when the powder reshapes the ashes into a recognizable ghost-portrait that patrons will debate. The inferred lens holds; cost is conceptual and felt in the repetition itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vanishing point gallery is vivid—damp plaster, walls that never resolve, thin walls bleeding city noise—and its illusory depth mirrors Liora's practice. The mask, powder vial, and rocking chair function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice: the mask's weight and fractures recur, charging her smile and her act of standing. The chair's final silence marks the end of the cycle's current iteration. The gallery pressures her work by offering patrons who will lean in and debate, making her ephemeral art momentarily legible. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (charcoal stains, porcelain edges pressing temples, dust motes hovering).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to crystallize fleeting emotion through controlled dissolution and viewer perception—"the mirage of safety." One tightening occurs when Liora scatters powder over the ashes, knowing it will last only hours, creating urgency for the patrons' encounter. The reversal is micro: she burned the portrait because understanding was "the enemy of art," converting comprehension into deliberate incompletion. Agency is present in the burning and scattering, though the renunciation of understanding could carry more on-page friction or trade-off. The cost—perpetual motion, never settling—is legible in the final image of her kneeling in the next city. Escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: beauty pieced from shards, truth woven through omission, safety as mirage, meaning in the space between seeing and naming. The mask made from her mother's teacup and the burned portrait both enact the theme without stating it. Liora's practice—burning what she understands, scattering it so viewers almost recognize it—resists tidy resolution and invites lingering reflection. The closing image (kneeling in the next city, mask fitting, fractures catching light, the mirage holding "for now") offers a resonant non-literal answer: impermanence and elision are the only honest preservation. The curator's titles are labeled lies, a meta-commentary that works because it's filtered through Liora's voice. No overt moralizing; complexity sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct—perceptual signature filters through an artist's lens (charcoal stains, the way light catches ash, porcelain refracting patterns). Interiority is concrete ("Understanding was the enemy of art") and voice-motivated. The two lines of dialogue (visitor's question, Liora's reply; sister's accusation, Liora's reply) carry subtext and advance theme without feeling expository. Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to Liora's sensory and interpretive experience. Some phrases approach lyric abstraction ("truth was a shape you had to circle") but remain tethered to her artmaking practice. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do double work (the mask's fractures both physical detail and thematic image). However, several phrases loop or paraphrase: "not by preserving them, but by letting them dissolve in the right way" echoes "not by clinging, but by letting it unravel in a way that felt like choice"; "the mirage of safety" and "safety was just another mirage" restate without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the closing third: "The mask would still fit. / The fractures would still catch the light. / She would still be weaving. / The curator would still call it art." These parallel declaratives stack without variation, dulling momentum at closure. Minor register drift ("the curator would call this piece") toward art-catalog diction. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stack touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—artist creates ephemeral portraits from ash and powder that viewers almost recognize—offers a specific, tactile angle on impermanence and illusion. The mask made from a survivor teacup and the method of controlled burning provide concrete transformation of familiar art-world material. However, the itinerant-artist-scattering-ashes frame and the curator-misnames-the-work beat feel recognizable from experimental literary fiction templates. The emotional calculus (burning what you understand, leaving viewers on the verge of comprehension) is thoughtfully rendered but not wholly surprising. The piece commits to its premise and avoids safety-hedging, yet the synthesis doesn't quite reach inevitability in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora appears early, drives the burning and scattering (two distinct beats), and her choice to burn the portrait because she understood the subject too well shapes the middle action. She decides to leave the ash-portrait for patrons and moves to the next city, a renunciation with cost (perpetual itinerancy). Present in closure. Causal pressure is moderate; the decisions alter tactics but the cost could be more acute. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost +0.4, minus swappability (another artist could perform similar acts) −0.5 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mask is introduced early (paragraph 4), handled across multiple beats (pressing into temples, weight shifting, edges biting, clicking softly, refracting light, fractures catching light in the final third). Its origin (mother's teacup from the fire) ties to backstory and theme. It constrains choice subtly (the physical discomfort, the perceptual filter) and charges the closure image ("The mask would still fit. / The fractures would still catch the light."). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal/constraint +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (shattered porcelain from a survivor object) +0.6, cost +0.4, minus some ornamental description −0.4 = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mirage of safety is named by the curator in paragraph 5 and echoed in the late paragraph ("Safety was just another mirage"). It frames theme and Liora's practice (illusions that dissolve if looked at too long), shaping her method of scattering ashes to be almost-recognizable. However, it does not directly constrain an on-page choice or shift tactics; it remains thematic rather than actionable. Present early enough, reappears at closure to reweight meaning. Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.8, thematic coherence +0.6, closure linkage (concept charges final image) +1.0, minus no causal pressure on choices −1.1 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully, thread by thread, through what you left unsaid" appears in paragraph 6. The attribute shapes her reply to the visitor ("meaning isn't in the image... it's in the space between") and her practice of scattering powder to create incomplete portraits. It constrains method but does not drive a distinct on-page turn with visible cost. Present in one beat (the dialogue), loosely in the powder-scattering beat. Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, thematic fit +0.5, specificity +0.4, minus label-only in some uses −0.3, no sharp cost tied to this trait −0.0 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Powder (ground lapis, crushed pearl, dust of unsent letter) is introduced paragraph 8, scattered in paragraph 14 to hold the ash-portrait's shape for hours, and its fading by morning is noted in the penultimate paragraph. This action creates the ephemeral artwork that patrons will debate, enabling the story's central aesthetic and stakes. Two beats (withdrawal and scattering, then the fading consequence), causal role clear. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage (fading by morning shapes the cycle's impermanence) +1.0, specificity +0.5, cost (impermanence, viewer confusion) +0.4, minus no sharp in-scene friction −0.4 = ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Incomplete information structures the entire practice: Liora burns the half-finished portrait, scatters ashes so viewers "almost recognized it," and uses powder to create transient images that will be debated with "each version more certain than the last." The method is signaled early (paragraph 5: "illusions so delicate they dissolved if you looked too long") and enacted in the powder-scattering and viewer-anticipation beats. It shapes the artwork's reception and the story's stakes. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (drives the aesthetic and viewer friction) +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, minus some thematic overlap with "weaves truth carefully" −0.3 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vanishing point gallery anchors setting from the opening line, provides atmosphere (damp plaster, walls that never resolve, thin walls bleeding city noise), and houses the action. Its vanishing-point illusion mirrors theme. The space enables the artwork and the anticipated patron encounter. However, the gallery does not constrain a choice or shift tactics on the page; it functions as coherent backdrop rather than active pressure. Early signal +0.8, presence across story +0.6, thematic coherence +0.7, closure linkage (implicit in the final cityscape) +0.5, minus no direct choice constraint −1.2 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The rocking chair slows in paragraph 7 and stops in paragraph 12 ("The chair stopped moving. Silence hummed..."), marking a temporal beat. The final mention ("The rocking chair didn't creak again") in paragraph 24 signals the cycle's end. However, the chair's slowing does not tighten decisions or create urgency; it's more atmospheric marker than active clock. Present in three beats, but passive. Early signal +0.5, three mentions +0.6, closure linkage +0.6, thematic fit (stopping = the ephemeral moment crystallized) +0.5, minus no active pressure on tactics −1.4 = ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Liora's motivation—to crystallize fleeting emotion by burning and scattering, creating art that lasts only hours—is dramatized in the portrait-burning, powder-scattering, and anticipation of viewer debate. It drives the central action and shapes her renunciation (burning because she understood too well). Friction appears in her sister's accusation and the admission that understanding is "the enemy of art." The motivation is contested internally and externally. Early signal (implicit in opening action) +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, cost (perpetual itinerancy, never settling) +0.5, minus some abstraction in articulation −0.1 = ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Somber marvel tone is established early (damp plaster, old secrets, charcoal stains, the mask's jagged edges) and sustained through lyric diction, controlled pacing, and the interplay of beauty and pain (porcelain shards, fractured light, the grave-like snow of powder). The tone modulates subtly: quiet determination in the scattering, wry distance in the curator's misnaming, melancholy in the closing cycle. It charges the final image (kneeling in the next city, the mask fitting, the mirage holding "for now"). Early coherence +0.8, modulation under pressure +0.7, closure charge +1.2, specificity +0.6, minus occasional drift toward abstraction −0.0 = ~7.3.</comment>
