<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tuner's motivation is embodied through his patient, deliberate walking and fork-striking, but internal contradiction is absent—he moves with unwavering confidence rather than genuine struggle. The final moment ("the scales felt even") edges toward label-speak rather than dramatized cost. Interiority remains atmospheric and consistent but lacks the complexity of competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The single-POV lens is stable, with no secondary characters generating pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered sensory callbacks (shutter, chime, well, child's laughter) that reweight the dominant stake of revival. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the tuner stops, the town exhales, and the final image ("Balance... was a thing you kept") crystallizes the ongoing cost and reconfigures the initial archway tension without requiring a decisive physical act. One meaningful deepening—from silence to chorus—is sufficient at this length, and the cost (endless walking, "the work was not done") is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archway, cobblestones, and well function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the action: the archway "deciding whether to stand or surrender" pressures the tuner's pace, and the cobblestones warming underfoot signals revival progress. Sensory selection is strong (rust and gold light, scent of bread, thin voice) and filtered through the tuner's professional attention. The final image of laughter from a silent street reweights prior atmospheric detail. The setting actively participates in escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (revival of the town) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archway groans and the tuner quickens his pace, narrowing options and raising temporal pressure. The protagonist's agency—walking with deliberate rhythm, striking the fork at the well—drives the accumulation. Cost is legible in the final reflection ("the work was not done—it never would be") and the implicit eternal vigilance required. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening from "wild hush" to "golden fire" and child's laughter reweights the stake with felt endurance cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (balance as maintenance, not achievement) emerges through the tuner's repeated walking and the archway's groaning, avoiding direct statement until the earned final reflection. The closing insight ("Balance... was a thing you kept") arises from concrete struggle on the page rather than assertion. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic summary ("the scales felt even") that slightly dilutes the prior image work. The piece resists tidy morals by leaving the work unfinished, but the articulation of theme in the penultimate beat reduces resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated, precise diction ("gaunt figure," "wild hush," "stubborn faith") remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance is stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in the tuner's professional filtering (noting the fork's weight, the resonance felt rather than heard). Rhythm modulates purposefully, accelerating when the archway groans and slowing at the final image. The single line of dialogue ("You're late" / "I know") carries subtext and advances plot without disrupting the narrative texture. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively (short bursts "He was infinitely patient" alternate with longer architectural sentences), and information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or plot. Minor scaffold appears in repetitive stems: "He passed... He paused... He quickened" in successive paragraphs creates template cadence. The metaphor "skeleton... bones... breath" is coherent, and figurative density (fork "smooth as still water," pulse "like the pulse of a heart remembered") enhances rather than obscures. The loop penalty is modest (−0.4) because it does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of "bell tuner" + "footstep rhythm" + "ghost town" is specific and non-obvious, with the revival mechanism (sonic memory) feeling earned rather than convenient. The trade-off between patient accumulation and the archway's imminent collapse creates genuine tension. However, the core frame (magical artisan revives a liminal space through specialized craft) echoes familiar fantasy templates, and the transformation relies more on atmospheric execution than a bold structural or moral gamble. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative design but does not radically heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bell tuner present from the opening, makes repeated choices (walking deliberately, striking fork at well, quickening pace when archway groans) that drive the accumulation and shape the ending. His decisions alter tactics under pressure. Integration is strong across setup, development, and closure; the tuner's agency is causal within the Accumulative lens. Score reflects solid beat involvement and closure linkage but stops short of indispensability because the character's interior life lacks the friction that would make removal structurally catastrophic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ebony tuning fork introduced in opening paragraph, used three times on the page (temple, well rim, final beat), with each use generating a distinct effect (initial hum, water resonance, dissolving voice into laughter). The fork's physical properties (weight, smoothness) are specified and its ritual use constrains the tuner's method. Appears in the ending beat ("still humming in his grip") and its resonance directly enables the revival. Strong integration: setup, multiple beats, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. Not quite indispensable because the story could function with a different ritual object, but causal pressure is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the dominant stake, signaled immediately ("town... holding its breath, waiting... to wake it") and sustained through every beat: shutter creaking, chime shivering, footsteps echoing, windows lighting. The concept shapes all tactics (walking rhythm, fork strikes) and the ending's charge (child's laughter, ongoing work). Removal would collapse the story's logic entirely. The concept is not merely thematic but operationalized on the page through sensory accumulation and the archway's conditional stability. Essential across setup, development, and closure with high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" trait is stated once in exposition ("He was infinitely patient, a man who understood...") and demonstrated through deliberate walking and repeated attempts without frustration. However, the trait is not tested by a competing urgency that would reveal its cost; the archway's groaning prompts him to quicken, not abandon patience. The attribute enables the accumulative method but lacks a dramatized tradeoff where patience forecloses a faster, riskier path. Functional and present but replaceable with "deliberate" or "methodical" without structural loss. Lyric setup → ending persistence qualifies for mid-band but not higher without friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rebuild" signaled in the opening act ("revival... not a shout but a rhythm") and operationalized through walking, fork-striking, and sensory accumulation (shutter, chime, well, laughter). The action is not literal construction but symbolic restoration, which fits the Accumulative lens. Major turns (well resonance, archway groaning, windows lighting) trace directly to the rebuild effort. The final reflection ("the work was not done") ties the action to closure. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the action's method is somewhat abstract—removing "rebuild" would require reframing but not full collapse. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Footsteps-on-cobblestones method introduced early ("each step a metronome ticking the dead town back to life") and sustained as the primary mechanism: "sound rippled outward," "Footsteps echoed where no one walked," cobblestones warming, rhythm synchronizing. The method constrains tactics (must walk, must maintain rhythm) and enables all escalation beats. Final line ("when the sun rose, he would walk again") directly ties the method to ongoing cost and closure. The mechanics matter throughout; removing the footstep-rhythm would break causality. Setup, development, and closure participation all present with high causal pressure and specificity. Indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ancient archway present in the opening line, provides spatial anchor, and returns at a key turn ("The archway groaned... deciding whether to stand or surrender") that pressures the tuner to quicken his pace. It reappears in resolution ("The archway held"). The setting element constrains the timeframe ("before the collapse") and charges the stakes. However, the archway functions more as a symbolic deadline than a physical resource or obstacle that alters tactics in multiple beats. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development is thinner. Solid integration with causal pressure but not indispensable—another crumbling landmark could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" timeframe is signaled ("holding its breath, waiting") and the archway's groaning creates urgency ("deciding whether to stand or surrender"), but the clock is not tracked with escalating precision. The tuner quickens his pace once, then the archway simply "held" at closure without a final countdown or visible near-miss. Time pressure exists but does not tighten choices across multiple beats or alter tactics beyond one acceleration. The timeframe frames the stakes but is not actively deployed as a constraint that shapes the ending's cost. Functional with setup and one development beat; closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Restore shared balance" motivation introduced in the opening reflection ("revival... a conversation") and made concrete through the tuner's walking, fork-striking, and the final articulation ("the scales felt even"). The desire is dramatized through repeated attempts and the friction between progress (laughter, lit windows) and incompleteness ("the work was not done—it never would be"). The motivation shapes the ending directly. However, there is minimal on-page conflict between the tuner's wants and competing costs; he proceeds steadily without internal doubt or sacrifice. Desire is clear and closure-linked but lacks the friction between want and fear that would elevate it. Setup, development, and closure all present; causal pressure is solid.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Wild hush" tone established in the opening ("wild hush of a place holding its breath") and sustained through layered paradoxes: silence that listens, dust that shifts reluctantly, shadows stretching. The tone modulates with pressure—quiet shutter creak, low water resonance, thin voice, bright laughter—while maintaining coherent atmospheric control. The final image (child's laughter "bright and unbroken" in a street "that had known only silence") reweights the opening hush with charged contrast. Tone is not static; it deepens and inverts at closure without breaking. Setup, development, and closure participation all strong with high specificity and irreplaceability. Nearly indispensable; removing "wild hush" would flatten the story's atmospheric engine.</comment>
