<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's mnemonic gift is mentioned but never constrains a choice with visible cost; the interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("the gift was a curse") without embodied contradiction acting in scene. The final painting sequence offers embodied emotion through physical action (knees hitting stone, arms burning), and the renunciation of charcoal for color reads as earned by accumulated pressure. Minor slip: the mother's voice from the lock feels convenient rather than motivated by prior dramatization of the mnemonic trait.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through sensory density and metaphoric layering until the lock-painting interaction triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the door/tapestry image reweights suppressed creativity with visible cost: leaving the lantern, accepting the feral brightness). Orientation anchors cleanly (cave, Elias, post-funeral). One meaningful deepening occurs when the lock's dial is turned "to a memory" and the painting splits—this reweights the dominant stake (uncorking creativity) and forecloses the old, sketched life. Cost is legible: he leaves the lantern and climbs with color-smudged fingers, proof of irreversible change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cave's crystals, amethyst vein, and stalactites supply concrete sensory anchors and constrain the painting's discovery. The lock pressed against the amethyst vein is a spatial choice that enables the split; the hollow behind the stone matters causally. Micro-setting (cave as body/tool surrogate) charges the final image: "the cave was singing with him, the crystals humming as the paint bled into the stone." The environment is lived-in and purposeful, never postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (uncork suppressed creativity) signals early and tightens once when Elias presses the lock to the painting and turns the dial "to a memory"—this narrows options from safe charcoal to irreversible color. The cost is visible: arms burning, leaving the lantern, ascending with color-stained fingers. No second reversal is required at this length. Minor gap: the mother's paint tubes resolve a problem (lack of color) they did not help create on the page, slightly softening agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (suppressed creativity vs. inherited duty) emerges through the lock, the cave painting, and the final door image without overt statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the door/tapestry reweights the calling from inescapable curse to owned inheritance. Small deduction: "uncork something feral and bright" and "half-living" trend slightly abstract; the piece could gain resonance by trusting the color-smudged rungs alone to carry the transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices shadows, charcoal, and "prismatic ghosts" in character-specific ways. Distance modulates purposefully from tight interiority ("his knees hit the damp stone") to reflective summary ("the calling wasn't inescapable anymore"). No head-hopping. Minor slip: "the exact angle of his mother's wrist the day she'd left" is told memory without present anchor, but it lands briefly and primes the lock's function, so BRR allowance applies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short bursts at the lock turn: "The cave groaned. The painting's surface rippled..."; longer lyric sentences in reflection). Information density is high in the painting-split sequence. Two small issues: "colors he'd never been brave enough to use" and "half-breathed idea" are near-synonyms for the same suppression concept within two paragraphs (paraphrase loop, −0.2). "The last echo wasn't laughter this time. It was the sound of a seal breaking" repeats the echo frame without adding pressure (−0.2 cumulative). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis (mnemonic artist + lock as emotional key + cave painting with hidden supplies) feels specific and purposeful. The lock-as-memory-dial transformation is a fresh inflection. Small deduction: the cave-as-creative-womb and art-as-liberation premises are familiar; the story executes them well but does not radically transform the template. The mother's paint tubes arriving precisely when needed trends slightly convenient, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: present from the opening ("charcoal against paper," "fingers perpetually stained black"). Development: his choice to use paint instead of charcoal at the lock-painting moment alters tactics. Payoff: "fingers left smudges of color on the rungs" signals the transformation. Two beats (sketching refusal, painting act) and closure linkage present. Causal pressure is moderate: the artist role enables the painting but does not narrow options under stress until the final third. Swappability: another creative role (sculptor, poet) could serve with edits. Score: two gates + closure linkage + moderate causal work = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early ("broken combination lock in his palm"). Development: pressed against the amethyst vein, turned "to a memory" to trigger the painting's split—this narrows options and enables the paint discovery. Payoff: "The lock fell from his hand, its purpose fulfilled." Three beats (holding, pressing/turning, falling) with distinct causal roles. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability (the lock's dial-as-memory mechanism is unique). Cost: the lock's fall symbolizes foreclosed past. Only minor gap: the lock could have constrained an earlier choice to push higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "inescapable calling" framed early via "every unfinished sketch" and the father's locksmith duties. Development: implicit in the cave descent and painting obsession. Payoff: "The calling wasn't inescapable anymore. It was his." Cost is felt (leaving the lantern, color-stained fingers). Two-gate participation with lyric reprise that reweights the stake. However, the concept shapes theme more than on-page tactics; no moment where "inescapable" pressure visibly narrows a choice. Swappability: "suppressed ambition" or "inherited duty" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: "mnemonically gifted" mentioned early. Development: the lock's dial is turned "to a memory"—this beat nods to the gift but does not show cost or constraint (any emotional trigger could work). Payoff: absent from closure. One weak beat, no visible tradeoff. The trait is label-only; removing it would not break the story's logic. Cap at 4.6 (missing payoff) and apply ornamental deduction (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "to *rectify* the lock" signaled in first third. Development: the rectify action (pressing lock to painting, turning dial to memory) triggers the painting's split and the paint discovery—this narrows options and shifts tactics from charcoal to color. Payoff: lock falls, "purpose fulfilled." Two beats with causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor swappability: "unlock" or "release" could serve with edits, and the action overlaps heavily with the lock object (9B), slightly reducing unique irreplaceability. Still essential to the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: ancient painting behind stalactites introduced early ("he'd found it years ago"). Development: painting's surface ripples and splits when lock is pressed to it, revealing the hollow—mechanics shape the turn. Payoff: "the wall held not a portrait, but a door" reweights the painting's meaning and charges the closure image. Three beats (discovery memory, split, door transformation) with high causal pressure and irreplaceability. The painting-with-hollow mechanism is indispensable; no substitute works without full rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "subterranean crystal cave" anchored immediately. Development: cave's amethyst vein enables the lock-painting interaction; crystals "humming" as paint bleeds into stone supplies texture that charges the final act. Payoff: "the belly of the earth" and ascending with color smudges tie setting to transformation. The cave supplies resources (vein, hollow, acoustic resonance) that alter tactics and outcome. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; only minor swappability (another hidden space could serve with significant edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Setup: "after the last echo of laughter fades" opens the story. Development: no urgency or tightening tied to elapsed time; the painting sequence could unfold over minutes or hours without change. Payoff: "The last echo wasn't laughter this time" reprises the frame but does not reweight a stake with cost—it's decorative. One weak beat (opening frame), no clock pressure. Swappable with "after the funeral" or "at dusk" without structural loss. Cap at 4.6 (missing development), apply ornamental deduction (−0.5), lyric-reprise allowance raises floor slightly to ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: suppressed creativity signaled early ("every unfinished sketch," "safe, controlled, monochrome"). Development: choice to squeeze paint onto fingers and press to wall dramatizes the desire under friction (arms burning, visible cost). Payoff: ascending with color smudges, "it would never let him go back to half-living." Two beats with embodied conflict and closure linkage. Felt cost present. Minor gap: the desire is more narrated than contested by a live obstacle on the page; the father's death removes external duty rather than forcing a trade-off in scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: tone ("drip of mineral water," "wet stone and something older") establishes sorrow and luminous possibility early. Development: tone modulates from grief ("after the funeral, after the neighbors' hollow condolences") to ecstatic release ("the cave was singing with him"). Payoff: "The dark didn't scare him anymore" and color-smudged rungs charge the final image with earned brightness. Coherent through turns, modulates with pressure. One friction: "auroral sorrow" as a label does not appear on the page; the effect is earned through action and image, not stated, which strengthens execution but leaves the exact prompt phrase absent.</comment>
