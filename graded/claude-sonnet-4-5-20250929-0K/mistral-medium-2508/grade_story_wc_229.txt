<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is embodied through sensory cues (lavender exhale, cork texture) and contradictory impulses (need to prove versus fear of ridicule). His motivation to beckon the boats back through whispers rather than shouting drives concrete micro-choices. Harkin's arc from skepticism to recognition is earned through the cork's tactile proof. Minor slip: the dream sequence at the end tilts slightly toward label-only resolution rather than sustained contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias moves from needing the cork as proof to embodying the whisper himself, with visible cost (the cork's work is done; now he must tend the metaphorical garden). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern, density increase, and cadence shift reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boats turn, then Harkin's recognition crystallizes the shift from proving to embodying intent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse and lantern room constrain choice: Elias must use its bones and vibrations to beckon the boats. Dawn's pale light and spent oil charge the opening and final images. The cork's tactile ridges and the harbor's spatial choreography remain clear. Does not reach 9-band: the lighthouse functions primarily as metaphor rather than imposing a physical constraint that alters the final tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—is signaled early and tightens when the boats turn, then deepens when Harkin pockets the cork with recognition. Escalation is accumulative: vibrations → exhaled scent → boats turning → Harkin's transformation → Elias no longer needing the cork. Cost is legible: Elias must relinquish the proof and step into embodied action. Minor gap: the fishermen's muttering about dreams is recounted rather than dramatized, softening the pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—intent as whisper versus shout—emerges through concrete particulars: cork, vibrations, scent, boats, garden. The final image (tending the garden) reweights prior material without stated moral. Subtext operates in Harkin's wordless recognition and the fishermen's slower hands. No thematic echo in the final paragraph. One minor slip: "Whispers travel farther" is articulated mid-story in free indirect style, which risks stating rather than earning the thesis, though the closure image rescues it by shifting from proving to embodying.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature is consistent (sensory focus on vibrations, scent, tactile cork). Elias's diction—"vibrations of intent," "screaming only in its precision"—is poetic but coherent with his introspective character. Harkin's dialogue ("You been messing with the horn again?") and his lack of articulation at the recognition beat distinguish him. Minor slip: the phrase "the kind that comes when a man realizes" in Harkin's moment leans slightly explanatory rather than fully trusting embodied gesture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>High information density and varied rhythm; most lines do multiple jobs. Opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor overwriting in several beats: "deliberate as a held breath," "tender, screaming only in its precision," "thick and sweet, though the lighthouse garden had been dead for decades" stack figurative language without clear payoff in a single passage. One paraphrase loop: "the scent of crushed lavender and damp earth—the garden's memory" restates without added pressure. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis of lighthouse setting, sensory beckoning, and the whisper-versus-shout premise. The cork as inherited purifier and the vibrations-of-intent concept are non-obvious. Minor derivative element: the mentor-figure recognizing the apprentice's gift after initial skepticism is a familiar arc. The piece commits fully to its lyric register and executes the accumulative design cleanly, but the transformation relies on established tropes (proving the doubter wrong, finding one's voice) without a bold structural or moral risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (assistant keeper) drives all key beats: exhaling scent to beckon boats, holding out the cork to Harkin, and turning back to the lantern in the closure beat. His choices narrow options (relinquishing the cork, stepping into embodied practice). Present in setup, middle, and ending; indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vial cork appears early ("sat in his pocket"), is handled mid-scene ("rolled it between his fingers"), is offered to Harkin (tactile proof), and its symbolic work is completed in the ending ("didn't need the cork anymore"). Functions causally across three beats and charges the closure image. High irreplaceability: its tactile warmth and inherited purifying attribute matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Vibrations of intent" is named early, felt by Elias in the lighthouse bones, and dramatized when the boats respond to his exhaled scent. Shapes the middle beat (the boats turning) and returns in the ending ("no longer resistant, but resonant"). Functions across two beats with closure linkage, but the concept remains somewhat abstract—its mechanics are asserted more than concretely shown altering a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Purifies whatever it touches, distilling desire into something true" is attributed to the cork early. The trait enables Elias's belief and Harkin's recognition, but the purifying action is mostly metaphorical: no visible cost or constraint tied to the purification itself is dramatized. Present in setup and middle; closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Beckon" is the story's central action: Elias beckons the boats back with exhaled scent and the quiet pull of whispers. The boats' turning is the story's first major turn; the beckoning redefines Elias's relationship to proof and power. Indispensable; swapping it would collapse the premise. Present in setup (framed as need), middle (enacted), and ending (embodied without the cork).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"By the scent of a garden at night" (crushed lavender, damp earth, night-blooming jasmine) is the method Elias uses to beckon. Signaled early via his mother's garden memory, enacted mid-scene ("exhaling the scent"), and returns in Harkin's recognition beat (jasmine scent). Shapes two beats and charges the closure symbolically. Slightly lower because the scent's mechanics are more evocative than concretely shown altering a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors the opening image, supplies the vibrating bones Elias listens to, and the lantern room is the vantage from which he watches the boats. Dawn's spent oil charges the closure image. Present in setup and ending; the lighthouse's physical properties (iron ribs, spiral stairs) constrain staging. Does not reach higher: the lighthouse is more symbolic scaffold than a resource that alters a tactic under physical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the heat wave breaks" appears in the opening line and sets atmospheric relief, but the timeframe does not constrain decisions or create urgency. The story's timeline is elastic (three weeks of listening, then morning, then night); no ticking clock alters tactics. Present but ornamental; easily swappable with another weather shift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To prove that whispers travel farther than shouts" is Elias's explicit motivation, dramatized through his choice to exhale scent rather than use the foghorn. The desire is conflicted (fear of Harkin's ridicule versus need for validation) and drives the middle beat (boats turning). Closure shifts from proving to embodying. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; slight reduction because the motivation is articulated in exposition mid-story rather than purely inferred from action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Screaming tenderness" is embodied in paradoxical images: "tender, screaming only in its precision," the knife metaphor, the "clean, bright ache of dawn." Tone modulates from quiet listening to the taut moment of beckoning to the soft recognition scene with Harkin. Coherent through turns and charges the final image (tending the garden). Does not reach higher bands: the tone is asserted in one line ("screaming only in its precision") more than it organically arises from every syntactic and image choice across the arc.</comment>
