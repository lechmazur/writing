<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior voice carries distinct texture ("serenely electric," the unlearning approach), but her final leap reads as unmotivated by prior causality—gravity reversal arrives without setup or earned cost. The mentor's teaching is told rather than shown shaping a present micro-choice. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from doubt to laughter without embodied struggle, and the jump feels like concept assertion rather than character-driven necessity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural design with charged images (fragment, dish, tower song), but the closure—Elara jumping and reversing gravity—lacks causal setup or felt cost. The fragment's "weight reversal" is introduced only at the leap, reading as a late rule change that solves a conceptual problem it did not help create. Orientation is delayed (who/where emerges gradually but lunar perigee anchors time early enough); however, the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure because the jump's stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted observation deck, skeletal transmitters, cracked parabola dish, and gorge are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail. The tower's spiral stairs and the statue's outstretched hand provide spatial grounding that charges the fragment's return. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure—the jump occurs in open air without environmental pressure—so it remains atmospheric rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tuning the unheard frequency—is signaled early, but escalation is thin: Elara climbs, places the fragment, the dish shatters, the note persists. No reversal narrows her options; the shattering appears catastrophic but immediately reveals it was not. The jump at closure lacks visible cost because gravity's reversal is asserted, not earned, and her laughter flattens the moment's stakes rather than charging them.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme—"the beginning hidden inside every ending"—emerges through the fragment's Big Bang echo and the city's song, avoiding overt thesis. The final image attempts resonance but the jump and gravity reversal land as abstraction rather than earned particulars. "To hear the unheard, she had to become the silence" approaches moralizing; the piece resists full articulation yet the conceptual repricing feels asserted rather than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric ("shard of hush," "serenely electric"), with purposeful compression and metaphoric density. POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. However, elevated diction ("the sound of the universe listening to itself") occasionally drifts from the concrete perceptual frame, and peak beats favor abstraction over embodied perception. The final paragraph's register ("stupid, beautiful truth") shifts toward meta-commentary without full grounding in Elara's idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense ("drunken sentinels," "lightning made gentle," "gorge swallowed her laughter and spat it back as light") and occasionally mixed (how does a gorge spit laughter as light?). Paraphrase loops appear: "not absence, but a presence" followed by "the kind that lived in the pause" restates without added pressure. Syntactic variety is present, but metaphoric coherence slips in peak beats, and the final image's vehicle (air/laughter/light transformation) lacks physical logic within the established world rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The celestial signal interpreter, fake-star relic, and abandoned radio city offer a fresh synthesis. The mentor's method of "unlearning" and the concept of "the universe listening to itself" show thematic ambition. However, the gravity reversal at closure echoes fantasy convenience tropes without transformation, and the "beginning in every ending" frame, while poetic, does not fully avoid abstraction. The piece takes risks with lyric compression but the final leap's lack of causal grounding limits its inevitability in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara climbs, places the fragment, and jumps—three beats. Her choices (climbing, tuning by unlearning, jumping) are on the page, but the jump feels conceptual rather than causally motivated by prior beats. Early signal is strong (first paragraph); closure linkage is present but the leap's logic is asserted rather than earned. Swappability is low (the role is specific), yet causal pressure is weak because the jump does not narrow options so much as declare them resolved.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fragment appears in five beats: pocket hum (opening), pressed into dish, tumbles, found in statue's hand, pocketed again. Early signal, recurring use with reweighted meaning (weight reversal), and closure linkage are present. However, the weight reversal is introduced only at the jump without prior setup, limiting causal irreplaceability. The fragment drives the tuning attempt but its final property (gravity inversion) arrives late, capping integration despite strong reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" is named once and echoed in "the note...humming in her bones," framing the silence-as-presence theme. It shapes stakes (finding the unheard frequency) but does not constrain on-page choices—Elara's method (unlearning) and the fragment's mechanics do the causal work. The concept is more thematic ornament than tactical driver, appearing in setup and thematic reflection but not forcing a mid-scene trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the fragment's hum (twice) and the air at the jump. It labels texture but does not enable or constrain an action with cost. No visible trade-off hinges on this quality; it could be replaced with another synesthetic descriptor without altering choices. Ornamental use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tuning drives the central action: Elara tunes by "unlearning," not by turning knobs. The method is signaled early and enacted at the dish. However, the tuning succeeds immediately (the note spills, the dish shatters but the sound persists), so the action does not generate a costly reversal or failed attempt that would deepen stakes. It shapes the middle beat and closure linkage (the hum in her bones) but could be generalized to "listen" or "open" without fundamental breakage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"By discarding assumptions" is named in the opening and enacted once: she tunes "not by turning knobs but by unlearning" and stops searching to find. The method is signaled but its mechanics are abstract—what specific assumption does she discard at the dish? The jump at closure asserts the method's success (gravity was an assumption) without showing the on-page cost of unlearning. One causal beat, but swappable with "surrender" or "trust."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The radio tower city, gorge, spiral stairs, cracked dish, and statue are vividly rendered and drive spatial progression. The dish's heart holds the fragment (middle beat), the statue's hand returns it (closure beat), and the gorge amplifies the city's song. However, the setting does not constrain the jump—Elara leaps into open air without environmental cost or obstacle. Strong setup and middle involvement, but closure participation is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is named in the opening ("Tonight was lunar perigee...the air thrummed") and motivates the timing, but no on-page clock tightens decisions. The moon "swelling close enough to whisper" and pulling the city's harmonic resonance shape atmosphere, yet Elara's choices (climb, tune, jump) are not time-pressured. Setup is present; middle and closure lack temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated as Elara's inheritance (mentor's chase) and enacted thematically: the fragment forged in a Big Bang set carries "creation's first gasp," and her realization that "the beginning had been here all along, disguised as an end." However, this motivation is told and reflected rather than dramatized in a conflicted choice. No on-page moment shows her weighing this desire against a cost; it remains thematic gloss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tone blends lyric metaphor ("serenely electric," "shard of hush") with grounded detail (rusted tower, spiral stairs, cracked dish), creating a fantasy-practical register. However, the final paragraph's laughter and light transformation ("the gorge swallowed her laughter and spat it back as light") tilts fully into abstraction, and the jump's whimsy ("stupid, beautiful truth," gravity reversal) undercuts the prior practical grounding. Coherent through the climb, but modulation at closure flattens rather than charges the stakes.</comment>
