<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and embodied—the prism's warmth, the stone's weight—and his micro-choices (selecting the stone, aligning the prism) reveal a hierarchy of values. The daughter's absence creates a credible loss that shapes his ritual without over-articulation. Minor weakness: the communion moment edges toward stock phrasing ("the way he always did before the world shifted"), but the ending choice to reach for the next stone earns the renunciation of waiting. No diagnostic label-speak mars the peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—stone, ripples, light—and the closure reweights the ritual through the act of reaching for the next stone, foreclosing passive vigil with felt cost. Orientation anchors (Elias, atrium, dawn) land by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening: the ripples "read" the harbor's memory and worry, then Elias's breath, building density that charges the final turn. Cost is legible in "the world shifted—just as it always did—around the quiet certainty of the atrium's light" followed by his return to motion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The atrium's glass walls, central pool, and mist function as micro-setting that constrains Elias's ritual and charges the closure. The prism he aligns "warmed" and "pressed against the glass wall" is handled twice with evolving purpose. Sensory hierarchy is strong: salt, damp glass, mist curling. The spatial choreography (dock, walkway, atrium, pool) remains coherent. The stone's sinking and lingering ripples supply a concrete anchor for the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elias's need to sustain meaning in the mundane ritual before the day's uncertainty. The stone drop deepens pressure—ripples become "noctilucent reckonings" that forecast tide generosity and wind turn—narrowing his options to accept what the patterns reveal. The reaching for the next stone at closure is agency as endurance, foreclosing hope that the ritual might end. One tightening is sufficient for this length; visible cost (continuing despite the daughter's absence) is on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the prism/stone/ripple particulars: "some things are meant to be seen slowly" and "the mundane could hold meaning" are tested by the daughter's absence and Elias's persistence. The final image—"turned toward the sound of voices, already reaching for the next stone"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: meaning persists through repetition, not revelation. Subtext operates in the daughter's letter ("I miss the way the light moves there") and Elias's silence. No moralizing; the atrium's glow "pulsed once, like a heartbeat" charges the concept without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with a distinct perceptual signature: he notices weight, texture, light refraction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully ("He wasn't praying. He was communing"). Diction fits a glazier's idiom ("oilcloth apron," "noctilucent reckonings" attributed to the daughter, not Elias). Minor slip: "as if the world were too tired to be sharp" in the opening risks elevated lyricism outside Elias's likely lexicon, though it's framed as the daughter's question. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or pressure. Minor loop: "the mist rose, and the world shifted—just as it always did" near the end echoes earlier phrasing without adding new pressure (−0.2). One template-cadence run: "He'd built it... He'd chosen it... He wasn't praying... He always did" clusters pronoun + verb stems across four moves (−0.4). No figurative muddle; metaphors (mist like a held breath, atrium like a lung) are coherent. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The glazier-as-diviner synthesis and the prism atrium feel fresh and specific to this voice. The ripples-as-harbor-memory mechanic is purposeful rather than ornamental. Risk: the lyric accumulation and quiet ending could feel static, but the piece commits fully and the final reach for the next stone reweights the ritual. Proximity check passes; no echo of famous lines. The premise transforms the "paying attention" trope through glass-working particulars and the daughter's absence, avoiding template middles.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias signals early (end of first third), drives the stone-drop beat and prism-alignment beat, and the final reach for the next stone is his choice. Cost: continuing the ritual despite the daughter's absence. Causal pressure is present but mid-range; his observation feeds decision but the turn is quiet.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The prism atrium appears in paragraph one, is entered and used (aligning the new prism) in the middle, and the atrium's glow "pulsed once" charges the closure. Handled across three beats with evolving function. Irreplaceability is high—glass and light mechanics are specific to Elias's craft.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Noctilucent reckonings" is named once, attributed to the daughter, and labels the ripples' meaning. It does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted function; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elias "read them like lines in a letter" (the ripples) signals the trait early and it enables the forecast (tide generous, wind turns). Cost is oblique—his reading commits him to continue the ritual—but the trait is more label than lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Commune" is named mid-story and dramatized in the stone-drop and prism-alignment beats. The final reach for the next stone extends the communion into the new day. Two beats plus closure participation; causal pressure is moderate. Swappability test: "ritual" or "meditation" could substitute with minor edits, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stone breaks the pool's surface early; ripples are read ("the first ring... second... third") in the middle beat, shaping Elias's forecast. The method appears at closure ("the ripples lingered, ghostly and precise") and he reaches for the next stone. Three beats, mechanics matter, cost tied to persistence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Pearl Bay at dawn anchors orientation in paragraph one, the mist and tide pressure the ritual's meaning, and the first boat's return at dawn confirms Elias's forecast. The bay "exhaled" at closure. Setting drives tactics (the atrium built to hold light, the pool's stillness) and charges the final image. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Before everything shifts" signals early (title echo in "before the world shifted"). Dawn's "first light" and "by noon" create a ticking frame; the first boat returns as predicted, proving the ritual's timing. The clock shapes Elias's urgency and the closure ("the day began"). Cost: the ritual must occur in this narrow window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To illuminate value in the mundane" is dramatized in Elias's stone-drop and his answer to the daughter ("Only if you count paying attention"). The final reach for the next stone enacts the motivation. Friction is present—he continues despite her absence—but the want is more stated than conflicted in choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Clear complexity" coheres through lyric precision ("liquid silver," "noctilucent reckonings") and contradictory texture (mist that blurs, prisms that clarify). Tone modulates with pressure: calm in the opening, tightens at the stone drop, breathes at the boat's return. The final image—sound of voices, reaching for the next stone—holds the tone's charge without resolving ambiguity.</comment>
