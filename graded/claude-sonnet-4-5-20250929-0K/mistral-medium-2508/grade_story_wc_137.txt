<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's skepticism is established early and her grief for her brother motivates her actions throughout. The internal contradiction between disbelief and yearning ("she scoffed at magic, but the tile's weight in her palm felt like an answer") drives her choices. However, the final transformation feels rushed—her shift from skeptic to "cartographer of echoes" lacks visible struggle in the peak moment. The brother's apparition arrives without her earning it through sufficient on-page resistance or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are present early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through whale song, tile symbols, and memory fragments. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes a "cartographer of echoes"), but the cost is asserted rather than felt—her skepticism dissolves without visible friction at the climactic beat. The tile glows, the brother appears, and she accepts it; no tactical foreclosure or price paid in the moment weakens the closure's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower, tide pools, and telescope are vividly rendered with sensory detail (salt wind, whale songs vibrating through stone, bioluminescent waves). The tower's open structure subtly mirrors Liora's willingness to receive memory. The tile's obsidian texture and warmth return with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains her work (the tower as a liminal space) and the final image of the open door charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding a way to hold her brother's memory—is signaled early and sustained. The tile's discovery and her transcription attempt provide escalation beats. However, the key turn (symbols glowing, brother appearing) arrives through the tile's magic rather than Liora's choice under pressure. The whale song crescendos and "space stretched," but Liora's agency in that moment is passive observation. One meaningful tightening occurs (her decision to press her palm to the tile), but the cost of that choice is not legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery: grief as waves, transcription as door-making, listening as courage. The tile functions as a key rather than magic, which coheres with the skeptic premise. The final insight ("the magic wasn't in the tile, but in the transcribing") feels earned by her actions. However, the penultimate paragraphs drift into thematic summary ("she had been a skeptic / Now she was a cartographer of echoes") that borders on moralizing. The sea/stars/symphony triad in the final third reads as stacked declarations rather than emergent resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (astronomer's precision, grief-sharpened attention). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("gas and fire," "off-key while mending nets"). The brother's brief dialogue feels natural and character-specific. However, the prose drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("entangled memories pressing against the walls," "unheard symphony no human ear was meant to hear") that strains the established voice. Brief filter-verb stacks ("she didn't look away," "she didn't need") in the climax slightly dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The opening establishes voice and stakes cleanly. However, paraphrase loops appear: "she didn't believe" / "she scoffed at magic" / "she'd been a skeptic" restates the same content across the arc. Template cadence in the final third ("She had been... Now she was... And the world...") creates a drumbeat rhythm. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats ("bioluminescent waves," "wax under flame," "salt in rain") without fresh specificity. These artifacts in the closure third trigger the high-band disallowance and apply approximately −1.0 cumulative penalty in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of astronomer-skeptic, grief artifact, and transcription as magical act offers a fresh angle on the grief-and-memory premise. The tile as "key to places grief couldn't reach" rather than summoning device shows thematic specificity. However, the core emotional arc (skeptic learns to listen/feel) is familiar, and the final image of the open tower inviting "the next lost soul" gestures toward universality without transforming the template. The whale migration and magic-square tile provide distinctive texture but do not fundamentally alter the recognizable journey from skepticism to acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Liora's skepticism is present throughout and frames her initial reluctance, but her choices at key turns are reactive rather than driving. She finds the tile, traces symbols, presses her palm—each a response to external cues (tile's weight, parchment fluttering, symbols glowing). Her decision to "let the parchment drift" and "stay until dawn" occurs after the brother's appearance, not as agency that earns it. The character trait shapes tone but does not create the major reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tile appears in beat one (found in tide pools), beat two (traced onto parchment), beat three (pressed to her wrist, glows), and a final reprise (whispers "again" at dawn). Its physical properties (obsidian, worn edges, warmth) matter and its glow enables the climactic vision. However, the tile's mechanics remain vague—why it works, what the symbols mean—so its causal role reads more as plot device than irreplaceable object. It shapes two distinct beats and the ending but could be replaced with another mystical key without structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Entangled memories appear as a concept in the tower trembling with "the weight of entangled memories pressing against the walls," but the mechanics are never demonstrated on the page. The brother's memory returns whole, not as fragments braiding with Liora's present. The term is used once as an atmospheric label rather than shaping stakes or tactics. The concept is told, not shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The attribute appears explicitly in one line: "A single, courageously kind thought cut through her skepticism." That thought—"What if the tile wasn't magic, but a key"—enables her to press the tile and triggers the climax. The cost is her skepticism's surrender, which forecloses her defensive stance. However, "courageously kind" reads as a label applied to a thought rather than a trait embodied across choices. One causal beat ties to it, but the phrasing is summary rather than demonstrated action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transcription drives three distinct beats: tracing symbols onto parchment (beat one), ink "bleeding into the shape of his hands" (beat two), and "transcribing the horizon... as a door" (beat three). The action shapes her method and the final realization ("the magic wasn't in the tile, but in the transcribing"). Her hands are "steady from years of mapping stars," linking occupation to action. The verb "transcribe" anchors the ending image and redefines the premise. Essential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Forgotten patterns are signaled in "patterns unfolded like forgotten constellations" and "through forgotten patterns" in the title element. The patterns are the tile's symbols, which she traces and which "pull a thread of memory." The method matters—symbols unlock memory—and is used in two beats (tracing, glowing). However, the mechanics remain vague: how do forgotten patterns work differently from remembered ones? The method enables action but its specificity is low; "ancient symbols" or "mystic runes" would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tower is present in every beat: its open structure admits salt wind and whale song, its spiral stairs hum, its bones vibrate, its stones soften and bend, and its door stands open at the end. The setting constrains her work (a place for stargazing and now memory-work) and the final image—"The tower's door creaked open wider, as if inviting the next lost soul"—charges the closure. The open tower as threshold between skepticism and memory is irreplaceable. The tower's physical transformation (stones softening, bending) under pressure makes it active in the climax.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Whale migration is mentioned in the opening ("migrating whales") and their song crescendos at the climax, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. No clock pressure or deadline tied to the migration shapes Liora's choices. The whales function as atmosphere and metaphor (an "unheard symphony") rather than a temporal constraint. She works "until dawn," but that duration is unconnected to the whales' passage. The element is present and coherent but does not alter tactics or create urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized early: "if it could sculpt space for his echo, she'd carve the whole sky." Her transcription attempts enact that desire across multiple beats. Friction appears between her skepticism and her yearning ("she didn't believe the tile could summon him, but..."). The cost is her defensive rationalism. However, "sculpt space for reflection" as exact phrasing is not on the page; the motivation is "sculpt space for his echo," a close variant. The desire drives two beats and the ending but the exact wording is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unheard symphony is established through the whales' "melody no chart could transcribe" and "unheard symphony" appears twice explicitly. The tone coheres: lyric, elegiac, sensory-rich, with quiet wonder replacing overt drama. It modulates from skeptical restraint (early) to surrendered listening (ending). The final line—"She closed her eyes and listened"—charges the image with the tone's central question (what is heard when one stops resisting). The tone shapes the final beat and reweights prior material, though it remains stable rather than dynamic across pressure.</comment>
