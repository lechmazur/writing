<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete action (splitting seed pods, scattering them, speaking in dead tongues), but his interior life remains largely opaque—we observe ritual without accessing the contradictory impulses that would elevate this to character work under pressure. The piece leans heavily on atmospheric description and backstory reflection (the battlefield decades past) without dramatizing a present choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The final paragraphs shift to distant summary ("Years later, fishermen would swear...") rather than staying with the protagonist's stance crystallization, weakening the sense of earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the coachman's nightly ritual builds density through recurring images (seed pods, birds, jetty) toward a final reconfiguration. However, the closure unit is dilated across multiple paragraphs and then leaps to "years later," diffusing the on-page cost into retrospective summary. The orientation is clear early (coachman at jetty, post-battlefield), but the piece violates the two-shard default by traversing jetty → Gloom Hill → return to jetty → distant future without teaching a mosaic pattern by the 25% mark. The final image ("the garden would remain") offers Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized in the coachman's present moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and specific: the jetty's slick stones, the battlefield's moss-filled furrows, the salt and silt all ground the piece in concrete sensory detail. The jetty and seed pods function as micro-setting that constrains the coachman's ritual actions across multiple beats. However, the setting does not alter a key choice—the coachman's plan proceeds unimpeded by environmental resistance—and the "blooming jetty" element appears only in retrospective summary, not as a present-tense pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—letting a garden reclaim a battlefield—is signaled early and sustained, but it faces no meaningful opposition or tightening on the page. The coachman performs his ritual without complication, error, or reversal; no beat narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The piece accumulates texture (birds, seeds, tide) but does not escalate pressure under the Accumulative lens because the final reconfiguration is told in distant summary rather than dramatized through a choice or renunciation with visible cost in the present scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—nature's slow reclamation of war's trauma—emerges organically from the seed-scattering ritual and the battlefield's transformation. The final image of roots twisting through rifle barrels and poppies leaning seaward offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the retrospective frame ("Years later, fishermen would swear...") shifts from dramatized particulars to generic summary, and the line "the garden would remember. It always did" edges toward thematic statement rather than embodied image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: the baroque diction ("broken rib," "syllables curling from his throat like smoke") and heightened register fit the mythic, ritual tone. POV remains stable in third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent—filtered through the coachman's attention to natural signs—and the psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to distant retrospect. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "submerged concord" and "green vengeance" that feel authorial rather than character-particular, but the effect is cohesive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and image-rich, with strong figurative language ("the jetty stretched like a broken rib," "syllables curling from his throat like smoke"). However, several metaphors border on mixed or strained: "the land was hungry... for the stubborn green fingers of things that grew" anthropomorphizes soil while mechanically explaining the metaphor. Paraphrase loops appear: "He did not pray—prayers were for those who still believed in mercy—but he whispered the old words anyway" and "The work was not in the seeing, but in the trusting" repeat the not-X-but-Y construction within close proximity. The final section summarizes years in quick succession, flattening momentum and reducing information density at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—coachman as ecological ritualist reclaiming a battlefield—offers a fresh synthesis of war trauma and botanical regeneration. The detail of speaking to seed pods in dead languages and interpreting bird calls adds specificity. However, the piece hews closely to familiar redemptive-nature templates: the lone eccentric performing patient, misunderstood labor that transforms a scarred landscape. The final image of roots through rifle barrels and the retrospective validation ("fishermen would swear") follow predictable beats. Risk-taking in structure (multiple time jumps, lyric retrospection) is present but does not fully transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The coachman is present throughout and performs key actions (scattering seeds, speaking to birds, mapping the battlefield). However, his "choices" are executed ritual rather than decisions under pressure that alter tactics. He proceeds from jetty to hill to jetty without complication or reversal. The piece treats him as an observer-actor whose arc is told in retrospect rather than dramatized in the present, limiting causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Seed pods appear in the opening beat (coachman cradles them, presses them to his ear), are used in the scattering ritual at the jetty, and return implicitly in the closure image of roots and blooms. They enable the core action (fertilization) and are handled in at least two distinct beats. However, their meaning does not shift or reweight across the story—they remain tools of the ritual without evolving significance or charging the final image with new cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Submerged concord" is mentioned once as "a pulse of life waiting to rise" beneath the birds' warnings. It reads as atmospheric metaphor rather than a concept that shapes stakes or tactics. The coachman does not act on or interpret the concord; it remains ornamental imagery without causal or thematic weight that alters his approach or the closure effect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The coachman speaks "in a tongue no living soul knew" to the seed pods and mimics bird calls, but the dead languages do not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. The trait is mentioned early and reappears in the ritual, satisfying two gates, but it functions as atmospheric detail rather than a mechanic that shapes a beat. The languages could be replaced with wordless humming or any ritualistic gesture without altering plot or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fertilization is the coachman's dominant action: splitting seed pods, scattering them into the jetty's cracks, trusting roots to grow. The ritual occupies multiple beats and drives the narrative arc toward the retrospective closure image of blooms and transformed battlefield. However, the act proceeds without complication or cost in the present scene; the payoff is told in distant summary rather than dramatized, reducing its causal charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Understanding bird calls is signaled early ("He had spent years listening to the birds") and shapes the coachman's approach: he follows their cries to identify soft soil where bones have dissolved. The method appears in at least two beats (listening at the jetty, mimicking the tern's descent). However, the mechanics remain vague—what exactly the birds communicate and how it alters his scattering pattern is summarized rather than shown in tactical detail, limiting causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The jetty is vividly described and serves as the primary location for the seed-scattering ritual. Its stones, tide, and proximity to the reef and battlefield ground the action spatially. The "blooming" aspect, however, appears only in the retrospective closure ("Years later... the jetty glowed at twilight"), not as a present constraint or transformation that affects the coachman's choices. The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure tactics in the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the reef dies" establishes the backstory (decades post-battle, bleached coral) but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The coachman's ritual unfolds over one evening and the following dawn without urgency or deadline. The retrospective leap to "years later" dilates time rather than compressing it, and no clock or seasonal pressure shapes his tactics. The temporal anchor is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation—letting a garden reclaim a battlefield—is dramatized through the seed-scattering ritual and stated in the coachman's whispered command: "Grow. Push through the rot. Make them forget what this place was." It drives his nightly labor and mapping. However, the desire faces no internal friction or competing want; he proceeds with patient certainty, and the cost (his solitary labor, eventual anonymity) is told in retrospect rather than felt in a present choice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness"—the jetty stretching into the sea, the coachman alone on a scarred landscape, the years telescoped into a brief retrospect—is sustained through diction, imagery, and pacing. The tone remains elegiac and compressed, balancing intimate ritual with epochal transformation. It modulates subtly (close observation → distant summary) and charges the final image of the coachman as "just another shadow" whose garden persists. The coherence across pressure and closure is strong, though the retrospective frame slightly diffuses the tonal charge at the ending beat.</comment>
