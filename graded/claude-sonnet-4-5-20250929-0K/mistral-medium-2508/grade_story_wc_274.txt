<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to expose the truth is signaled early and her final act carries weight, but her interior life leans heavily on stock thriller beats ("pulse scandalized the stillness," "hands shake"). The phrase "bravely conflicted" appears as meta-label rather than dramatized contradiction in scene. The closing smile and "I've just remembered" land as posed rather than embodied under lethal pressure, diminishing the cost's emotional authenticity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly. The causal chain from letter → discovery of discrepancies → system flood → confrontation reads cleanly under a Causal lens. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (Elara dies, truth spreads) with visible cost on the page. The "Martyr" label and "archives spoke back" feel slightly assertive rather than dramatized, but the core reversal—silenced past given voice—lands with legible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The snow-laden library, isolation chamber glass, cryo-pod cores, and pneumatic tubes supply vivid anchors. The glass chamber constrains Elara's final stand spatially, and the console's blue light charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (burnt copper ink, ozone scent). Minor slip: "stained glass" witness feels decorative rather than weight-bearing at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (expose erasure vs. self-preservation) signals early and escalates through the letter's demand, Elara's hesitation, then her irreversible command input. The flood spreads "uncontainable as fire," forcing the Overseers' response. Elara's agency drives the turn; her death is the visible price. The tightening from internal conflict to gunfire is clean and causal, though the "No. I've just remembered" line edges toward posed defiance rather than lived cost under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of silenced history vs. voice emerges through the cryo-pods, "contraband truths," and the archives "speaking back." The final image of dormant networks waking offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. Weakness: "The revolution had begun in the blink after surprise" edges into thematic summary, and "Martyr" scrolling on the terminal feels slightly convenient, softening the conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction carries literary ambition ("cathedral of secrets," "ghost against the console") and modulates under pressure with shorter syntax during the climax. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Elara's "No. I've just remembered" pursues defiance with subtext. Minor register drift: "scandalized the stillness" and "bravely conflicted" feel elevated beyond her crisis lexicon, and the Overseer's "sedition" line reads slightly expository.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings shift purposefully. Information density is high in the letter and climax beats. Two friction points lower the score: paraphrase loop ("The library kept breathing. / And for the first time in history, the archives spoke back" restates transformation without added pressure) and template cadence in the opening paragraphs ("The library had…," "Elara Vey…," "Her gloved fingers…," "The letter arrived…") creates a stacked declarative rhythm. Purple tendencies ("pulse scandalized," "barb," "dizzying quiet") cluster near peak beats without consistent pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cryogenic archivist premise and "contraband truths" frame offer a fresh genre synthesis. Weaknesses: the "dangerous letter naming the protagonist as the key" and "protagonist martyrs self to spread the truth" beats follow a recognizable template without transformative specificity. The burnt-copper ink and dormant pneumatic tubes add texture, but the emotional arc (discovery → hesitation → sacrifice) and the scrolling "Martyr" label feel derivative of similar conspiracy-thriller climaxes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's decision to input the command is the story's pivot; her choices (hiding discrepancies, opening the letter, flooding the system) drive all major turns and her death delivers closure cost. Present early, developed across beats, causal at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The letter appears in beat two (pneumatic tube arrival), is handled and read (hooks her "like a barb," warm/alive), demands immediate action, and its replication at the climax spreads the contraband truths—shaping the flood tactic and charging the final image. Three beats, causal, closure-linked.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Contraband truths" frame the inciting letter, the discrepancies Elara hid, the system flood's payload, and the "loose" truths at closure. The concept defines stakes (erasure vs. exposure), alters tactics (flood the network), and the final image ("contraband truths were loose") crystallizes the reconfiguration. Early, multi-beat, indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" appears once as narrative summary ("years bravely conflicted, entering false compliance reports") but is not dramatized as simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. Her hesitation before the command is shown, but the label itself does not constrain a choice or carry visible cost; the trait could be removed with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The act of scandalizing (inputting the command that floods every terminal with the letter) triggers alarms, forces the Overseers' assault, and delivers the closure transformation ("the library screamed"). The verb appears explicitly ("scandalized the stillness") and the replication action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the climax and ending consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dormant networks are seeded early (pneumatic tube "dormant for decades, yet suddenly, treacherously alive"), Elara uses "forgotten access codes" to flood the system, and the ending hinges on "the dormant networks had woken." The method shapes her tactic, enables the spread, and charges the final image. Three beats, causal, closure-essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The library's vaulted halls, isolation chamber, cryo-pods, and glass/console anchor space and constrain Elara's final stand. Snow falling "harder" as she acts adds atmospheric pressure. The setting supplies resources (console, networks) and the "stained glass" witness charges the confrontation. Two-plus beats, some causal shaping, present at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"The blink that follows surprise" appears in the letter's demand and is echoed at closure ("revolution had begun in the blink after surprise"). The timeframe tightens urgency (act "now" before purge cycle) but elapsed time is not tracked on the page—no live clock alters Elara's moves between the letter and her decision. Lyric seed-and-reprise without mid-beat pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to provoke an unspoken conversation" (forcing a reckoning by spreading the letter) drives her choice to flood the system despite the cost ("burning her own life to light the way"). The motivation is dramatized through hesitation and irreversible action, with visible friction (self-preservation vs. exposure). Present in decision and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" is named once and the hush/stillness motif recurs throughout (library "swallowing sound," "quiet wasn't peace," "silence" at death). Tone modulates from suspended dread to the scream of alarms, then back to quiet at Elara's death. The final "snow kept falling" reprises the hushed atmosphere, but "dizzying" itself does not charge the ending image—tone is coherent but the adjective is ornamental.</comment>
