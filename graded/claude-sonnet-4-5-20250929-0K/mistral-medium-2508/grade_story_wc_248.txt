<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is established early and his final choice to burn the ledger carries cost, but the arc relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized pressure. The self-portrait wound and decade of guilt are told more than shown through micro-choices. Interior contradiction exists (saving vs. destroying) but most reflection summarizes past states rather than forcing present trade-offs. The archivist remains abstract—a memory prop rather than a relationship under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. The piece teaches its lyric compression early and the final burning reconfigures the promise's meaning with felt cost. However, orientation is delayed—who Elias is and his exact situation emerge gradually through the first third without clear anchoring. The closure lands (he destroys the ledger to foreclose weaponization) but the causal chain depends on summarized backstory rather than on-page choices narrowing options. One meaningful deepening occurs but causality feels loose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive is anchored with vivid sensory detail (charred parchment, soot, humming air) and the desert wind at closure charges the final image. The third pillar constrains Elias's discovery and the key-and-seam mechanism shapes the climax. Micro-setting (tapestry, pillar, ledger) functions well. Minor issue: spatial choreography during the descent into "the archive's gut" remains vague, but the setting participates meaningfully in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: protect the promise from weaponization. The discovery of the ledger and decision to burn it constitute one meaningful tightening with visible cost (he erases the names, including hers). However, the escalation is mostly reflective realization rather than antagonistic pressure or a forced trade-off. No on-page opposition complicates his choice; the fire is an unchallenged act. The cost is legible but the path to it lacks friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the archive-as-womb image and the fire-as-mercy logic without overt moralizing. The final line "I kept my word" and the smoke-question image offer resonant non-literal closure. The infinity symbol with her initials and the volcanic tenderness motif recur with shifting weight. Minor slip: "the most dangerous art was the kind that survived" edges toward theme statement, though it's filtered through Elias's perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and maintained: lyric compression, elevated diction, and patterned metaphor (archive as tomb/womb, fire as mercy) cohere throughout. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. The perceptual signature—Elias reading hidden geometry, tracing symbols—is character-specific. Minor register drift: phrases like "analytically intuitive" and "volcanic tenderness" feel authorial rather than Elias's natural idiom under stress, but the effect is consistent and intentional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled. However, paraphrase loops appear: "he'd burned the libraries to rescue the promise" is restated multiple times across paragraphs. Template cadence in the final third: "The sun rose... Somewhere, a new library... Elias smiled... Then he vanished... The wind erased..." creates a drumbeat. Stock metaphor "sharp and fleeting, like the strike of a match" and "volcanic tenderness" (repeated from prompt) reduce freshness. Information density is high but loops and cadence stiffness lower the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archive-as-womb and fire-as-mercy synthesis offers a fresh angle, and the vandalized self-portrait as map is non-obvious. However, the "lone archivist burning forbidden knowledge" premise is a widely used template, and the emotional arc (guilt, realization, release) follows familiar beats. The lyric style and specific imagery (tapestry, ledger, her initials in infinity curves) elevate execution, but the core does not fully transform the archetype. Transformation present but incomplete.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (lending library arsonist) drives the discovery beats and the final burn, participating in setup, middle (following the trail, opening the pillar), and closure (lighting the match). However, most choices are reflective realizations rather than contested decisions. The arsonist identity constrains his interpretation but does not create tactical friction or visible cost until the ending. Two gates met solidly; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears early (kneeling beside it, brushing soot), returns with a message in its border ("Find the third pillar"), and is referenced at closure as "embers" that "told him everything." Three beats across setup, middle, and ending. However, its function is largely clue-delivery; it does not constrain a choice with cost. The reprise at closure is brief and does not reweight prior stakes beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is introduced early (slashed mural, wound he inflicted) and reappears at the pillar revelation ("hadn't been an act of rage—it had been a map"). It shapes thematic stakes (self-sabotage, hidden truth) and reframes prior acts. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics; the revelation is told rather than tested. Two gates met; causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is mentioned once in exposition ("Elias had been analytically intuitive then, tracing the hidden geometry") and does not constrain or enable any on-page action. It functions as a character label without visible trade-off or cost. No beat involvement, no closure linkage. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Portray" appears twice: once as setup ("he let himself portray the truth") and once at closure ("he was done creating"). It frames thematic stakes (art as dangerous survival) but does not drive a major turn. The act of burning the ledger is the decisive choice, and "portray" could be replaced with "acknowledge" or "accept" without structural loss. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations (charcoal sketches, inked symbols) is signaled early ("His trail of artistic creations... had led him here") and shapes the middle beat (following clues to the pillar). However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized; we do not see him decode a sketch or symbol on the page. The method enables discovery but does not constrain tactics or impose cost. Two gates met; moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is present throughout: setup (kneeling beside blackened remains), middle (third pillar with carved message, key-and-seam mechanism), and closure (flames taking the ledger, desert wind carrying ashes). The pillar's seam and the archive's "gut" constrain his discovery and the wind participates in the final image. The setting pressures choices and charges closure. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" anchors the timeframe early and situates the story post-fire. However, time does not tighten decisions on the page; there is no clock or deadline. The phrase establishes backstory context but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Setup gate met; development and closure participation absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rescuing the forgotten promise is dramatized: Elias follows the trail, opens the pillar, discovers the ledger, and burns it to prevent weaponization. The motivation is present in setup, drives the middle discovery, and resolves at closure. However, the internal friction (saving the promise vs. saving the world from it) is told in reflection rather than tested through an on-page trade-off. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate, cost legible but not contested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Volcanic tenderness appears once explicitly ("a volcanic tenderness erupting in his chest") at closure and is echoed in the tonal contrast of lyric brutality (fire, ash) and intimacy (whispering her name, the infinity symbol). Tone modulates across beats—urgency in discovery, quiet resolve at the burn—but the phrase itself is ornamental rather than functional. The tonal coherence supports closure but the specific element is not indispensable. Two gates loosely met.</comment>
