<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life is selective and embodied—"the weight of the camera suddenly heavier" and "his thumb traced the camera's screen"—with contradictory impulses visible in the choice to plant the canister while knowing the drones will erase everything. However, the trait "purposefully curious" appears only as a label in early reflection without constraining a later choice, and the final renunciation (boarding the ship) feels more resigned than earned by a prior dramatized trade-off. The emotional arc tracks cleanly but the climactic boarding reads passive, limiting the cost's visibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat ("crater inspector, Elias Voss...summit of Tycho Crater"), and the piece follows a clear causal arc: plant canister → photograph → board ship as drones approach. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's final photograph crystallizes the tension between preservation and erasure, with the cost felt in "a world that would never know what it had lost. But he would." The lens reads as Causal-Accumulative hybrid, with the canister pulses and photo sequence tightening pressure toward the final image. Closure cost is conceptual and legible, though the physical act of boarding rather than a final image choice slightly diffuses the charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lunar surface is visceral and selective: "boots crunched over the moon's silvered dust," "jagged rock," "regolith," with the crater's edge framing Earth as "a pale jewel." The canister and camera function as micro-setting that constrains action (planting, photographing, tracking time). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The summit setting charges the final image when "the summit of Tycho Crater gleamed, untouched for now, a lie of permanence," making the environment indispensable to the stake.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing beauty before industrial erasure—is signaled early and tightens through the canister pulses and the approaching drones' "distant hum." Elias's agency drives each beat (planting, photographing, departing), and the cost is visible in the line "Three hours to outlast the future" and the final renunciation of the crater. However, the escalation is linear rather than reversing or deepening; the drones never complicate his plan, only approach as a ticking clock, so pressure accumulates without a meaningful turn that narrows his options or forces a trade-off mid-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the hourglass grain, the canister's timed pulses, and the photographs as acts of defiance. The line "It had measured the end of one era and the birth of another" risks abstraction but is grounded by the prior image work. The final photograph—"Earth rising, the crater pristine, and...the ghost of his own shadow stretching toward home"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what survives industrial conquest. The piece resists moralizing, though "Men of the space age didn't cry" briefly editorializes before pulling back to the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a lyric-inflected distance: "He wanted to outlast them, if only in memory" and "his thumb traced the camera's screen" filter perception through Elias's professional and emotional lens. Diction is purposeful—"ghosts of light," "dawnlit hush," "knife-edge of light"—though the phrase "a quiet so vast it hummed" borders on stock poetic register. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is consistent but leans on repeated syntactic patterns ("He snapped...Then another...And another") that flatten rhythm under pressure, preventing higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is mostly clean with vivid compression: "Earth hung like a pale jewel, swollen with unspoken promises." However, template cadence runs appear in peak beats—"He snapped the shot. Then another. And another" and "He didn't cry. Men of the space age didn't cry"—and paraphrase loops recur: the canister's function is explained twice in similar terms, and "outlast" is invoked three times without reweighting. These artifacts dull momentum in high-pressure moments, triggering a −0.6 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is otherwise strong, and the figurative language remains coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core premise—documenting a site before industrial destruction—is familiar, but the canister's timed bioluminescent pulses and the hourglass grain offer specific, grounded texture. The protagonist's role as "crater inspector" rather than scientist or activist adds a small fresh angle. Emotional specificity in "his finger lingering on the shutter like a lover's farewell" avoids generic templates. However, the lonely-custodian-of-vanishing-beauty arc and the elegy-for-progress theme echo widely used narrative shapes without a non-obvious moral calculus or transformation, keeping the piece in the strong-but-familiar band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (crater inspector) is present throughout and his choices—planting the canister, photographing, boarding the ship—drive all three major beats. Setup is immediate, and his decisions create the story's escalation and closure. However, his choices are linear and unopposed; he executes his plan without adaptation or trade-off that reveals new cost, so the character's integration reads as functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The sand grain is introduced early ("a single grain of sand from Nightwatch's hourglass...carried the weight of time itself"), mentioned at the midpoint ("the sand grain in his pouch a secret anchor"), and reprised at closure ("The sand grain in his pouch had done its work"). However, it is never handled or used in a dramatized beat; it remains a thematic touchstone described in reflection rather than constraining a choice or altering an action. The closure reprise reweights meaning lyrically but does not demonstrate causal necessity, keeping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" (core concept) is introduced early as "the dawnlit hush pressed against his helmet" and recurs throughout—"dawnlit hush," "dawn swallowed the stars," "the coming light"—shaping the temporal stakes (drones arrive at dawn) and charging the final image when "the engines ignited, carrying him back." The concept directly alters options (the clock tightens as dawn approaches) and is present in the closure unit, making it essential across beats. The specificity of "hush" as both silence and impending noise elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" appears once in early reflection ("purposefully curious, longing to understand what was lost before it vanished") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown through a choice that trades curiosity against another value. It remains ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Outlast" (action) is signaled early ("He wanted to outlast them, if only in memory"), drives the canister planting and photograph sequence, and is directly invoked at closure ("The sand grain...had measured the end of one era and the birth of another"). The action redefines the stakes from physical preservation to memorial endurance, and the final boarding is its culmination. However, the action is never tested or complicated—Elias succeeds without friction—so the integration is strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Chemical reactions for timed messages (method) are introduced early when Elias plants "a chemical cocktail...meant to react slowly, releasing a pulse of bioluminescent gas at precise intervals." The canister pulses three times on the page, marking the escalation beats (first glow, dawn pulse, final hiss), and the method's specificity—bioluminescent timing—shapes the structure. The mechanics matter (he checks his watch against the pulses), and the final "chemicals spent, its message delivered" ties to closure. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The moonlit summit (setting) anchors every beat: "summit of Tycho Crater," "the crater's edge," "regolith," and the spatial contrast between the pristine summit and the approaching landing pad. The setting supplies the camera's viewfinder frame, the jagged rock for planting the canister, and the "distant hum" of drones that tightens pressure. At closure, "the summit of Tycho Crater gleamed, untouched for now" charges the final image with the lie of permanence. The setting is irreplaceable; no other location would carry the same stakes or visual resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"During the space age" (timeframe) is signaled by "mining drones," "space age," and "observatory," establishing the era. The live clock—"three hours until the first drill bit touched the surface"—tightens decisions and the canister pulses track elapsed time. However, the timeframe itself (space age vs. another era) does not alter tactics; the urgency comes from the three-hour window, not from the broader era. The period supplies texture but is not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To photograph the last of something precious" (motivation) is dramatized in Elias's action across all beats: "his camera slung low...hungry to capture the last untouched stretch," the repeated shutter clicks, and the final thumb-trace of the screen. The desire is conflicted—"Each click was a theft, a defiance"—and the cost is visible when he boards the ship knowing "The crater would be gone by noon. But the photographs would outlast it." Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, and the motivation shapes every major choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" (tone) is established early—"dawnlit hush," "a quiet so vast it hummed"—and modulates with pressure: defiance in "Each click was a theft," resignation in "He didn't cry," and final lyric weight in "the ghost of his own shadow stretching toward home." The tone charges the final image when the ship lifts and Elias closes his eyes, carrying "a world that would never know what it had lost." Coherence is strong and the tone is indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>
