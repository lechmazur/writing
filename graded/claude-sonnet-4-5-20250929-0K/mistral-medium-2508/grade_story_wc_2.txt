<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tinkerer's motivation is clear—seeking patterns in broken things—and his stance evolves through concrete actions (handling compass, dismantling clock). Interior voice remains consistent with a bias toward uncertainty and improvisation. However, the final shift to "befriending absence" feels asserted rather than earned through visible struggle; the renunciation lacks dramatized cost that would foreclose alternate paths on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: objects and images (clock, compass, leaves, waterfall) recur with shifting weight until the final repurposing. Orientation anchors (tinkerer, workshop, boneyard greenhouse, cavern) land within the first fifth. The closure—stripping a gear to free the compass needle, then sketching a new timepiece—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing his shift from fixing to improvising. Cost is visible: he stops winding the clock, releases the last gear. One meaningful deepening occurs when the waterfall's question prompts his realization. Minor slip: the middle waterfall scene feels like a convenient oracle rather than a tightening born of prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and specific: charcoal-scented boneyard, waterlogged harbor relics, greenhouse with glowing leaves, cavern with slow-falling water. The compass and ledger constrain his next choice (wedging the gear), and the greenhouse path shapes his descent. Spatial choreography remains clear across four locations. The glowing leaves function as micro-setting that charges the final image when they "part like a crowd." Gate satisfied: environment constrains choice and charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding a reason to stop fixing what can't be fixed, signaled early. Escalation under Accumulative lens proceeds through object encounters (compass, ledger command "Improvise") that reweight his understanding. The tinkerer's agency drives the resolution: he strips the gear, repurposes it, and stops winding the clock—a renunciation with visible cost. One meaningful deepening when he grasps "You've been collecting the wrong kind of time." The waterfall voice feels convenient rather than pressure-born, slightly undercutting escalation integrity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—embracing productive brokenness, improvisation over certainty—emerges through concrete particulars: the clock that never kept time, the frozen compass, the glowing leaves "practicing." The final image (green shoots through cobblestones, compass pointing at "nothing," warm gear released) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through images rather than stated thesis. Minor slip: "uncertainly certain" and "befriended its absence" edge toward label-speak in the final paragraphs, but remain grounded enough in prior action to avoid full abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: diction favors particulars ("bone-yard," "half-burned letters," "tuning fork struck against fate"), rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts in the cavern, longer cadences in reflection). POV remains stable third-limited; the tinkerer's perceptual signature—noticing broken, liminal things—is consistent. No dialogue present. Psychic distance tightens during key beats (compass hum, waterfall question). Minor: a few phrases ("uncertainly certain," "practicing") approach whimsy without full voice grounding, and some figurative turns ("fate," "parade") feel slightly elevated for a tinkerer's interior, but remain largely coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings differ; information density is high in early beats. Figurative language is generally apt ("like embers refusing to die," "black as a held breath"). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "broken things held secrets," "uncertainly certain," "improvising" recurs without escalating pressure. The waterfall "speaking" and leaves "practicing" edge toward whimsy without clear mechanical grounding. Paraphrase appears in adjacent lines describing the compass and ledger. Template cadence in the final third: "He understood then. / The broken clock didn't need fixing... / The admiral's compass wasn't lost... / And the glowing leaves?" Apply −0.6 for template run and loops; moderate density elsewhere partially offsets.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Premise—tinkerer discovers meaning in brokenness via underground convergence—feels fresh in execution through specific objects and setting choices. The compass-gear fusion and the sketch of a tide-driven timepiece offer non-obvious synthesis. Emotional specificity (handling cold brass, warm thigh-pocket compass) avoids generic epiphany templates. Risk-taking in structure (four locations, lyric callbacks) heightens without obscuring. Minor: the waterfall voice and glowing leaves veer toward fable convenience, and the "Pattern" capitalization in the final act feels slightly over-declared. Within-band bonus for cohesive risk: +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tinkerer present throughout; his choices (following greenhouse path, descending, prying ledger, stripping gear, wedging it into compass, sketching new timepiece, releasing last gear) drive all major turns and closure. Occupation (tinkering with broken objects) shapes perception and final act. Early signal, three+ beats, closure linkage, causal pressure all satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Compass introduced early (harbor crate); engraving spurs recognition; hums in pocket during descent; he strips a gear and wedges it into the frozen mechanism, freeing the needle; sits on workbench at closure. Four distinct beats, causal work (enables final direction), closure presence. High irreplaceability: its frozen state and engraving are unique properties that matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" functions as setting (workshop under boneyard, city's ashes, final green shoots through cobblestones) and thematic frame. It shapes the tinkerer's origin context and the ending image (growth from ashes). Present early, reweighted at closure. Does not directly constrain a mid-story choice but charges the final image with conceptual cost. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" appears as descriptor and theme ("let it sit, uncertainly certain"). It reflects his stance but does not visibly constrain an on-page action with trade-off. Label-only use without a dramatized cost tied to the attribute itself. Functional but replaceable; no middle beat where the trait forces a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Improvise" is the ledger's final command; directly triggers his realization and the gear-stripping, compass-freeing act. Drives closure choice and ending posture (walking, improvising). Two beats (ledger discovery, final walk), causal pressure high. Swapping for "adapt" or "experiment" would dilute specificity but not break logic; strong but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Greenhouse leaves part to reveal downward path (enables descent), then part again at exit "like a crowd" (charges return). Two beats, both spatial/atmospheric. Mechanics matter (path access) but do not constrain a hard choice with cost. Mid-range: functional across beats, but the leaves' glowing and "practicing" remain decorative metaphor rather than tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Waterfall cavern is the site of ledger discovery and the voice's key question. Setting supplies the resource (ledger) and atmospheric prompt ("What do you seek?"). Does not constrain a choice with visible trade-off (he could have found ledger elsewhere). Two beats, closure-adjacent resource, but not indispensable to story logic. Mid-6s for atmospheric participation without hard constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" governs narrative structure: first phrase on compass, second on greenhouse door, convergence of objects. Timeframe is conceptual rather than clock-based but it drives his recognition and the decision to stop fixing. Pattern-recognition is the engine of escalation and closure. Three beats (compass, door, realization), causal pressure clear, closure-shaping. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation—"to befriend uncertainty"—is stated late but enacted throughout: he refuses to discard the broken clock, follows ambiguous clues, stops winding the clock at closure, releases the last gear. Desire is dramatized in repeated choices to engage with the uncertain rather than resolve it. Friction visible: releasing control costs comfort. Early implicit signal, multiple beats, closure crystallization. Strong.</comment>
