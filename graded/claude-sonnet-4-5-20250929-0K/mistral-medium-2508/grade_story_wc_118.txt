<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is rendered through concrete, embodied action—tracing stitches, pressing tapestry to cheek, feeding pages to embers—and his motivation (collecting wall-heard stories) drives each move. Interior texture is specific ("a hook behind his ribs") and contradictory impulses emerge when he doesn't resist the displacement tug, showing acceptance over struggle. The final smile is "cracked at the edges," an earned micro-choice that forecloses retreat. Minor issue: the "sensitively perceptive fingers" phrase leans toward label-only in its first mention, though later tactile details recover specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through layered images (tapestry, diaries, dragons, axis) that converge when the tapestry warms and the axis moves, reweighting Elias's solitary task as cosmic participation. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final walk with pulsing tapestry and the line "Somewhere, the world remembered how to turn" crystallizes his role as witness-catalyst with felt cost (endless iteration, no human companionship). Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The lens holds; no causality breaks touch closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The silo as reclaimed library—shelves spiraling "like the grooves of a colossal phonograph"—is vivid and purposeful, anchoring Elias's archival work. The fireplace, ladder, and tapestry fragment constrain his physical moves (climbing, feeding pages, pressing wool). The final image charges setting: "the silo sighed behind him, its metal skin singing a note just shy of sorrow" binds structure to emotional resonance. The wind "carried the scent of rain, though no clouds remained" subtly reflects post-human displacement without exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving/collecting stories that outlast dreamers. Pressure tightens when the tapestry's axis moves and Elias feels the tug, forcing him to choose non-resistance ("He didn't resist"). The choice forecloses balance, committing him to iterative wandering. Cost is visible: he walks away from the silo's shelter into a rain-scented wind with no clouds, accepting endless collection over stasis. One meaningful deepening (the axis pivot) drives the ending; no reversals required under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the Sundering as trade ("They took the dreams. We took the sky"), dragons as pivot, and Elias as custodian of wall-heard memory. The tapestry's warming and the silo's sigh function as non-literal answers to "What endures after human agency ends?" without stating a moral. The "bronze quiet hum" recurs in the final smile, charging the closure with earned resonance. No thematic echo or moralizing; the piece commits to its elegiac premise and follows implications without retreat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and intimate, filtering all perception through Elias's archival sensibility ("his sensitively perceptive fingers," "exhaled through his nose, the sound like a rusted hinge"). Diction is consistent—elevated but tactile, no register drift. The prose carries a distinct rhythmic signature: long, layered sentences during contemplation, shorter beats at the axis pivot. Free indirect style is clean. Minor: "sensitively perceptive" edges toward filter-stack phrasing, though the sensory specificity that follows recovers momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, high information density, minimal scaffolding. Figurative language is purposeful (phonograph grooves, hook behind ribs, metronome steps) and coherent. Opening and closing images anchor voice and recharge motifs (silo hum, bronze quiet, tapestry pulse). Minor density wobble: "the stories were still breathing, still twisting around the displaced axis like vines around a broken trellis" stacks metaphor vehicles without advancing new pressure, trending toward mid-band overwriting in a high-texture passage. No loops or template cadence; propulsion is maintained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—solitary historian in post-dream world collecting wall-heard stories via half-burned diaries and a tapestry axis—synthesizes familiar post-apocalyptic and archival tropes into a specific, non-obvious frame. The Sundering as trade and dragons as pivot offer fresh inflection. Emotional specificity (cracked smile, bronze quiet) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and elliptical backstory heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece does not fully escape elegiac-archivist conventions, capping the top band, but the dragon-axis mechanics and tactile layering distinguish it from median examples.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias signals early (opening paragraph), drives two beats (tracing tapestry stitches, feeding diaries to embers), and his final walk directly shapes closure. His choice not to resist the displacement tug narrows options and commits him to itinerant collection. His role as "last historian" is essential to the ending's charge. Mild swappability: another archivist archetype could fill the slot with edits, but "odd" is earned through his acceptance of the hook and his cracked smile.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tapestry appears early (second paragraph), is handled in three beats (unfolding, tracing, pressing to cheek, slipping into pocket), and its warming at the axis pivot drives the climactic moment. Dragons coiling as axis and the charred edges seed backstory; the warm pulse in the pocket charges the final walk. Removing it would collapse the story's central mechanism (axis displacement) and closure image. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Displaced axis is named and described early ("pivot point where the world had once turned"), drives the climactic beat when "the axis in the weaving moved" and Elias feels the tug, and shapes his final walk as custodian of a tilted world. It reweights the tapestry's function and the Sundering's cost. The concept is woven through metaphor (silo tilt, world tilt) and the dragons' mechanics, though it trends slightly abstract in mid-story exposition. Strong causal role and closure linkage lift it into the upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is named once as a label ("his sensitively perceptive fingers tracing the stitches where the weaver had hesitated") and later embodied through tactile actions (pressing tapestry to cheek, feeling the thrumming threads). The trait enables his recognition of the axis and the hesitation in the weave, informing his response to the displacement. It shapes one key turn (noticing the axis in the tapestry), but swappability is moderate—"perceptive" or "careful" could substitute with minor loss. Mid-band functional role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Probe" is named explicitly ("he'd been probing the same fracture for years") and demonstrated across beats: tracing stitches, reading half-burned diaries, feeding pages to embers to coax light onto the tapestry. The probing action triggers the axis movement and the displacement tug, directly shaping the climactic turn. It defines his method and drives the ending walk. High causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceability is strong (examine, study, or search would dilute the mechanical precision). Upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries in the fireplace are signaled early (second section: "diaries he pulled from its ashes"), supply key exposition ("The sky split like a seam"), and their reheating via fed pages triggers the tapestry's glow and the axis pivot. The mechanics matter: Elias feeds a diary to "coax the embers back to life," and the resulting light makes the dragons' fire "no longer faded." The method drives the climactic beat and shapes closure. High integration and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is established in the opening line, its spiral shelves and fireplace constrain Elias's physical actions (climbing ladder, feeding embers), and its metal skin's "sigh" charges the final departure image. The setting is indispensable: removing it would collapse the archival stakes and the tactile mechanics (ladder, ashes, metal groan). The silo's transformation from grain bin to repository embodies the post-dream world's repurposing. Upper-band integration and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last human dream is dreamt" is established early ("The last human dream had been dreamt decades ago") and reprised twice ("The last historian had no need for balance," "The last human dream had been dreamt, but the stories were still breathing"). It colors stakes and tone, framing Elias's work as post-human curation. It does not tighten a live clock or alter tactics beat-to-beat, trending more atmospheric than causal. Lyric reprise at closure reweights the premise. Mid-6s for thematic anchoring with moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "collect the stories walls have heard" is named early and demonstrated through probing diaries, handling the tapestry, and the final walk toward future offerings. It drives each beat and shapes the closure walk: "The stories would find him. They always did." Internal friction emerges in his acceptance of endless iteration ("The walls were patient, and so was he") versus human connection. The motivation is essential to closure and carries visible cost (solitude, itinerant existence). Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" is established early as the diaries' "bronze quiet hum" and recurs in the final image: Elias's smile is "bronze-quiet as the hum of a spinning world." The tone is coherent—elegiac, textured, restrained—through all beats, modulating subtly with pressure (the axis pivot intensifies without breaking quietness). It charges the closure image, binding sensory texture to thematic stillness. High coherence and payoff; strong closure linkage lifts it into the 8-band.</comment>
