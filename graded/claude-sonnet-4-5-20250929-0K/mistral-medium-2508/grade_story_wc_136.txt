<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates clear motivation rooted in grief, with the compass work and phantom punch showing character-specific problem-solving. The sister reveal lands emotionally but arrives so late that the interior work feels more expository than contradictory-in-scene. His final choice to return to the mist reads as earned, though the epiphany ("some mysteries weren't meant to be solved") skirts diagnostic abstraction. The backstory reflection is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (the vault, the phantom punch) and tilts his stance toward release rather than pursuit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, building density through mist, cracks, vault, and phantom punch motifs until the platform vision reweights Elias's obsession. The closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): he names the truth, receives the vision, then chooses to step back into the mist rather than follow—a renunciation with felt cost. The platform vision offers a micro-turn but the final image of folding the map with a deliberate crease charges the closure. Cost is legible in the line "only carried with trembling certainty."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vault's rusted lattice, the cracks forming arrows, and the mist curling around boots create vivid spatial anchors that constrain Elias's route and charge the ending image. The phantom punch as micro-object constrains his choice at the pedestal and its dissolution marks the threshold moment. Sensory detail is selective: "wet earth and old promises," "wind through a keyhole." The map's final fold—a crease that won't align—functions as setting-as-object, encoding the theme and altering his future tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the fortress/naming the unspoken truth—is signaled early and tightens when the punch "bites" the air, opening the platform. The voice's question forces the confession ("I don't know where she went"), a renunciation that forecloses the obsessive mapping detour. Agency is clear: he whispers the answer, steps forward, then chooses to return. The cost is the surrender of certainty ("only carried with trembling certainty"). One meaningful tightening occurs; no multiple reversals are needed at this length, and the escalation reads as deepening rather than causal turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the cracks/arrows motif and the opposition between precision and grief, culminating in the map fold that "would never quite align." The sister's line "some paths aren't meant to be followed—only acknowledged" skirts overt statement but is delivered by a spectral figure, not authorial intrusion. The phantom train and schedule board ("The Hour You Missed") load symbolic weight without earning full dramatic pressure. The final image offers a resonant answer—mystery as companion rather than puzzle—but the thematic articulation is more elegant than urgent.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Diction exhibits mild overwriting: "fortress of unspoken truths," "wounds bleeding through," "phantom train rolled on invisible tracks" stack elevated metaphor without pattern-teaching or payoff. The sister's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("You were always better at reading maps than me") but her spectral role limits friction. Psychic distance compresses smoothly during the vault encounter. Perceptual signature is present but intermittent: the analytically artistic lens shows in compass-reading but doesn't consistently filter every perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across most beats: "mist swallowing breath," "stars bleeding through like wounds," "exhale a ghost of hesitation," "phantom punch dissolved," "ripples spiraling outward." Several metaphors mix registers (breath-swallowing mist, bleeding stars) without coherent vehicle logic. Template cadence appears in paragraph-initial constructions: "The mist parted... The tool trembled... The slit yawned... The phantom punch warmed." Paraphrase loop: "mysteries weren't meant to be solved, only carried" echoes "not to be followed—only acknowledged" within two beats. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but scaffolding ("back in the city," "somewhere, a phantom train") pads transitions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The phantom punch as navigation tool and the cracks-as-arrows offer a specific synthesis of cartography and grief. The vault-as-threshold rather than fortress is a fresh inflection on the quest premise, and the sister's spectral station inverts the search from "finding" to "naming." However, the core arc—obsessive mapper confronts unresolved loss via magical threshold—reads as a familiar template (grief + magical realism journey). Emotional specificity in the final fold elevates execution, but the journey's beats (mist, artifact, vault, vision, return) follow a recognizable quest structure without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias the route mapper frames the opening, drives the compass/crack-reading in the first third, places the punch at the pedestal (middle turn), and folds the map with a deliberate crease at the end. His meticulous obsession constrains his tactics (months decoding, precise vault timing) and the final choice to mark the vault "not with ink but with a crease" shows irreplaceable craft. Cost is visible: he surrenders the belief that precision can outrun grief. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phantom punch appears in the coat pocket (first third), is placed on the pedestal to "bite" the air (middle turn), and dissolves when its purpose is fulfilled (closure beat). It returns with reweighted meaning: from decoder tool to threshold key. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"left no mark… only the faintest impression"—and its dissolution feels convenient rather than causally grounded. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; two distinct beats and closure linkage are present, but swappability is moderate (any liminal artifact could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unraveling mysteries shapes Elias's motive (months decoding the punch, tracing cracks) and his tactic of reading patterns. The vault encounter tests this drive, and the closure reframes mystery as something "not meant to be solved, only carried." The concept participates in setup (decoding work), development (cracks as puzzle), and payoff (the map fold as acceptance). However, the mystery-solving itself is told in summary; on-page, Elias mostly observes and responds. Causal pressure is moderate; the concept enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Analytically artistic" is mentioned once in exposition ("his analytically artistic mind weaving hypotheses") but does not visibly constrain or enable on-page action. We see the compass work and map-folding, but these read as "meticulous mapper" traits; no visible tradeoff between analytical rigor and artistic intuition shapes a choice. The trait is label-only with no dramatized cost. Missing development and closure participation; cap at 4.6 for missing setup gate and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dare appears implicitly when Elias "dared to believe" (setup) and explicitly when he "dared to step forward" at the platform (closure beat). The final dare—stepping back into the mist—redefines the action as courage to release rather than pursue. Setup and payoff gates are met; missing explicit middle dare where a choice hinges on daring. The action is thematic rather than physical, which fits the Accumulative lens, but swappability is moderate (risk, venture, choose could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cracks forming arrows are introduced in paragraph two, guide Elias to the vault (first third), appear etched on the pedestal (middle), and "spiraled outward like ripples" in the final image, reweighted as new questions rather than answers. The method shapes his route-reading tactics and charges the closure by multiplying rather than resolving. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Specificity is high: the arrow pattern is irreplaceable to the cartography premise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The starlit vault is introduced early (first third), supplies the pedestal and iron gates that shape the middle choice, and its sealing "with a sigh" marks the threshold closure. The dome's "lattice of rusted metal and shattered glass" with stars "bleeding through like wounds" provides vivid atmosphere that mirrors Elias's grief. The vault as liminal space rather than literal fortress reweights the setting's meaning. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; two beats and closure linkage present. Pressure is moderate: the vault constrains access (timing, touch) but does not dynamically alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the opening (clocktower midnight, "the hour… between one hour and the next") and returns in the final line ("the new hour—the one that divided what he'd outgrown from what he'd yet to become"). Setup and payoff gates are met; missing middle development where the hour's passage tightens a choice. The time is poetic rather than a live constraint; no on-page urgency shows the vault closing or Elias racing the clock. The charged return elevates the lyric reprise to mid-5s but the hour does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Finding the fortress motivates the opening trek, months of decoding, and the vault arrival. The voice's question dramatizes the motive's friction: the fortress isn't a place but a truth he must name. His confession and renunciation show cost (surrender of certainty). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is present. However, much of the motivation is summarized ("spent months decoding") rather than shown in conflicted on-page choice. The dramatized peak is the whispered answer, which lands with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Trembling certainty is woven throughout: "hands shook," "breath fogged," "phantom punch trembled," "hands steady now," and the final phrase "carried with trembling certainty." The tone modulates from shaky anticipation to charged resolve, coherent across turns. It charges the final image (the deliberate crease, the steady hands holding paradox). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle modulation is present in the vault beats. The tone is specific to Elias's grief-charged precision and irreplaceable to the closure's emotional register.</comment>
