<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's observational trait is established early ("always been the one who noticed"), but her interior life leans heavily on poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The choice to plant crumbs and bake is motivated by character, yet the wheat's instant transformation removes sustained internal conflict—she shifts smoothly from question to action without friction. The prince's weeping at the end reads as received emotion rather than a micro-choice that reveals his hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a pattern of noticed strangeness and withheld action, then deepens through Liora's guerrilla baking that reverses the city's adjustment reflex. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bakery's sign reappears; coins "feel like enough"), with conceptual cost legible in the city's years of normalizing horror. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. One minor causality slip: the oven "roared to life" without prior setup of Liora's ability or the tea house's latent magic, though the pattern of impossible warmth partially covers it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tea house courtyard, copper kettle, and wheat constrain Liora's choices across multiple beats and charge the final image of leading the prince into the grain. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("flour once dusted the air like snow," "wild honey unspooling like a memory"). However, the palace's broader geography remains vague—guard posts, fountain, and courtyard spatial relations are unclear, and the reversed river on Tuesdays is mentioned but never dramatized as a constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restoring the city's refusal to adjust to horror, signaled early through Liora's observation and the vanished bakery. The tightening occurs when Liora plants crumbs and the wheat erupts, forcing the city to stop adjusting; guards abandon posts, the prince returns. Her agency (baking, distributing loaves) drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual but legible: years of normalized strangeness are confronted. No reversals required by this lens; the deepening through baking is sufficient and the price (the city's absolution being "tenuous") charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—creeping normalization versus sacred attention—emerges through concrete actions (replanting flagstones, baking, weeping guards) rather than statement. The final image of coins feeling "like enough" after years of adjustment offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. "Tenuous absolution" is invoked directly in the penultimate paragraph, a slight thematic echo that borders on over-articulation, but the bread's return and the city's shift remain rooted in particulars. The piece resists binary resolution; the prince's tears and Liora's silence preserve ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Liora's perceptual signature ("noticed when the ordinary tilted," "heuristically gentle"). Distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and purposefully elevated ("unspooling like a memory," "uncloaking its wounds"), fitting the fable-like tone. One register slip: "heuristically gentle" reads as authorial label rather than Liora's brother's plausible speech. The prince's silence at the end is voice-appropriate, but his interior remains opaque—no dialogue to test distinctness. Filter verbs ("she didn't ask," "he didn't speak") are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in places ("the river now ran backward on Tuesdays"), but the piece leans on lyric metaphor in nearly every high-pressure beat without always advancing causality—"unspooling like a memory," "whispered over a fire no one had lit," "tenuous for words" pile figurative language without distinct payoff. Two paraphrase loops: "the bread would keep rising, where the ordinary had finally, mercifully, uncloaked itself" restates the prior paragraph's resolution. Minor template cadence in the litany of city wounds ("the bakery's disappearance, the prince's quiet exile, the way the river..."). No artifacts touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of creeping normality, guerrilla gardening, and bread as sacred conduit is specific and non-obvious; the wheat erupting from crumbs and the city's adjustment reflex feel inevitable in hindsight. The piece takes structural risk with its fable-like compression and lyric voice, heightening stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the bread-with-memory trope (biting into a loaf and tasting the past) echoes magical-realism templates closely; transformation is present but partial. The final image of the bakery's return and coins feeling "like enough" is fresh and earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liora as "creeping normality noticer" is signaled early and her observations frame the inciting choice (breaking the bread, planting crumbs). Her noticing drives two beats: the initial observation and the decision to bake. She appears in the closure (leading the prince into the wheat), but the final turn is more about the city's collective shift than her individual decision. Her trait constrains tactics (she acts alone, in secret) with visible cost (isolation, the others "wouldn't understand").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bread appears in three distinct beats: discovery on the windowsill (setup), breaking it open and planting crumbs (development), and baking loaves that trigger memories and the wheat's spread (payoff and closure linkage). Its warmth and impossible presence drive causality; removing it would collapse the story's logic. Specificity is high: golden crust, yeast and wild honey, scored patterns. The bread's reweighted meaning at closure (coins feel "like enough") ties directly to its distribution and the city's return to ritual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is directly named late ("Some absolutions were too tenuous for words") and shapes the story's emotional stakes throughout: the city's adjustment, Liora's refusal to demand answers, the prince's weeping. It alters tactics (Liora bakes in secret, without explanation) and charges the closure image (coins as "enough" despite unresolved wounds). However, the concept is more thematic overlay than a choice-constraining force; it doesn't prevent or enable specific actions so much as color their interpretation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is mentioned once as a brother's past label and illustrated in one prior action (replanting flagstones with mint and thyme). It does not constrain an on-page choice in the present timeline; the guard's refusal to crush leaves is past summary. Liora's gentle approach (secrecy, distribution rather than confrontation) aligns with the trait, but the trait itself is label-only without a visible tradeoff or cost tied to it in a present beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears twice with clear reweighting: early as "uncloaking its wounds" (the city's strangeness) and at closure as "the ordinary had finally, mercifully, uncloaked itself." The action is metaphorical but drives the major turn—Liora's baking forces the city to stop adjusting and see its strangeness plainly. The wheat's eruption and the guards' abandonment of posts are the physical manifestation of uncloaking. Swapping "uncloak" for "reveal" would weaken the piece's metaphorical coherence, but the action is still somewhat replaceable with edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is signaled in the brother's memory (replanting flagstones) and enacted in two beats: planting crumbs in the courtyard and the wheat's eruption. The method shapes Liora's tactics (secrecy, bypassing authority) and the wheat's spread pressures the city's guards and prince. The mechanics matter: crumbs in soil → shoots → wheat → loaves. However, the method is not explicitly named or taught as a pattern; readers infer it from the mint/thyme callback and the planting action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tea house courtyard is present in setup (abandoned, overgrown, copper kettle), development (planting crumbs, wheat erupts where the fountain stood), and closure (leading the prince into the wheat). The setting constrains Liora's choices (she uses the oven, distributes loaves from windowsills) and supplies resources (the kettle, the courtyard's soil). The wheat's takeover of the fountain site is specific and irreplaceable. Removing the courtyard would require a full rewrite; the story's logic depends on this liminal, forgotten space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" anchors the season in the opening and is mentioned once more ("sparrows had flown south weeks ago"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; actions unfold across "the first frost," "by morning," "the third day," "the next morning" without urgency or deadline pressure. The timeline is present but ornamental, establishing mood rather than constraining tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Liora's desire to "find the sacred in the ordinary" is dramatized in multiple choices: noticing the warm bread, planting crumbs as question, baking with "whispered guess," refusing to explain. The motivation drives her tactics (secrecy, observation, ritual repetition) and shapes the closure (leading the prince into the wheat, coins feeling "like enough"). However, the desire is told more than shown in friction—Liora's want encounters no cost or competing pull on the page; she acts smoothly toward her goal without visible sacrifice.</comment>
