<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias is strongly embodied through goggles, key, counting ritual, and the physical tension of gripping the key. Internal conflict surfaces when he must choose whether to wind the clock despite the risk, and his realization that he's a gatekeeper rather than shepherd shifts his stance with visible cost (the new notch). Minor slip: the woman's line "You have to let go" feels slightly generic for such a charged moment, but the decision to release the key remains causally earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texturing. The counting ritual, wavering horizon, ship manifestation, key-turns, and Elias's release form a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): he releases the key, accepting his role as gatekeeper with the price visible in the new notch and his smile, foreclosing the path of intervention. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ship breaches and the woman grabs his wrist, forcing the choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cliffside station, brass instruments, hydraulic clock, copper pipes, theodolite, and fjord are vivid and purposeful. The key's physical warmth at seventy-three and the black water vomiting onto stones are specific sensory choices that constrain Elias's decision. The station's isolation and the fjord's quiet charge the final image when silence swallows the aftermath. Spatial choreography (cliff, tower, deck) remains clear across the ship's approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to wind the clock and pull the ship through or release it, signaled early when the horizon wavers. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Elias presses the key, counts, feels the warmth and smells copper, sees the ship split the horizon, stands in two places, then chooses to let go. The tightening is visible when the woman grabs his wrist and the cost is legible on the page: the ship vanishes, the new notch appears, and he smiles knowing gates can never be perfectly closed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: clocks don't measure time, they choose it; the razor edges between what was and what could be; the shepherd-to-gatekeeper shift. The key's new notch and Elias's decision to count from ninety-eight tomorrow offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The father's cryptic entry and the Bureau's denial of shepherd wisdom deepen thematic complexity. No on-the-nose thesis statements; the final image reweights the entire premise with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: "cracked in a jagged smile," "like calling a man who tends to storms a 'wind gardener,'" the razor-edge metaphor threaded through. POV remains tight to Elias; knowledge stays character-bound (Bureau logs, father's teaching). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority during counting to the dissociative moment of standing in two places. The woman's dialogue is brief and functional. Diction stays consistent under stress; no filter stacks or head-hopping. Minor: "eminently peculiar" in the third paragraph reads slightly authorial rather than Elias's natural thought pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The counting sequences accelerate tension effectively. Minor figurative clustering in the opening (barnacle, jagged smile, wind gardener) stays legible and voice-driven. The prose is clean, with strong verbs ("vomiting black water") and specific nouns. The final line "Tomorrow, he'd count backwards from ninety-eight" lands with propulsion and recharges the counting motif without overexplaining.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "shepherd of time" premise and razor-edge metaphor feel fresh; the hydraulic clock and horizon measurement station are specific rather than generic steampunk dressing. The transformation of clocks-as-choosers rather than measurers offers a non-obvious angle. The closure—gatekeeper accepting imperfect seals—grows from prior particulars. Risk-taking in the dissociative "two places at once" beat heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor: the Bureau's dismissal and the ghost-ship trope are familiar, but specificity (counting backward, the notch in the key) transforms them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout; his choices to press the key, count, and release it create the key turns. Present in setup, middle decision (counting despite danger), and payoff (release and acceptance of gatekeeper role). His final smile and plan to count from ninety-eight tie him to closure. Causal pressure is high; he narrows options under stress. Specificity: "shepherd of time" vs. "gatekeeper" distinction matters.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The key is handled in setup (pressed against brass heart), middle (turns warm at seventy-three, grows active), and payoff (released, then slipped back onto belt; new notch discovered). It constrains choices (whether to turn it), enables the breach, and returns with reweighted meaning (the notch). The key's mechanics (bow worn smooth, turning itself) are specific and irreplaceable. Closure linkage is strong: the notch and tomorrow's plan hinge on it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Razor edges between what was and what could be" is signaled early (paragraph 7) and shapes Elias's understanding at closure ("The razor edge cut deeper"). It informs his hesitation and the cost of letting go. The concept is thematic but also constrains tactics: he counts carefully, aware of the fragility. It charges the final realization that gates can't be perfectly closed. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is more implied than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" appears once in paragraph 3 as a descriptor of the title "shepherd of time." It colors tone but does not constrain an on-page action or generate visible cost. No middle development or closure participation. Ornamental; could be removed without altering plot or stakes. Late first appearance (paragraph 3) and swappable with similar modifiers.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias squints twice: at the hydraulic clock (paragraph 2) and harder when the horizon wavers (paragraph 12). The second squint precedes the discovery of the folding sea and ghost ship, a key turn. The action is specific to his role (checking horizons) and his damaged goggles. It enables the inciting observation but is not revisited at closure. Present in setup and middle; missing from payoff. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Counting backwards is signaled in paragraph 9 (from ninety-seven, the way his father had), dramatized in the middle (paragraphs 19–24: one hundred down to twenty-nine with escalating sensory changes), and returns at closure (tomorrow he'll count from ninety-eight). The method shapes the ship's breach and Elias's control. Mechanics matter: specific numbers correspond to specific effects (warm at seventy-three, copper smell at fifty-one). Irreplaceable; the entire ritual hinges on it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station provides the brass instruments, hydraulic clock, theodolite, and fjord setting that frame Elias's work. It supplies the ledger and the isolation necessary for the anomaly encounter. The station's tools (key, clock, pipes) constrain his choices. Present in setup, used in middle (clock tower, pipes vomiting water), and implicit at closure (lamplight, oiling gears). Micro-setting qualifies: the cliffside and fjord quiet charge the final image. Solid integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle" is mentioned once in paragraph 4 ("The whistle had blown an hour past") to anchor when the real work begins. It frames the timeframe but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics. No middle development or closure participation. Functional setup but replaceable; the urgency comes from the anomaly itself, not the whistle's timing. Could be swapped for "after sunset" or similar with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's desire to understand what clocks really measure is signaled early (paragraphs 6–7: "clocks didn't measure time" but the razor edges). It drives his choice to press the key despite danger and his epiphany at closure ("They chose it"). The motivation is dramatized through his father's teaching and the Bureau's dismissal. Friction surfaces when understanding risks unraveling him. Present in setup, middle choice, and payoff realization. Causal pressure is strong; the final smile shows he has accepted the answer.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" appears in paragraph 4 ("its shriek lost to the fjord's quiet") and returns at closure (paragraph 33: "the fjord's quiet swallowing the aftermath whole"). The tone modulates with pressure: quiet frames the opening calm, tension builds through the counting, and quiet returns to charge the final image of silence after the ship vanishes. Coherent through turns; the tone's return reweights the ending. The fjord's breath-holding (paragraph 21) personifies the quiet under stress. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
