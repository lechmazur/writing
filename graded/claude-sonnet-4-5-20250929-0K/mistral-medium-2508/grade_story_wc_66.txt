<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to restore narrative through pirate broadcast is clear and consistent, and his choice to open the door and continue the broadcast with Lira emerges from prior pressure. Interiority remains specific ("dust on her sleeves shimmer, just for a second") and grounded in the copyist's trade. However, the final sequence—Ministry finding the empty alcove and phrase appearing citywide—shifts to summary after the core choice, and the vanishing feels convenient rather than earned by prior on-page constraint. The girl Lira arrives late and her agency is minimal; she functions primarily as validation rather than applying pressure that forces Elias to alter tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (copyist, ember alcove, shortwave radio, post-story-famine). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accumulates through broadcast risk, the girl's arrival, and the final broadcast, then reweights at closure when the phrase spreads citywide. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias vanishes and the city adopts the phrase, crystallizing the story-famine's end with undeniable pressure. Cost is oblique—Elias's disappearance is stated but not dramatized—and the Ministry's discovery reads as summary rather than scene. The lens holds, but the final third substitutes exposition for scene work, softening the closure beat's felt immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove is vividly anchored (yellowed sheet music, damp paper, mist coiling through cracked windows) and the shortwave radio's glow functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's broadcast and charging the final moments when "the glow flared bright enough to cast their shadows on the wall." Spatial choreography remains clear across the single location. Sensory hierarchy reflects the copyist's priorities (ink, paper, static). However, "ember alcove" itself remains slightly abstract—ember suggests heat or residual fire, yet damp paper and mist dominate, creating a register drift that never fully resolves into tactile lived-in use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring stories to the city under threat of execution—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the girl arrives with transcribed lyrics, validating the broadcast's reach and raising the stakes by revealing a traceable listener. Elias's decision to let her broadcast ("What do you want to say?") narrows options with visible risk: the Ministry will know the alcove's location. However, the escalation is muted because the Ministry's response occurs off-page in summary, and Elias's vanishing feels more like author intervention than a choice with dramatized cost. The piece leans accumulative, and pressure coheres under that lens, but the final beat substitutes report for scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—narrative as survival, dust learning to speak—emerges organically from the pirate broadcast and the recurring phrase "The wind carries what the mouth cannot hold." The final image of the phrase scrawled citywide reweights prior material without a stated moral, and the dust-as-carrier motif recurs with specificity (girl's sleeves shimmer, dust begins to sing). Subtext operates in gesture and implication (the girl clutching the scrap, Elias pressing it to his chest). The ending avoids tidy resolution and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor slip: "the dust had learned how to wait. And how to listen" edges toward theme summary rather than trusting the prior image work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (copyist's eye for music, ink, static). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "the story famine," "elusive lyrics," "thistled calm" (though "thistled" reads slightly strained). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—Lira's "My name is Lira, and I remember the color blue" advances plot and carries thematic weight. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during broadcast, wider for the Ministry's discovery). Minor issue: "the only light came from the shortwave radio's dial, its glow secretly luminous" introduces "secretly luminous" as description rather than POV-filtered perception, creating a brief register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but generally purposeful ("mist coiled through the cracked windows, thick as regret"). Information density is high; most lines advance story or atmosphere. However, patterned artifacts accumulate: "dust" recurs across ten beats without always adding new pressure, creating synonym churn around "shimmer," "whisper," "sing." The phrase "The wind carries what the mouth cannot hold" is repeated four times, twice identically, which reads as motif reinforcement but edges toward loop. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "By dawn, the phrase was scrawled... Elias was already gone... The story famine would last... But now, the dust had learned..." (four parallel declaratives in summary mode). These artifacts cluster in the closure section, dulling immediacy when scene work would sharpen cost.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of pirate broadcast, forbidden songs, and sentient dust offers a fresh angle on resistance-through-art premises, and the detail is specific (copyist trade, shortwave dial glow, salt-rotted docks). The phrase "The wind carries what the mouth cannot hold" functions as both tactical tool and thematic anchor, and the girl transcribing lyrics from static is a strong particular. However, the core arc—underground artist risks execution to restore culture—follows a recognizable template, and the ending (hero vanishes, movement spreads) is a familiar pattern. Transformation is present but not radical. The "dust learning to speak" conceit is the piece's boldest choice, though it remains more asserted than mechanically grounded.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias the copyist is present throughout, and his occupation shapes his method (transcribing, broadcasting music/text). His choice to open the door to Lira and let her broadcast drives the final turn. However, his vanishing at the end is summarized rather than chosen on-page, and his trade as copyist matters more as thematic texture than as constraint—any underground broadcaster could perform the same arc with minor edits. Present in setup, middle choice (door), and ending (gone), but the ending participation is passive (he is acted upon by the Ministry off-page). Two beats with causal pressure, but closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow appears in the opening, is adjusted twice (turned to pinprick when the knock comes, then flared bright for Lira's broadcast), and recurs in the final image ("the stubborn glow of a dial that refused to darken"). It constrains Elias's broadcast timing and lights the alcove, shaping the atmosphere and the final symbolic charge. Specificity is high ("its brass casing still warm," "pulsing faintly in time with the static"). Present in setup, middle, and ending with reweighted meaning. Strong causal and closure linkage; the glow's refusal to darken directly charges the city's adoption of the phrase.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Pirate broadcast is the dominant stake and tactic: Elias broadcasts forbidden material at risk of execution, the girl arrives because she heard the broadcast, and the Ministry's search for the source drives the final tension. The concept shapes every major beat and alters tactics (he dims the dial when the knock comes, invites Lira to broadcast herself). Present in setup, middle, and ending. However, the broadcast mechanics remain abstract—we never see a patrol close in or a near-miss that raises cost on-page. Causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is present but indirect (the phrase spreads, not the broadcast itself).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is attributed to the radio dial's glow in the opening and returns at the ending ("the stubborn glow of a dial that refused to darken"). The secrecy is not dramatized—no patrol nearly discovers the glow, no moment where Elias must hide it under pressure. It reads as atmospheric descriptor rather than constraint. Present in setup and ending with thematic charge, but no middle beat where the trait alters a choice. Lyric reprise reweights the image at closure, lifting it into mid-band, but the "secret" quality itself never matters tactically.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears once, when Elias "cloaked his voice in the elusive lyrics of the Chant of the Hollow Reed." The action enables the broadcast method and links to the forbidden-song tactic, but it is mentioned only in summary and does not recur or constrain a later choice. The piece does not show the cloaking process or a moment where uncloaking would risk exposure. Functional in setup, absent in middle and ending. Swappable with "disguised" or "masked" without structural change. One beat, no causal pressure beyond enabling the initial state.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elusive song lyrics (specifically "Chant of the Hollow Reed" and the play fragment "The wind carries what the mouth cannot hold") are the broadcast method and recur as the phrase that spreads citywide. The method is signaled early and shapes the final image. However, the "elusiveness" is told rather than shown—we never see the lyrics resist understanding or require effort to transmit. The phrase's power to "unspool silence" is asserted but not dramatized in a beat where it alters a listener's options. Present in setup and ending with thematic charge; middle use is summary-only. Lyric reprise lifts it, but mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ember alcove is the single setting and grounds every beat (walls lined with sheet music, cracked windows, desk). It provides the broadcast location and forces Elias to dim the radio when the knock comes, showing mild constraint. The mist pressing closer at key moments adds atmosphere and reflects pressure. Present throughout with spatial choreography and micro-setting function (the desk, the door, the radio's placement). However, the alcove does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters tactics—Elias could broadcast from any hidden room. Strong setup and atmospheric charge; middling causal pressure; present but not causally active in the ending (he leaves it empty).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the story famine" frames the premise and "seventeen years" anchors historical depth, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page. "Every midnight" signals broadcast timing, yet no clock pressure appears—no patrol schedule, no ticking countdown. "That night" and "By dawn" mark the ending sequence but function as transition labels rather than constraints. The piece unfolds in a single evening with no time crunch that alters Elias's moves. Present in setup as context; absent as tactical pressure in middle and ending. Context-only use trends low-mid.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To teach dust to tell stories" is Elias's stated motivation and recurs at the ending ("the dust had learned how to wait. And how to listen"). It shapes his choice to start the broadcast and to let Lira speak, but the motivation is told more than dramatized—we do not see Elias wrestle with the cost of broadcasting or choose between competing goods. The girl's arrival validates the goal but does not force a conflicted choice. Present in setup (stated), middle (door choice), and ending (fulfilled); however, friction between want and cost is minimal. Lyric payoff at closure lifts it into mid-band, but the desire lacks on-page contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" is a striking phrase but does not function as a stable tone descriptor. The piece oscillates between lyric quiet (damp paper, mist, humming alcove) and stated urgency (executions, censors, risk), yet emotional modulation is muted—Elias remains composed throughout, and the girl's arrival does not spike tension on the page. The tone at closure shifts to declarative summary ("By dawn, the phrase was scrawled...") rather than charged calm. Purposeful restraint is present, but the "thistled" quality—implying prickle or defensive spikiness—never manifests in syntax or rhythm. Coherent through most beats; does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Mid-band for coherence without dynamic range.</comment>
