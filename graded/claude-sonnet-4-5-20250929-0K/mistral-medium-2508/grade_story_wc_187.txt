<comment>Summer-Quill's interiority is richly embodied through sensory detail and her interaction with the crystal flags, and the "preemptively nostalgic" trait shapes her perceptual filter throughout. However, the final shift—realizing "identity wasn't something you sculpted from experience—it was what remained when you stopped trying to shape it at all"—arrives as insight rather than through a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The arc is more contemplative realization than contradictory impulses forcing a hard choice, weakening the causality of the change.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (flags, shadow, storm, memory) and a cadence shift at the vision-touch moment that reweights her understanding. Orientation anchors who and where early, though "when" remains atmospheric ("after fog becomes solid"). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she stops measuring and accepts the river metaphor—but the cost is conceptual and felt rather than decisively visible on the page, which limits the charge. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The crystal flags, the Spear's shadow, and the stormlit observatory above clouds are vividly rendered and purposefully integrated. The flags hold borrowed memory that Summer-Quill handles ("pressing her fingers," later "her palm"), and the shadow's twitch and the space where it "would fall" directly enable the vision-touch moment. The observatory's isolation and the storm's rhythm charge the final image ("the candle flames bent toward the future"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or recurring object constrains choice or charges closure.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—sculpting identity from collective memory—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through her method (measuring shadows, tracing memory), the Spear's shadow-twitch complication, and the vision that reweights her approach. The tightening is internal: she moves from trying to dam the river to letting it flow, which narrows her former tactic and forecloses the archivist-as-sculptor path. Agency is renunciation with a felt cost (abandoning the chase), though the price could be sharper on the page to enter the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The theme—identity as emergent rather than constructed—arises organically from the flags, the shadow method, and the river metaphor without moralizing. The final image ("The page was blank. And for the first time, that was enough") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (the Spear's recognition chime, footsteps leaving no prints). A few phrases edge toward abstraction ("the sound of the past making room"), but the particulars anchor the conceptual work solidly.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The prose maintains a distinct, lyric voice with controlled distance and purposeful compression ("the breath of the unspoken," "the shadow of the central monument had bled into an uneven stain"). Psychic distance is stable; POV knowledge remains consistent. Some lines in the final third approach elevated diction that lightly tensions the established register ("chiseling her own edges against the collective memory"), but the effect remains voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the execution.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high across most beats. However, the middle section contains minor paraphrase loops: "The method was old: examining shadow lengths… But she wasn't measuring time. She was sculpting identity…" restates her goal without added pressure, and "not the archivist, not the keeper, but the one who *understood*" edges into summary redundancy. The final third's figurative density ("hands against a windowpane," "a map," "a river," "a lullaby") stacks metaphors in quick succession, lightly testing coherence without breaking it. These artifacts remain non-closure and trigger a modest deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of shadow-measurement, collective memory, and the archivist's identity quest is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The river-versus-dam realization and the charged final image (blank page as sufficiency) feel earned in hindsight. However, the "archivist who collects forgotten things" and "epiphany about letting go" premise echoes familiar terrain; transformation comes through the crystal flags and shadow mechanics rather than a wholly fresh frame. Risk-taking in the lyric, reflective mode elevates the work within its band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Summer-Quill is on the page throughout and her choice to stop measuring and accept the river drives the ending. She kneels, presses her palm, receives the vision, stands, and returns to the observatory—decisions that alter her stance. Early signal is strong; her action shapes the closure image. However, the arc leans more toward realization than a hard decision that forecloses a prior path with visible cost, limiting the causal pressure score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The crystal flags appear in the opening third ("crystal flags humming," "a shard of memory"), are handled mid-story ("She knelt, pressing her fingers to the damp stone"), and chime in recognition at the turning moment. They hold borrowed memory and constrain her method (she must read refraction at the precise hour). The final image references them indirectly (the observatory interior) rather than returning to them on the page, which lowers closure linkage slightly. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure across two distinct moments.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Collective memory is the story's premise and shapes the dominant stake: Summer-Quill tries to sculpt identity from the flags' borrowed memories. It appears early, drives her method (measuring, conjecturing), and the vision teaches her it's "a river" not "a vault," reweighting the concept at closure. The mechanics are clear and alter her tactics. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than a discrete, on-page constraint with visible cost, which keeps it shy of the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Preemptively nostalgic" is introduced early ("a condition she'd diagnosed in herself at fourteen") and filters her perception throughout ("every moment was already slipping into the past before it fully arrived"). It shapes her archivist vocation and her attempt to pin down what is "never meant to be caught." The trait enables her method but the visible cost tied specifically to this attribute is implicit rather than dramatized in a discrete choice, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Conjecture" is named as part of the method ("the method was old: examining shadow lengths at monuments to conjecture what the light had been") but does not create a major turn. The actual turn comes from pressing her palm and receiving the vision, which feels more like contact than conjecture. The action is signaled and consistent with her work, but it could be replaced with another interpretive act (e.g., "interpret," "deduce") without structural loss, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The method—examining shadow lengths—is introduced early and used on the page: she kneels at the Spear's shadow, traces "the space where its shadow *would* fall if the light had never changed," and that tracing triggers the vision. The mechanics matter and shape her attempt. However, the method does not appear in the ending image (she sits with a blank page, not shadows), which limits closure linkage. Two distinct beats and causal involvement place it solidly mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is anchored early, provides isolation that enables her uninterrupted work, and the storm's pulse and rain punctuate key beats. The forecourt and tower supply the spatial resources (flags, Spear, desk) that constrain and enable her actions. The final image ("In the observatory, the candle flames bent toward the future") charges the closure. Environment shapes tactics and the ending, meeting the high-band requirement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>"After fog becomes solid" anchors the timeframe atmospherically in the opening and the story proceeds in a single continuous session ("Tonight, she stood"). However, the time constraint does not tighten decisions—there is no clock pressure or deadline that alters her tactics. The fog and storm provide mood and ritual context but do not function as a live constraint that narrows options, keeping the score mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The motivation—to sculpt identity from experience—is stated early, dramatized through her method (kneeling, pressing, tracing), and tested by the vision that shows her "trying to pin down what was never meant to be caught." The friction between her desire to shape and the realization that identity "was what remained when you stopped trying to shape it at all" creates the story's central conflict. The cost is felt (abandoning the sculptor stance) and the ending image (blank page as sufficiency) pays off the motivation with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The tone—deepening hush—is established early ("the only sound was the slow creak of the tower," "the hush wasn't an absence") and modulates with pressure: the flags hum and whisper, the storm pulses, the Spear chimes in recognition, and the final beat offers "the sigh of a held breath released." The tone charges the final image ("the candle flames bent toward the future") and the closing line ("that was enough") lands in quiet sufficiency. Coherent across all beats and purposefully calibrated to the accumulative design.</comment>
