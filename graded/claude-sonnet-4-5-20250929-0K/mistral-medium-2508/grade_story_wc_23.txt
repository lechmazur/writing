<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is embodied through concrete particulars—tracing cracks in the bronze, building towers of driftwood—and the backstory block (~15%) effectively anchors her present stance. The shift from ship navigator to ruin navigator is earned through her radio work and the maps she builds, with micro-choices (lighting the candle, rolling fresh paper) revealing hierarchy of values. However, the phone-call voices remain abstract; their identity ambiguity ("echoes of herself") flirts with mysticism without grounding choices in specific contradiction or embodied cost, keeping the work strong but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph and teaches a pattern of lunar cycles, phone calls, and map-building that accumulates toward the final image. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the weight in her chest felt lighter" and "the maps weren't just directions, but anchors" reweights her navigation project with felt cost (years of solitary work, the ache in her ribs). The cost is legible and the cadence shift from isolation to connection lands cleanly. One tightening—tonight's call moves from riddles to "the way back"—narrows her stance from passive recording to active guidance, sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The signal station is vividly anchored (rusted antennae, warped floorboards, dying relay switches) and micro-setting elements—the censer foot, typewriter, phone—constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful: "salt wind," "click of relay switches," "breath fogging the bronze." The bronze censer foot functions as both object and setting micro-anchor, warming in her grip and shaping the closure beat. The cliffs, station interior, and props are spatially coherent and pressure choices throughout, though occupational systems (signal-station mechanics) remain sketched rather than deeply rendered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Lena's need to chart loss and guide the drowned home. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening—tonight she moves from recording to directing ("Start walking")—that narrows her role from passive receiver to active navigator with visible cost (her solitude, her ache). The phone calls escalate in clarity with lunar phases, and the final act (hanging up, lighting a candle, rolling fresh paper) forecloses her prior isolation. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the maps function as both tactic and constraint. The reversal is modest but earned, and the cost (years of waiting, the weight lifting) is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—navigating loss, reverse migration, the geography of absence—emerges organically from Lena's map-building and the phone calls without overt statement. The censer foot, bronze patina, and maps accumulate into a resonant image: "the maps weren't just directions, but anchors" reweights the premise without moralizing. The final image (rolling fresh paper, the rising moon, the promise of another call) offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how the lost find their way home. Subtext operates cleanly in gesture (breath fogging bronze, the candle lit) and the piece resists tidy resolution, instead achieving raw solace through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tight; perception is filtered through Lena's professional past (charts, coordinates, radio voice) and present specificity (patchwork, driftwood towers, string-and-nail maps). Diction stays consistent—concrete, tactile, maritime—with purposeful cadence modulation (short urgency in the phone exchange, longer breath in reflection). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: the caller's riddles and Lena's translation advance plot and reveal subtext. Filter verbs are light; psychic distance stays close. Voice distinction between Lena's narration and the caller's rough static is clear. No head-hopping; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled with strong concrete detail ("rusted antennae," "warped floorboards," "greenish bloom of oxidation"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "She hadn't always been a navigator of ruins" anchors past and present). However, minor scaffold appears: "the censer foot didn't glow, didn't sing—but it listened" leans toward stock mysticism, and "raw and unpolished" in the penultimate paragraph adds a label where image already carries the weight. "The weight in her chest felt lighter, as if the maps weren't just directions, but anchors" unpacks the metaphor slightly more than needed. Information density is high elsewhere, and the final lines propel cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—reverse migration, guiding the drowned inland—transforms the ghost-story frame through specificity: coordinates given in riddles, maps of "reverse migrations," bronze censer foot as talisman. The synthesis of signal station, lunar cycles, and patchwork navigator feels purposeful rather than checklist. The turn from passive recording to active guidance is non-obvious and earned. Risk-taking in the ambiguous caller identities ("echoes of herself, calling backward through time") heightens thematic charge without full clarity, which is intentional. The piece avoids template plots and stock resolution; the ending image (rolling fresh paper, moon rising) offers a durable, specific vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout and her choices shape beats: lifting the censer foot, answering the phone, sketching coordinates, lighting the candle, rolling fresh paper. Her decision to say "Start walking" marks the key turn from passive to active navigator. Present by setup, constrains middle action (map-building, phone ritual), and drives the ending choice. The role "patchwork navigator" is named but its mechanics (salvaging, stitching) are implied rather than shown in distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The censer foot appears in beat one (traced, pulsing faintly with the moon), returns mid-story (lifted to her ear, cold then warming), and anchors the closure beat (set atop the sketch, patina deepening, breath fogging it, "it listened"). Its warming and color shift tie to lunar phase and map completion. The object's role evolves from talisman to tool to witness. Specific properties (patina, pitted surface, warmth) matter and constrain her ritual. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reverse migration" is named explicitly ("maps of reverse migrations, paths leading inland from the sea") and shapes the story's logic: the drowned trying to find their way home, footsteps retracing the tide's retreat. It informs Lena's mapmaking and the caller's need. Present in setup (conceptually), middle (map descriptions), and ending (footsteps in wet sand). However, the concept is more thematic frame than tactical constraint; removing the phrase would not break scene-level choices. It reweights meaning but does not narrow on-page options in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lunar phase is signaled early ("the moon was a sliver," "the censer foot pulsed faintly when the moon swelled full") and the calls' clarity "fluctuates with the phases" ("waxing moon, the voices were clear... on the wane, they dissolved"). The trait enables tonight's action (sliver moon = cold foot, but rising moon at end charges the promise of another call). Present across setup, middle rhythm, and ending image. However, the fluctuation is told more than dramatized; we do not see a failed or garbled call on-page to feel the cost of a waning phase.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Build" is the spine: Lena builds towers of driftwood, maps of string and nail, routes with pen and typewriter. Every beat involves construction—feeding graph paper, sketching coordinates, setting the bronze atop the sketch, rolling fresh paper. The final turn ("she would build") recharges the action as vow and closure. Present in setup ("she built things instead"), drives middle beats (translation into ink, new route unfolding), and anchors the ending. The action is irreplaceable; swapping "build" for another verb would collapse the thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("the phone rang," "Midnight calls were never for the living") and shapes two beats: the riddle-call and the final outbound call ("Start walking"). The cryptic riddles force Lena's translation work and move her from passive to active. Present in setup (phone rang), middle (riddle-to-coordinate mechanics), and ending (she dials, the promise of another ring). However, only one full exchange is dramatized on the page; the "every lunar cycle" pattern is told. The mechanics matter but are not pressure-tested across multiple attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The signal station is anchored in paragraph one ("clung to the edge of the cliffs," "rusted antennae," "warped floorboards") and its components—phone, typewriter, candle, walls papered with maps—constrain and enable every beat. The setting's isolation charges Lena's solitude and the station "hummed with something like solace" at closure. Present across setup, middle (relay switches, antenna groaning, walls), and ending (station as ship, adrift). The starlit frame brackets the action (sliver moon → rising moon) and the cliffs' erosion echoes theme. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics fail" anchors backstory (lighthouse failure, coastguard call, "No survivors") and motivates Lena's shift to ruin navigation. It sets the "Now" frame but does not tighten present-tense decisions; the story unfolds in one night without a live clock counting down. Present in setup (backstory block) but absent from middle tactics and ending image. The timeframe is a setup cue, not a constraint that alters moves. Functional but replaceable with another inciting loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To navigate the geography of loss" is dramatized through Lena's map-building, her translation of riddles into routes, and her guidance ("the way back"). The motivation is embodied in her ache, her towers of driftwood, and the weight in her chest that lifts when she acts. Present in setup (building to chart loss), middle (sketch of routes, "weight of what was missing"), and ending (maps as anchors). The desire conflicts with solitude and the cost of years spent waiting. The friction between recording loss and guiding others home charges the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Raw solace" coheres across beats: the station's rusted decay, the "ache in her ribs," the caller's hitching breath, and the final hum "raw and unpolished." Tone modulates with pressure—sparse and cold early, warming through the call exchange, charged at closure ("for the first time in years, the weight... felt lighter"). The ending image (rolling fresh paper, rising moon) earns the solace without sweetness. Tone shapes the final charge and is irreducible to the piece's effect. The label "raw solace" is named once in the penultimate paragraph, slightly over-explaining what the images already carry.</comment>
