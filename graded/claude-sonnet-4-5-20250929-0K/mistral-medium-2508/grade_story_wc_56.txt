<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's characterization operates through concrete objects (sundial, ledger) and selective perception (canal's reflection, heron's flight). The decision to drop the ledger and keep the sundial shows internal contradiction with visible cost—releasing the mapped destinations but retaining the tool that "points inward." However, the line "the architecture of lies—the way they were framed, the way they sagged under their own weight" reads as diagnostic meta-commentary that tells rather than embodies her expertise. The final choice to steer toward docks after dropping the ledger feels earned but the intermediate beats often substitute poetic observation for micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (barge, canal, Liora) within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring images (sundial, reflection, ledger) and a cadence shift when Liora drops the ledger and turns the barge back. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she walks away from the auctioneers with the sundial, foreclosing the pursuit with visible cost ("no longer lost"). The cost is legible in the drowned ledger and the acceptance that "some things weren't meant to be found." One meaningful deepening through the marshes scene reweights her understanding from seeking destinations to recognizing "the spaces between them."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The twilight canal, algae-slick piling, and marsh mist are vivid and filtered through Liora's seeker's lens. The sundial's shadow "pointing inward" and the radio's dying broadcast supply small constraints that shape her final choice to release the ledger. Spatial choreography (stern → canal split → marshes → docks) remains clear. However, the barge itself—central to the setting—remains functionally inert; Liora steers it but its weight, cargo constraints, or mechanical needs never pressure a single choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding her father's lie-architecture vs. letting go) is signaled early and tightens once when the sundial's shadow "points inward," triggering the marshes detour and ledger-drop. That move forecloses the mapped chase with visible cost (years of pursuit, the ledger itself). The final turn—steering back to docks but planning to refuse sale—adds a second meaningful narrowing. Agency is clear (her decisions drive each turn) and the Accumulative lens supports the gradual reweighting. Pressure coheres but escalation is modest; the middle marshes passage accumulates mood more than rising stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (the architecture of lies as scaffolding, not destination) emerges through the sundial's shifting use, the ledger's drowning, and Liora's realization about "spaces between." The final image—"hindsight wasn't about seeing clearly. It was about learning to squint"—reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the central question. The sundial recurs purposefully (pitted face, bent gnomon, inward-pointing shadow, kept as reminder) and charges the closure. Minor penalty: "The lies weren't the architecture. They were the scaffolding" reads slightly over-articulated for peak realization, though it stops short of a thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV narration maintains stable third-limited distance with Liora's perceptual signature (salvager's eye for "brass edges," "thoughtfully clear" ink, objects as prompts). Diction remains consistent—poetic-compressed but legible, with purposeful fragments ("Errant, unsteady, but no longer lost"). The line "hindsight wasn't about seeing clearly. It was about learning to squint" carries voice-specific compression. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during sundial examination, wider during marsh passage). No head-hopping; filter verbs appear but serve the reflective mode. Rhythm varies naturally across beats without template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is lyric-dense with strong imagery ("blade through old parchment," "pages spreading like lily pads") and information density is high. However, several beats loop concept without advancing pressure: "silence of a world that had moved on" / "the world's noise faded to this" restate the same isolation; "not as she was, but as she might have been: steady, unbroken" / "as she was—errant, unsteady, but no longer lost" recycle the contrast structure. The line "some things weren't meant to be found. They were meant to be let go" is a paraphrase loop across adjacent sentences. Template stems appear in the auctioneers triplet ("the first…the second…the third"). Apply −0.6 for loops and −0.3 for template cadence in non-closure beats = −0.9 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of relic-seeker and internal quest, canal barge as liminal space, and the sundial's "inward" shadow offers a fresh angle on letting-go narratives. The transformation of the father's coordinates from destinations to "spaces between" is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (chasing the past → releasing it) follows a well-trodden template, and the piece does not take bold structural risks beyond lush description. The radio's "last broadcast" and heron's flight read as ambient detail rather than causal elements. Proximity check: "the past is a map, but only fools trust the legend" echoes numerous craft aphorisms without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout as an errant legend seeker. Her choices—steering toward marshes (instead of docks initially), dropping the ledger, keeping the sundial, planning to walk away from auctioneers—create the story's key turns. The role shapes her perception (salvaging objects, reading "the architecture of lies") and drives both the middle deepening and the closure. Setup: early; Development: marshes choice; Payoff: refusal to sell. Causal pressure clear. Swappability: low—her seeker training and father's ledger are specific. Cost: years of pursuit released. Minor deduction: some beats (canal reflection, heron) are observed without immediate decision pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sundial appears in at least four beats: stern examination (brass edges, bent gnomon, inscription), held up in marshes (shadow points inward), grows warm in pocket, final decision to keep it. It enables the key turn (the inward-pointing shadow triggers the marshes detour and ledger-drop) and charges the closure (kept "as a reminder" of squinting hindsight). Setup: opening paragraph; Development: marshes shadow-reading; Payoff: closure image and thematic anchor. Causal pressure and irreplaceability high. Visible cost tied to keeping it (walking away from gold). Deduction: the warming-in-pocket beat reads slightly ornamental—an atmospheric flourish that does not alter her choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity operates thematically (the sundial's defiant shadow, the father's "thoughtfully clear" coordinates, the final epiphany "hindsight wasn't about seeing clearly. It was about learning to squint") and constrains Liora's stake—she seeks clarity but learns to accept ambiguity. The concept is woven into the ending image and the ledger-drop moment. However, it does not visibly change her tactics on the page; rather, it reframes her understanding after the fact. Setup: implicit in "doubted her father's stories"; Development: shadow pointing inward; Payoff: squinting line. More echo than engine—it enriches theme but does not force a mid-scene choice with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" describes the ledger's ink once ("the numbers were thoughtfully clear") but does not function as a trait that constrains or enables Liora's actions. It characterizes her father's care, not her own attribute. No on-page cost or enabling moment tied to this quality. Appears once, mid-story, as description. Missing setup as Liora's trait, missing development, missing payoff. Swappable with "carefully preserved" or similar. No causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Salvage frames Liora's identity ("she had salvaged [the sundial] from a sinking houseboat two towns back") and her trained instincts. She salvages the sundial, contemplates salvaging vs. releasing the ledger's destinations, and chooses what to keep. The action underlies the closure choice (selective salvage = keep sundial, release ledger). Setup: early; Development: implicit in her examination and choice; Payoff: closure retention vs. release. However, the act of salvaging itself is backstory—she does not perform salvage on the page during the primary scene window. The central turns (steering, dropping ledger, planning refusal) do not require salvage mechanics. Swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"By training instincts" is declared once in exposition ("Her training had honed her instincts, not for combat or theft, but for the architecture of lies") but the mechanics never appear. We do not see her training in action—no moment where she reads a structural tell, tests a lie's weight, or applies learned technique under pressure. The phrase is label-only. Setup: mid-story mention; Development: absent; Payoff: absent. Easily swappable with "by intuition" or removed entirely. No visible cost or enabling moment tied to trained method vs. raw perception.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal anchors every scene and pressures Liora's choices: the canal split forces a binary (docks vs. marshes), the half-sunk piling provides a tie-off point for the ledger-drop, the water swallows the ledger and reflects her transformation. The barge's movement (cutting, nudging, steering back) tracks her emotional arc. Setup: opening line; Development: canal split and marshes passage; Payoff: steering into light. Causal pressure clear, irreplaceability high. Specificity strong (algae, mist, wake, piling). Cost: the marshes detour and the ledger's drowning both depend on canal geography. Minor deduction: twilight itself (vs. dawn or noon) does not constrain a choice; the time progression (twilight → morning) happens off-page between radio mentions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The radio broadcasts bracket the piece ("the morning broadcast long dead" at opening, "repeat, this is the last broadcast" near end) and signal passage to "the silence of morning." However, time does not tighten decisions—Liora's pace is contemplative throughout, with no clock pressure on her marshes detour or ledger-drop. The morning/twilight transition occurs off-page without altering her tactics. Setup: early; Development: absent (no mid-scene urgency); Payoff: the final "morning light" image closes the frame but does not charge the choice. Swappable with any liminal time marker. No visible cost tied to the timeframe itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to understand the architecture of lies") is declared and dramatized through Liora's examination of the sundial's inscription, the ledger's coordinates, and her realization that "the lies weren't the architecture. They were the scaffolding." It drives her years-long pursuit and the closure choice (release the map, keep the reminder). Setup: early; Development: marshes insight; Payoff: closure shift from seeking to releasing. Friction visible: she wants clarity but learns to "squint." However, the phrase "architecture of lies" itself is abstract and borders on therapy-speak; the want is more told than shown through micro-choices under immediate pressure. Cost: years and the ledger, both legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" captures the piece's tonal paradox: lyric calm layered over existential release. The tone remains coherent—contemplative, elegiac, compressed—and modulates purposefully (quieter during reflection, slightly more urgent at the canal split, serene again at closure). The final image ("the water kept moving. And so did she") charges the tone with forward motion despite loss. However, the upheaval itself is muted; the emotional cost is understated to the point where the serenity dominates. Setup: opening twilight lyricism; Development: marshes stillness during the ledger-drop; Payoff: closure movement. Irreplaceability moderate—"quiet reckoning" or "melancholy resolve" would yield similar effects.</comment>
