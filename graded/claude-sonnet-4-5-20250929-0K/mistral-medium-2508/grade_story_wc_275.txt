<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is grounded in concrete sensory anchors—pressing thorns, tasting the sandbag, listening to roots—and her contradiction between inheritance (father's violence-to-peace arc) and her own choice to anchor rather than flee creates genuine internal tension. The choice to stay with the roses over escape is dramatized through micro-actions (sheathing the knife, knotting the scrap) that foreclose a path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the father's voice and lessons dominate reflection heavily, occasionally flattening Liora's own perceptual signature into inherited maxims rather than her lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently (Liora, dome, post-collapse), builds pressure through layered images (sandbag, knife, roses, fissure), and delivers Earned Stasis closure—Liora's refusal to flee, her commitment to tend the quiet, forecloses escape with palpable cost ("The world had fallen. She would weave it back together, one thorn at a time"). The cost is felt in her isolation and the fissure that "didn't spread. Neither did she." One meaningful deepening occurs when she decides to patch the dome with the sandbag scrap, crystallizing her stance. No causality breaks; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dome, sandbag, knife, and roses function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the cracked pane pressures her decision to patch it, the soil grounds her kneeling ritual, and the glass barrier becomes the literal and symbolic edge she defends. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"thick with the scent of things that refused to break"—and the roses' breathing versus the world's scream creates spatial contrast that charges the final image. The fissure that "didn't spread. Neither did she" uses environment to anchor her renunciation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: tend the continuity (roses, dome) versus flee the collapsing world. The pressure tightens when the sandbag's impact cracks the glass, forcing Liora to choose between repair and escape; her decision to kneel again and wait for the plants' guidance is Earned Stasis with visible cost (isolation, danger deferred). The knife's transformation from weapon to carving tool, and the final image of patching the dome, narrows her options and forecloses flight. Agency is renunciation under accumulative pressure; the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the contrast between her father's violent past and her cultivation of quiet, the roses as continuity against ruin, and the knife repurposed from weapon to inscription tool. The final image—"She would weave it back together, one thorn at a time"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to endure collapse) without stating a moral. The sandbag's scrap as both ruin-remnant and future patch, and "engraved quiet" as inherited practice, anchor the theme in objects and actions rather than assertion. No overt philosophizing at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Liora's sensory bias (thorns, taste, vibration). Perceptual signature is distinct—she notices roots, stitching, the roses' breathing—and diction remains consistent (concrete, slightly elevated but never clinical). Free indirect style is clean: "You were supposed to leave" registers as memory without filter clutter. Minor deduction: a few stock constructions under pressure ("the world burned," "the scream of dust") slightly flatten rhythm, and one line—"things that refused to break"—edges toward generic assertion rather than her specific voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or stakes. Rhythm modulates well between kneeling stillness and the world's roar. Deductions: several paraphrase loops and template cadence runs appear—"The tower was dust. The roses were not" echoes "The world had fallen" phrasing, and multiple sentences open with "She + verb" in the final third (−0.4). Stock metaphor "like a child's sandcastle under a boot" in the opening, and "thick with the scent of things that refused to break" leans abstract (−0.3). One filter-verb cluster mid-story ("felt the vibration," "smelled of earth") slightly dulls immediacy (−0.2). Artifacts do not obscure closure but accumulate across non-closure beats (total −0.9 per cap).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of bounty-hunter-turned-gardener legacy, post-collapse stillness versus urgency, and the knife as writing tool rather than weapon feels specific and non-obvious. The "engraved quiet" motif and roses-as-continuity are executed with grounded detail rather than quirk. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on the dome/roses/father's philosophy intersection. Minor deduction: the tower's collapse and airship wreckage arrive as backdrop rather than causally integrated stakes, limiting the premise's boldness (−0.3). No derivative template, and the risk of a quiet, refusal-driven ending succeeds without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's choice to stay and tend rather than flee drives the closure unit (Earned Stasis) and her micro-actions—kneeling, sheathing the knife, patching the dome—alter tactics across multiple beats. Setup clear (daughter of bounty hunter, now gardener), development (her kneeling ritual and decision to patch), and payoff (final stance crystallization). Causal pressure is strong; her renunciation forecloses flight with visible cost. Specific to her inherited philosophy ("engraved quiet") and irreplaceable in the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears in setup (frayed canvas, father's engraving), development (she tastes it, feels its rough edges, recognizes it cracked the pane), and payoff (she plans to stitch it into the dome's seam as a patch). Three distinct beats with escalating function: memory anchor → pressure source (cracked glass) → repair material. Its weight andwords drive her reflection and final choice. Irreplaceable: the scrap's dual role as ruin-remnant and continuity-patch charges the closure image. Cost tied to it: the fissure it caused and her decision to repurpose rather than discard.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: father's engraved phrase "Quiet, like the wind before dawn" on the sandbag. Development: she carves "continuity" into bark and reflects on his teaching. Payoff: the final image of tending quiet versus the world's scream reweights the concept. Two beats (engraving and final stance), and it shapes her dominant stake—maintain the quiet her father taught. However, "engraved quiet" as a phrase mechanism (inscribing words) is less causally active than the broader philosophy it represents; swappable with "inherited stillness" without major structural loss (−0.5). Lyric resonance present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: "the roses bloomed in senselessly perceptive silence" and "she knelt again… and waited for the plants to tell her what came next. They always did." The trait is present as characterization of the roses' responsiveness to her father's teaching. Development: her listening posture recurs. Missing: no on-page moment where this specific perceptivity constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The roses' silence functions atmospherically but does not alter tactics or create tradeoff. Label-only mention without dramatized consequence (−0.6). Introduced early but not integrated causally into a decision beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "sheathed her knife into the soil beside a sapling." Development: "The blade had never tasted blood—she'd spent years sharpening it only to carve her father's phrases into bark, turning weapons into whispers." Payoff: "She pulled it free… to carve continuity into the bark." Three beats; the act of sheathing and re-purposing the knife encapsulates her renunciation of violence and commitment to inscription. Causal role: the knife's transformation from weapon to tool for engraving mirrors her choice to anchor rather than fight or flee. Irreplaceable: removing "sheathe" would require rewriting the weapon-to-whisper arc that charges the closure. Cost present: forsaking the blade's martial use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "Plants remember," he'd say, pressing his calloused hands into the earth, inculcating the roots with the same stubborn patience he'd once used to track fugitives." Development: she waits for the plants to tell her what comes next. Payoff: her final listening posture and decision to tend. Two beats; the method is her inherited practice and shapes her dominant stake (continuity through cultivation). However, the mechanics of "inculcating values" remain abstract—we see her listening and carving, but the actual transfer of values to plants is asserted, not demonstrated with cost or constraint on-page (−0.7). Present and thematically active but not causally irreplaceable; swappable with "tending" or "teaching."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: dome and roses anchored in opening paragraph. Development: the cracked pane pressures her choice, the glass barrier creates the contrast (quiet inside / chaos outside), and the soil grounds her kneeling ritual. Payoff: "the dome would stand" and her plan to patch the seam with the sandbag scrap. Four beats with escalating causal pressure; the dome's integrity is the material stake and the fissure's threat forces her repair decision. Irreplaceable: the enclosure's physics (glass, warmth, fragility) and spatial contrast charge every beat and the final image. Cost tied to setting: the crack she must mend, the isolation she accepts. Strong micro-setting use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "after the tower falls" and "By dawn, the desert would be ash." Development: the airship wreckage is recent, the crowds are fleeing now, and her father's voice says "You were supposed to leave." Payoff: "By dawn" anchors the closure window. Two beats; the post-collapse frame creates urgency (she stayed when others fled) and the dawn deadline adds temporal weight to her vigil. However, no on-page clock tightens her moves—she kneels, reflects, and waits without time pressure altering tactics within the scene (−0.6). Present and coherent but not causally constraining her choices in real-time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: implicit in her staying with the roses when the tower falls. Development: "You were supposed to leave… but the roses had needed her more" and her carving "continuity" into bark. Payoff: "She would weave it back together, one thorn at a time." Three beats; her desire to maintain continuity against ruin drives every choice (sheathing, patching, listening). Friction between wants (flee to safety, as father intended) and costs (isolation, danger deferred) is palpable. Irreplaceable: removing this motivation collapses the Earned Stasis closure. Cost on-page: forsaking escape, accepting the fissure's threat, binding herself to the vigil.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: opening contrast between crumbled tower and blooming roses. Development: tone modulates between Liora's quiet gestures (kneeling, tasting, listening) and external roar (dust, fleeing crowds, metal groaning). Payoff: "Outside, the world burned. Inside, she tended the quiet" crystallizes the duality. The tone is coherent—stillness under catastrophe—and charges the final image without flattening into single-note serenity or chaos. Minor deduction: a few beats ("the wind howled," "the world burned") lean toward stock intensity rather than the blaze-within-tranquility specificity the prompt implies (−0.4). Present across all three gates and modulates with pressure.</comment>
