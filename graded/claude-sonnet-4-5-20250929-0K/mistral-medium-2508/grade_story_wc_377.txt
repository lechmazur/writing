<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's seasonal muteness and devotion to her work are established early, but her interiority remains largely decorative rather than contradictory. The piece tells us she has "learned" and "spent years," but no micro-choices under pressure reveal competing impulses or hierarchy of values. The final act—gathering remnants and imagining the next sculpture—reads as ritual confirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. No meaningful internal friction or embodied struggle surfaces in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens by the first third and maintains it through the iceberg-shattering climax. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraphs. The closure—ice dissolving into the wind, Liora standing at the bluff edge—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost legible in the final image: the world below remains unchanged, but her stance crystallizes around continued preservation work. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ice shatters and scatters "like seeds," reweighting her labor from solitary act to potential dispersal. However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized—no visible trade-off or forfeited option surfaces on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bluff setting is anchored early with sensory specifics (humming, wind sighs, thinning air) and returns in the final image to charge the closure. The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining Liora's work: its properties (ancient light, trapped shimmer) shape the sculpture's design and the shattering beat. The valley below provides clear spatial and thematic contrast, and the edge of the bluff in the final paragraph grounds the ending stance. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—preserving wonder through kinetic sculpture—is signaled early and maintained. The ice-shattering beat delivers a meaningful tightening: the sculpture spins faster, the ice thins, and the moment of release narrows to a single perfect sound. However, escalation is largely textural rather than driven by protagonist agency or opposition. Liora kneels, sets, exhales, watches—but no decision or renunciation forecloses a live option. The piece accumulates pressure through image and cadence rather than through choices that alter tactics or reveal trade-offs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the iceberg's dissolution and the contrast between the noisy valley and the silent bluff. The final image—"tune the world to hear it"—reweights prior material without stating a moral, and the seed metaphor in the shattering beat charges the closure with earned resonance. Wonder is rendered through concrete particulars (blue-green flash, child's gasp, angel echo) rather than abstraction. The piece resists easy binaries and invites reflection on preservation versus consumption. One mild slip: "The world didn't need more noise. It needed more wonder" skirts thematic statement but is balanced by the surrounding images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Liora notices vibration, shimmer, and the angle where "wonder still had a color." Diction is largely controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("glisten—not with melt, but with something older"). However, several lines drift toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "moral calculus," "Morse code of light," "consensus reality." The final paragraph's "The symphony was already written" borders on thematic ventriloquism. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong in the ice-shattering beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in key beats. However, the piece carries multiple prose artifacts: near-paraphrase loops ("She didn't need to see to know" / "She didn't speak. She didn't need to"), elevated metaphors in adjacent lines ("kinetic sculptures that moved with the wind" / "spiral of brass and tensioned silk"), and template cadence in the valley-contrast passage ("they had stopped asking" / "But Liora tuned"). The final paragraph stacks three scaffold transitions ("She didn't speak. She didn't need to. The symphony was already written.") that dull the closure image. Filter-verb density remains acceptable and no mixed metaphors break clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of seasonal muteness, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragments offers a fresh angle on preservation and wonder. The bluff-vs-valley contrast and the ice-as-trapped-truth conceit feel specific to this narrator and setting. However, the core emotional arc—solitary artist preserving beauty in a degraded world—follows a well-worn template without a sharp inflection. The ending gesture (gathering remnants, imagining the next piece) confirms rather than transforms. Proximity check: "like seeds" and "the world didn't need more noise" echo familiar environmental-art rhetoric. Risk-taking is modest; the piece chooses lyricism over structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora appears early, drives the sculpture-building action, and shapes the ending stance. However, her choices remain largely procedural (kneel, set, exhale, gather) rather than turn-making. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. She observes and enacts a ritual rather than choosing under pressure. Three beats (arrival, sculpture activation, post-shatter gathering) involve her, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment is introduced early, handled in two distinct beats (cradle-setting and shattering), and its properties (ancient light, trapped shimmer) constrain the sculpture's design. The shattering beat is the story's climax. However, the ice does not return with reweighted meaning in the final image—it dissolves into Liora's palm and vanishes. Strong middle development and closure proximity, but no reprise to elevate further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is mentioned once in exposition ("to coax those songs free") and echoed in the final line ("tune the world to hear it"), but it does not shape on-page choices or alter tactics. The concept functions as thematic overlay rather than causal driver. The sculpture-building could proceed identically if framed as "preserving beauty" or "creating wonder." Label-only integration with lyric reprise, but no mid-scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness is stated early ("her voice retreating each winter") and motivates Liora's reliance on "the language of vibration." However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible trade-off. She never faces a moment where speech would help but is unavailable. The trait colors setting and voice but remains ornamental to the plot. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears in four beats: ice against cheek, trapped shimmer, becoming a pulse, and scattering seeds. The word anchors the ice's transformation and charges the shattering climax. However, the action itself (glisten as a visual phenomenon) does not drive reversals—the sculpture's mechanics and Liora's design choices do. The word is a motif rather than a turning action. Strong reprise and closure linkage, but causal pressure is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture is signaled early, its mechanics (gears, silk sails, wired bone, brass spiral) are described in two beats, and it drives the ice-shattering climax. The sculpture's design (angle of impact, tensioned silk, wind-driven arms) shapes the peak beat's outcome. Removing this method would collapse the story's central event. Strong integration across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bluff is anchored early with sensory specifics (humming, wind sighs, thinning air) and provides spatial contrast to the valley below. It appears in the final image, grounding Liora's stance. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Liora could perform the same ritual elsewhere. The bluff charges atmosphere and theme but does not pressure tactics. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance, but no causal leverage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is implied by the valley's noise-versus-silence contrast and Liora's muteness, but no explicit temporal marker grounds the story in a post-verbal era. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Dawn is mentioned once for atmosphere. The piece could occur in any era with minor edits. Vague, ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Preserving wonder is stated explicitly ("The world didn't need more noise. It needed more wonder") and motivates Liora's sculpture work. The desire surfaces in the ice-cradle beat ("the angle where wonder still had a color") and the final stance. However, the motivation is told and confirmed rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible trade-offs. No friction between preservation and another goal surfaces. Functional with closure participation, but no on-page cost tied to the desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is coherent throughout: restrained lyricism, quiet intensity, compression balanced with sensory detail. The piece modulates subtly—calmer in the opening, tighter during the shattering beat, expansive in the final paragraph—without breaking voice. "Muted vigor" fits the controlled energy of Liora's work and the piece's rhythm. The final image ("played the empty air like an instrument") charges the tone with purpose. Strong consistency and modulation under the accumulative lens.</comment>
