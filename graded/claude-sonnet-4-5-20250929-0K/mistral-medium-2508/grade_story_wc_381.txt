<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The summoner remains abstract throughout—her choices (unfolding the wing, shaping silence, lunging) are presented as ritual gestures without embodied stakes or internal contradiction. Interiority relies on stock poetic phrasing ("hollow-eyed stare," "solitude pressing in") rather than character-particular thought. The failure moment ("She had failed") is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. No visible cost forecloses a path; she simply rests, and the prophecy "sleeps" without on-page consequence that alters her options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who she is, where exactly she stands, and what the prophecy concretely threatens remain vague past the first third; apply −0.4 under the Orientation Test. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (layered images, cadence), but the closure unit lacks legible cost: the prophecy shifts from "scream" to "sigh" off-page, and she sleeps without a decision or renunciation that forecloses a live option. The final image (crane at dawn) is a cameo, not a reweighting anchored in prior causality. Because/therefore linkage is absent; events flow as lyric tableaux without a tightening that narrows her choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The brook, reeds, and nocturnal setting are vividly rendered and sensory detail is purposeful (moss, damp earth, scattered stars). The origami wing functions as micro-setting, constraining her ritual and charging the final third when it becomes "lighter" and "quiet." Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling by the brook, palm, satchel). However, the environment does not force a hard choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it serves as atmospheric stage rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("hush a prophecy") is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The snap of the prophecy-thread reads as a micro turn, yet she does not pursue a new tactic—she simply waits, and the wing drifts back "lighter." Agency is passive (receiving the wing's return) rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake; here the arc flattens into lyric stasis without pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (silence as counterweight to fear, the cost of containment) emerges through images rather than statement, and the final line avoids moralizing. The origami wing's shift from "sharp enough to cut silence" to "holding the shape of a silence that could breathe" offers a resonant reprise. However, the ending does not pose a non-literal answer to a dramatized question—no choice crystallizes the thematic tension. The piece gestures toward complexity but lands on "perfect" hush, a resolution without ambiguity or felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and rhythmically controlled ("terrestrially cosmic tension," "tranquil blaze"), yet register occasionally drifts into abstract ornament ("smoothed hush," "lattice of light") that feels imported rather than character-particular. The perceptual signature is poetic but generic—adjectives could apply to any contemplative protagonist. Psychic distance remains consistent, and free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops touch pivotal beats: "The prophecy's weight had lessened, its edges softened" immediately follows "It wasn't gone. But it was no longer a scream. Just a sigh"—three lines restating the same content without added pressure. Template cadence runs in the final third ("For now, she was still. / For now, she was whole. / For now, the hush was hers"). Stock metaphors ("serpent of soundless syllables," "tranquil blaze") accumulate without fresh specificity. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (the snap, the lunge) obscures rather than sharpens causality. Apply −0.9 for loops and template artifacts; these touch the closure section, so disallow 9+ globally and cap high bands at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise (summoner quieting a prophecy through origami ritual) offers surface novelty, but execution relies on fantasy-trope shorthand (summoner, prophecy, magical object) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "code woven into the hush of the night" and "serpent of soundless syllables" read as decorative rather than stakes-driven. The emotional arc (solitary effort → rest) could transfer unchanged to any meditative fantasy frame. No bold risk heightens the material; the piece chooses safety in lyricism over particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and her isolation is stated, but her choices (unfolding the wing, lunging, resting) do not create key turns—events happen to her (the wing drifts back, the prophecy softens). She observes and performs ritual gestures without decisions that narrow options or alter tactics. Functional but replaceable; a generic "seeker" could occupy the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in setup (satchel), middle (unfolds, drinks moonlight, trembles, bleeds silver), and closure (drifts back "lighter," folded into satchel, dawn crane takes flight). It constrains her ritual and its state change (lighter, quiet) signals the prophecy's shift. However, the wing does not force a choice with cost—it acts on her rather than being wielded in a decision that forecloses a path. Three beats and closure reprise meet the two-of-three gate, pushing toward mid-6s, but swappability (any ritual object could return "changed") and passive use limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "smoothed hush" appears in the middle ritual ("shaping the silence into a net of smoothed hush") and closure ("the smoothed hush carried her under," "the hush was hers"). It names the desired state but does not shape tactics on the page—she does not choose between competing methods of hushing or pay a price to achieve it. Present in two beats and closure, but ornamental; the concept could be swapped for "calmed quiet" without structural change. Functional label without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears once as descriptor ("the air hummed with a terrestrially cosmic tension") and echoes in the final third ("stars pulsed in their terrestrially cosmic rhythm"). Label-only; no action is constrained or enabled by this trait. It does not appear in the closure unit or shape a choice. Present but ornamental, well below functional threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Flow" is signaled early ("not a dream, a *flow*, a current of images") and governs the prophecy's nature (slithering code, brook's murmur syncing with her breath). The ritual involves weaving and syncing rhythm, implicitly tied to flow. It appears in setup and middle but does not return explicitly in closure; the crane's flight and brook's carrying are flow-adjacent but not named. Two gates (setup, middle development) met; causal involvement is moderate—the flow metaphor organizes her ritual but could be replaced with "current" or "stream" without breaking logic. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"By mapping silence" is stated in exposition ("To hush it, she had to map the silence") but the mechanics of mapping are never dramatized—she traces water, unfolds the wing, shapes silence into a net, none of which read as cartographic or encoding action. The method is declared, not shown in distinct beats. Present in setup as intention but does not shape attempts or closure. Functional but replaceable with "weaving" or "capturing" with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the brook is anchored early (kneeling by the brook, reeds, moss, stars) and remains stable through closure (she lies on damp earth, brook sings). The brook provides the medium for her ritual (water surface, reflections) and its murmur syncs with her breath, shaping one beat. It appears in closure as ongoing presence. Two gates met (setup, closure); the setting enables the ritual but does not force a choice or supply a contested resource. Solid mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" reads as atmospheric descriptor rather than timeframe. The nocturnal setting provides a single-night window (she works "tonight," dawn comes at the end), but no clock tightens decisions—she could attempt the ritual indefinitely. Time does not pressure her choices or alter tactics. Present as backdrop, not as constraint. Functional but passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To hush a prophecy spoken in code" is the stated motivation, signaled early and recurring (chasing echoes, catching the code, hushing it). She pursues this goal through the ritual, and the closure claims success ("the prophecy slept"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no friction between wanting to hush it and the cost of doing so. The prophecy's threat remains abstract (world unraveling by "unspoken fears"), so the stakes feel ornamental. Setup and closure gates met; causal pressure is moderate but the friction is missing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears explicitly once in the final third ("the night's tranquil blaze") and echoes in the juxtaposition of serene nocturnal setting with charged ritual moments (snap, lunge, searing cold). The tone modulates slightly (tense during the snap, calm at closure) but remains dominantly tranquil-meditative throughout, never fully embodying "blaze" in peak pressure. The oxymoron is asserted more than enacted. Functional mood but does not charge the final image with the promised paradox. Mid-low band.</comment>
