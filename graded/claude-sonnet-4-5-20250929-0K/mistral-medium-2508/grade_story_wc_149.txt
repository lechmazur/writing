<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is sustained (debt-payment across lifetimes), but her interior is largely poetic assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The keeper and Vesper receive minimal interiority; their presence registers more as atmospheric function than individuated agents with stakes. The final dissolution reads as inevitable rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses alternatives. Embodied emotion is scarce—"petals crumbling," "wind through dead branches" are lyric metaphors, not physical sensation or micro-choice under duress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric density and pattern accumulation toward a reconfiguration). Orientation anchors arrive within opening lines (greenhouse, Liora as ghost, bead in soil). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Liora dissolves, Vesper awakens, orchard holds the echo), but cost remains largely asserted ("veil began to unravel") rather than dramatized with a legible emotional or tactical price tied to specific on-page choice. The bead's crumbling and Liora's vanishing happen in passive sequence rather than through her decision under contradictory pressure, weakening the felt cost test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly rendered (frost-weeping glass, blackened vines, nightshade blooms) and anchors every beat. The oldest tree's cavity of glowing veins constrains the awakening action and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the orchard's alchemical properties (poison-thriving soil, tree as Vesper's vessel) enable the climactic resurrection. Micro-setting (bead buried in soil, glass panes sealing) directly shapes tactics and closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint and charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (wake Vesper) is signaled early and sustained. The keeper's vial of black sap and Liora's repeated "excavations" accumulate pressure, but the tightening is textural (density increase) rather than a decision-point that narrows live options. The final awakening arrives as fulfillment of pattern, not a choice with visible tradeoff. Cost is declared ("each appearance cost her," "veil began to unravel") but not dramatized as a moment where Liora weighs and forfeits something on the page, leaving the escalation under the Accumulative lens functional but not sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (love as devouring cycle, debt perpetuating across lifetimes) emerges from the bead's resonance and the orchard's metabolic recursion. The keeper's line "lovingly venomous" and the final "debt was paid. / For now" avoid overt moralizing, and the carved names ("here, here, here") offer a non-literal answer. However, thematic Echo appears in "You're lovingly venomous" (prompt attribute verbalized mid-scene) and the final paragraph edges toward summary ("the debt was paid"), diluting earned resonance with light exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Liora, with brief omniscient tracking of the keeper and Vesper that remains clear at section breaks. Perceptual signature is lyric and gothic ("smoke through a keyhole," "petals crumbling"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("excavation: she clawed her way") that sits uneasily with the embodied ghostly hunger the piece claims. Dialogue is spare and purposeful (keeper's "Again?" and Vesper's "You woke me"); filter verbs ("She knew," "watched") appear but do not stack heavily. The prose maintains atmospheric coherence, though the voice feels more authorial-poetic than character-rooted internal texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and imagery vivid ("glass panes weeping frost," "ribs caged in thorned blossoms"). Paraphrase loop: "She had not come to haunt" immediately followed by "The debt was older than the orchard itself" repeats the motivation statement without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "there, in the curl... there, in the way..." is purposeful parallelism, not a flaw. Overwriting in high-density beats: nearly every line carries figurative language ("wound in the world," "swallowed star," "slash of dawn like a wound healing backward"), which charges atmosphere but occasionally obscures causal sequencing (e.g., bead crumbles → veil unravels → glass seals, all in rapid succession without clear temporal or causal connectors). Cumulative line-level debt totals ~−0.4 from loop and density in closure beat, placing the score mid-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The alchemical-orchard-as-metabolic-debt premise is specific and the lyric-gothic texture is confidently sustained. The ashen-veil ghost, bead-as-anchor, and tree-birthed lover synthesis feels purposeful rather than template. However, the "ghost repaying debt through self-sacrifice to resurrect lover" frame echoes familiar paranormal-romance beats without a sharp conceptual twist; the cycle ("for now") suggests recurrence but does not transform the logic established. The keeper as witness-custodian and the carved names add texture but do not fundamentally alter the arc's predictability in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Liora (ashen-veil ghost bride) is present throughout, her touches bloom nightshade, and her dissolving veil at closure provides the final image. She acts (excavates through the bead, reaches for Vesper), but her choices are iterative fulfillment of prior pattern rather than decision-points with visible tradeoff on the page. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is action without friction. Swappability moderate: the ghost-bride archetype could be revoiced with minor edits. Late-scene dissolution is charged but not causally active in altering Vesper's state—Vesper rises as the tree opens, not because Liora makes a new choice in that beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The carved stone bead is seeded early (dowry, buried under tree, pulsing), handled across beats (Liora's fingers brush it, keeper presses sap into earth near it, "between her fingers burned"), and crumbles at closure, ending its song and Liora's tie to the world. Three gates met (setup, middle resonance attempts, payoff). Causal pressure: the bead's resonance enables Liora's excavations and Vesper's awakening; its destruction coincides with closure. Specificity: carved stone (not generic object) with pulse and song. Cost connection: its crumbling ends the cycle this time. Caps do not apply; score trends high-7s but does not reach indispensable (≥8.5) because its mechanics are asserted ("drank their last breath," "sing Vesper's name") rather than concretely dramatized in a choice-under-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" as core concept: the bead's resonance calls Liora back, Liora's essence unspool into the bead to "sing Vesper's name," and Vesper awakens. Setup early, middle beats involve repeated excavation attempts, and payoff is the tree splitting and Vesper rising. The concept shapes tactics (Liora must excavate through the bead) and alters the ending state. However, the mechanics remain abstract metaphor ("resonance," "sing," "echo") rather than a concrete system with costs the protagonist navigates on the page. Swappability moderate: "magical召唤" or "ritual anchor" could replace resonance with synonym edits. Three gates met; causal role in climax; score mid-5s for functional shaping without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" appears once in the keeper's dialogue mid-scene ("You're lovingly venomous, you know that? This place thrives on poison, and still you drain it dry"). It characterizes Liora's effect (the orchard thrives on poison, her touch blooms nightshade, yet she exhausts it) but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Label-only: the trait is named, not dramatized in a choice where venomous-love creates a tradeoff. Setup gate met (mentioned by midpoint), middle development absent (no choice shaped by this duality), payoff absent (does not return or charge closure). Score low-3s for ornamental thematic echo without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Ghost" as action/state: Liora exists as ashen-veil ghost throughout, her cameo appearances ("flicker of presence," "smoke through a keyhole") define the narrative mode, and her dissolving at closure is the final consequence. Setup immediate, middle beats involve repeated ghosting ("Each appearance cost her"), and payoff is her unraveling into Vesper's hands. The ghost condition enables her posthumous return and structures the stakes (how long can she sustain manifestation?). However, swappability moderate: spectral revenant or spirit-anchor could substitute with minor edits. Causal pressure: her ghostliness constrains her ability to act (ephemeral, costly appearances) and drives the bead-dependence. Score high-6s for essentiality across beats but not fully indispensable (a similar undead state could carry the arc).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" as method: Liora appears in fragments ("there, in the curl of a dead leaf's shadow; there, in the way the moonlight split"), the keeper remarks "Again?", and the text names it "ghosting, this flicker of presence." Setup by first third, middle beats describe cost ("Each appearance cost her"), but the method does not materially constrain tactics—Liora excavates and reaches regardless of cameo mechanics. Payoff: her final appearance is sustained enough to reach for Vesper and dissolve, which contradicts "cameo" fragmentation without on-page explanation. Swappability high: "intermittent manifestation" would serve identically. Score mid-4s for present but minimally causal, with internal contradiction at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is present throughout: frost-weeping glass, blackened vines, nightshade, tree with glowing-vein cavity, and "endless night" above. Setup immediate, middle beats show Liora's touches leave nightshade and the keeper tends the soil, and payoff includes the tree splitting and glass panes sealing. The setting pressures choices (bead buried in soil, tree as vessel for Vesper, orchard's poison-thriving metabolism that Liora drains), supplies resources (black sap, loam), and charges the final image (glass seals, orchard hums louder, nightshade blooms). Irreplaceability high: the alchemical properties and greenhouse enclosure are integral to resurrection mechanics. Score high-7s for essential presence and causal constraint across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" as timeframe: winter appears in opening ("seventy-three winters") and closing ("fields lay winter-cracked"), and the hush motif recurs ("in the hush of winter-cracked fields" when the promise was made, "the hush of the greenhouse" at closure). Setup present, middle absent (no temporal pressure or clock that alters tactics), payoff is lyric reprise without tightening consequence. Time does not constrain decisions—Liora has returned many times, "for now" suggests indefinite future recurrence, and no urgency is dramatized. Swappability high: any mournful season could substitute. Score low-4s for present atmospheric frame without causal function; lyric reprise adds modest resonance but does not reach 5.0 without middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to repay a debt across lifetimes" is stated early ("The debt was older than the orchard itself: a promise made... 'Wake me when the world forgets its name'"), drives all of Liora's excavation attempts, and resolves at closure ("the debt was paid. / For now"). Setup immediate, middle beats show repeated effort ("She had spent lifetimes learning the shape of this debt"), and payoff is Vesper's awakening. The desire is clear and sustained, but friction between want and cost is told more than shown—Liora's veil unravels, yet the moment lacks on-page hesitation or competing impulse that would dramatize internal conflict. Swappability moderate: "sacred vow" or "binding promise" could replace debt. Score mid-6s for clear causal role across beats without embodied friction in a peak choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tone "mournful elation": mournful threads (Liora dead seventy-three winters, "petals crumbling," keeper's wet eyes, endless night) and elation threads (awakening, "something sweeter, something like the first breath after drowning," orchard breathing louder, dawn slash) coexist and charge the ending image. Setup present (opening wound/frost imagery vs. humming greenhouse), modulates through middle (cost vs. progress), and payoff balances dissolution with fulfillment. Coherence maintained; the oxymoron is purposeful. However, elation is more asserted than felt—Vesper's skeletal-sapling form and Liora's erasure carry more weight than joy, tilting the final effect toward mournful with elation as conceptual claim. Score mid-5s for coherent duality that charges closure but does not fully dramatize both poles in embodied beats.</comment>
