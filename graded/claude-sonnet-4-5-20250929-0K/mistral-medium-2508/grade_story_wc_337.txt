<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is richly textured with embodied detail (calloused fingers, the needle's worn eye, threads wound like bracelets) and his core choice—letting the knot unravel rather than fixing it—reverses his restorer identity with visible cost. The piece sustains contradictory impulses (the urge to mend vs. the need to release) acting simultaneously in the sanctuary scene. Minor slips: the woman's voice functions more as thematic echo than pressure-applying character, and the final smile labeled "broken thing, but it fit" edges toward self-commentary rather than pure embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elias's deliberate unraveling of the final knot is a Decisive Change that releases the drowned with visible cost (the prisms shatter, the net dissolves, his role shifts from restorer to "door"). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens—pressure builds through layered images of frayed nets, silk patience, accumulated silence—and the final cadence shift (laughter replacing gasps, doors unlatched, spirits freed) reweights the dominant stake with undeniable cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the needle hovers, the knot swells, and Elias chooses release over repair. Orientation is clear early (prism sanctuary, Elias kneeling, net in hand, oil lamp glow) and the lens holds through closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary concretely shapes the closure: fractured walls cast splintered rainbows, prisms tremble and shatter under the pressure of what is freed, starlight pools like blood where the net had been. Micro-setting elements (the oil lamp's bent flame, the altar, the tapestry needle left gleaming) charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—kelp stench, salt-fogged mirrors, the net's seawater knots—and filtered through Elias's craft-focused perception. The sanctuary's air thickens with "interlaced hush," a textural constant that reweights at closure when secrets are no longer held.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to mend the net and maintain the town's illusion or unravel it and free the restless spirits—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias lets the needle drop. His agency (deliberate unraveling) forecloses the path of restoration with visible cost: the sanctuary shatters, the drowned rise, his identity shifts from restorer to conduit. The tightening is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible on the page (prisms breaking, spirits laughing, doors unlatched). One micro turn (the needle hovering) sets up the decisive release.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the net's dual nature (lie vs. truth, repair vs. release) and the tension between enforced silence and necessary confession. The final image—Elias as a door, spirits freed, the "interlaced hush" replaced by laughter and open doors—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: whether wholeness requires stitching wounds shut or allowing them to breathe. Subtext operates in gesture (the needle dropped, threads wound as bracelets), silence (accumulated then released), and the woman's voice ("You didn't fix it" / "You let it be"). The piece resists moralizing; the ending is ambiguous (blessing or haunting?) without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (close third on Elias), and the perceptual signature is selective and craft-specific: he notices knots, silk patience, the needle's worn eye, frayed edges. Voice modulates purposefully—compressed, lyric sentences during the unraveling ("The knot unraveled itself"), longer, image-dense lines during setup. The woman's dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("You won't hold them"). Minor slips: "interlaced hush" and "singing pressure" edge toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon, and the phrase "accumulated silence, drawing it from the air like mist" risks abstraction in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (most lines advance atmosphere, character, or stakes). Figurative language is vivid but occasionally dense without respite: "flame bending like a held breath," "spun from spider's patience," "interlaced hush of a thousand confessions," "singing pressure" cluster in peak beats and risk obscuring immediacy. Template cadence appears in the final third: "They would call it... / They would walk... / their laughter tangled... / their silence no longer..." (four parallel constructions in close succession). Clarity holds, but the overwriting in high-pressure moments and the cadence run lower the score by −0.6 to −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—a broken mask restorer who frees spirits by unraveling rather than mending—transforms the "restorer learns to let go" template through specific, grounded choices: the exhumed fisherman's net, the tapestry needle passed down like a curse, the prism sanctuary's fractured light. The choice to unravel rather than repair feels earned in hindsight and offers a non-obvious moral calculus. The synthesis of gothic atmosphere, tactile craft detail, and the reversal of restoration as liberation is memorable. Minor derivative notes: restless spirits and the wise refusal to fix what shouldn't be fixed echo familiar gothic and literary beats, but the net's knots and the "door" metaphor particularize the trope sufficiently.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, frames the opening (kneeling, tracing the net), makes the key choice (letting the needle drop, unraveling the knot), and embodies the closure (winding threads on wrists, stepping into starlight, becoming a door). His decision alters tactics and redefines his role from restorer to conduit. The character shapes two major beats (the hovering needle, the final walk toward the water) and the ending would collapse without his agency. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability are all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears early (grandmother's, eye worn smooth, threaded with silk), is used in one beat (hovering over the final knot), and returns in the closure (left on the altar, eye gleaming like a promise). It signals Elias's craft and the inherited burden ("passed down like a curse"), but its mechanics do not meaningfully constrain the middle action—the unraveling happens when he drops it rather than through its use. Two touches (threading, altar deposit) and closure participation earn mid-band, but swappability (another tool could serve the same function) and limited causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" appears once as a phrase in the final third ("the interlaced hush of a thousand confessions finally spoken") and is thematically echoed in Elias's act of accumulating silence and then releasing it. The concept shapes the stake (silence vs. release) but does not materially alter tactics on the page—Elias's choice to unravel is driven by the net and spirits, not by the hush itself. Present and thematically coherent, but functionally replaceable and introduced late.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elias "accumulates silence" explicitly ("drawing it from the air like mist") and weaves it into the net's gaps; this trait enables the central action (stitching silence into the net to hold the drowned) and constrains the final choice (unraveling releases both net and silence). The attribute shapes two beats (the weaving work, the decision to stop) and is causally active at closure when the silence is no longer held. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage are present, though the trait is somewhat abstract and could be reframed without breaking the story.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Exhumation frames the inciting premise (Elias "had exhumed it not with a spade but with the slow, deliberate unraveling of each loop") and the act of unraveling—both past and present—drives the central turn when he unravels the final knot. The action is signaled early, returns with reweighted meaning at closure (the net dissolves, the drowned rise), and is irreplaceable: without exhumation and unraveling, the spirits remain buried and the story collapses. Two beats (past exhumation, present unraveling) and strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method—unraveling knots in a fisherman's net—is signaled early (Elias traces frayed edges, the net is "a tangle of twine and regret"), shapes the central action (threading silk, hovering over the final knot, letting it unravel), and determines the closure mechanism (the net dissolves into threads, spirits are freed). The mechanics matter: the final knot holds the fisherman's name, and its unraveling triggers the release. Three beats (setup, hovering, dissolution) and high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is present throughout: fractured walls cast rainbows, prisms catch and scatter light into whispers, they tremble and shatter at closure under the pressure of what is freed. The setting charges the final image (light bleeding into cracks, prisms shattering) and supplies atmosphere (starlight, oil lamp, stone floor). Two beats (trembling, shattering) and closure participation, but the setting does not materially constrain Elias's choice—he could unravel the net elsewhere. Strong closure linkage and specificity, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" is thematically present (the sanctuary's prisms scatter "secrets shared across time," the "interlaced hush of a thousand confessions") but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. The piece unfolds in a single continuous night without a clock or deadline that alters tactics. The secret-sharing is atmospheric and closure-adjacent (the drowned's confessions are finally spoken) but does not pressure the unraveling choice. Present and coherent, but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—to ground restless spirits—is explicit ("the spirits had been slipping through the cracks... their unrest a current beneath the town's skin") and drives the opening action (mending the net to hold them). The motivation is tested and reversed at the peak choice: he realizes the net is a lie and chooses to free the spirits rather than force them to stay buried. Two beats (mending attempt, release decision) and strong closure linkage. The friction between his restorer role and the spirits' need for freedom is palpable and costly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone—lucid unrest—is coherent and purposeful throughout: clear, craft-focused perception paired with Gothic atmosphere (drowned spirits, kelp stench, trembling prisms) and restless energy (the flame bends "like a held breath," the air thickens, the spirits slip through cracks). Tone modulates with pressure: calm, methodical work gives way to the howling gust, laughter, and shattering prisms at closure. The final image (Elias as door, spirits waiting, tide turning) charges the tone with both relief and ambiguity, consistent with "lucid unrest."</comment>
