<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is competent and clear in motive—rescuing truth—but the characterization relies heavily on telling ("emotionally rational as ever, though his pulse betrayed him") rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. His interactions with Callahan feel stagey; the priest arrives as a foil rather than applying genuine pressure through their relationship. The final choice to slip into shadows reads more as escape than costly renunciation, leaving the change underearned. Minor positives: his micro-choices (photographing the page, laying out documents) do advance pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Elias at a disused station with the Codex. The piece follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore links: he finds the ledger, photographs it, Callahan arrives, Elias counters with modern parallels, then exits. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he leaves with the photograph, "honest" at last—but the cost is more asserted ("finally, honest") than shown; no foreclosed path is dramatized on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Callahan calls the police, raising stakes briefly. The ending's resonance depends on metaphor rather than visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The disused railway station is vividly rendered: ivy strangling iron, peeling DANGER signs, cracked platform. The rosebush bookends the piece purposefully, its bare branches mirroring the stripped lie. Spatial choreography stays coherent throughout the confrontation. The setting constrains choice modestly—Elias uses the shadows to vanish—pushing this toward the 9+ gate, though the constraint feels more atmospheric than tactical. Sensory detail is strong and POV-filtered without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: expose the ledger's truth before the Church buries it again. Pressure tightens when Callahan arrives and calls the police, forcing Elias to act. However, the escalation is external (someone else's radio call) rather than driven by Elias's agency; he counters with documents but doesn't risk or sacrifice on the page. The resolution—slipping into shadows with a photo—avoids rather than confronts cost. One reversal (the archivist's warning) initiates the scene, but the climax lacks a trade-off that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of noble lies versus corrosive truth emerges through the Codex ledger and Callahan's defense of protective deception. The rosebush and illuminated **B** recur with shifted weight, and the final image—tracks leading "nowhere and everywhere"—offers non-literal closure. Elias's quiet certainty and the "finally, honest" station create resonance without moralizing. Minor slip: "parallels" is stated rather than fully dramatized in the middle beats, and the thematic question occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("gilded frauds," "tapestry") rather than grounded in character cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a literary register ("thick as the mildew," "ghost engineer") that fits the archival setting and Elias's scholarly lens. Dialogue between Elias and Callahan pursues goals and carries subtext, though Callahan's lines veer toward thesis ("burn the tapestry to find a single loose thread?"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices gilt, vellum, and decay—but under peak pressure (Callahan's arrival) the prose stays elevated rather than compressing. Minor filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("adjusted," "traced," "exhaled") slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, but overwriting clusters in high-pressure beats: "ivy strangled the iron bones," "thick as the mildew climbing," "light as a promise, heavy as a key." Mixed metaphor: the **B** "catching light like a held breath" confuses vehicle and tenor. Template cadence in the opening (three "he [verb]" constructions) and paraphrase loop ("The lie had been noble" echoes "noble lies" without added detail). Information density is high in the document-reveal beat, but figurative density in the final third slows momentum. No major causality breaks, so penalties stay in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Premise—academic exposes Church ledger at atmospheric ruin—is familiar (Dan Brown territory), but the rosebush-as-surrender motif and modern parallels add modest freshness. The illuminated **B** as both craft and lie is a strong particular. However, the confrontation follows a predictable arc (hero arrives, villain follows, hero escapes with evidence), and the ending's vagueness ("leading nowhere and everywhere") retreats from bold specificity. The piece commits to its gothic-scholarly register without deep risk or surprising moral calculus. Transformation test: swap Codex for artifact X and railway for ruin Y, and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias drives every major beat: he opens the crate, photographs the ledger, counters Callahan with documents, and chooses to exit into shadow. His scholarly lens filters all perception. His decision to leave rather than wait for police alters tactics and forecloses the option of public confrontation. Present in setup, middle choice (photographing), and closure (departure). Strong causal role, though the final choice reads more as exit than transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The illuminated **B** appears in three beats: crate opening (touched, described), Elias's reflection on its lie, and the flash photograph that turns it into "a sun." It anchors the lie visually and recurs with shifted weight in the photo Elias pockets. However, its role is largely symbolic; removing it would not break plot logic—any ledger entry could serve. The object shapes theme more than tactics. Gates: setup ✓, development (reflection), payoff (photo in pocket). Lyric reprise lifts it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Noble lies" is the story's spine: the Codex is a ledger disguised as hymnal, Callahan defends protective deception, and Elias's documents expose the unbroken pattern. The concept shapes every choice—Elias's motive to "rescue truth," Callahan's argument that exposure "would unravel faith," and the stakes of the confrontation. It appears in setup (Codex revelation), drives the middle debate, and charges the ending ("finally, honest"). High integration; the story would collapse without this exact framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Emotionally rational" is told once ("emotionally rational as ever, though his pulse betrayed him") but not dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Elias remains calm and methodical throughout; no on-page moment shows rational calculation colliding with visceral emotion to constrain a choice. The label appears mid-story without prior or subsequent embodiment. Missing setup as trait and missing payoff in closure. Present as description, not as driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Recapture" (used as "the recapture of what had been stolen—not the book itself, but the truth") frames Elias's decade-long quest and explains his presence at the station. However, the on-page action is *acquiring the photo* and *presenting modern parallels*, not recapture per se—the Codex was already misplaced by the archivist, not seized by Elias. The action could be reframed as "expose" or "preserve" with minor edits. Present in setup (motive), absent from the climax choice. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Drawing parallels" is signaled early ("He needed to draw parallels") and executed on the page: Elias lays out land deeds and bank transfers, connecting the 12th-century ledger to modern holdings. This method becomes the story's tactical climax—Callahan's face goes slack at the pattern—and shapes the thematic closure ("the unbroken line from then to now"). Present in setup (stated intent), middle (document reveal), and payoff (Callahan's reaction). The mechanics matter and alter the confrontation's outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The disused railway station is vivid and present throughout: ivy, rusted rail, peeling signs, shadows. It provides the isolation necessary for the confrontation and supplies the escape route (Elias vanishes into shadows, follows the tracks). The rosebush on the platform charges the opening and closing images. However, the setting's tactical contribution is modest—any ruin would serve. Gates: setup ✓, development (Callahan's entrance framed by station details), payoff (Elias exits along tracks). Strong atmospheric work; micro-setting (shadows) enables the final move, lifting it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops" anchors the opening image and closing reprise ("The rosebush had shed its last petal"). The petal's fall marks a symbolic threshold—surrender, ending—but does not create a ticking clock or tighten decisions on the page. Time remains vague; the confrontation's duration is untracked. The element functions as lyric bookend rather than pressure device. Gates: setup (opening image) and payoff (closing line) present; middle development absent. Lyric reprise reweights the stake modestly, placing it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To rescue truth from a pit of lies" is Elias's stated and lived motive. It drives his decade-long chase, his choice to photograph the ledger under time pressure, and his decision to confront Callahan with modern parallels rather than flee. The motive is tested when Callahan argues the cost of exposure ("unravel faith for thousands"), forcing Elias to choose truth over comfort. Present in setup (stated), middle (photo choice), and payoff (exit with evidence). Friction between want (truth) and social cost is dramatized. Strong integration.</comment>
