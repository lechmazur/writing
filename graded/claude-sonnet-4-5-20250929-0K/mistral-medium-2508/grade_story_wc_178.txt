<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Qishti's motivation is clear and his actions follow a consistent pattern of scholarly devotion, but his internal experience remains largely analytical without embodied contradiction. The final kneeling "not in worship, but in recognition" gestures toward complexity but arrives through declaration rather than dramatized tension between competing impulses. Micro-choices (hesitation at the threshold, pressing the tile) are present but lack visible cost that forecloses options. The character reads as a vehicle for the premise rather than a figure wrestling with genuine stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern and density build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final observatory moment where Qishti's understanding crystallizes. Orientation anchors (astronomer, palace, dusk) arrive early. The closure image—lines on his skin, stars burning brighter—reweights the premise with conceptual cost (the shift from measurement to felt dialogue). One slight weakness: the underground sequence feels like scaffolding toward the insight rather than a choice-driven tightening, and the cost remains oblique rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The palace setting is vivid and purposeful: cracked mosaics, chiseled sigils, and the descent constrain Qishti's movements and charge the atmosphere. The tile itself functions as micro-setting, recurring with evolving meaning (warm, pulsing, rewritten onto skin) that directly shapes the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("thick with the scent of damp and something older"). The underground sanctum supplies the altar and schematics that enable the final reconfiguration, making setting essential to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the tile to understand its message—is signaled early and tightens through the three-night mapping and the threshold hesitation. The descent and altar placement provide one meaningful deepening that changes knowledge under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present (pressing the tile, kneeling in recognition) but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral: no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the "devotion too vast for numbers" remains abstract. The piece coheres but lacks a sharp trade-off or visible price that would elevate pressure into the high band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tile's schematic cipher and the altar's "What is measured is never lost," culminating in the realization that stars speak in a "language he'd mistaken for silence." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: Qishti's devotion shifts from empirical measurement to felt conversation. The tracery on his hands concretizes the transformation. One small slip: "empirically ironic" and "devotions too vast for numbers" edge toward thematic declaration, but the closure image rescues specificity and charges prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct: elevated, lyric diction ("frugal rhythm," "schematic of intersecting angles") matches the astronomer's scholarly perceptual signature. POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Distance modulates purposefully (close during the tile examination, wider during the descent). Internal thought is consistently voice-motivated. One minor deduction: phrases like "empirically ironic thrill" and "dialogue at last begun" drift slightly into authorial commentary rather than staying fully inside Qishti's perceptual lexicon under pressure, but the effect is minor and does not obscure focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts appear. "The tile was a key, he realized, and the lock was the palace itself" is serviceable exposition that summarizes rather than dramatizes discovery. "Not from reverence, but from habit" and "not in worship, but in recognition" use parallel negation structures that feel templated. The final paragraph edges toward paraphrase loop: "burned just a little brighter" and "no longer distant, but intimate" restate the same shift. Figurative language ("like a fruit revealing its seed") is clear but not essential. These issues do not obscure closure but prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of astronomer-scholar, Babylonian palace ruin, and cipher-as-devotion is specific and non-obvious. The tile-as-schematic and the altar's inscription transform familiar treasure-hunt tropes into a conceptual quest. However, the core arc—solitary scholar discovers hidden knowledge that reframes his life's work—follows a well-trodden template. The "conversation at last begun" ending feels earned but not particularly fresh; the emotional revelation reads as a genre convention executed competently rather than transformed. Risk-taking is present in the lyric register but does not fully compensate for the familiar emotional terrain.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Qishti's frugality appears early ("counting grains of sand," "threadbare robe") and shapes his cautious approach (slipping past guards, returning at dusk). His decisions—three nights of tracing, pressing the tile, stepping into the passage—create key turns and the closure kneeling. The trait is integrated across beats and closure, but the choices themselves feel inevitable rather than costly; no moment shows frugality foreclosing an option or creating friction. The astronomer's role drives plot but his specific frugality does not constrain tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tile appears in setup (discovery), development (three nights of mapping, threshold press that opens the passage), and closure (placed on altar, rewritten onto skin). It is handled physically across multiple beats, evolves in function (puzzle → key → covenant seal), and charges the final image where its tracery remains on Qishti's hands. Removing the tile would break the story's causal spine. One cap: the tile's mechanics (how pressing it opens the pillar) are asserted rather than earned through prior schematic logic, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion shapes the tile's cipher ("a love letter written in the language of the unseen") and the altar's covenant, motivating Qishti's three-night decoding and final recognition. The concept appears in setup (tile as puzzle), development (mapping as devotion), and closure (covenant sealed, dialogue begun). It alters Qishti's understanding and reconfigures his relationship to the stars, but the devotion is more contemplated than enacted under pressure; cost is conceptual rather than visceral. The concept drives theme strongly but could be swapped for "hidden communion" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" appears once as a descriptor ("the empirically ironic thrill of a man who had spent his life decoding the heavens only to find the earth hiding secrets") but does not constrain or enable on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or choices. Qishti's empirical habits (counting, mapping) are present, but the irony remains a thematic claim rather than a dramatic engine. No beat hinges on this attribute; it functions as flavor rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears explicitly in the mapping sequence ("until the pattern uncloaked itself: a cipher") and implicitly when the schematics "flare to life" at the altar, rewriting themselves into a new pattern. The action is signaled in development and participates in closure as the tile's meaning is fully revealed. It shapes the middle turn (understanding the cipher) and the ending realization. However, "decode" or "reveal" could substitute with minimal structural impact; the specific verb is metaphorically apt but not mechanically indispensable to the plot's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Schematic representations appear early (the tile's "intersecting angles," "diagrams of a cosmos"), recur in the underground passage ("equations of light and shadow"), and culminate at the altar where schematics "rewrite themselves" and are traced onto Qishti's skin. The method shapes his three-night mapping process and the closure image. Removing schematics would require a different cipher mechanism. The method is present across beats and ending, but the mechanics (how schematics encode devotion) remain asserted rather than demonstrated, capping irreplaceability slightly below the high band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient Babylonian palace is established early (cracked mosaics, throne room, chiseled sigils) and reimagined through the hidden passage and underground sanctum. The setting supplies the central pillar that opens, the altar, and the observatory endpoint. It constrains Qishti's movements (avoiding guards, slipping past torches) and provides the resources (tile, altar) that enable closure. The reimagined element (combining ruin with active secret) is specific to the plot. One slight deduction: the palace functions more as backdrop and puzzle-box than as a force that pressures choices with conflicting costs.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is signaled early ("new overseers," "usurpers' hammers," "regime had deemed unworthy of looting") and provides context for Qishti's cautious movements and the palace's abandoned state. The timeframe enables the plot (forgotten spaces accessible, guards distracted) but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. No on-page clock pressures Qishti's three nights of study or his final return to the observatory. The setting is purposeful but the temporal window functions as static context rather than escalating constraint, placing it in the mid-band for timeframe integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to seal a covenant with the unknown is dramatized through Qishti's threshold hesitation ("a covenant offered to the unknown"), his kneeling at the altar, and the closure where the covenant is "sealed not with blood but with the weight of his attention." It appears in setup (tile discovery), development (descent as faith act), and closure (recognition, conversation begun). The desire drives the arc and faces friction (scientist versus faith). However, the covenant itself remains abstract; what Qishti gains or sacrifices on the page is unclear, capping felt cost and keeping the motivation in the upper-mid band rather than high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dusky harmony is established early ("dusk," "braziers' flickering light," "first light of dawn") and modulates through the descent ("dark, the air thick") to the final observatory moment where stars "burned just a little brighter" and the conversation is "intimate." Tone remains coherent—contemplative, reverent, lyric—and charges the final image without becoming static. The harmony (measured prose, no sharp discord) fits the astronomer's evolving understanding. One minor note: the tone is perhaps too smooth; a moment of sharper dissonance during the threshold hesitation might have deepened pressure, but the existing modulation is purposeful and supports closure.</comment>
