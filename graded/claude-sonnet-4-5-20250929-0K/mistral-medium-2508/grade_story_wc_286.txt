<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The potter's phototropism to kindness is asserted but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. His decision to embed the glass and leave the bowl shows intention but lacks visible internal conflict or cost that would earn the gesture. Interiority leans toward poetic abstraction ("his mind unspooled the fractured timelines") rather than embodied, character-specific thought under pressure. The final understanding arrives as gentle realization rather than through struggle that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (potter, oasis, present moment signaled by chimney smoke). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (bee, glass, bowl, kiln) that converge at the closure moment when the potter leaves the glowing bowl in the ruins. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—"resistance wasn't refusal / It was remembrance"—with conceptual cost (he walks away, the bowl stays). One tightening is present (the glass embedded, the bowl fired, the bowl left behind), sufficient for this length, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The oasis setting is vivid and purposeful: cracked earth, bleached combs, sun patterns, and the kiln all anchor the potter's work and the story's spatial logic. The lantern glass as micro-setting object constrains the potter's choice (he embeds it in the bowl) and charges the final image (the bowl glows faintly). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the potter's attentive stance. The environment subtly mirrors the thematic question of persistence and fracture without becoming overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled early and drives the potter's return and ritual. Pressure accumulates through textural density (the thrum, the bee, the glass warming) rather than causal reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the potter embeds the glass and fires the bowl, then leaves it in the oasis, a gesture that reweights his relationship to the place. The cost is conceptual (departure, the bowl left as offering) rather than viscerally felt, which limits the score's ceiling.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the potter's repeated visits, the fractured timelines as lived texture, the glass thrumming with memory. The final image—"resistance wasn't refusal / It was remembrance"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (the bee landing, the glass warming) and implication (the bowl left behind). The piece avoids thematic declaration until the penultimate beat, and even then the insight is earned by the potter's embodied work rather than abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature (the potter notices thrum, light bending, honey scent). Diction is elevated and lyric, occasionally drifting into poetic abstraction ("his mind unspooled the fractured timelines like thread") that feels slightly external to a working potter's idiom. No dialogue is present. The prose has distinct texture and rhythm, though some figurative language in high-density passages (glaze "shimmering like the last breath of a dying star") tilts toward ornament. The perceptual filter remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("hives split open like old wounds," "time had split like wet clay"), but some metaphors feel slightly overwrought or stacked without clear payoff ("glaze shimmering like the last breath of a dying star"). A few phrases loop conceptually: "thrum" recurs four times with similar phrasing, and the "fractures/fractured" motif is touched repeatedly without advancing pressure each time. Information density is high, and no major scaffold or clarity breaks appear, but the ornamental texture in non-peak beats slightly dulls momentum. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and no grammatical errors are evident.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—a potter who reads fractured timelines through a ruined oasis—offers a fresh synthesis of craft, memory, and temporal rupture. The phototropism-to-kindness trait and the thrum as sensory signature feel specific and avoid stock fantasy tropes. The final turn (leaving the bowl as an offering rather than taking it to the village) subverts expectation and is earned by prior particulars. Some elements (the bee, the lantern glass) echo broader eco-apocalyptic motifs without full transformation, and the "resistance wasn't refusal" insight, while resonant, borders on aphoristic neatness. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative texture, quiet ending) heightens meaning without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The potter is present throughout and his choices (embedding the glass, firing the bowl, leaving it behind) drive the arc. His zen-minded stance is asserted ("phototropic to kindness," "sharp gentleness") but not dramatized through difficult on-page conflict. He observes and acts with intention, but the decisions feel preordained rather than emerging from contradictory impulses. His final understanding ("resistance wasn't refusal") arrives gently rather than through a choice that narrows options with visible cost. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but more contemplative than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lantern glass appears early (first third), is handled twice (traced, embedded in the bowl), and charges the final image (the bowl glows faintly). Its thrum recurs with reweighted meaning across beats. The glass enables the potter's ritual and its embedding is the story's key physical action. Removing it would weaken the closure image significantly. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff, with causal pressure (the glass "drank in") and closure linkage (the glow).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are described thematically ("his mind unspooled the fractured timelines," "the overlap," "a timeline he couldn't see") but do not constrain or enable a concrete choice on the page. The concept enriches atmosphere and explains the oasis's strangeness, but it remains ornamental to the potter's actual decisions (embedding glass, firing, leaving the bowl). No visible cost or tactical shift arises from the timelines themselves. Present in setup and referenced at closure, but swappable with "lingering magic" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Phototropism to kindness is stated once ("The potter was phototropic to kindness") and implied by his repeated returns, but it does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The trait colors his motivation but does not create a trade-off or force a difficult choice. No moment where his attraction to kindness conflicts with another impulse or alters his tactics. Label-only use without on-page friction. Present in setup but missing from middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The thrum appears four times: lantern glass vibrates in his palm, again when the bee lands, when the glass warms, and one last pulse as he shapes the bowl. It signals the oasis's aliveness and guides the potter's attention, but the action itself is descriptive rather than causal—removing "thrum" and replacing with "warmth" or "glow" would require only minor edits. The thrum enriches texture and charges atmosphere, but it does not redefine the potter's options. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but its swappability limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sun patterns are mentioned once in setup ("He followed the sun patterns etched into the earth") and referenced obliquely in the bees building "where the sun lingered a second longer." The method is signaled but not enacted on the page—we do not see the potter actively reading or interpreting the patterns to guide a choice. The mechanics do not shape his attempts or alter tactics. Present in setup, functional but replaceable, missing from middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oasis is vividly rendered (cracked earth, bleached hives, kiln, sun patterns) and directly pressures the potter's work: the heat, the wax combs as backstory, the spatial logic of hives and kiln. The setting supplies the materials (clay, glass, kiln) that enable the ritual and its physical constraints (scorched earth, relentless sun). The oasis is indispensable—removing it collapses the story's logic and stakes. Strong integration across all three gates with high causal pressure and closure linkage (the bowl left "among the ruins").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "as chimney smoke flattens" is mentioned once in setup ("when the chimney plumes...flattened against the horizon, a signal that time was thinning again") and obliquely at closure ("By evening, the smoke from the kiln would join the flattening plumes"). It marks a ritual occasion but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—the potter's actions unfold at his own pace without urgency. The clock is vague and untracked. Present in setup and closure, but does not constrain middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated ("to understand why some places resist change") and drives the potter's return and observation. It shapes his ritual (embedding the glass, leaving the bowl) and culminates in the insight "resistance wasn't refusal / It was remembrance." The desire is present but not dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction between wants and costs—the potter's path feels contemplative rather than pressured. Present in all three gates, but the lack of on-page friction and cost limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sharp gentleness coheres throughout: precise detail ("cracked earth," "wax combs bleached white") paired with tender gestures (the bee on his finger, the whispered question, the bowl left as offering). The tone modulates subtly with pressure—gentleness during observation, sharpness in the kiln's heat and the "scorch line"—and charges the final image ("sharp gentleness of the dying light"). The tone is consistent, purposeful, and integrated into diction and rhythm, elevating the closure effect.</comment>
