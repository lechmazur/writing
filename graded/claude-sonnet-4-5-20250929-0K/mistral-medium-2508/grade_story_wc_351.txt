<comment>Lena's interiority is vivid and specific ("helix of equations," "cartographer of the entangled dark"), but her motivation to "unfold" memories feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle. The backstory blocks (Mars prototypes, lover, child) exceed the reflection budget and flatten present pressure; they anchor via the mirror but don't shift present stance through micro-choices. The final walk reads as acceptance, but no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene—she moves from observation to embrace without visible cost or foreclosed path. Internal conflict is told retrospectively rather than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered reflections, ending on "cartographer of the entangled dark." Orientation anchors Lena, canyon, moonlight by the second paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she accepts the entanglements), but cost is conceptual and implied rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The piece teaches its pattern (mirror adjustments → layered visions), but the final walk doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it reads as thematic statement. One meaningful deepening (visions surface) is present, but the Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what she loses or pays.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The canyon as "threshold" and "wound" is vivid and purposeful; the rusted tripod and fractured mirror anchor micro-setting. The mirror constrains choice (she adjusts its angle three times, feeding current through nanites), and the moonlight charges the final image ("pulsating, liquid white"). Sensory detail is selective (ozone, rust, cold air fogging), filtered through Lena's engineer's eye. The mirror's broken edges "warm against her skin" at closure, a tactile detail that supports the ending. Spatial choreography is clear (crouched, knees hit ground, picks up mirror, walks).</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Lena seeks to prove memories are entangled, not lost. The mirror adjustments create one meaningful tightening (reflections deepen from stranger to constellation to probe's call), but escalation is textural rather than causal—visions accumulate without narrowing her options or forcing a trade-off. Agency is observation and adjustment, not decision under pressure. The ending forecloses no live path; she walks as "cartographer," an identity she desired from the start. Cost is conceptual (accepting the void inside) but not legible as a visible price paid—no stamina loss, no tool failure, no tactical shift.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Theme (memory as entanglement, the void within) emerges from the mirror work and nanite modifications, not direct statement. The fractured mirror as metaphor for warped memory is purposeful; its reprise at closure (edges now warm) reweights her relationship to the past. Subtext operates in image and gesture (silent prayer, lips moving, child drawing constellations). The final line offers a resonant answer—she becomes cartographer—but it restates her declared goal rather than reweighting it with non-obvious cost. Epiphany ("the void had been inside her all along") reads as thematic echo, too tidy for the ambiguity the piece otherwise sustains.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (engineer's precision: "helix of equations," "chaotically precise"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("fractured ribs," "quantum foam," "sediment"). No head-hopping. Under peak pressure ("knees hit the ground"), diction compresses slightly without losing texture. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (close on "her pulse spiked," then pulls back for the canyon's inhalation). No dialogue on the page, so those bullets do not apply. Minor register drift: "synaptic plasticity" and "quantum foam" feel slightly elevated for a crisis moment, but voice remains coherent.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in most lines. Three paraphrase loops touch closure: "not as an engineer... not as an archeologist... but as the first cartographer" recycles the structure; "the canyon swallowed her footsteps whole" echoes "the canyon seemed to inhale" without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "canyon walls loomed like fractured ribs" is functional but familiar. Filter-verb stack: "she had spent," "she'd been modifying," "she had always been" clusters in exposition, dulling immediacy. Template cadence in the vision sequence: "a man laughing... a child drawing... a probe, half-buried" uses parallel stems. Apply −0.6 in Q7 for loops and template cadence touching closure; disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Premise (engineer modifies herself to access entangled memories) is specific and non-obvious; the mirror as tool is a fresh synthesis. The canyon as threshold and the nanite resonance feel organic. Emotional truth (abandoned dreams, lover's critique, childlessness) grounds the speculative frame. Transformation test: plot and arc depend on these exact choices (mirror, nanites, canyon). Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking (lyric compression, high diction) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One deduction: the "archeologist of abandoned dreams" phrasing reads slightly prompt-like, a label imposed rather than earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>Lena is present throughout; her engineer identity shapes perception (equations, schematics, neural interfaces) and she makes three on-page choices (adjusts mirror, feeds current through nanites, picks up mirror and walks). Setup clear; middle beat (feeding current) constrains tactics; closure beat (walks as cartographer) reframes identity. However, choices are observational adjustments rather than high-cost decisions that alter tactics under pressure. "Helix-minded" is embodied in diction but doesn't constrain a key choice with visible tradeoff. Two-of-three gates met; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage present but identity shift feels inevitable rather than earned. Score ~5.7: shapes one key turn (feeding current) and contributes to ending, but swappable with "obsessive scientist" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mirror appears in beat 1 (tracing jagged edge), beat 2 (adjusting angle), beat 3 (feeding current), beat 4 (picking up, edges now warm). Setup early; middle beats (adjustments) constrain tactics; closure beat (warm edges) recharges meaning. Three-gate pass. Causal pressure: adjustments enable visions. Closure linkage strong: "broken edges now warm" signals acceptance. Specificity high: fractured surface as "mosaic" and its distortion matter. Cost connection: her transformations depend on resonating with the mirror. Score ~7.8: essential across beats and ending, drives three distinct actions, charges final image. Not indispensable—another fractured surface could substitute—but removal would flatten closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Entangled memories appear as exposition (theory stated), middle beat (visions of stranger, man, child, probe surface), and closure claim ("all of it, tangled in the helix of her mind"). Setup by paragraph 8; middle beat (visions) shapes her realization; closure beat restates the concept. Three-gate pass. Causal pressure moderate: concept licenses the visions but doesn't constrain her choices—she doesn't decide *which* memories to access or face a cost in retrieving them. Closure linkage: "no longer abandoned" reweights the stake. Specificity: quantum foam and entanglement are named but mechanics stay abstract. Score ~6.4: shapes one key turn (visions surface) and charges ending, but could be rephrased as "collective unconscious" or "shared memory field" with minor edits; not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Chaotically precise" appears once as a descriptor ("her movements chaotically precise—calculated yet trembling") in the mirror-adjustment beat. Setup implicit in "helix of equations... always coiling tighter"; closure absent. One-gate pass (middle beat). Causal pressure weak: the phrase describes her state but doesn't enable or constrain the mirror work—she could be "steady yet intense" without altering the sequence. Cost connection absent. Specificity low: "calculated yet trembling" is a label without visible tradeoff. Score ~4.8: functional mention in one beat, but replaceable and ornamental; removing it would not break logic or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>"Modify" appears as backstory (months of self-modification with nanites), middle beat (adjusting mirror alignment, feeding current pulse), and closure implication (transformations settle into her). Setup by paragraph 8; middle beat (feeding current) is the key action that triggers deeper visions; closure references "transformations" plural. Three-gate pass. Causal pressure: feeding current through nanites enables the vision sequence. Closure linkage: final acceptance depends on prior modifications. Specificity: nanite resonance with fractured glass is unique. Cost hinted (months of self-modification) but not paid on-page. Score ~7.2: drives two beats (nanite pulse, final settling) and shapes ending, essential but cost is told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Synaptic plasticity appears in beat 1 ("first tremor of synaptic plasticity rippled through her skull"), exposition (months of rewiring neural pathways with nanites), and implied in closure (entanglements "settle into her like sediment"). Setup early; middle absent as named mechanic; closure implied. Two-gate pass (setup, closure). Causal pressure weak: the tremor signals transformation but doesn't shape her attempts—she adjusts the mirror, not her synapses, in the key beats. Closure linkage moderate: settling references neural change but doesn't name the method. Specificity: nanites and neural pathways are concrete. Score ~5.9: signaled and present in closure implication, but method doesn't constrain middle tactics; removing "synaptic" and keeping "neural nanites" would not alter structure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Canyon is present throughout: walls "loomed," "threshold," "wound in the world," "seemed to inhale," "swallowed her footsteps whole." Setup immediate; middle beat (canyon's inhalation coincides with vision deepening) pressures her; closure beat (canyon swallows footsteps) charges final image. Three-gate pass. Causal pressure: canyon as threshold frames her choice to come here; its "quaking" under moonlight heightens urgency. Closure linkage strong: final line uses canyon to seal her disappearance into the role. Specificity: fractured ribs, cracked earth, moonlit threshold are vivid. Cost connection: walking into the canyon forecloses return. Score ~7.6: essential across beats and ending, drives spatial logic and final image, but swappable with another liminal landscape (desert, ice field) without breaking core stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Timeframe "during a period of profound transformation" is stated in exposition (months of self-modification, seventeen years designing probes) and closure claim (transformations settle). Setup via backstory; middle absent as live pressure; closure restates transformation. Two-gate pass. Causal pressure weak: months of prior work enable tonight's attempt, but no on-page clock tightens decisions—she adjusts the mirror at will. Closure linkage: "transformations" references the period but doesn't show culmination with cost. Specificity low: transformation is told, not dramatized as a live process. Score ~5.2: functional background that licenses the attempt, but time doesn't constrain tactics or alter moves; removing "months" and keeping "one night" would not change structure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Motivation appears in exposition ("came to the canyon... as an archeologist of abandoned dreams"), middle beat (chasing theory to recover buried things), and closure (walks "as the first cartographer"). Setup by paragraph 4; middle beat (adjusting mirror to access dreams) enacts desire; closure fulfills it. Three-gate pass. Causal pressure moderate: desire to recover lost memories drives mirror work. Closure linkage: "cartographer" reframes "archeologist" and claims fulfillment. Friction weak: she wants to recover dreams and does so without visible cost or competing want. Specificity: "archeologist of abandoned dreams" is vivid but slightly label-like. Score ~6.1: shapes one key turn (vision retrieval) and ending identity, but desire is declared and met without dramatized conflict; could be "seeker of lost knowledge" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Tone "quaking reverie" is embodied throughout: "moon's silver scalpel," "helix of equations," "fractured glass," "synaptic plasticity rippled," "canyon seemed to inhale," "pulsating, liquid white," "canyon swallowed her footsteps." Setup immediate; middle beats sustain dreamlike precision; closure intensifies ("liquid white," "swallowed"). Three-gate pass. Coherence strong: elevated diction, metaphor density, and syntactic rhythm hold. Modulation: tone tightens (short sentences "Lena's pulse spiked. That wasn't her memory.") then expands again. Closure linkage: final image ("swallowed... whole") charges the reverie with finality. Specificity: quaking (tremor, rippled, pulsating) and reverie (dream visions, entanglements) are sustained. Score ~6.7: tone is coherent and charges the final image, essential to atmosphere, but density occasionally tips toward overwriting (see Q7 penalties); not indispensable—piece could work in plainer register with adjustments.</comment>
