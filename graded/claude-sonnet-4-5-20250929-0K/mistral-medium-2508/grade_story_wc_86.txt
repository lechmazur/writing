<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is motivated by a consistent ethic—untethering stalemates, recycling mistakes into wisdom—and his micro-choices (offering the drawer pull, the cache location) track that hierarchy of values. His internal contradiction (thinking of prisoners as "seeds" while trading them like chess pieces) adds texture. Kaelis's hesitation and her nephew's raw wrists give embodied emotion, and the boy's final question ("Will they forgive me?") lands with credible vulnerability. Minor slip: Elias's interiority occasionally edges toward label-speak ("the weight of neutral territory pressed too hard"), but the closure choice—giving the boy time to try—feels earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: who (Elias Veyne, negotiator), where (storm-worn parapet above a chasm), and the dominant stake (prisoner exchange under moral pressure) anchor by the second paragraph. The inferred lens is Causal: Elias's offer → Kaelis's memory of her brother → the deal → the boy's release. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kaelis picks up the drawer pull and the ghost of sibling love tips her decision. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the boy goes free, the war continues, and Elias walks away lighter—options have narrowed and a path is foreclosed. The ending image ("something quieter had won") lands the cost cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The parapet—windblown, slick with mist, groaning under the storm—is not postcard description; it constrains the negotiation (both parties exposed, no banners cross the chasm) and charges the final image when Elias and the boy step away from the edge. The chasm functions as a persistent spatial threat, and the boy's raw wrists from ropes are tactile, lived-in detail. Spatial choreography is clear: Elias at the parapet, Kaelis emerging from mist, the boy waiting below with a lantern. The setting modulates with pressure: mist parts to reveal the void's depth at the negotiation's hinge, then the storm swallows footprints as they leave.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—securing the boy's freedom—is signaled early ("the boy was Kaelis's nephew, taken for desertion") and escalates under Causal pressure: "They won't release the boy" → Elias adjusts terms with the drawer pull → Kaelis's memory tips the trade → the boy goes free. One meaningful tightening: the deal forecloses the cache location and requires Kaelis to trust Elias, narrowing options. The cost is visible: the war "limps on," Elias gives up his father's drawer pull, and the boy still faces an uncertain forgiveness. Agency is clear—Elias's decision to offer the cache and Kaelis's choice to accept—and coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—neutral territory as a choice, not a place; recycling mistakes into wisdom—emerges from concrete action: Elias offering the drawer pull, Kaelis recalling her brother's initials, the boy asking "Will they forgive me?" The final image ("something quieter had won") reweights the premise without stating a moral. The drawer pull accrues meaning: first a habit-object, then a lever/lie, finally a silent reminder in a general's desk. Minor slip: "the furrowed hush" and "neutral territory had done its work again" edge toward thematic echo, though the phrases are filtered through Elias's professional lens and do not dominate the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds Elias's perceptual signature: "preferred to think of them as seeds waiting to root," "he'd spent years recycling mistakes into wisdom." Psychic distance is stable. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Kaelis's "They won't release the boy" and Elias's offer carry subtext and advance plot. Voice modulates under pressure—sharper at the negotiation, gentler with the boy—without head-hopping. Minor issue: some register drift in stressed moments ("the moon hung at half-mast, its phase synchronizing with the tide of their patience" reads elevated for a crisis beat) and a few stock phrases ("ghost of a sibling's love") soften the otherwise distinct texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Figurative language is controlled except in one cluster: "mist that curled like ghostly fingers," "moon hung at half-mast," "phase synchronizing with the tide of their patience"—three metaphors in quick succession at the opening negotiation beat, mixing vehicles (ghost/nautical/tidal) without clear pattern payoff. Template cadence appears in the mid-section: "He slid it toward her. … Her fingers twitched. … 'No,' Elias said." Paraphrase loop: "something quieter had won" echoes "the furrowed hush" within two lines. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum at a pivotal turn, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—negotiator on a neutral parapet using a personal object to broker a trade—offers a fresh angle on war-story territory. The drawer pull as lever/lie is a specific, earned turn. Emotional particularity (Kaelis's memory of her brother's initials, the boy's raw wrists) avoids generic templates. Minor friction: the core frame (neutral mediator, moral calculus, war-weary wisdom) echoes familiar midpoint-of-conflict narratives without fully transforming the arc; the ending wisdom ("not my trade, but I can give you the time to try") risks platitude, though it grows from prior action. The synthesis feels solid and purposeful but not yet indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (prisoner exchange negotiator) drives all three gates: setup (opening paragraph, "the man who untethered stalemates"), development (adjusts terms with the drawer pull, narrows options), and payoff (releases the boy, offers "time to try"). His choices create the key turn (the cache-for-nephew trade) and the closure effect (the boy's freedom, the cost of the war continuing). The role is causally indispensable; removing it breaks the story's logic. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5. No frictions apply. Total: ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The antique drawer pull (object) appears in three beats: Elias adjusts it in his palm (opening), sets it on the stone as "a lever" (negotiation turn), and it sits "in a general's desk" as a silent reminder (ending image). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (patina, father's lesson, Kaelis's brother carved initials) +0.6. Friction: the middle beat (offering it) is pivotal, but the ending reference is summary-only ("somewhere … would sit"), not dramatized on the page, applying −0.5. Total: ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Neutral territory (core concept) shapes all three gates: setup ("neutral territory pressed too hard," the parapet as a no-man's-land), development (the chasm "neither side's banners daring to cross" constrains the negotiation space), and payoff ("neutral territory had done its work again"). It alters tactics—both parties must meet exposed, no enforcement beyond mutual need—and charges the final image (stepping away from the edge, storm swallowing footprints). Early signal +0.7, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Minor friction: the phrase "neutral territory had done its work" in the final third is slightly thematic-echo, applying −0.3. Total: ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly thoughtful" (attribute) is present but not explicitly dramatized as a trait label. Elias's behavior—offering the cache, reading Kaelis's hesitation, giving the boy "time to try"—embodies thoughtfulness. Setup is implicit (his reflective interiority anchors early), development (he adjusts terms rather than forcing a win), and payoff (his final words to the boy). Causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.7. Frictions: no on-page sentence names the trait, so it reads as inferred rather than constrained, applying −0.5; the attribute is interchangeable with "patient" or "perceptive" without structural change, applying −0.4. Total: ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Untether" (action) is signaled early ("the man who untethered stalemates"), drives the middle beat (offering the cache to untether the nephew), and appears in the ending reflection ("I can give you the time to try" extends the untethering metaphor). Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9. Friction: the verb is metaphorical rather than a distinct physical act, and the story would function with "free" or "release" substituted at minor cost, applying swappability −0.6. Total: ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Synchronizing through moon phases" (method) appears once: "the moon hung at half-mast, its phase synchronizing with the tide of their patience." The mechanics are asserted but never tested—no prior attempts shown, no on-page failure or adjustment tied to lunar timing. Setup is present (mid-first-third), but development and payoff gates are missing. Late signal −0.3, ornamental (description without causal work) −0.8, summary-only −0.5. Cap for missing development and payoff: 3.4. Total: ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The storm-worn windblown parapet in mist (setting) constrains all three gates: setup (opening paragraph anchors location and atmosphere), development (the exposed meeting space forces vulnerability, "no banners daring to cross"), and payoff (stepping away from the edge, the storm swallowing footprints charges the final image). The mist parts to reveal the chasm's depth at the negotiation hinge, a micro-setting move that alters emotional pressure. Early signal +0.7, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, specificity (windblown stones slick with mist, groaning parapet) +0.6. Total: ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "between apology and forgiveness" is signaled once ("the moon … the timeframe between apology and forgiveness stretched thin") but does not constrain the on-page negotiation. No ticking clock or deadline forces a choice; the deal proceeds at conversational pace. The phrase reappears thematically in the boy's question ("Will they forgive me?") but does not shape tactics. Setup +0.4, closure linkage (thematic) +0.6. Frictions: vague tracking (no urgency tied to elapsed time) −0.5, ornamental mention −0.6. Total: ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To recycle mistakes into wisdom" (motivation) drives Elias's choices: setup ("he'd spent years recycling mistakes into wisdom"), development (offering the cache as a way to untether the boy from "a war he didn't start"), and payoff (pocketing "his father's lesson" at the end). The desire is dramatized in his offer and the cost (giving up the drawer pull). Early signal +0.7, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.1, cost connection +0.5. Friction: the phrase "recycling mistakes into wisdom" is stated twice, edging toward label-only at the end, applying −0.4. Total: ~6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" (tone) is signaled early ("a furrowed hush where even enemies could hear the cost of their pride") and sustained through quiet dialogue, muted gestures (fingers brushing a hilt, turning over the drawer pull), and the final image ("something quieter had won"). The tone modulates under pressure—tense at the negotiation, gentle with the boy—and charges the ending without breaking into melodrama. Early signal +0.6, coherence across turns +0.9, closure linkage +1.2. Minor friction: "furrowed hush" is repeated as a thematic marker in the final third, applying −0.3 for slight echo. Total: ~7.0.</comment>
