<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to find "where stories begin" is signaled but remains abstract; her on-page choices (trading moonlight, incising slates) feel observational rather than personally pressured. The patron's hunger is embodied ("eyes flickered, hungry"), yet Liora's internal stakes never materialize as genuine contradiction or cost—she performs her role without visible friction. The final choice to keep moonlight "for the darkness it held" gestures at thematic weight but arrives without prior struggle, making the renunciation feel declared rather than earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Textural/Accumulative lens with its lyric, image-driven mode and recurring motifs (slates, moonlight, pauses). However, no single beat narrows options or changes Liora's stance; the patron's arrival and departure function as illustration rather than escalation. The ending reiterates the opening premise ("stories begin where silence breaks") without reweighting it through visible cost or a decision that forecloses a path. Orientation is swift (library, Liora, opening day by paragraph two), but the closure unit reads as a thematic echo rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is vivid and purposefully surreal ("shelves of crystalline branches," "clouds swirled slower"), and the quartz counter and obsidian needle are handled across beats. The needle's physical act (incising the slate) produces the fracture, linking tool to outcome. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the floating library and clouds do not constrain Liora's choices or alter tactics under pressure, limiting integration to descriptive rather than causal work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding "where stories begin"—is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or escalating cost. The patron's request is accommodated without friction; Liora incises, the slate fractures, the exchange completes. No reversal or deepening forces a trade-off; the "next customer" framing suggests repetition rather than transformation. The piece lacks a single on-page moment where Liora's agency forecloses a path or pays a visible price, keeping pressure static and illustrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme—silence and absence as story's origin—is woven through concrete images (clean slates, the needle that "traces nothing," moonlight's captured dark) and avoids overt moralizing until the final lines. However, the last paragraph's direct statements ("The story begins where the silence breaks") and the repeated "She already knew the answer" veer into thematic summary rather than letting the final image resonate. The glimmering parole concept is intriguing but remains abstract; no on-page event transforms or complicates its meaning, leaving resonance theoretical rather than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and lyric throughout, with a consistent perceptual signature ("fingers brushing," "hum like a plucked string," "chimed softly") that never slips into head-hopping or register mismatch. The patron's dialogue is sparse and goal-driven ("I want the glimmering parole"); Liora's interiority stays character-particular. Distance remains stable, and the elliptical phrasing ("The incising wasn't writing; it was listening") reads purposeful rather than obscure. Minor scaffold appears in the final third (repeated "She already knew," "It was always the same"), slightly dulling the ending's immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent ("wind that smelled of old ink and ozone," "prismatic shadows"), but the final third suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She already knew the answer. / It was always the same. / The story begins where the silence breaks." These adjacent restatements dull closure momentum. The penultimate sequence ("She picked up her needle. / The slate was waiting.") recycles the setup without adding pressure. Clarity is high, but information density drops in the last 150 words, triggering −0.6 for loop/scaffold in a closure-adjacent beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "glimmering parole" concept and the vendor-of-blank-slates frame offer a fresh angle on meta-narrative inquiry, and the image of incising absence is specific. However, the execution retreads familiar ground: the mystical proprietor, the seeker who arrives with metaphysical currency, the exchange that reveals a secret the proprietor already knows. The ending's repetition ("They always did") and the promise of cyclical future visits signal a closed loop rather than a transformation, limiting originality to the surface premise without a non-obvious synthesis or earned risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her professional role frames the scene, but her choices are reactive and illustrative (selecting a slate, keeping moonlight) rather than pressured. She does not face a dilemma or make a turn; the patron's request is accommodated without friction. Setup and middle development are present, but closure participation is passive observation ("She already knew"), capping the score below 5.0 per the missing-agency friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bottled moonlight appears in the opening exchange, flares during the incising beat, and is kept by Liora "for the darkness it held" at closure. Three distinct beats with a purposeful final reprise that reweights its meaning (from currency to symbol of absence) meet the three-gate test and causal involvement, lifting the score into the 6.0+ band. However, its transformation is conceptual rather than action-driving, limiting further elevation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "glimmering parole" is named and defined mid-scene, shapes the patron's request, and prompts Liora's incising action. It appears in setup (patron's request), drives the middle beat (incising), and is referenced obliquely at closure ("the space between them"). However, its mechanics remain abstract—no on-page cost or tactical constraint tied directly to the parole itself—and the ending's broader "silence" framing diffuses its specificity, capping it in the mid-5s for functional but somewhat diffuse integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" describes the slate arrangement in paragraph three but does not constrain or enable any later choice. The attribute is ornamental staging without causal work, tactical tradeoff, or closure linkage. Late first appearance and no development or payoff trigger the missing-development cap of 3.4, with a small lift for early mention placing it at 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Incise" is signaled in the setup (Liora's needle, the slates "waiting to be incised"), drives the central beat (the needle traces the fracture), and returns at closure ("She picked up her needle"). Three gates met, with causal pressure (the incising produces the parole's physical manifestation) and closure linkage. The action is specific and irreplaceable (tracing absence, not writing), lifting it into the 7+ band. Minor friction: the final incising is anticipated rather than executed on the page, slightly reducing immediacy.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Quantifying absence" is named by Liora mid-scene and frames the patron's need, but its mechanics are never demonstrated beyond metaphor. The needle "traces nothing," yet the result (a fracture) appears without a clear method the reader can trace. Setup and middle mention are present, but the method's execution is told rather than shown and does not recur at closure, capping it below 5.0 per swappability and summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is vividly described in the opening and the final image references the clouds and chiming branches, meeting setup and closure gates. However, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics; Liora's exchange with the patron would function identically in any mystical shop. The floating clouds and crystalline shelves remain postcard elements without causal pressure, capping the score in the mid-4s despite lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "lull of opening day" is named in paragraph five, contextualizes Liora's anticipation, and the ending's "The lull was over. / Now, the work began" marks a shift from waiting to engagement. Two gates met with a clear before/after cadence change. However, no on-page clock or urgency pressures Liora's choices; the timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical, limiting elevation above the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Liora's motivation "to find the place where stories begin" is declared in paragraph four and echoed at closure ("stories didn't begin with words"). It frames her professional stance and her choice to keep the moonlight, meeting setup and closure gates. However, the desire is never dramatized as internal friction or tested by a conflicting cost; Liora's conviction remains stable and uncontested, reducing integration to thematic framing rather than pressured choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone—lyric, elliptical, with fragmented sensory images and recurring motifs—is consistent and modulates subtly (the opening's "thick with possibility" shifts to the closing's declarative "The lull was over"). The patterned repetition ("She already knew," "It was always the same") and the micro-image structure (needle, slate, moonlight, fracture) teach "integrated fragmentation" by the second paragraph and hold through closure. The final image's declarative turn charges the ending without breaking the established register, meeting all three gates and supporting closure. Minor friction: the ending's direct thematic statements slightly flatten the lyric mode established earlier, preventing higher elevation.</comment>
