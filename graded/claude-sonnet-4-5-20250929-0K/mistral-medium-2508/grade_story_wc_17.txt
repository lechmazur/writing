<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his perceptual acuity is embodied through specific sensory work (tuning fork, half-burned diaries, ear that catches drafts). The interiority shows contradiction—he wants to know what walls dream but more whether they dream of him—and the final choice to complete the mural and walk away reads as earned. However, the emotional progression from discovery to completion feels compressed; the transition from "hands shook" to serene smile lacks intermediate embodied struggle, and the mother's-eyes moment doesn't visibly complicate his tactics in the alcove or sealed-door beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: film negative discovery → recognition of mother's eyes → father's diary words → sealed door → mural completion → corridor transformation. Orientation anchors (ivy passage, Elias, cartographer role, post-climate-shift world) land by ~80 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the mural completion shifts the corridor's echo from whisper to song, and Elias walks away lighter but still burdened—a stance crystallization with visible cost: he leaves the threshold open, releasing the legacy). One meaningful tightening occurs when the door opens and the shrine forces confrontation. Cost is legible in "no longer a chain, but a thread he could choose to follow or cut" and the act of walking away. A minor slip: the sealed door's literal disappearance and replacement with a glowing threshold reads convenient rather than causally motivated by the mural's completion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (damp stone, pulse, scent of old smoke and wet earth). The crumbling alcove, sealed door, and shrine room are spatially coherent, and the ivy "as if listening" recurs to charge the final departure. The passage itself constrains Elias's movement and the sealed door becomes a literal threshold he must breach. Micro-setting (film negative, diaries, tuning fork) functions well. One gap: the post-climate-shift world (drowned coasts, acid rains) is declared but never shapes a present choice or resource constraint on the page; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elias can reconcile with his family's trapped memories and his own role in that legacy—is signaled early and tightens when he finds his mother's face in the negative, escalates when he hears his own name through the sealed door, and culminates in the mural completion that transforms the corridor's echo. The tightening is meaningful: the door "groaned open" after he burns the varnish, forcing confrontation with the shrine. Visible cost: he sits, spills negatives "like confessions," completes the mural through dawn, and walks away with "burden of legacy...no longer a chain, but a thread"—a renunciation that forecloses returning to passive listening. One micro-turn (the door's disappearance) reads convenient rather than earned by his prior agency, softening the final price slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (memory, legacy, the burden of witnessing and recording trauma) emerges organically from the cartographer vocation, the diaries, and the mural act. "The walls didn't just dream. They *remembered*" reframes the premise without stating a moral, and the final image—open threshold, Elias choosing to walk away—offers a resonant answer: some dreams are meant to be lived, not mapped. The film negative aligning with the mural's blank patch is a strong non-literal beat. Minor slip: "Some dreams weren't meant to be mapped. Some were meant to be lived" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than trusting the image alone, though it stops short of moralizing by landing on action (he walks away, smiles).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Elias's perceptions. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the mother's-eyes recognition ("He hadn't thought of her in years"), mid-distance during exploration, and slightly elevated at the reflective closure. Diction is consistent and literary without register breaks; the prose carries a distinct, melancholy texture. Elias's perceptual signature (sensitively perceptive ear, focus on echoes and textures) is maintained. No dialogue appears. One minor note: "The ivy outside rustled, as if listening" and "the sealed door was gone" read slightly omniscient rather than filtered through Elias's direct observation, though they remain within lyric license for this mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the read-aloud test passes cleanly. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and reweight stakes effectively. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "a notebook of half-burned diaries salvaged from fireplaces" establishes tool, backstory, and world-state). However, two paraphrase loops appear: "The walls didn't just dream. They *remembered*" is immediately followed by "And they had been waiting for him to do the same" (synonym restatement), and the penultimate paragraph's "Some dreams weren't meant to be mapped. Some were meant to be lived" loops the concept without adding pressure. Template cadence: "He stopped...He pressed...He lit...He pulled...Elias sat...Elias stepped...Elias smiled" runs across seven beats with identical subject-verb stems, flattening propulsion during high-pressure moments. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops; these artifacts touch the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The corridor echo cartographer vocation is fresh and the combination of film negatives, half-burned diaries, and climate-shift setting feels specific. The mural completion as both witness act and release is a non-obvious synthesis. Emotional specificity (mother's eyes in the negative, father's voice through the door) avoids generic templates. However, the core arc—returning to a haunted familial space, confronting trapped memory, completing a ritual act of closure, then walking away lighter—follows a recognizable template for trauma-processing narratives. The "walls remember" conceit and the literal threshold transformation echo familiar symbolic moves. The piece executes its premise well but does not radically transform the inherited frame; originality rests more in texture and detail than in structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias (corridor echo cartographer) is present throughout and his perceptual work drives discovery beats (finds negative, hears name, completes mural). His decision to complete the mural and walk away is the closure action. However, much of his "cartography" is passive reception (listening, tracing) rather than active mapping choices that narrow options; the key reversal (lighting the door, completing the mural) comes late and the vocation's mechanics don't constrain tactics earlier. The character is essential but his occupation's specific methods are under-dramatized in pressure moments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears in three beats: discovery in the alcove, recognition of mother's eyes under lantern light, held up to align with the mural's blank patch, and finally spilling from his fingers during the mural completion. It returns with reweighted meaning (from relic to key to confession) and its alignment moment is pivotal. The strip is handled, examined, pocketed, retrieved, and released—evolving use across the arc. It directly shapes the mural's final form and charges the closure. Strong integration; not quite indispensable (the story could function with another memory trigger) but close.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is the dominant stake, signaled early ("weight of legacy pressed down"), tested at the sealed door ("his own name...wasn't quite a question, wasn't quite an accusation"), and resolved in the final lines ("burden of legacy remained—no longer a chain, but a thread he could choose to follow or cut"). The concept shapes his hesitation, his decision to burn the door open, and his choice to complete the mural and then leave. It alters tactics (he must confront rather than only map) and reappears in the closure with visible cost (he walks away, foreclosing passive cartography). Solid causal presence across setup, middle choice, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's "sensitively perceptive ear that caught what others dismissed as drafts" is mentioned early and enables his hearing of the passage's hum and his name through the door. However, the trait is primarily a label that explains his vocation rather than a live constraint with visible cost. The story does not show a moment where acute perception creates a tradeoff (e.g., overwhelm, distraction, or a choice others could not face). The trait is functional but does not demonstrably narrow options or impose penalty on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Glimpse" occurs when Elias holds the film negative to lantern light and sees "the ghost of a face" with his mother's eyes. This moment triggers recognition, the memory of her death, and his deeper pursuit into the passage. It seeds the mural's final alignment. However, the glimpse itself is brief and could be replaced with any sensory memory cue (a voice recording, a scent, a written letter) with minor edits. The action is important but not uniquely structural; it catalyzes rather than redefines the arc's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are mentioned early ("notebook of half-burned diaries salvaged from fireplaces") and appear again when Elias recalls his father's words: "The house dreams in corners. Listen." This line primes his expectation and justifies his deep listening. However, the diaries' mechanics—how he uses them, what specific entries guide his choices—are not dramatized. They function as backstory prop and thematic echo rather than a live method that shapes attempts or tactics in the passage. Present and thematically relevant but functionally thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is anchored early, its pulse and hum guide Elias's pursuit, the crumbling alcove and sealed door are spatial constraints he must navigate, and the passage's transformation (whisper to song, sealed door to open threshold) is the closure image. The setting supplies resources (the alcove hides the negative, the door seals the shrine) and its atmosphere charges every beat. The ivy "as if listening" at the end recurs to reweight the space. The passage is indispensable; removing it would collapse the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the climate shifts" is established early (drowned coasts, acid rains, fever that took his mother) and provides atmospheric context for Elias's vocation (mapping voices in abandoned spaces). However, the climate-shift element does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page. The passage exploration unfolds in a single night ("by dawn") but no live clock pressures his choices. The timeframe is present and internally consistent but ornamental to the main arc; it could be replaced with any post-catastrophe setting without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what walls dream about" is stated early ("He wanted to know what the walls dreamed about, but more than that, he wanted to know if they dreamed of him") and drives his exploration deeper into the passage. The want is complicated by personal stakes (his mother, his father, his own name) and the final realization ("The walls didn't just dream. They *remembered*") reframes the desire. However, the motivation is more tell-driven than dramatized through friction; Elias's want and the cost of pursuing it are declared rather than shown through on-page struggle or competing impulses. Present across beats and closure-relevant but lacks embodied conflict.</comment>
