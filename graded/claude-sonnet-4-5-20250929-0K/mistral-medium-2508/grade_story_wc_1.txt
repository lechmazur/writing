<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear and her internal state is rendered concretely through physical action (tracing frost, folding the ledger). The brother revelation provides genuine contradiction and cost. However, the final renunciation ("She didn't need the ledger anymore") arrives through assertion rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses options with visible struggle. Interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("the illusion that purpose was something you could melt and mold") without embodied contradiction acting in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: the ledger discovery drives the brother realization, which propels her walk into the canyon. Orientation anchors (canyon, frost, post-fire timeframe) arrive early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis—she releases the ledger and walks on, foreclosing the search with felt cost. The cost is legible in the act of letting go and the image of lightness. One meaningful tightening (brother's handwriting) narrows her options and the final walk reconfigures her stance from searcher to arriver.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canyon and frost constrain and charge the entire arc: frost patterns mirror her glass work and provide the discovery mechanism; the narrowing canyon walls guide her path. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her artist's eye. The body and ledger function as micro-setting, shaping the final release. The frost returns in the closing image, reweighting her perception from maker to listener, and the environment actively participates in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discover her brother's truth and her own purpose) is signaled early. The ledger revelation tightens options causally. However, the final choice to drop the ledger and walk on feels more like acceptance than a forced trade-off with competing costs dramatized on the page. The brother remains off-stage, so the stakes lack a second character to create immediate pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs but the price—emotional release—is asserted more than wrestled with in contradictory action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (purpose in unmaking and pauses) emerges organically from frost/glass imagery and the ledger's charred state. The final image—stepping into quiet light—offers a resonant answer without a stated moral. Subtext operates in the silence and the canyon's breath metaphor. The brother's absence charges the walk with ambiguity. Minor slip: "Maybe purpose wasn't in the making, but in the unmaking" edges toward thesis statement, though the subsequent action and imagery redeem it by grounding the insight in her physical release of the ledger.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-person-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature (artist's eye, light/fracture metaphors). Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent. However, several lines compress into lyric abstraction under pressure ("the pauses were where the truth lived") rather than maintaining concrete sensory texture. Free indirect style is mostly clean. No dialogue present. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively with emotional beats, though occasional elevated register ("drifting resonance") slightly exceeds the established lexical range in peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear with varied syntax and purposeful compression. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the canyon held its breath" bookends without transformation; "purpose" and "pauses" recur in adjacent lines without added pressure. Template stems cluster in the final third ("She thought... She let... Then she walked..."). Figurative density is high throughout without consistent pattern-teaching, and some metaphors ("breath a ghost," "numbers glowed faintly") veer toward stock imagery. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags slightly under decorative layering in the middle and closing sections.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of glass artist and smuggler's ledger is specific, and the frost-as-text conceit offers a fresh angle. However, the emotional arc (artist discovering purpose through loss and release) follows a familiar template. The brother reveal adds stakes but remains abstract since he never appears. The ledger drop and walk into light feel earned in hindsight but lack a bold risk or turn that redefines the premise. Specificity in craft detail (glass work, frost patterns) elevates the piece above generic execution, yet the resolution into quiet acceptance is well-trodden territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora's artist background shapes her perception (patterns, light, fractures) and her past work anchors the contrast with the ledger. However, "luminous glass artist" functions more as characterization than a driver of key turns; the climactic choice (dropping the ledger, walking on) stems from the brother revelation and her acceptance, not from her glass work constraining or enabling the action. Present across beats but replaceable with another craft without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ledger appears early, is handled multiple times (tracing numbers, folding, gripping, dropping), and its key entry ("pay in silver or the girl") triggers the brother revelation that tightens stakes. The final act of releasing it completes the arc. However, the ledger's scorched state is described but does not constrain her choices—she can read it fully. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but the object's specific properties (charred, numbers) are functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" is invoked thematically (ledger as testament to greed, fire as transformative loss) but does not shape on-page tactics. The fire and ledger inform backstory and emotional stakes, yet Liora's route forward (following frost patterns, walking the canyon) is chosen independently. The concept echoes in imagery (ash, charcoal) but does not alter her options or constrain her movements in scene. Present and coherent but ornamental to the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is told twice ("she had always been steadily adaptive") and implied in her shift from glass to frost-reading, but no specific on-page action demonstrates adaptation under pressure with a visible cost or tradeoff. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a constrained choice. Functional label without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Retrace" drives multiple beats: she retraces frost patterns, retraces ledger numbers, and the narrative structure retraces her emotional arc from maker to listener. The brother discovery hinges on her retracing the handwriting. The action is woven through and shapes the middle turn. However, the final closure (walking forward, not retracing) shifts away from the action, so it does not anchor the ending image. Two strong beats but not indispensable to the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Frost patterns are signaled early, likened to her glass work, and provide the setting for her contemplation. She "retraces" them and they "mirror the fractures in her own work." The frost melts under her footsteps but remains "etched in her mind." The method shapes her perceptual lens and the final image ("The frost listened"), but does not mechanically constrain her attempts or tactics—she reads meaning into them rather than solving a problem through them. Lyric reprise with modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canyon is present throughout, its silence and narrowing walls guide her path, and it "holds its breath" in the opening and closing, framing the arc. The ledger discovery occurs there, and the setting charges the final walk. However, the canyon does not impose a material constraint (cold, access, danger) that alters her tactics; it functions more as atmosphere and thematic mirror. Strong presence and tonal contribution, but not indispensable to the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" anchors the opening and establishes backstory (fire three nights ago), but the timeframe does not tighten present decisions. No live clock or urgency governs her walk into the canyon; she moves at a contemplative pace. The "attempt" backstory informs stakes but does not press on-page choices. Functional setup without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire to "discover purpose in the pauses" is told explicitly mid-story and dramatized through her contemplation of frost and the ledger. The final walk embodies her shift from searching to arriving, a legible stance change. However, the motivation is more internally resolved than externally contested—no competing want or fear creates friction that costs her something concrete. The pauses structure her reflection but do not force a trade-off with visible loss on the page. Present and shapes the ending, but the conflict is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" is invoked explicitly ("the canyon... hummed—a drifting resonance") and the tone modulates from contemplative stillness through the brother revelation to quiet resolve. Sentence rhythm and imagery (breath, pauses, stars, light) cohere around the tone, and the final "quiet kind" of light charges the closure. The tone remains consistent under pressure and supports the Earned Stasis form. Strong tonal control tied to the ending image.</comment>
