<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is characterized through his embodied perception—hearing stress cracks as music, strumming fissures—and his symphonic mindset shapes micro-choices (pressing the insulator, adjusting grip). Internal contradiction is light: his drive to voice the sculpture's grief is consistent rather than conflicted, and no meaningful renunciation or cost forecloses a path. The final act (leaving the insulator) reads more as completion than change, limiting the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly by the opening paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered sensory details and the deepening communion between Elias, the sculpture, and the grove, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the insulator left behind, the melody carried by siskins). Cost is present but oblique—Elias walks away—so the closure reads as Earned Stasis with a quiet handoff rather than a decisive forfeiture with sharp sting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove, the sculpture's stress cracks, and the insulator all constrain choices: Elias presses the ceramic to amplify sound, analyzes fissures as sheet music, and the insulator's warming and "weeping" charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (damp needle-bed, glaze catching dawn, beads of moisture), filtered through Elias's symphonic attention. The setting functions as micro-setting and tool, meeting the 9+ gate requirement and driving the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to voice the sculpture's grief—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's iterative adjustments (thumbnail strum, insulator application). The escalation is driven by accumulative deepening rather than causal reversals: each strumming attempt layers meaning until the siskins respond and the insulator weeps. One meaningful intensification occurs when the bird trills and Elias answers, narrowing the act to communion; however, the visible price is muted—he simply leaves—so the cost lacks the sharpness required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—empathy in motion, voicing silenced grief—emerges through concrete action (strumming, siskins answering, insulator weeping) rather than statement. The final image (grove remembering, future listeners hearing the cracks) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: the phrase "empathy in motion" appears twice as a conceptual claim ("That was the core of it"), which slightly edges toward theme echo, though it remains subordinate to the dramatized beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and Elias's perceptual signature is distinct: he hears vibrations as music, reads stress as melody. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression ("not music, not yet—but it was *almost* a song"). Minor slip: "Empathy in motion. / That was the core of it" briefly shifts into meta-commentary, a slight flattening of the otherwise embodied texture, though it recovers quickly and the closure image holds voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high (each line advances action or atmosphere), and clarity remains strong. Minor deductions: "the sound of empathy, still moving" in the final line borders on abstraction after the vivid insulator-weeping and siskin-stitching images, and "symphonically minded" appears twice with near-identical phrasing. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks mar the closure beat, so non-closure issues are capped at −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—tree-song sculptor using stress cracks and a porcelain insulator—offers a fresh angle and specific synthesis. The closure (leaving the insulator, siskins carrying the melody) feels earned in hindsight. Minor penalty: the core concept "empathy in motion" is stated twice, nudging the piece toward template territory; the emotional arc (lonely artist finds communion) is familiar, though the execution through tactile, acoustic detail lifts it above the generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, his choices drive all key beats (kneeling, strumming, pressing the insulator, adjusting grip, leaving the insulator), and the closure depends on his decision to walk away. Early signal, causal pressure across three beats, and closure linkage all present. Cost is muted—he simply departs—so indispensability stops short of the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The insulator appears in four beats: dangling at belt, pressed to cracks to amplify, thrumming and heating, and weeping beside the sculpture. It enables the song's emergence (mechanics matter) and charges the final image with its salt-clouded surface. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity (porcelain glaze, moisture as grief) all present; minor cap for the cost being implicit rather than a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is named twice as a concept and dramatized through Elias's communion with the sculpture and siskins. It shapes the dominant stake (voicing grief) and the ending gesture (leaving the insulator for future listeners). However, it functions more as theme than as a constraint that narrows on-page options; the concept is echoed rather than forcing a tactical choice with cost, limiting the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is named early and enables Elias's perception (hearing vibrations, reading cracks as sheet music, strumming with deliberate slowness). It constrains his method—he analyzes stress patterns like music—but does not force a visible tradeoff or narrow options under pressure. Setup and development gates met; payoff is implicit in the siskins' melody, so the trait scores in mid-band for enabling action without incurring cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strumming appears in four beats: thumbnail on the largest fissure, adjusting grip to tune, dragging nail down the deepest crack, and the siskins' reprise. The action defines the protagonist's method and produces the key turn (siskin responding). Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage present. Minor cap: the action is intrinsic to the premise (sculptor strums sculpture) so swappability is low, but the cost tied to strumming itself is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Analyzing stress cracks is signaled early ("analyzing the stress patterns like sheet music"), shapes middle attempts (jagged split from despair, hairline fracture from frozen sap), and the mechanics matter (each flaw holds a note). The method enables the song and is present in the closure beat (future listeners pressing ears to cracks). Setup, development, and payoff gates met; cost is implicit in the labor, not a sharp tradeoff, so the score lands in upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is named in the opening line, provides spatial grounding (damp needle-bed, branches, undergrowth), and the siskins' response (tilting head, trilling, stitching melody into leaves) charges the closure. The setting supplies resources (birds as audience) and the grove "listens," but does not constrain a choice under pressure. Setup and payoff gates met; development is light, so the score stays in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls" frames the opening and returns in the penultimate paragraph (hedgehog "now curled again"), bracketing the scene with a lyric pattern. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline; it functions as atmospheric framing rather than a live clock. Only setup and payoff gates met, and the element is swappable with any dawn marker, so the score trends toward lower-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to create music in a silent world—is dramatized through Elias's iterative strumming, his choice to play "until the siskins returned," and the final act of leaving the insulator so the grove remembers. Friction between the want (voice the grief) and cost (leaving the tool behind) is present but muted. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, and closure linkage all met; cost is oblique, capping the score below the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is coherent throughout: softest light, whisper of fibers, high thin note, held breath, grove exhaling, siskins' single questioning note. Tone modulates with pressure (oak's shuddering chord, insulator thrumming hot) and charges the final image (sound that "doesn't need ears to be heard"). The tone is essential to the closure effect—quiet depth over volume—and removing it would flatten the story's resonance, placing the score in the high band.</comment>
