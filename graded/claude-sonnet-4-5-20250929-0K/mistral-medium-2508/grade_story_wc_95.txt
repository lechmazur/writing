<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (turning questions into destinations) drives his sundial investigation with embodied detail—mechanical arm whirring, pulse quickening. His final choice to pocket the key and partner with Liora feels earned by the atrium duel. However, interiority remains thin: we see gestures and reactions but little internal contradiction or struggle between competing impulses. The twelve-year revelation lands as plot information rather than a moment that reweights his hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly: Elias and Liora, glass atrium, three-day wait, sundial duel. The drive lens reads Causal with situational pressure: needle card → shadow angle → hidden compartment → key, each beat motivated. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (partnership crystallized); cost is legible—Elias abandons solo vindication, accepts shared credit. One meaningful tightening when he realizes Liora carved the code twelve years prior narrows his options and reframes the negotiation. The "lock's been broken for decades" line undercuts the key's material necessity slightly but the relational shift holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Glass atrium, brook, sundial, and heron anchor space vividly with sensory detail (dappled light, damp earth, crushed mint). The sundial's hidden notch and needle card's shadow constrain Elias's blade work, charging the final reveal. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout fencing moves. Minor issue: the mechanical arm is described repeatedly (brass hinges, gears whispering, sparks flying) without these details altering a tactical choice; they remain atmospheric rather than functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving ethical governance theory—signals early and tightens when Elias realizes the sundial holds the answer, not the Council. The duel is a negotiation; each thrust and parry narrows interpretive options. Liora's twelve-year code forces Elias to see her buried question, escalating intellectual to relational stakes. The key's reveal and partnership decision land with felt cost: both abandon the Council's verdict for a shared map. One clean reversal when "You've been here before" reframes the duel from competition to test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—destinations vs. answers, doubt as map—emerges through the sundial puzzle and brook metaphor without overt statement. The needle card's coded angle and Elias's realization that waiting itself holds the answer offer a resonant, non-literal close. However, "turn questions into destinations" hovers close to prompt echo, and the final exchange ("Let's make it worth the wait") edges toward thematic summary. The heron's motionless watching and brook's indifference supply atmospheric reinforcement but do not constrain the final choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elias; perceptual signature (mechanical arm adjustments, pulse quickening) anchors his POV. Dialogue carries subtext—Liora's "Took you long enough" and "Lock's been broken for decades" reveal her testing motive obliquely. Voice modulates with pressure: short clauses during blade clashes, longer syntax in the resolution. Minor slip: "diplomatically fierce" and "calculated smirk" lean toward filter-heavy summary rather than showing Liora's stance through action alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; compound images ("surface catching the late afternoon light like shattered diamonds") create texture without obscuring action. However, density slips with paraphrase loops: "the atrium held its breath—the brook, the heron, even the dappled light" restates the same suspension without added pressure. "Lunging forward not with his blade but with the flat of his mechanical palm" stacks negation and clarification where a direct verb would propel. Template cadence in the final third ("Elias took it… Liora adjusted… Elias grinned") flattens momentum approaching closure. No grammar breaks; clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dueling philosophers via coded sundial offers a fresh synthesis of intellectual and physical conflict. The twelve-year embedded code and "lock's been broken for decades" twist add ingenuity. However, the atrium duel as negotiation and mechanical-arm protagonist echo steampunk/philosophical-thriller templates without a transforming lived detail that makes this pairing inevitable. The ending pivot—partners rather than rivals—feels organic but arrives via familiar beats (hidden compartment, symbolic key). Transformation test borderline: swap names and dial for another puzzle, the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias (dueling philosopher with mechanical arm) drives the sundial investigation, slaps the needle card, and pivots to strike the gnomon, unlocking the compartment. His mechanical arm sparks against Liora's rapier and whirs during stance adjustments, shaping fencing tactics. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure decision. The arm's specific mechanics (brass, gears) appear in multiple beats but remain more atmospheric than causally irreplaceable—generic prosthetic could substitute with minor edits. Still, his philosopher role (questions → destinations) and partnership choice are indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Danish tin sewing needle card appears in three beats: Liora flicks it as challenge, Elias slaps it airborne, Liora's rapier embeds it in the sundial's VII–VIII split, and its shadow reveals the hidden notch. The card's delicate filigree and coded placement drive the puzzle's resolution. However, "Danish tin sewing needle card" specificity (nationality, material) does not alter the logic; any small metal card with a shadow-casting edge would serve. The object shapes two key beats and closure participation but lacks unique properties that make this exact card irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hidden overture" frames the atrium encounter as a negotiation where each move is a clause, signaled early ("coded overture") and paid off when the key emerges. The concept shapes Elias's interpretive stance—he reads Liora's duel as a test of his ability to see buried questions. However, "overture" functions more as thematic label than a mechanical constraint; removing the term would not break the story's logic, and the duel-as-negotiation works independently. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but does not narrow options in a middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" applies to Liora: her calculated smirk, rapier interception, and twelve-year code-carving all suggest strategic intensity. However, the trait is asserted via label ("diplomatically fierce") and summary gestures ("her diplomatic mask sliding back into place") rather than shown through a visible tradeoff where diplomacy and ferocity compete on the page. No on-page cost tied to this attribute—she does not sacrifice one quality to deploy the other. Label-only use without causal pressure; caps at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fencing structures every major turn: Liora's needle-card flick, Elias's palm slap, rapier-on-brass sparks, blade tracing refracted light, and final strike into the sundial's center that unlocks the compartment. The action is irreplaceable—remove fencing and the negotiation collapses; no static debate or dialogue alone could deliver the same embodied puzzle-solving. Present in setup, two middle escalations, and the closure beat. The duel's choreography (lunges, feints, pivots) drives Elias's realization and partnership choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sundial's coded angles (half-painted face, VII–VIII split, gnomon shadow, hidden notch) are seeded early and mechanically essential: Elias follows the shadow's bearing, realizes Liora carved code into wet pigment twelve years ago, and strikes the center to unlock the compartment. The method shapes his interpretive attempts and the closure reveal. However, "coded angles" could substitute with another geometric cipher (mosaic tile, window lattice) without major rewrites. Strong causal role across three beats but not uniquely irreplaceable in specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Glass atrium and brook anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail (shattered-diamond light, damp earth, crushed mint, heron's motionless watch). The atrium's glass panes refract light Elias traces with his blade, contributing to the puzzle. However, setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost—the duel could occur in another enclosed, light-filled space without altering the sundial logic. Present in setup and atmospherically throughout, with one middle involvement (refracted light), but does not decisively shape the ending. Lyric resonance (brook's indifference, heron) enriches tone without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Three days" of waiting for the Council's verdict is stated early and patience "curdled into something fiercer," but the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions. No countdown pressure, no visible urgency that the next hour or day matters. The "while waiting" condition motivates the duel's existence but does not alter tactics within the scene. Time remains static backdrop rather than a live constraint. Present in setup, absent from middle escalation and closure; functional but replaceable with "during an impasse" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Turn questions into destinations" is voiced by Elias early, dramatized when he pivots from debate to following the sundial's shadow-path, and echoed in the final partnership walk toward "an unfinished argument" cityscape. The motivation drives his interpretive shift and closure choice. However, the desire is articulated more than conflicted—no on-page moment where he is tempted to cling to answers or refuse Liora's partnership. Present across setup, middle realization, and ending, with some causal pressure, but lacks visible friction between want and cost at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" coheres: formal diction (gnomon, filigree, rapier, magistrate) coexists with sparking brass, lunging physicality, and the sundial's "chimed" reveal. Tone modulates from tense standoff to partnership revelation without breaking voice. The final image—mechanical and whole silhouettes walking toward the city—charges the duality. However, tone remains relatively stable rather than escalating with pressure; no clear cadence shift at the closure beat that reweights the stake. Purposeful and consistent but does not transform prior material through tonal intensification.</comment>
