<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lira's interior world is concrete and particular—"time had frayed like the hem of her coat," the weight of collected stories "coiled in her ribs." The ghost confrontation dramatizes internal conflict through externalized iterations of self, though the twenty-five-year-old's interiority bleeds slightly into Lira's narration. The final choice to surrender to the lagoon is earned by the accumulation of collected failures and the physical leap embodies renunciation with visible cost. Minor slip: the ghost's voice occasionally converges with Lira's perceptual signature in diction and rhythm.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line 6 (carousel, lagoon, Lira's age uncertainty, camera wheel). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered pasts (merchant's boast, child's sob, woman's shadow) converging with ghost encounters, then deepens when multiple Liras emerge from the lagoon. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Lira's surrender—"let the past have her, just for now"—forecloses escape with felt cost, and the final image reweights the opening's frozen carousel through her willingness to wait "until the carousel started again." Cost is legible in the hands pulling her under and her cessation of struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The carousel platform, kinetic lagoon, and camera wheel supply tactile constraint: the lagoon's mist-memory surface "rippled only when the wind hit just right," dimpling where younger Lira once stood. The floating-island geography and glass towers sketch class structure without catalog. At closure, the lagoon refuses to ripple but "remembers," and the skeletal bridge below charges the jump with prior failure—environment directly shapes the final act. Spatial choreography stays clear across all ghost positions and the leap trajectory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Lira collects fragments to ensure the architect-self "doesn't follow me," establishing a reckoning with eroded ambition. Pressure deepens when the lagoon births multiple past selves and the chorus of "You left us all" forces acknowledgment. The final leap is protagonist-driven agency under the Accumulative lens—she chooses surrender over evasion—and forecloses the scavenger path with visible cost (hands pull her under, she doesn't struggle). The ghost's "bring something better than a camera" adds a constraint that reweights tactics at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—reconciliation with abandoned selves and eroded ambition—emerges through concrete particulars: the camera wheel holding "ghosts trapped in its frames," the crumpled blueprints, the unfinished bridge visible through clouds. The final image offers a non-literal answer: Lira's surrender isn't defeat but a wager that cyclical return ("until the carousel started again") might reweigh stasis differently. Subtext operates through the ghost's accusation "coward" spelled in ripples and Lira's whispered "I know," avoiding moralizing. No thematic echo in the ending; closure reconfigures the frozen-carousel frame through action and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Close third-person POV maintains stable distance and perceptual signature: Lira notices through tactile detail (camera wheel pressed to temple, wind carrying "ozone and old carnivals") and metaphor rooted in decay (time frayed, stories coiled). The ghost's italicized dialogue differentiates voice from narration. Brief convergence at "The lagoon didn't ripple. It *remembered.*" reads intentional—external reality echoing internal recognition—and the italics sustain clarity. Psychic distance tightens during the leap ("For a moment, weightless. For a moment, enough.") without filter clutter. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short bursts at the jump, longer accumulation in the ghost chorus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: "the way it dimpled where her younger self had once stood" does setting, memory, and character work simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at the leap ("She jumped. Not to fall..."), longer lyric passages in reflective beats. Minor loop: "she collected fragments" and "scavenged their discarded things" paraphrase the same content across paragraphs two and three without added pressure (−0.2). The metaphor "heavy as the camera wheel" contradicts plastic's lightness slightly but doesn't obscure sense. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats; the closure sequence is propulsive and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon as memory-mist medium and multiple-self ghost confrontation offer a fresh synthesis of identity-erosion premises. The "chronologically confused" detail (thirty-seven or forty-three) integrates causally: Lira's uncertain age signals the fraying that the ghosts literalize. The camera wheel as relic rather than functioning camera and the lagoon's refusal to ripple but instead "remember" transform familiar motifs through specific rules. The final wager—surrender to past selves as cyclic preparation—resists both tidy redemption and nihilistic collapse. Risk-taking in the ghost-chorus structure and the lagoon's non-water physics heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's scavenger role is established early (paragraph 4: "scavenged their discarded things") and her choices—pressing the camera wheel to her temple, raising it "like a shield," advancing the film one last time, then jumping—drive key beats. The jump decision alters tactics from collection to surrender, redefining her relationship with the past. Two gates clear: setup (paragraph 4) and closure (jump scene). Middle development is implied (she uses collected objects across time) but not dramatized in a distinct middle beat on the page, limiting band entry. Irreplaceability is moderate; another role could substitute with rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The camera wheel appears in four distinct beats: Lira traces its edges (paragraph 2), presses it to her temple to view trapped photos (paragraphs 6–7), raises it "like a shield" against the ghost chorus (paragraph 11), and advances the film one last time before jumping (paragraph 13). Each use escalates pressure: from passive object to divination tool to defense to final ritual. Setup, development, and closure gates all clear. The wheel's specific property—holding "ghosts trapped in its frames"—cannot be swapped for a generic relic. Cost linkage is strong: the blank final frame precipitates her leap. Swappability remains low; the mechanics of advancing film integrate causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions shape the dominant stake from paragraph 4: the younger Lira "wanted to be an architect of clouds, to build bridges," now she scavenges discarded things. The ghost with "crumpled blueprints" and the "skeletal remains of a bridge she'd never finished building" (paragraph 14) directly constrain the final leap—Lira jumps toward the unfinished structure, confronting the failure. The concept narrows options throughout: her collection of failures forecloses forward motion, forcing the surrender. Setup, development, and payoff gates clear. Irreplaceability is high; removing this premise breaks the ghost logic and the bridge image at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Chronologically confused appears early as a label: "at thirty-seven or possibly forty-three (time had frayed like the hem of her coat)." This trait enables the ghost-multiplicity conceit—if time is stable, past selves cannot coexist—but the cost of confusion is not dramatized in a discrete action. The trait shapes atmosphere and justifies the lagoon's time-blurred memory surface, but no single on-page choice hinges visibly on Lira's uncertainty. Setup and thematic development are present; specific choice constraint is implied rather than dramatized. Moderate irreplaceability; another time-distortion mechanism could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Regret saturates interiority and dialogue but is never named as the action itself; instead, it manifests through collecting fragments, confronting ghosts, and the final surrender. The ghost chorus accuses "You left me behind. You left us all," and Lira whispers "I know"—regret acknowledged drives the leap. The action is distributed across beats rather than a single event, which diffuses causal sharpness. Setup (early collection framed as burden), development (ghost confrontation), and closure (surrender as acceptance) all engage regret. Swappability is low for the emotional core but moderate for plot structure; another complex emotion could drive similar moves with rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled in paragraph 5: "she collected fragments of overheard stories the way others gathered shells. A merchant's boast about a lost city, a child's sob over a dropped kite, the hollow laugh of a woman who'd sold her shadow." However, these fragments do not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics—they accumulate as backstory atmosphere. The method appears at setup but does not participate in the ghost confrontation or the final leap decision; she uses the camera wheel instead. Missing development and closure gates cap the score. The method could be replaced with generic memory-hoarding without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is established early (paragraph 1: "kinetic lagoon," paragraph 6: "suspension of memory and mist that rippled only when the wind hit just right") and its properties shape key beats. Lira reads its dimples to locate her younger self's position, the lagoon births the ghost chorus, and at closure it doesn't ripple but "remembers," then catches her with hands pulling under. Setup, development, and closure gates clear. The lagoon's specific rule—memory-suspension that responds to wind and will—directly enables the ghost emergence and the final surrender. Irreplaceability is high; a generic body of water breaks the memory-physicality fusion.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the carousel halts" anchors the entire piece (paragraph 1: "stopped years ago") and Lira's present scavenging occurs in the stasis following collapse. The halt sets the story's existential pressure—nothing moves forward, only sideways into collected pasts. However, the timeframe does not create a ticking clock or tighten a discrete decision window; the carousel's stoppage is condition rather than countdown. Setup is strong, thematic pressure is present, but no middle beat or final choice hinges on time running out. The ending promise "until the carousel started again" reweights the halt conceptually but does not dramatize urgency. Moderate irreplaceability; another post-collapse frame could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Negotiation with one's own ghost is dramatized across the central confrontation (paragraphs 9–12): Lira speaks directly to the twenty-five-year-old ghost, who challenges her ("You think if you collect enough pieces, you can bargain your way back?"), and Lira counters with her true motive ("I'm here to make sure she doesn't follow me"). The ghost chorus forces acknowledgment ("You left us all"), and Lira's "I know" is the negotiation's climax—acceptance rather than bargaining. Setup (paragraph 4 hints at reckoning), development (ghost dialogue), and closure (surrender as final negotiation term) all clear. The motivation generates friction between evasion and confrontation with visible cost. Irreplaceability is strong; removing ghost-negotiation collapses the dramatic engine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fractured stillness is established in the opening image—carousel "frozen mid-gallop," wind "never ceased" yet nothing moves—and sustained through contradictions: motion without progress, voices overlapping yet the lagoon "stilled," the leap that is weightless yet purposeful. Tone modulates at the ghost emergence (active confrontation fractures the stillness) and again at the jump (kinetic release within stasis). The final paradox—"let the past have her, just for now"—charges the image with the tone's core tension: active surrender within frozen time. The tone is coherent across turns, specific to this piece's logic, and essential to the closure effect. Irreplaceability is very high; another tone would not support the carousel/memory-stasis fusion.</comment>
