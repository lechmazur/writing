<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias functions primarily as observer with minimal on-page motivation driving his choices until the final act. His numb arm serves as recurring embodied detail and the final decision to hand over the bolt shows contradictory impulses (safety vs. truth), but the interiority remains thin—he "understood" and "thought of" rather than wrestling with competing desires in scene. The pianist's sewn lips and burn scars are vivid, but his presence is largely symbolic; no genuine friction between the two characters emerges. The backstory about the "unpardonable silence" incident is told rather than dramatized, and Elias's twenty-year tenure as bellhop is asserted without showing how that history shapes his present stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear orientation (bellhop, cobalt fortress, third-floor landing) early. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring motifs (silence, cold, nerve regeneration) build toward the final hum and note. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Elias hands over the bolt and "stayed" as the first real note shakes the walls—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than legibly forfeiting a specific path or relationship on the page. The causality is thin: the bolt's function as "key to rebuilding" the piano is asserted late without prior clues, and the pianist's return and Elias's decision hinge on symbolic logic rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, sealed fifth-floor door, and the bolt itself are rendered with concrete, purposeful detail. The bolt's temperature shift (cold → warm, pulsing) and the banister's lightened wood grain anchor the investigation sequence. The nerve regeneration in Elias's arm recurs as a tactile micro-setting that charges his final choice ("where the pain was returning in flickers, like distant music"). However, spatial choreography on the fifth floor is vague—no clear distance between door and window, no account of how the pianist entered a wax-sealed room—and the moat reference (keys scattered into it) floats without spatial grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to restore the piano and break the fortress's enforced silence—emerges clearly. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias finds the cracked wax seal and chooses to enter, but the escalation is primarily atmospheric (vibration, sustained note, teacup shattering) rather than driven by protagonist agency. The cost of handing over the bolt is conceptual (the fortress "had never been safe") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture—guests will complain, but no specific relationship, position, or safety net is shown collapsing on the page. The pianist's presence and the bolt's sudden warmth function as coincidence that complicates rather than a causal chain Elias set in motion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fortress's history of silencing pain and the cost of enforced safety. The recurring images—nerve regeneration as returning pain/music, the sewn lips, the bolt as key—accumulate without overt thesis statements. The final image ("the fortress answered") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what was sacrificed for quiet. Minor slip: "seraphically mundane" appears twice as a phrase-label (cracked wax, guests' ignorance) without sufficient grounding in action, and "remaining was its own kind of sound" edges toward abstraction. The core insight—safety as chosen deafness—lands with clarity and cost tied to prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a lyric, compressed texture ("rusted from disuse," "frostbitten hope") that modulates with pressure. The pianist cannot speak, so no dialogue friction; Elias's single line ("You're not supposed to be here") is spare and apt. Minor register drift: "seraphically mundane" and "unpardonable silence" read as elevated authorial diction rather than Elias's lexicon, and the phrase "the color of a bruise just before it fades" is precise but slightly decorative in a peak beat. Perceptual signature is present but generic—touches, vibrations, cold—without idiosyncratic bias. No head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty (the bolt's warmth signals agency; snow as "notes on a broken scale"). Clarity is mostly strong, but several beats suffer from overwriting: "seraphically mundane in its imperfection, like a saint's halo drawn by a child's hand" stacks metaphor without propulsion, and "tuneless, frostbitten hope of a sound" mixes vehicles. Template cadence appears in the final third: "He thought of... He thought of..." and "The pianist turned... The pianist's eyes... The pianist began..." across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "the cost of safety had never been silence. It had been the choice to stay silent" restates the same content. No major causality breaks, so penalties remain in Q7. Filter verbs ("felt the vibration," "thought of") cluster but do not dominate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core premise—a bellhop encountering the exiled pianist who can rebuild the silence-unraveling instrument—offers a fresh angle on the cost-of-safety motif. Specific detail (piano bench bolt, nerve regeneration, sewn lips) anchors the concept in particulars rather than abstraction. The transformation test passes: swapping names and the fortress for another setting would require reimagining the silence motif and Elias's occupational perspective. Minor derivative echo: the "sound that unravels sound" and enforced silence after trauma recall familiar SFF tropes (e.g., cognitohazards, silencing curses), though the nerve-regeneration parallel and bellhop POV provide enough specificity to avoid cliché. The ending's quiet stance (Elias stays, the fortress answers) feels earned rather than convenient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (silent-choir bellhop) is present throughout and his final decision to hand over the bolt is the story's decisive act. He is seeded early (first paragraph), appears in development (traces the discoloration, enters the forbidden floor), and is active at closure (places the bolt, stays). However, his earlier moves are observational—he follows clues rather than making high-cost choices—and his occupation as bellhop does not visibly constrain or enable tactics. The "silent-choir" label is mentioned once without recurrence or demonstrated cost. Two-gate participation (development + closure) but limited causal pressure and specificity yield mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt is introduced early (third-floor landing, "half-buried in the carpet's nap"), handled in at least three beats (pocketed, warms in his pocket, handed to the pianist), and its function is revealed late as "the key to rebuilding" the piano. It drives the investigation sequence and enables the closure choice. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement. Deductions: swappability (a "key" or "component" could replace it with minor edits) and late functional reveal (the rebuilding claim appears only in the fifth-floor scene). Cost connection is conceptual rather than dramatized—no visible sacrifice tied specifically to the bolt's use. High development and closure participation elevate the score, but lack of irreplaceability and late mechanics cap it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "unpardonable silence" is mentioned as past event backstory (the sequence that "unraveled sound itself") and recurs as thematic label ("the cost of safety had never been silence"). It shapes the stakes conceptually—Elias must choose whether to allow the piano's return—but does not constrain on-page tactics or alter choices beyond the final handover. Present in setup (via exposition) and at closure (thematic reprise), but missing active development. The concept is told rather than dramatized: we never see or hear the silence's mechanics on the page. Functional but largely ornamental, yielding lower mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" appears twice: once describing the cracked wax seal and once labeling the guests' ignorance. Neither instance constrains an action or creates a visible tradeoff. The phrase functions as atmospheric descriptor without causal work—removing it would not alter any beat. Present in setup and referenced near closure, but purely ornamental. Label-only usage and no cost connection place it in the low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Remain" / "remaining" is seeded early ("the effort of remaining"), recurs in the pianist's stance, and is explicitly thematized ("remaining was its own kind of sound"). Elias's final act is to stay ("He stayed") rather than flee when the note shakes the walls, and this choice redefines the ending's meaning. Three-gate participation (setup, development, closure) and thematic charge. However, the action is somewhat abstract—"staying" could be replaced with "listening," "accepting," or "witnessing" without major structural changes—and the cost is atmospheric (guests will complain) rather than a legible forfeiture. Strong thematic integration but limited irreplaceability cap it at upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elias follows "the slightest discoloration" on the banister ("where the wood had lightened, just slightly, as if something had been dragged against it") to track the pianist's path. This method is signaled early, used once in the investigation beat, and does not recur or shape later attempts. Present in setup and development but absent from closure. The method is specific and visual but functionally replaceable—any trace (footprints, scent, sound) could serve the same purpose. Two-gate participation with minimal causal pressure yields mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress under snow is established early, recurs in sensory detail (turrets, halls, fifth-floor door, moat reference), and the snow's intensification charges the final beats ("snow began to fall harder," "snow slid from the eaves revealing the cobalt beneath"). The setting supplies the forbidden fifth floor as a spatial constraint and the wax-sealed door as a barrier Elias crosses. However, the fortress does not meaningfully alter tactics—Elias's path is linear (finds bolt, follows trace, opens door, hands it over)—and the micro-setting (his numb arm, the bolt's temperature) does more causal work than the macro location. Three-gate participation and closure linkage, but limited tactical constraint, place it in the 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The nerve regeneration timeframe is seeded early ("still numb," "doctors calling it a miracle") and recurs at closure ("where the nerves were still stitching themselves together"). It provides a thematic parallel (numbness returning to feeling as silence returns to sound) but does not create a ticking clock or tighten decisions—Elias's investigation and final choice proceed at the story's own pace without urgency imposed by the regeneration timeline. Present in setup and closure, absent from development. Lyric-resonance use without causal pressure yields lower-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To understand the cost of safety" is implicit in Elias's reflections ("safety was just a word for the things they'd chosen not to hear") and his final decision to enable the piano's return. The motivation is thematized at closure but not dramatized as conflicting desire earlier—Elias does not visibly wrestle between preserving safety and seeking truth until the handover moment. Present in development (reflection on guests' ignorance) and closure (handing over the bolt, deciding to "tell them the truth"), but the friction is told rather than embodied in contradictory on-page choices. Two-gate participation with conceptual rather than visceral conflict yields upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone blends cold, lyric resignation with emergent warmth: "frostbitten" images (snow, cobalt as bruise, tuneless hum) give way to "hope" (the pianist's hum, the fortress answering, pain as returning music). The tone modulates coherently through the investigation (cold, held-breath quiet) to the closure (vibration, the first real note). It charges the final image ("the fortress answered") without becoming saccharine or declarative. Minor slip: "seraphically mundane" and "rusted from disuse" occasionally edge toward decorative lyricism that slows momentum. Strong coherence and modulation under pressure with purposeful shift at closure place it in the 7s.</comment>
