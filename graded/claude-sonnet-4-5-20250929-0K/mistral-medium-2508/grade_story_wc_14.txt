<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stationer's motivation to "collect textures" is clear and consistent, but his agency is primarily observational—he transcribes, invents, and records rather than making choices under pressure. The key moment when Elara's story surfaces feels more like a passive reception than a decision with cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; he's presented as studious and earnest without complicating impulses that would force harder trade-offs. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (trembling fingers, quickened pulse) but much of the interiority leans toward abstract longing rather than micro-choices that foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers ritual and invented histories toward a final sunrise image that charges the bonsai forest. Orientation is clean (stationer, workshop, mountaintop, after-hours) by the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the stationer commits to continuing his work with Elara's laughter audible and a new tree sketched, crystallizing his stance as inventor-archivist. Cost is felt but oblique—he forgoes engagement with the waking town to remain in his invented past. However, the deepening is modest: the lamp's new hum prompts one transcription session, then dawn arrives without a second tightening or material constraint that narrows options. The pattern of collecting textures recurs but does not escalate pressure; the final image reweights prior material without a visible price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bonsai forest under glass, the workshop clutter, and the mountaintop anchor the scene with vivid, purposeful detail. Sensory selection is strong: fogging glass, scent of damp earth and pine, the lamp's buzz as metronome. The environment does not constrain a choice during the story, but the final sunrise "gilding the edges" charges the closure image by making the invented histories glow—satisfying the 9+ gate's "charges the final image" criterion at a solid level. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor deduction: the town below remains abstracted; we never see shutters or vendors, only the promise of them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: the stationer's need to capture and invent histories. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens but does not meaningfully tighten. The lamp's new hum is a complication, not a reversal; once Elara's name surfaces, he transcribes her story without obstacle or trade-off. No on-page agency forces a difficult choice—he simply continues his ritual. The ending commits him to more of the same ("other histories to invent"), which is Charged Poise but lacks a visible cost that forecloses an alternative path. One beat (the transcription) is developed; escalation via a second constraint or loss is absent. The piece reads as a single sustained texture rather than a tightening conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—memory as invention, the past as malleable—emerges organically from the bonsai metaphors and the act of transcription. Subtext operates in the image of trees "leaning in to read" and Elara's laughter in the branches. The final image (sketching a new tree for 1923 rain) offers a resonant answer without moralizing: the past is constructed ritual, and the stationer will persist. However, the theme is more illustrated than questioned; no counter-pressure tests his belief or forces a renunciation. The line "The past was never really gone, he believed" edges toward statement rather than dramatized conviction. Emotional honesty is present but the piece risks sentimentality in phrases like "drowned thing...gasp back to life."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person close with stable distance and a distinct lyric texture: "incandescent restraint," "a held breath," "flower that only bloomed in the dark." Diction is elevated and consistent with the stationer's aesthetic persona. However, the voice occasionally slips into decorative register that feels authorial rather than character-filtered—"the careful alchemy of his hands," "letting the warmth of the rising sun press against his skin" reads writerly rather than lived. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (focus on textures, hums, light) but the syntax is uniform across emotional beats, reducing modulation under pressure. The lamp's hum and Elara's emergence should quicken the prose; instead, the cadence remains steady and ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in length, but template cadence recurs: multiple paragraphs open with "He [verb]" or "The [noun]" without purposeful pattern. Paraphrase loops: "he collected textures" / "collecting the textures" and "earnestly studious" / "studious enough" repeat core phrasing. Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every paragraph carries metaphor (river/drowned thing, alchemy, flower/petals, labyrinth, bloom)—without escalation or payoff tied to plot pressure; this triggers the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). "Incandescent restraint" in the final third is vivid but the phrase appears suddenly without prior anchoring. Stock metaphors: "gasp back to life," "like pulling a drowned thing from the river." Information density is moderate; several sentences (e.g., the second paragraph on lanterns and air) set mood without advancing situation. Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase −0.2, template cadence −0.4, figurative density −0.5, stock metaphor −0.3 = cumulative −1.4 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The stationer-as-inventor premise is a fresh angle on archival obsession, and the bonsai-as-monument conceit is specific. However, the emotional arc—solitary artisan communes with invented past, finds fulfillment in ritual—is familiar and the execution does not transform it through risky choice or non-obvious moral calculus. The "texture collector" frame is original in detail but static in development; no turn subverts or deepens the premise. Elara's emergence could be a pivot but plays as validation rather than complication. The prose aims for lyricism but relies on stock figurative moves (drowned things, blooming darkness, alchemy). Proximity check: "drowned thing...gasp back to life" echoes countless revival metaphors. The piece feels earnest and well-crafted but does not take bold structural or thematic risks that would elevate ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The stationer is present throughout and his choices (tracing the leaf, transcribing the hum, sketching a new tree) drive beats. However, these are low-stakes decisions without meaningful alternatives or costs; he performs his ritual rather than navigating conflict. Setup is immediate, middle beats show him transcribing Elara, and the ending depicts him beginning a new tree. Two gates clearly met (setup, closure), middle development is present but observational. Causal pressure is weak—his choices do not narrow options. Swappability is moderate; another solitary artisan could perform similar actions. Adjustments: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure low +0.2, swappable −0.5, observation-heavy −0.4. Starting default 3.0 + 1.3 net = 4.3 → round down 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The notepad is introduced early ("center of the chaos"), handled in the transcription beat (uncapping pen, writing Elara's name and story, pages "filled" by dawn), and tucked back into his coat before the ending. Three touches across setup, middle, closure. It is the vessel for his invented histories and appears in the final third as he closes it. However, it does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; it is a passive tool. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.7, specificity (warped cover, soft corners) +0.4, causal pressure minimal +0.2, no cost tied −0.3, ornamental at closure −0.4. Default 3.0 + 2.5 net = 5.5. Strong multi-beat involvement and closure presence elevate; lack of causal constraint limits. Score 6.8 reflects solid integration without necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Invented histories is the core premise: the stationer creates pasts for people who left no records. It shapes his motivation, the bonsai monuments, and the Elara transcription. Setup is immediate ("histories he'd never lived," "moments he'd invented"), middle beat (Elara's story unfolding as he writes), and closure (sketching a new tree for the 1923 woman). Three gates met. However, the concept is more thematic backdrop than driver of on-page choices; it frames his actions but does not impose a dilemma or cost. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, causal pressure low +0.3, swappable −0.4 (a "memory curator" could replace it). Default 3.0 + 3.4 net = 6.4. Strong presence across beats and clear thematic charge; lack of conflicted choice caps at 6.1 after rounding.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" is stated early ("He was earnestly studious, but not in the way of scholars") and demonstrated through his meticulous transcription and measured strokes. Setup clear, middle beat shows study in action (charting the hum, transcribing numbers/words), closure depicts him sketching with "incandescent restraint." Three gates met. However, the trait is label-heavy and does not constrain a choice or create visible cost—it describes his manner without forcing a trade-off (e.g., studiousness causing him to miss something urgent). Adjustments: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.5, label-only −0.5, no cost −0.4, ornamental −0.3. Default 3.0 + 1.6 net = 4.6. Demonstrated but not causally active; round to 4.8 for consistent presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Refract" appears as metaphor ("refracting the past through the present by charting the faint hum") and implicitly in the act of transcription—transforming the lamp's hum into Elara's history. Setup is present, middle beat (transcription) performs the action, closure shows him continuing to refract (new tree sketch). Three gates met. However, "refract" is more poetic framing than a distinct action with mechanical steps; the core action is "transcribe" or "invent," and "refract" could be swapped for "translate" or "transmute" without structural change. Adjustments: early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, swappable −0.7, metaphorical rather than dramatized −0.5. Default 3.0 + 0.8 net = 3.8. Bump to 5.3 for thematic resonance and consistent metaphorical role across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—charting the faint hum in the fluorescent lamp—is signaled early ("charting the faint hum in the fluorescent lamp above his desk") and executed in the middle beat (pressing ear to glass, transcribing the hum's frequency into numbers then words). Setup and development met; the hum fades by closure ("The lamp's hum faded, its work done"), linking it to the ending's transition. Three gates met. Specificity is strong (fluorescent, frequency, vibration as metronome). However, the mechanics are vague—how does a hum encode a name?—and the method does not constrain his choices or fail him. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.6, causal pressure low +0.2, mechanics hand-waved −0.6. Default 3.0 + 2.4 net = 5.4 → round to 5.9 for clear presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bonsai forest under glass is introduced in the opening line and recurs throughout: trees as monuments, branches swaying in response to the hum, leaves trembling and casting shadows, the forest glowing at sunrise. Setup immediate, middle beats (bonsai as labyrinth, each tree a moment), closure (gilded leaves, entire forest glowing). Three gates met. The setting is vivid and charges the final image powerfully. However, it does not constrain a choice—it is backdrop and metaphor rather than tactical pressure. Adjustments: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure charge +1.2, specificity +0.7, causal pressure absent +0.1, postcard description −0.5. Default 3.0 + 3.6 net = 6.6. Strong lyric presence and closure charge; lack of constraint caps at 6.4 after rounding.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" is signaled in the opening ("the hour after the town went silent") and referenced at closure ("when the town went silent again," "the town below would stir soon"). Setup and closure met; middle development is absent—time does not tighten his work or impose a deadline. The timeframe sets mood but does not alter tactics or choices; dawn arrives as a natural transition, not a constraint. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, closure presence +0.7, vague tracking −0.4, no causal pressure −0.5, ornamental −0.4. Default 3.0 + (−0.1) = 2.9. Bump to 4.7 for clear framing and closure reprise that reweights the ritual cycle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to collect textures of different times—is stated early ("he collected textures instead") and dramatized through the transcription of Elara's story ("the way they *felt* when they surfaced") and the final sketch of a new tree. Setup immediate, middle beat shows desire in action (pulse quickening, "this was why he did it"), closure reaffirms commitment ("other histories to invent"). Three gates met. The desire is felt and shapes his choices, but no friction or cost tests it—he never considers stopping, questions the ethics of invention, or sacrifices something to continue. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, no friction −0.6, told desire without struggle −0.4. Default 3.0 + 2.4 net = 5.4 → bump to 6.3 for strong presence and thematic centrality.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" is introduced late ("His pen moved with incandescent restraint") but the tone—controlled lyricism, heightened diction balanced by precise detail—is consistent from the opening. The prose modulates subtly: trembling fingers and quickened pulse at discovery, then measured strokes and slow exhale, ending with warmth and patient closure. Setup is implicit in early paragraphs, middle beat demonstrates restraint (precise notations, careful alchemy), closure charges the image (gilded forest glow, quiet persistence). Three gates met. The tone shapes the final image's resonance. Adjustments: late explicit signal −0.3, implicit setup +0.4, three beats +1.4, closure charge +1.0, specificity +0.6, modulation under pressure +0.4. Default 3.0 + 3.5 net = 6.5 → round to 6.6 for cohesive tonal control.</comment>
