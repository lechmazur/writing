<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows contradictory impulses—curiosity vs. duty, listening vs. witnessing—that act simultaneously in scene. The trait "persistent curiosity" is labeled but not meaningfully embodied through micro-choices under pressure; it's told rather than dramatized in the atrium beats. The final moment where he "answers" the voice offers a stance shift, but the progression from kneeling recognition to resuming work feels more like emotional arithmetic than earned cost. Interiority occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("Curiosity had always been his undoing") without grounding in concrete embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~100 words; the atrium setting and Elias's role are clear. The piece follows a Hybrid lens—Causal in the tracking mechanics, Accumulative in the mist/photograph motifs—and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure: Elias shifts from chasing heartbeats to being led by them, answering the dead's call with the hearing aid flickering. Cost is legible (he kneels, the aid goes dead, he accepts a new mode of work) but the child's face being "his" introduces a late backstory element that isn't causally prepared, creating mild whiplash. The closure reweights his role and the photograph, satisfying the lens, though the reveal feels more asserted than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The atrium's glass dome, mist, stone, and bench are rendered with vivid sensory detail (scent of pennies, iron taste, silvered wood). The mist functions as both atmosphere and constraint—it "screams," thickens, and dissolves—actively shaping the scene's pressure and Elias's final encounter. The hearing aid and glove serve as micro-setting objects that charge the ending. However, the atrium's physical layout remains somewhat abstract; spatial choreography (where Elias moves, how far the bench is) is unclear, and the photograph's mechanics (how it "dissolves" the atrium) are unexplained.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding "her" before the mist does—is signaled early via the hearing aid's whisper. Pressure tightens when Elias touches the glove and the mist screams, forcing the encounter with the woman and child. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by Elias's agency; he follows the pulse passively until the glove touch triggers the vision. The final shift (from chasing to being led) reweights his role with felt cost (kneeling, dead aid, acceptance of a dual mission), but the vision itself is coincidental revelation rather than earned turn. One meaningful tightening is present, sufficient for this length under a Hybrid lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing, memory, the duty to the forgotten—emerges organically from the mist/photograph/hearing-aid motifs and Elias's occupation. The final image (answering the static, being led rather than chasing) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the gap between Elias's public role (mapping the living) and private compulsion (listening to the dead). However, the line "Some echoes weren't meant to stay buried" edges toward thematic statement, and the child's face being "his" introduces a symbolic convenience late without prior grounding, slightly weakening the earned quality of the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steadily; Elias's perceptual signature (listening closely, fragile heartbeats, static as message) is distinct and voice-motivated. Diction remains consistent ("pennies left on a corpse's eyes," "spider silk") with purposeful compression ("The dead didn't speak. They *lingered.*"). However, brief moments of expository interiority ("He wasn't a hero. He was a man who listened too closely") explain rather than dramatize, and the supervisors/ex framing feels like scaffolding. Italicized voice ("Find her before the mist does") is handled cleanly, and psychic distance shifts intentionally to match emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is controlled and mostly apt ("mist curled," "static hissed," "breath fogging the mic"). However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "He wasn't a hero" appears twice within close proximity, and "The dead didn't speak. They *lingered.*" / "They needed *witnesses.*" / "Some echoes weren't meant to stay buried" form a thematic churn that reiterates rather than advances. Minor template cadence in "He didn't know... He wasn't... He was..." clusters. The closure beat is clean, but mid-story scaffold ("Curiosity had always been his undoing—the trait his supervisors called...") slows momentum. Information density is generally high; propulsion holds through most beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—contact tracer for hearts receiving a signal from the dead via old hearing aid—offers a fresh synthesis of tech, grief, and memory. The mist-atrium-photograph triangle creates atmospheric specificity. However, the "forgotten woman in green dress whose child is revealed to be the protagonist's" follows a well-worn ghost-story template (lost mother/child reunion), and the turn relies on late symbolic convenience (the child's face suddenly visible and "his") rather than groundwork in Elias's established past. Emotional truth in the witnessing/listening theme is genuine, but the climactic reveal leans on archetype without transformation. One fresh inflection—the shift from chasing to being led—elevates slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character "contact tracer for hearts" frames Elias's job (mapping vulnerable heartbeats) early and returns at closure ("back to the work of listening—for the living, and now, for the dead"). His decision to follow the signal and answer the static at the end alters his mission scope. However, the role is more thematic accent than driver of key turns; the atrium encounter unfolds largely through atmospheric coincidence (mist, glove touch) rather than tracer skills constraining or enabling tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The photograph appears in paragraph ~6, is handled twice (Elias keeps it in his pocket, the child presses it into his palm), and returns with reweighted meaning (inscription "For when you forget" and the child's face now visible). It seeds the mystery and charges the closure. However, the photograph's mechanics (how touching it or being given it "dissolves" the atrium) are unexplained, and it does not constrain middle choices—Elias follows the hearing aid's pulse, not the photo's clues.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is gestured at in the framing ("He wasn't a hero. He was just a man who listened") and closure (answering the call, resuming vulnerable-mapping work with an expanded scope). However, the concept does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; Elias's encounter is more mystical revelation than heroic choice. The phrase "incidental" suggests accidental or low-key agency, which fits the passive tracking, but no moment dramatizes heroism arising from ordinary duty under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is labeled early ("Curiosity had always been his undoing") and motivates his choice to follow the signal into the atrium. However, the trait is told rather than shown through micro-choices; Elias adjusts the frequency and follows the pulse, but no on-page beat dramatizes curiosity creating a visible cost or forcing a trade-off. The trait enables the plot but does not constrain or complicate his tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Assure" (assuring the vulnerable that their voices matter) frames Elias's day job early and pivots at closure: he shifts from assuring the living to witnessing the dead. The action appears in exposition and the final lines ("back to the work of listening"), but the atrium sequence does not dramatize "assuring" under pressure—Elias listens and follows, he does not comfort or validate. The thematic reprise charges the ending, but the action itself is more backdrop than driver of turns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced in paragraph 2, its "faint pulse" and "frequency" guide Elias through the atrium, and it flickers at closure when he answers the voice. The method (tracking via decades-old aid) is signaled early, used in three beats (initial hum, frequency adjustment, final flicker), and its mechanics (frayed wires, warm as if still pressed to an ear) are specific. However, how the aid "tracks" or why it connects to this particular woman/child is unexplained; the device is more atmospheric conductor than rule-bound tool.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "mist-clad atrium at twilight" is established immediately, sensory details (glass dome, damp stone, pennies scent, iron taste) are vivid, and the mist actively pressures the scene (curling, thickening, screaming). The bench and glove are setting resources that trigger the vision. The atrium's twilight timing and mist supply the atmosphere for the encounter and charge the final dissolution. However, spatial layout is vague (distances, paths, atrium size), and the setting does not constrain Elias's tactical choices—he follows the pulse wherever it leads.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"When the dead call" frames the opening ("when the dead called") and recurs at closure ("a voice whispered his name. He answered"). The timeframe is more thematic marker than live clock; no urgency or countdown tightens decisions. The atrium visit reads as one continuous dusk encounter without time pressure altering tactics. The phrase signals the story's supernatural mode but does not function as a ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To protect vulnerable voices" is dramatized in Elias's job (tracing the city's vulnerable, flagging those at risk) and returns at closure (resuming the work "for the living, and now, for the dead"). The motivation drives his choice to follow the signal (a vulnerable voice from the past) and accept the expanded mission. However, friction between this desire and competing costs (risk, ex's disapproval, supervisors' skepticism) is told rather than felt in scene. The final acceptance feels more thematic echo than hard-won trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reeling hush"—a tone of disoriented quiet, stunned suspension—is sustained through mist imagery, faint whispers, shallow breath, and moments of silence (the world going silent, the aid stopping). Tone modulates with pressure: calm tracking → mist scream → kneeling stillness → resumption. The final image (adjusting the frequency, answering the whisper) crystallizes the hush as active listening rather than paralysis, charging closure. However, some beats ("His knees hit the stone") feel more theatrical than hushed, creating mild tonal friction.</comment>
