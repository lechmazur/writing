<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation to explore rather than flee is established early and embodied through tactile engagement with the compass rose and sketchbook. The contradiction between pariah status and observer role creates tension, and micro-choices (stepping onto the railing, tearing the page free) accumulate pressure. However, the final leap reads more as lyric surrender than a decision with visible internal conflict—the "let the current take her" formulation dilutes agency at the climax. The mother's whispered voice feels unmotivated by prior dramatization, landing as convenient external validation rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early through layered imagery (compass rose, sketch, anomaly) and builds density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "Home" shifts from place to direction. The Orientation Test is satisfied by paragraph two (who, where, when anchored). Cost is legible in Lira's physical leap and the station's emptiness afterward, fulfilling Charged Poise requirements. One minor causal slip: the anomaly's shift from external to internal ("wasn't out there—it was in here") occurs through assertion rather than dramatized discovery, creating a micro-gap in motivated progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observation deck as liminal space with thinned air, frost-bitten metal, and creaking infrastructure grounds the scene with sensory specificity. The compass rose and sketchbook function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice (aligning sketch with stars, touching the applique). The station's silence and groaning metal pressure Lira's final action. However, the time-dilation mechanism remains abstract—no concrete detail shows *how* the deck "could make time feel" stretched, limiting its tactical constraint until the final beat where Lira "stretches toward the light."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—turning confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightens through the anomaly's appearance and Lira's decision to leap. The compass needle's snap into place and the sketch's alignment create one meaningful reversal that narrows options. However, escalation feels more atmospheric than choice-driven: the light "envelops" Lira passively rather than her seizing it through tactical struggle. The cost (leaving the station, risking the void) is implied but not deeply felt on the page—no visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative that tests commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the compass rose/true north motif and the family custom reinterpreted as "not a map of the sky, but a key." The final reweighting—"Home" as direction rather than place—arises from concrete action (aligning the sketch) without overt moralizing. The mother's voice and "You were always the one who looked closest" borders on sentimental assertion but remains tethered to the observational stakes. The ending image (compass rose still pointing, new anniversary beginning) offers resonant ambiguity that invites reflection without resolving into tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: Lira's attention filters through observer training (charcoal smudges, constellation labels) and tactile engagement (tracing the applique, breath fogging glass). Diction stays consistent—"blessed pariah," "true north," "echoed silence"—without register drift. One minor slip: "temporally stretched, just like the stories said" briefly exits Lira's immediate perception into meta-commentary. The final sequence maintains compression under stress ("didn't wait," "pushed off") with rhythmic control that supports urgency without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (stars "unwinding into threads," light "like a bloom in reverse") enriches without overwhelming. However, several scaffold patterns accumulate: "She [verb]" openers cluster in the middle third, and near-paraphrase loops appear ("the silence so deep it echoed" / "echoed silence swallowed her"). The phrase "not burning, but revealing" and similar corrective constructions recur enough to become template-like. Information density is high in peak beats (compass needle snapping, sketch alignment), but the final paragraph's stacked abstractions ("fold between then and now," "shape of the custom") dilute propulsion at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of time dilation, family ritual, and navigation metaphor feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven. The reinterpretation of "Home" as direction and the sketch-as-key concept offer fresh inflection on station-abandonment premises. However, the core emotional arc—lone survivor finds transcendence through mysterious anomaly—follows a well-worn SFF template without sufficient lived-detail transformation. The risk of the leap and the lyric ending heighten stakes, but the anomaly's mechanics remain abstract enough that the resolution could apply to many similar setups with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira as "blessed pariah" is established early and her observer role drives the decision to stay, sketch the anomaly, and ultimately leap. This status enables the plot (she's the only one present) and shapes two key choices: continuing to sketch against custom and stepping onto the railing. However, the "blessed" modifier remains label-only—no dramatized cost or social friction shows why she's blessed versus merely outcast. The pariah dimension constrains her solitude but doesn't create visible internal conflict or tactical friction at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The compass rose applique appears in three distinct beats: opening tactile grounding (fingers tracing), warming as the anomaly arrives, and final static image pointing "the way she'd gone." It functions as both heirloom anchor and navigational tool—its needle snapping into place drives the key reversal. The element is irreplaceable: its gilded, inherited status and directional function interlock with theme. Minor limitation: the warming is asserted rather than causally explained, and the final reprise is descriptive rather than causally active in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"True north" is seeded early ("still believed in true north even after the beacons died") and questioned ("if true north had ever been more than a lie"). The compass needle pointing "not north, but *through*" creates the central turn. However, the concept operates primarily as thematic framing rather than tactical constraint—Lira's choices aren't visibly altered by competing directional options. The shift to "direction" versus "place" reweights meaning at closure but remains metaphorical; no on-page price is paid for abandoning literal true north.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" appears as descriptor ("the stars beyond seemed to stretch, warp—temporally stretched, just like the stories said") and in the leap ("her body stretching toward the light like time itself had decided to bend"). The attribute enables the anomaly's logic and the final transcendence. However, it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint: Lira experiences temporal effects passively rather than navigating trade-offs or costs tied to dilation. No on-page action shows her using or resisting the stretch—it's a feature of the setting she moves through, not a trait that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Glimpse" drives the inciting incident ("she saw it—a flicker, a glimpse of light") and the anomaly itself is described as revealing glimpses of past/future braids. The action redefines Lira's stance from passive waiting to active exploration. The glimpse is irreplaceable: removing it would collapse the plot trigger. It also seeds the closure where Lira "glimpsed the shape of the custom." Strong causal linkage and thematic charge, but the second usage is more metaphorical echo than distinct beat—the verb does similar work both times.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries is introduced early with heirloom weight ("her mother's, then her grandmother's") and constrains Lira's mid-scene choice: "The custom had always been to sketch what was there, not what you hoped to see, but Lira's hand moved on its own." This tension—breaking custom to map the anomaly—creates a meaningful turn. The custom's reinterpretation as "not a map of the sky, but a key" charges the closure. However, the mechanics (why anniversaries, what the sketches unlock) remain abstract, limiting tactical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observation deck with thinned air, curved glass, and suspended wreckage is established in the opening line and remains spatially coherent throughout. It supplies the glass surface for sketch alignment, the railing Lira balances on, and the void she leaps toward—three tactical beats. The time-dilation property is signaled ("this place could make time feel") and paid off when "time itself had decided to bend." The deck's emptiness after Lira's departure charges the final image. Minor gap: the dilation mechanism remains asserted rather than shown through earlier constrained action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" is anchored early ("no one had celebrated one since the shutdown," "when the others fled") and establishes the station's abandonment as ongoing condition. The timeframe creates Lira's isolation (stakes) and the anomaly's significance (first event in years). However, it functions as static backdrop rather than ticking clock—no urgency presses decisions, and the shutdown's duration isn't leveraged to tighten tactics. The ending references "since the shutdown" again, but the timeframe doesn't narrow options or escalate cost at closure. Present, functional, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to "turn confusion into exploration" is dramatized through Lira's response to the anomaly: pulse quickening, hand moving to sketch, stepping closer, and ultimately leaping. The desire directly drives the plot's key reversal (choosing to engage rather than observe passively). Internal friction appears when Lira questions the custom and wonders if true north was a lie, yet still acts. The cost—leaving the station, risking dissolution in the anomaly—is felt at closure. Strong causal link and visible in peak choices, though the framing sometimes edges toward label ("felt the old pull").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is established early ("the silence so deep it echoed, not with sound, but with the absence of the station's old machinery") and modulates purposefully: the single chime "soft and hollow, like a bell tolling underwater," Lira's laugh "lost in the stretch of time," and the final image of the "empty but no longer abandoned" deck. Tone coheres through restraint and charged stillness, supporting the accumulative lens. It charges the final image by transforming emptiness into presence ("a new anniversary began"). Highly integrated across beats and thematically resonant at closure.</comment>
