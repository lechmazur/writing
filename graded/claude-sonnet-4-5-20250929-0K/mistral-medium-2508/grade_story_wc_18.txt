<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker's interiority leans heavily on metaphor and atmospheric description rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The brother relationship is told through reflection ("had been his brother once") without on-page friction or a dramatized cost that tests commitment. The protagonist's final choice to "let go" arrives as summary assertion rather than a decision forced by prior causality with visible trade-off. Internal voice remains coherent but the peak moment lacks the embodied struggle required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric patterning: fog, mirrors, sextant, and light accumulate toward a final image of stars and threshold-crossing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first 120 words. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the mirror maker steps through a boundary that previously constrained him, and the final image reweights the orchard, mirrors, and sky motifs with undeniable pressure. However, the cost is asserted ("let the last boundary fade") rather than demonstrated through a specific forfeiture or action that narrows options on the page, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ruined orchard, fog, frost, and twilight are vividly rendered and filtered through the protagonist's perception. The sextant functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged at closure when it dissolves and the mirror becomes "smooth as still water." The orchard's transformation (skeletal branches to constellation shapes to light-bearing fruit) constrains the protagonist's final move and charges the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate criteria. Minor deduction for the workshop's mirrors ("refused to reflect anything but fog") being told rather than shown altering a present choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping memory and achieving reunion with the lost brother—is signaled early. The sextant's repair through synchronized breathing constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, and the orchard's transformation tightens pressure by making the abstract concrete. However, escalation relies on accumulation of atmosphere rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The protagonist's agency at closure is passive ("let the fog take him") rather than a decision that tests competing goods or unavoidable harms, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—boundaries, memory, grounding versus flight—emerges organically from the sextant's repair, the fog's erasure, and the mirror's final state. The brother's voice ("grounding is just another kind of flight") offers subtext without moralizing. The final image (stepping through sky as door, stars as "old dream finally caught") reweights prior material with resonance and avoids explicit statement. The piece invites reflection through particulars (frost-to-light, mirror-to-window) and maintains complexity. Minor penalty for the phrase "boundaries were the problem, then erasure was the answer," which edges toward thematic summary rather than remaining implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (tracing, pressing, breathing, exhaling). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the peak beat ("let the fog take him"). The prose texture is consistent with lyric compression and metaphor-heavy diction appropriate to the mirror maker's craft. However, elevated register ("careless hand," "runaway kite," "second skin") occasionally drifts from the artisan's grounded idiom without clear voice motivation. Filter verbs ("felt the faintest hum," "seemed to hold its breath") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy and preventing access to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. The piece demonstrates high information density and purposeful compression in service of lyric patterning. However, metaphor density in nearly every sentence of the climax ("fog thickened, pressing in like a second skin," "weight shifting from brass to something more fluid, more alive," "dissolve into his palms like frost under sunlight") without clear pattern-teaching triggers the overwriting penalty (−0.5). Minor paraphrase loop: "The mirror's surface rippled" followed immediately by "His brother's voice emerged from the glass" restates the mirror's activation without advancing pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening third ("He had come," "He exhaled," "He breathed") shows repetitive stems but does not pervade (−0.3). Total artifact debt −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror-making craft, celestial navigation, and fog-as-boundary offers a specific angle on grief and reunion. The sextant repair through synchronized breathing and the orchard's transformation into light-bearing fruit demonstrate fresh inflection. However, the core arc—artisan seeks lost brother, transcends through craft and memory—follows familiar template beats (estrangement, relic, mystical dissolution, threshold crossing) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The final image (stepping through sky-as-door, welcomed by stars) echoes widespread lyric closure patterns. The piece commits fully to its premise but the emotional journey and resolution remain within well-worn grooves, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker is present throughout and his actions (tracing the sextant, breathing in rhythm, reaching for the star-fruit, walking to the workshop, stepping through) anchor the narrative. However, these are largely passive or receptive gestures; the fog and sextant act upon him more than he acts upon them. No on-page choice creates a key turn—the climax is a letting-go rather than a decision that narrows options. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but swappable with another passive seeker archetype. Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sextant appears in the opening beat (tracing, pressing to palm, feeling its hum), the middle beat (trembling, melting frost, bending back to form, angling over the mirror to reveal the past image), and the climax (growing lighter, dissolving into palms). Its broken state and gradual repair shape the protagonist's method and the orchard's transformation. The sextant's properties (brass frame, warped angles, hum) are specific and its dissolution charges the closure. Essential across three beats and the ending, but the final "dissolve" is told rather than shown altering a live choice, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Boundary-erasure is named explicitly ("If boundaries were the problem, then erasure was the answer") and demonstrated through the fog's pressure, the mirror's shift from reflective to transparent, and the workshop walls becoming windows. The concept shapes the protagonist's tactic (synchronized breathing to blur self/other) and the closure image (stepping through the sky-as-door). However, the concept is more thematic claim than on-page constraint—it does not narrow live options or force a trade-off with visible cost. Present in setup (fog blurs district), middle (breathing blurs boundaries), and ending (stepping through), but its mechanics remain abstract. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not demonstrate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" is implied through the brother's accusation ("You were always too grounded") and the protagonist's half-mile walk back to the workshop, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait functions as thematic contrast rather than a lever that alters tactics or choices. Label-only mention; ornamental use. Present in setup (implied by mirror-making craft and the brother's flight) and ending (paradoxically, grounding becomes "another kind of flight"), but swappable with any artisan/dreamer binary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Recreate" drives the protagonist's middle action (repairing the sextant through rhythm and breath, reshaping the fog into something tangible, bending the metal back to form) and the orchard's transformation (branches weaving into constellations, trees bearing light-fruit). The action is signaled early ("began the work of recreation—not with tools, but with rhythm") and shapes two beats. However, the mechanics remain vague (synchronized breathing, pressure of will) and the final threshold-crossing does not clearly trace to "recreate"—it reads more as surrender/acceptance. Present in setup (method announced), middle (sextant and orchard transformed), but the closure pivots to "letting go" rather than active recreation, reducing causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Synchronized breathing is introduced explicitly in the middle beat ("The method had come to him in a half-dream: synchronized breathing, his inhales matching the imagined pulse of his brother's lost heart, his exhales shaping the fog into something tangible") and used once to repair the sextant and transform the orchard. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter—breath shapes fog, melts frost, bends metal—but it does not constrain further attempts or generate friction. Present in middle and linked to closure (the protagonist "breathed deeper" before the sextant dissolves), but single-use and swappable with any mystical craft-based method. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district supplies the sextant (found object), the frost and fog that pressure the protagonist's perception, and the transforming trees that charge the closure (skeletal to constellation-shaped to light-bearing). The fog's thickness ("thick enough to muffle even memory") motivates the protagonist's presence and the final lifting of fog shows the path home. The orchard's transformation alters the protagonist's final move (reaching for a star-fruit that "remembered"). Present in setup (ruined orchard, fog, twilight frost), middle (orchard holds breath, branches reshape), and ending (trees bear light-fruit, fog lifts). The setting constrains perception and supplies the closure image, but the protagonist could pursue the same arc in another liminal space with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Twilight and frost are established in the opening sentence and persist as atmospheric markers ("twilight's pale shimmer," "twilight's glow"), but they do not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics. The timeframe functions as mood rather than constraint. No indication that the protagonist must act before twilight ends or that frost's melting creates urgency. Present in setup and ending, but ornamental; swappable with any liminal time-of-day without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Capture a runaway dream" is dramatized through the protagonist's pursuit of his brother ("the man's obsession with mapping the heavens had pulled him into the sky like a runaway kite") and the final closure ("the stars welcomed him like an old dream, finally caught"). The motivation is signaled early, drives the protagonist's presence in the orchard and his recreation work, and shapes the ending image. However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—the protagonist does not weigh competing costs or face friction between wanting reunion and fearing it. Told rather than tested through choice. Present in setup (brother's flight, protagonist's escape from memory), middle (recreation as pursuit), and ending (dream caught), but the lack of on-page trade-off or dramatized friction keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Glass mountains" as tone reads in the piece's brittle, crystalline imagery: frost "like shattered glass," trees "skeletal," mirrors that refuse reflection, the sextant's cold brass, the fog as "second skin," and the final stars as "fragile." The tone is coherent and lyric, modulating from cold stasis (opening) to fluid transformation (middle) to luminous threshold (ending). The glass/mirror/frost motif charges the final image (mirror "smooth as still water," workshop walls becoming windows). However, the tone is consistently elevated and metaphor-dense throughout, with limited modulation under peak pressure—the prose does not compress or sharpen when the protagonist steps through, maintaining the same lyric register. Present across all beats and contributes to closure resonance, but static mood rather than dynamic tonal escalation.</comment>
