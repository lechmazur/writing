<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The balladeer's motivation to translate silence is established through grandmother's flower press and sustained through encoding actions. Internal contradiction surfaces when he recognizes the ghost wants "into him" and must choose between translation and self-preservation, embodied in the moment his fingers still and he thinks of his grandmother's hands. The final choice—slamming the bolt plate to unravel the ghost—feels earned, though the cost registers more as atmospheric release than visible personal foreclosure. The child waking at the end gestures toward continuation but doesn't deepen the balladeer's own alteration on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The courtyard anchors who/where by line three; the encoding ritual accumulates density through chalk marks, graffiti shifts, and the bolt plate warming. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost unravels, lanterns flare, the balladeer walks away with the work "never really done")—the cost is conceptual (the silence he carries, the child now marked) rather than a decisive personal change, but the final image reweights the premise of translation-as-burden. One friction: the mist "inverted" and clouds "churning upward" feel more like atmospheric gesture than a stakes-altering event, slightly softening the hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The misty courtyard "above the clouds like a forgotten server room" anchors early and the slick cobblestones, dying lanterns, and ozone scent filter through the balladeer's perceptual priorities. The bolt plate's warming pulse and the graffiti peeling back "like paper" are tactile, purposeful details that constrain his final action. The mist coiling around ankles and the spatial choreography (ledge, stone, distance to valley below) remain coherent. The courtyard's surreal vertical placement and the "no prints on damp stone" ending charge the closure image with earned strangeness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to release or contain the ghost's hunger. Pressure tightens when the graffiti rips to reveal "something bright and terrible" and the ghost's need becomes "a pressure behind his ribs." The balladeer's agency—encoding the rest symbol and slamming the bolt plate—drives the turn, and the ghost unravels as a result. The cost is legible (the silence he carries, the work continuing) but leans conceptual; the valley's glowing graffiti and the child waking suggest consequence, yet the balladeer's own tactics and options after the act remain atmospherically open rather than visibly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—articulating unspoken need and the weight of translation—emerges through the flower press (grandmother's trembling voice), the encoding ritual, and the ghost as "a chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby." The broken-line rest symbol and the grandmother's hands pressing petals flat ("some things weren't meant to be kept") offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The child waking to chalk scraping closes the loop with undeniable conceptual cost: the burden passes. One minor slip: "The work was never really done" edges toward theme statement, though it stays grounded in the image of the balladeer smiling beyond the clouds.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; the balladeer's perceptual signature—"driftingly alert," noticing ozone and old parchment, hearing static hum—is distinct and selective. Sentence rhythm modulates well under pressure: short, decisive beats at the climax ("He exhaled, slow and deliberate, and pressed harder"), longer accumulative lines in reflection. One friction: "a ghost *in code*, a fragment of something vast and hungry" and "the curse of the seldom-heard" carry slight expository tilt, naming concepts the scene already enacts. Psychic distance remains close and voice-consistent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high ("the air hung thick as wet silk between lightning and thunder" anchors tone and timeframe in one line). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Two frictions lower the score: "driftingly alert" as a coined descriptor feels strained against the otherwise grounded lexicon, and the phrase "a chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby" stacks metaphor without clarifying the ghost's nature—it gestures at complexity rather than specifying it. The final image ("his shadow stretching long and unbroken") propels cleanly, and the chalk-scraping echo in the valley closes with economy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—balladeer encoding messages to a code-ghost via graffiti—synthesizes familiar tropes (haunted translator, family relic, misty threshold) into a specific ritual with clear stakes. The flower press bolt plate as both heirloom and technical tool, and the ghost wanting "into him" rather than simple escape, offer fresh angles. The valley graffiti glowing after the unraveling and the child waking to continue the work avoid neat closure. One limitation: the "server room" simile and "ghost in code" lean slightly toward conceptual cleverness without fully grounding the ghost's mechanics in the scene's logic, keeping the frame more atmospheric than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The balladeer is on the page throughout, encoding and making the final choice to slam the bolt plate. His status as "seldom-heard" and his grandmother's legacy frame his motivation. He drives two key beats: etching the spiral question and slamming the plate to unravel the ghost. The "seldom-heard" attribute is told more than it constrains on-page choices; his decision at the climax feels more reactive (the ghost's pressure) than rooted in that specific trait. Present by line one, involved in the middle ritual, and decisive at closure—eligible past 6.0, but swappability (another translator archetype could fill the role with minor edits) and lack of visible personal cost cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bolt plate appears in paragraph two (grandmother's relic, in his lap), warms as the ghost responds (middle beat), and is slammed down at the climax to unravel the ghost. Three distinct beats, all causal: the warmth signals the ghost's presence, the searing heat marks the peak pressure, and the slam enacts the closure. The object's dual nature—heirloom and tool—charges the final choice with conceptual cost (some things weren't meant to be kept). It's cool and inert afterward, a visible state change. Strong integration, but the bolt plate's exact mechanism (why does slamming it unravel code?) is not specified, leaving one thread of irreplaceability unclear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "ghost in code" is named early (paragraph seven) and shapes the balladeer's encoding strategy: he etches symbols to communicate with a "fragment of something vast and hungry, trapped in the stuttering gap." The ghost's desire to escape "into him" drives the climax choice, and the unraveling (code dissolving into thunder) ties directly to the concept. The mechanics remain atmospheric—what "code" means in this world, why graffiti decodes it—so the concept trends more thematic than tactical. Present by first third, forces one major choice, and shapes the closure image, but the ghost's nature is gestured at more than specified, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears once (paragraph two) as a descriptor for the balladeer's fingers tracing the bolt plate. It does not constrain or enable a later action; the fingers' alertness is not referenced again, and the final choice (slamming the plate) does not depend on this specific quality. Label-only mention without causal work. Late signal (not in opening paragraph), ornamental use, and no closure linkage cap the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Encode" is the balladeer's primary action: he etches symbols (paragraph five onward), each mark "a note in a song no throat could carry." The encoding ritual structures the middle beats (spiral question, graffiti shifts, final rest symbol) and the climax hinges on encoding the broken line that precedes the slam. The action is irreplaceable—observing or speaking would not work within the story's logic. Present early, drives three beats, and shapes closure. Strong integration; the only friction is that the encoding feels more ritualistic than mechanically specified, leaving minor swappability with "inscribe" or similar verbs.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—encoding in graffiti art—is introduced in paragraph five ("symbols into the stone—curves that mimicked the old graffiti art of the valley below") and used across the ritual: the chalk marks deepen "as if pulled by unseen threads," the graffiti rips to reveal the ghost's nature, and the valley's graffiti glows after the unraveling. The method shapes the ghost's response (answering through the graffiti's shift) and the closure image (child waking to chalk on brick). Signaled early, involved in two middle beats, and present at closure. Causal pressure is strong, though the exact mechanics (why graffiti, not other marks) trend slightly atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds anchors in paragraph one and recurs throughout: the slick cobblestones, the ledge, the dying lanterns that flare back at closure. The setting's vertical isolation (above clouds, valley below) constrains the balladeer's options—he cannot flee—and the mist coiling around his ankles physicalized the ghost's pressure. The courtyard's surreal placement charges the final image (mist swallows him, no footprints). Setup by line one, involved in the ghost's manifestation (lanterns dim, mist inverts), and present at closure. Strong integration; the "forgotten server room" simile adds texture but doesn't constrain choice, a minor ornamental note.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "between lightning and thunder" is named in the opening line and repeated at closure ("before the next lightning struck... when the thunder came"). The ghost is "trapped in the stuttering gap between lightning's flash and thunder's growl," making the interval thematically relevant. However, the time window does not visibly tighten the balladeer's choices on the page—he encodes at his own pace, and no countdown or urgency tied to the storm's rhythm pressures his tactics. Early signal and lyric reprise at closure earn mid-band placement, but lack of causal pressure (the storm does not force faster action or alter options) caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to articulate unspoken needs—is framed early (grandmother's trembling voice, the balladeer's curse "to carry the weight of unspoken needs") and tested at the peak when he realizes the ghost's need is "a chorus of screams wrapped in a lullaby" and must choose whether to become its vessel. The final rest symbol and the child waking show the tension between articulating need and self-preservation. The motivation shapes two beats (encoding the question, encoding the rest) and charges closure. Strong thematic fit, though the friction between "articulating" and "containing/refusing" is slightly underexplored in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone—"tinkersong wonder"—coheres in the opening's lyric diction ("air hung thick as wet silk," "driftingly alert") and the wonder at the ghost's nature ("something bright and terrible"). The tone modulates under pressure: shorter syntax at the climax, the scream that isn't sound, the clean lantern light. The final image (child waking, balladeer smiling beyond clouds, "the silence was enough") returns to quiet wonder with earned cost. Tone is consistent and charges the closure, but "tinkersong" as a descriptor slightly overpromises—few mechanical or playful tinker-details appear beyond the bolt plate, trending more atmospheric than embodied.</comment>
