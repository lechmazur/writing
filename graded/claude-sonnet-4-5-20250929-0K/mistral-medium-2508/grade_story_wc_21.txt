<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias shows embodied emotion ("pulse hammered in his throat") and his archivist background motivates his decipherment work, but internal contradiction is thin—he moves from hesitation to wading into the lagoon without visible cost or foreclosed options on the page. The visions function as received exposition rather than choices under pressure. Liora exists only as memory-echo; no second character applies live pressure to test Elias's commitment. The final smile and "work wasn't over" deflates cost with reassurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (zeppelin, Elias, obsidian lagoon). The story accumulates pressure through diary fragments and visions, then offers a parley-via-shells reversal and a symbolic release of pages into the lagoon. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the past released, weight lifted), but the cost is asserted metaphorically ("lighter now") rather than shown as a specific forfeited option or price. The officers retreat without dramatized consequence, and Elias begins "a new ledger" with no visible obstacle, softening the before/after legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The zeppelin library, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (brass hull groaning, salt-stung air, ozone scent). The skiff descent and lagoon's edge—littered with locket, shoe, ribbon—ground Elias's choices in tactile particulars. The lagoon's surface ripples with "a hundred hands reaching up," charging the final image. Spatial choreography (zeppelin → skiff → lagoon shallows → return) tracks cleanly. The obsidian lagoon constrains the parley and provides the medium for release, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: uncovering Liora's buried truth versus the Revision Board's erasure. The parley-via-shells is a meaningful tightening that narrows options, and the officers' retreat raises the question of release. Yet the escalation is driven by coincidence (officers appear, then leave) rather than Elias's agency; he waits and arranges shells, but their retreat is unexplained, undercutting earned closure. The final act—releasing diary pages—feels symbolic rather than a costly trade-off, and no live consequence is shown for the choice to "set free" versus archive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—truths released versus preserved, memory as current not chain—emerges through the diary, beach-debris messages, and the lagoon's transformative medium. The ending image of pages dissolving and the zeppelin "lighter now" offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("truth could rest") and Liora's whispered "Thank you" risks sentimentality. The subtext in Elias's silent parley and the officers' retreat works well, but the closing smile and reassurance ("work wasn't over") soften ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (archivist's precision, "cataloging the silences") is distinctive. Diction modulates purposefully under pressure (short clauses during the standoff). The officers' sparse dialogue ("trespassing on restricted memory") carries subtext, and Elias's cryptic reply ("it wants you") advances the beat. Filter verbs ("realized," "saw") are voice-motivated and legible. Minor slip: "floating library was supposed to be neutral ground" tells the premise rather than embodying it in a micro-choice or reflection anchored to present stimulus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well across beats; sensory specificity (brass hull, salt-stung air, ozone) is concrete. Information density is high in the opening third. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "wasn't just reading—he was *there*" followed immediately by "trapped in the echo of her memories" restates immersion without new pressure. The phrase "retroactive fever dream" and "echo of her memories" blur into synonym churn. The closure paragraph stacks filter verbs and summary ("felt like a current," "weight…lifted") where a single charged image would sharpen impact. Template cadence in mid-story beats (He descended… He knelt… He saw…) slightly dulls momentum. No artifacts touch the final image directly, but cumulative patterns lower the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The zeppelin library and retrocognitive visions offer a fresh genre synthesis, and the beach-debris cipher is a specific detail. Yet the core frame—archivist confronts authoritarian erasure agency over contested memory—hews closely to familiar dystopian templates without deep transformation. The officers arrive and retreat via unstated logic, and the emotional arc (burden → release → peace) follows a predictable trajectory. The obsidian lagoon and Liora's spiral messages add textural novelty, but the stakes and resolution do not surprise in hindsight. Derivative premise adjustment applies (−0.7 within Q8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his archivist background primes the decipherment premise. He makes two key choices: arranging shells to parley and releasing the diary pages. However, both are reactive—prompted by the officers' arrival and the lagoon's symbolic invitation—rather than proactive decisions that narrow his options with visible cost. The diary visions happen *to* him; he is medium more than agent. Setup and payoff gates are met, but causal pressure and cost connection are weak. Mid-band functional use.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in three distinct beats: opening observation, descent to its edge with artifacts, and final dissolution of diary pages. It functions as both destination and transformative medium, constraining the parley location and enabling the symbolic release. The surface "ripples—not with water, but with the reflection of a hundred hands" charges the officers' retreat and the closure image. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met; causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Specificity high (obsidian, light-swallowing surface). Cost connection present but somewhat abstract (metaphorical weight lifted). All three gates plus strong closure linkage justify high score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is introduced early and drives Elias's decipherment work; its code "unspooled in Elias's mind like a retroactive fever dream." It reappears in the middle (spread on desk, margins with coordinates) and at closure (pages released into lagoon). Setup and payoff gates met. However, the encryption itself does not constrain a tactical choice or create friction—Elias decodes it successfully off-page. The diary's content (Liora's messages) matters more than its encrypted nature. Development gate is weak; the encryption is more premise flavor than on-page pressure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's retrocognitive visions ("trapped in the echo of her memories") enable him to experience Liora's past when touching the pages. This trait appears in two beats: initial contact and the lagoon-edge vision. However, the visions function as delivered exposition rather than a double-edged ability with cost. No tradeoff is shown—no disorientation that hampers present action, no choice between past immersion and present safety. The attribute is narratively convenient without visible constraint. Setup and payoff present but development (cost/constraint in a middle choice) missing; cap at 4.6 per missing-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The parley via shell-arrangement is the story's central tactical turn: Elias chooses negotiation over flight, arranges debris in Liora's code, and the lagoon's surface ripples, prompting the officers' retreat. This action is signaled in the diary ("arranging beach debris as messages") and executed on-page with specificity. Setup, development (choice under pressure), and payoff all present. However, the officers' response is unexplained—why does the ripple deter them?—which reduces causal clarity. The parley is essential but its mechanism and consequence remain opaque, capping impact. Strong presence across beats but swappability concern (a different symbolic gesture might work) and unexplained outcome prevent top band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method—arranging beach debris as messages—is seeded in Liora's diary ("shells arranged in spirals, driftwood carved with notches") and executed by Elias at the lagoon ("crescent of stones, line of broken glass pointing north"). It appears in two beats: Liora's historical practice and Elias's parley. Setup and development gates met. The method enables the parley turn and is causally tied to the officers' retreat. However, the mechanics remain vague—what message does the crescent convey? why is it persuasive?—and the method does not reappear in the closure (diary release is passive dissolution). Functional across two beats but replaceable with another symbolic code. Closure participation weak; cap influenced by that gap.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating zeppelin library is introduced in the opening line and bookends the story (Elias returns, lights a lamp, begins a new ledger). It provides atmospheric specificity ("brass hull groaning") and thematic resonance ("neutral ground" as a lie). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The skiff descent and lagoon action occur *away* from the zeppelin; the library is observation post and refuge, not pressure point. Setup and payoff present but development (middle constraint or resource) absent; cap at 4.6. Lyric reprise and thematic color lift it slightly within that band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Timeframe anchors after the waterlogged crate's arrival ("thirty years as archivist" establishes backstory; "descended in the skiff at dawn" marks present action). The story unfolds over one day (dawn descent, standoff, return by evening/night when lamp is lit). However, time does not tighten decisions—no deadline pressures Elias, and the officers' arrival is coincidental rather than time-driven. The "after the letters are found" frame is honored in setup and structure but does not create escalation. Setup and implicit structure present; development (time pressure on a choice) weak. Functional framing without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elias's drive to uncover Liora's buried truth is declared early ("the letters had found *him*") and motivates his decipherment, descent, and parley. The tension between uncovering and the Revision Board's erasure is legible. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices—Elias moves smoothly from discovery to descent to release without visible internal friction (e.g., archivist's duty to preserve versus impulse to free). The final choice to release the pages could have been weighted against his professional identity; instead, it reads as thematic inevitability. Setup, development (descent as goal-pursuit), and payoff present, but cost/friction weak. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone—"searing reverie"—is established in the opening's poetic diction ("wound in the earth," "swallow light," "retroactive fever dream") and sustained through lyric description and meditative pacing. The tone modulates slightly during the standoff (shorter clauses, concrete action) then returns to reverie in the closing paragraph ("ghost of Liora's laughter," "current," whispered thanks"). The tone charges the final image and supports the accumulative lens. However, the closing smile and reassurance ("truth could rest") soften the searing edge into comfort, diluting tonal consistency at the beat that most requires it. Strong setup and development; payoff slightly undercut by tonal drift toward consolation.</comment>
