<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elsin's core motivation (find the stairway, unmake the throne) is established and drives her descent, but the decisive pivot—realizing the throne must be destroyed rather than claimed—arrives without sufficient dramatized internal resistance. The choice to walk away feels more cerebral than contradictory; we see little cost in her renunciation. Embodied emotion is thin: "her breath hitched" and a final smile are the main physical markers in a story dense with lore and objects. The lack of on-page struggle between competing impulses (ascend vs. unmake) prevents the final choice from landing with felt weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late causal turn. The piece anchors who/where/when by ~120 words and escalates through discoveries (flake, hatch, murals, throne chamber) that deepen understanding. The closure—melting the throne and walking away—constitutes a Decisive Change with the conceptual cost (ending ascension) legible on the page. However, the cost feels more stated than felt: "the weight...lifting" and "chains...rusted to dust" tell us freedom rather than dramatizing a visible forfeiture. One meaningful tightening occurs (descent to chamber, realization, dissolution), meeting the 600–800 word standard, but the final image relies on summary assertion ("the past finally at peace") rather than a charged particular.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and underground atrium are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity ("silver-leaved trees," "ozone and old metal," "geometric tiles"). The ruby flake as recurring object constrains action (unlocks hatch, melts throne) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the descent and chamber sequence. The waterfall's shift from kaleidoscope to "just water" at the end provides a concrete environmental marker of change, meeting the 9+ quick test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake (reach the throne before sunrise, later reframed as unmake it) is signaled early and drives the sequence. The tightening occurs when Elsin realizes the throne must be destroyed, not claimed—a meaningful pressure point. However, the escalation is knowledge-driven rather than choice-constrained; she faces no on-page obstacle, rival, or internal temptation resisting the final act. The cost (foregoing ascension, vanishing into myth) is conceptual and arrives without a dramatized trade-off or visible loss of a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (power's cycle, renunciation over rule) emerges from the throne-destruction arc and the recurring ruby-flake motif. The final image—Elsin walking away, orchard fruit dimmed to ordinary red—offers a visual answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans on summary assertion in the final paragraphs ("the age of ascension was over," "some thrones are meant to stay empty") that states theme rather than letting the image speak. The murals and pomegranates recur but their shifts in meaning are told more than charged by fresh perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is lush and elevated ("wisely adventurous," "kaleidoscope of shifting hues") and stays voice-motivated throughout. Perceptual signature (lore-keeper's scholarly attention to murals, equations, inscriptions) is character-specific. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm immediacy. Minor register drift: "wisely adventurous" and "the age of choosing had begun" edge toward prompt-language rather than lived perception, but these remain exceptions rather than patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythm are controlled; figurative language ("boughs," "living veil," "helix of pure energy") is vivid but dense, appearing in most sentences of the climax without pattern-teaching. Two paraphrase loops: "wasn't above—it was *below*" immediately followed by "uncovering a hatch...clicking open" restates discovery; "emerged...the waterfall was just water" / "the orchard's fruit had ripened" / "she whispered...then she walked away" cycles through epilogue beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the final section: "The age of ascension was over. The age of choosing had begun." Stock parallelism rather than fresh closure image. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.6 for loops and template cadence in closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The unclaimed-throne premise and lore-keeper protagonist are familiar fantasy archetypes; the twist (destroy rather than claim) is executed competently but not freshly. The hidden-orchard and mural-as-guide beats follow expected discovery rhythms. Specificity in world-building (ruby-flaked metal, kaleidoscopic waterfall, geometric tiles) adds texture, but the emotional arc (scholar finds artifact, descends, solves riddle, renounces power, vanishes) tracks a well-worn template without a non-obvious synthesis or risky perspectival choice. The transformation test flags moderate swappability: the plot could function with different magical objects and a different ruin.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elsin (lore keeper) is named early, frames the quest, and makes the key choice to destroy the throne rather than claim it. She appears in all three gates: setup (orchard, first paragraph), development (descent, mural reading), and payoff (melts throne, walks away). Her professional skill (reading inscriptions, using lenses) enables the descent. However, her decisions feel more like puzzle-solving than high-cost choices; the final renunciation lacks visible on-page struggle. Two beats: uncovering the hatch, melting the throne. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. Swappability low (role is specific). Cost connection weak (no visible forfeiture or regret dramatized). Net: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.6, cost weak −0.3 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ruby flake is introduced early (paragraph 2), used to unlock the hatch (middle), and melts into the throne at climax (payoff). Three gates met. Three distinct beats: embedded in bark (discovery), unlocks hatch (function), dissolves into throne (transformation). Causal pressure strong (enables descent, triggers resolution). Closure linkage direct (catalyzes throne's destruction). Specificity high (crimson pulse, resonance mechanics are unique). Cost connection moderate (its consumption ends the artifact). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4 = ~7.8 (rounding considers slight ornamental description in first mention).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne is named in paragraph 4, drives Elsin's quest from the start, and is destroyed at climax. Three gates: setup (mentioned as relic/goal), development (realization it must be unmade), payoff (melts, releases city). Two beats: conceptual reframe (not for seated but for rising), physical destruction. Causal pressure strong (shapes entire descent). Closure linkage central (the throne's dissolution is the climax). Specificity moderate (woven ruby-metal is vivid but mechanics are generic). Cost connection strong (its destruction forecloses ascension). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.5, cost +0.5 = ~7.2 (rounding for slight summary-heavy payoff).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" appears once in paragraph 4 as a label without constraining or enabling any on-page action. Elsin's choices (using lenses, digging, descending) show caution and scholarship but do not dramatize a trade-off between wisdom and risk. The trait is told, not shown in a choice with visible cost. Setup only (mentioned but not developed or paid off). Ornamental use. Swappable (could be "cautious scholar" or "bold researcher" with no structural change). Label-only −0.3, no beat involvement, no causal work, late first use −0.3 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sally forth, but not upward" appears once in the mural's instruction (paragraph 8). It prompts Elsin to dig rather than climb—one beat. The action is conceptual (a reorientation) rather than physical or repeated. Setup and development present (prompts the turn to descent); payoff indirect (the stairway later spirals up, but she walks away, not sallying). Swappability moderate (could be "seek below" with minor edits). One beat +0.4, causal pressure moderate +0.7, late first use (second third) −0.3 = ~4.1 (rounding for summary-only use and lack of embodied sally).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Murals appear in four beats: bark peel (paragraph 8), shaft descent (paragraph 10), chamber rewrite (paragraph 14), and final mention (paragraph 15). Three gates met. The murals guide Elsin's path (sally forth instruction), frame the fall of the last ascender, and rewrite themselves at closure. Causal pressure moderate (provide clues but do not constrain). Closure linkage strong (rewrite is the final thematic image). Swappability moderate (could be inscriptions or visions). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, swappability −0.5, ornamental first mention −0.3 = ~5.9 (rounding for mechanics that are more atmospheric than tactically essential).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hidden orchard behind kaleidoscopic waterfall is introduced early (paragraphs 1–2, 6) and functions as entry, threshold, and return location. Three gates: setup (first scene), development (waterfall passage), payoff (return, now changed). Two beats: stepping through waterfall (access), orchard transformed at end (marker of change). Spatial pressure moderate (waterfall is a threshold but not an obstacle). Closure linkage moderate (the dimmed fruit and clear water signal the world's shift). Specificity strong (kaleidoscope, silver-leaved trees, glowing pomegranates are vivid). Cost weak (setting does not constrain tactics). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7, causal pressure +0.5, cost weak −0.2 = ~6.8 (rounding for postcard-leaning description in first use).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is stated in paragraph 5 and referenced at the end ("by the time she emerged...first true light"). Setup and payoff present; no development beat where the ticking clock alters a choice. The time limit does not tighten decisions—Elsin proceeds methodically without visible rush or deadline pressure. Summary-only use. Swappable (could be "by dawn" or "before morning"). Late first mention (second third) −0.4, ornamental −0.5, no causal pressure, closure mention +0.4 = ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation (find the stairway of ascension) is named in paragraph 4, drives the descent, and is reframed at climax (not to climb but to unmake). Three gates: setup (decades piecing together rites), development (discovering the stairway is below), payoff (the stairway unfurls but she walks away). Two beats: realization of descent, renunciation of ascent. Desire is present but not conflicted in scene—no on-page moment where she is tempted to climb. Cost connection moderate (foregoing ascension is conceptual). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, friction (told desire, not dramatized temptation) −0.6 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia: the brass lenses, old machinery, and murals of "first ascenders" blend archive-archaeology with speculative tech. Tone is consistent (elegiac, scholarly) but static—it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image distinctly. The ending's quiet farewell and dimmed fruit lean nostalgic; the helix of energy and shattering mirror lean futuristic. Setup and payoff present; no middle beat where tone shifts under stress. Coherence good, modulation weak. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, coherence +0.6, modulation absent −0.5, static mood −0.3 = ~5.6.</comment>
