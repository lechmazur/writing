<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marlin's motivation is clearly rooted in his failure and the candle's whisper, with his final choice to walk away from praise showing earned character work. However, interiority relies heavily on declarative summary ("He wasn't here for redemption") rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The keeper's unfinished edges and Marlin's recognition of "lingering luminance" carry specificity, but the protagonist's internal arc feels more told than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The closing beat—whispering "Louder" to the flame—lands with appropriate defiance, though the emotional progression from exile to mastery-rejection could be more granular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the spire, mist-walking revelation, and keystone accumulate meaning through density increase and cadence shift. Orientation anchors (Marlin, spire, exam failure) arrive early. The closure effect is Conceptual Repricing—Marlin's refusal to explain and his whispered command reweight the premise (sacred vs. automated) with visible cost (he walks away, leaves the keystone). One meaningful deepening occurs when the folly reveals mist-walking and the keeper's lesson. Minor causality question: the keeper's presence and her knowledge of Marlin feel convenient rather than earned, though the pattern holds at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, frostbloom archway, and impossible summer garden are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (climb, summit folly, garden pocket, return via mist). The keystone's pulsing light and veins of gold constrain the final choice by making meaning visible. However, the mist-walking shortcut undercuts the climb's physical stakes retroactively, and the Conservatory's interior at the end lacks grounding detail. The candle flame as micro-setting charges the final image effectively, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve the keystone and prove worth—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Marlin discovers mist-walking, reframing the challenge. However, the keeper's lesson and the keystone's properties arrive without resistance; Marlin does not face a live choice or trade-off at the summit. The closing renunciation (walking away from the deans) carries conceptual weight but lacks on-page cost legibility—what does he forfeit by leaving the keystone? The escalation relies more on thematic accumulation than protagonist agency narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the sacred in the imperfect, handmade, stubborn—emerges organically from the candle's refusal to extinguish, the crack-in-the-teacup lesson, and Marlin's final rejection of explanation. The keystone and candle merge to create living, imperfect light, a non-literal answer to automation's hollow perfection. Subtext operates cleanly in "Some things aren't for explaining" and the contrast between automated hymns and the roaring flame. Minor slip: "mastery's just another kind of forgetting" edges toward thesis statement, though it stays character-voiced. The ending image reweights prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marlin; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the climb, stepped back for the keeper's dialogue). Perceptual signature is consistent—Marlin notices lingering light, veins of gold, meanings in frost. Dialogue feels functional but not deeply individuated; the keeper's dry tone ("You're late") and Marlin's spare responses serve the scene without strong subtext. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "Of course" after mist-walking reads like authorial commentary rather than Marlin's lived reaction. Diction remains within register; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (the candle's whisper, the folly's shift, the keystone's reveal). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not old, just *unfinished*" restates "smudged like a sketch"; "the sacred in the simple" is reiterated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the climb paragraph ("his fingers numb, his robes stiff"). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("jagged tooth of ice," "crackle of old parchment"); no mixed metaphors harm clarity. The final beat—"Louder" and the roaring flame—propels cleanly, but cumulative loops and stems pull the score down per the artifact pack (−0.6 to −0.8 range).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—automated creation vs. handmade sacred—is timely and synthesizes myth-quest structure with contemporary anxiety in a fresh frame. Marlin's "lingering luminance" and the keeper's "unfinished" edges offer specific, memorable details. However, the underdog-mage-proves-worth arc follows a familiar template; the turn (mist-walking shortcut) and lesson (sacred in the imperfect) arrive without surprise. The ending's defiance is emotionally honest but not structurally bold. Transformation test: swap names and the arc remains largely unchanged, suggesting the freshness resides more in texture than premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marlin (underachieving mage) is seeded in the first paragraph, drives the climb and retrieval, and makes the closure choice to walk away and command the flame. His failure and exile frame the quest; his recognition of the keeper's lesson alters his stance. Three beats involve him causally (climb, retrieval, return). The final act is his decision, with visible cost (he rejects mastery and leaves the keystone). However, the keeper delivers the key insight rather than Marlin discovering it through choice, slightly lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The keystone appears in the assignment (first third), is retrieved at the summit (middle), and left behind at closure (end). It pulses with light, reveals veins of gold, and merges with the candle to create living shadows—three distinct beats. Its properties (accommodating impossibilities) enable the garden shift and the final light-merge. However, Marlin does not struggle to obtain it or pay a visible price for possessing it; it functions more as a catalyst than a contested object. Swappability is low (the "accommodates impossibilities" trait is specific), but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lingering luminance (core concept) is named early, demonstrated in the candle's stubborn flame, and echoed in the keystone's glow and the final roaring fire. It shapes Marlin's worldview and the keeper's lesson ("the stub of wax that won't let go"). However, it operates more as thematic gloss than a mechanic that alters tactics or narrows options on the page. The concept is present in the closure image (candle's flame roars) but does not drive a causal turn. Early signal and closure linkage earn mid-band placement; lack of causal pressure caps it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Accommodates impossibilities (attribute) is assigned to the keystone in the first third and demonstrated when it shifts the world to reveal the summer garden. However, this property is revealed rather than used; Marlin does not leverage it in a choice or face a cost tied to it. The attribute enables one beat (the garden shift) but does not constrain later action. It appears in the closure scene (the keystone is left behind) but passively. Swappability is moderate—"magic stone" could substitute with minor edits. Late functional use and lack of cost cap it below 5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Unstrap (action) occurs at the summit when the keeper tosses the satchel to Marlin, a clear middle beat. The action transfers the keystone and triggers Marlin's recognition of meaning in its light. It appears again implicitly when Marlin "slung the satchel over his shoulder" and later when he places the keystone on the floor. Two beats, both tied to the keystone's transfer and use. However, the action itself is not high-stakes—it could be replaced with "handed" or "gave" without structural loss. The specificity of "unstrap" adds texture but not irreplaceability. Early signal is absent; first appearance is mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mist walking (method) is revealed at the summit ("Everyone else took the stairs") and used once when Marlin steps into the mist to return. It arrives late (past midpoint) and resolves a problem it did not help create (the climb). The keeper's comment reframes the spire's challenge, but the method itself does not shape Marlin's prior attempts or constrain his tactics. It appears in the closure sequence but functionally as an exit mechanism. No setup, minimal development, one-use participation. Late arrival and convenience plotting cap it firmly below 5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Icebound spire (setting) is seeded in the opening line, frames the climb as treacherous (wind, frost, numb fingers), and pressures Marlin physically. The summit folly and impossible garden are distinct spaces that alter the quest's terms. The spire's verticality and isolation charge the final return—Marlin descends to reject the Conservatory's praise. Three beats (climb, summit shift, return) involve the setting causally. The micro-setting (frostbloom, veins of gold in ice) enriches but does not independently constrain a choice. Strong setup and closure linkage; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Timeframe (creativity automated) is established in the opening ("great engines of creation") and contrasted at closure (automated hymn vs. Marlin's roaring candle). It motivates Marlin's exile and the keeper's lesson ("make things instead of asking a machine"). However, time itself is not tracked or pressured—no clock tightens decisions. The frame operates thematically rather than tactically. Present in setup and closure with thematic weight, but lacks middle development as a live constraint. Lyric reprise structure earns mid-band placement; absence of tactical pressure caps it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Motivation (sacred in the simple) is signaled early via the candle's whisper and Marlin's exile for a "defect." The keeper's lesson dramatizes it ("the crack in the teacup, the scrawl in the margin"), and Marlin's final refusal to explain enacts it. The motivation is contested—Marlin rejects mastery and automated praise—showing friction between want (recognition) and deeper need (authenticity). However, much of the motivation is delivered via the keeper's exposition rather than Marlin's conflicted choice under pressure. Three beats (candle whisper, keeper lesson, closing act) with visible cost at the end. Told-and-shown blend pulls it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone (brilliant dimness) operates through contrasts: the candle's stubborn glow, the dull keystone pulsing with insistent light, the "smudged" keeper, shadows that move "imperfect, flickering, alive." The tone is coherent and modulates from exile's cold determination to the summit's quiet revelation to the closing defiance. It charges the final image—Marlin's flame roars against the hollow automated hymn. However, the phrase "brilliant dimness" itself is not directly enacted on the page; the tone reads more as "sacred imperfection." Strong coherence and closure charge; moderate specificity to the exact prompt phrasing.</comment>
