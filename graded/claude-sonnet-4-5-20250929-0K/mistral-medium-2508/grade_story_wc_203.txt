<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates clear interior contradiction—his professional detachment versus his intuitive understanding of the building's supernatural mechanics. His micro-choices (tracing cracks, listening with the barrel, choosing to unmake rather than fix) reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The ticket girl ghost provides relational pressure that forces his final choice, though her sudden solidity at the end ("touched her own wrist, her fingers solid") feels unearned by prior causality. The shift from observer to liberator is motivated but the embodiment of his emotional state during the climactic dismantling could be sharper.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Elias's observations drive investigation, which leads to discovery, which prompts the unmaking decision. Orientation anchors who/where/when efficiently in the opening. The closure—Elias dismantling the mechanism to free the ghosts—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghosts gain release, the circus is truly ended) with visible cost (the mechanism destroyed, the child's laugh shattered). One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the cracks are seams, narrowing his options from repair to unmake. The cost is legible in "The child's laugh in the pendulum shattered" and the finality of "Silence rushed in, thick and final."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (buttered popcorn, damp sawdust, peeling wallpaper) and constrains action throughout—the ceiling cracks shape investigation, the dust patterns provide crucial evidence. The shift from office to revealed mechanism above is spatially coherent. The tool (mainspring barrel) functions as micro-setting, actively used to unlock the ceiling door. However, the "vast, silent mechanism—gears the size of wagon wheels" lacks the selective, filtered detail that would show Elias's professional priorities; it reads slightly catalog-like in the discovery beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what the ceiling hides—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes the cracks are a door, then deepens when he understands the mechanism's purpose (pausing, not ending, the circus). His agency drives the turn: he chooses to unmake rather than repair, with visible cost (destroying the preserved laugh, ending the mechanism). The ghosts' watching creates secondary pressure. One meaningful reversal occurs when "The cracks weren't from decay. They were seams"—reframing the problem and foreclosing repair as an option. The price paid (the shattered laugh, the mechanism's destruction) is concrete and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of the paused circus: performance as burden, freedom through cessation rather than repair. "Weightless burden" is embodied in the ghosts' forced continuation and their release when the mechanism stops. The recurring mainspring barrel and the dust language both constrain action and accumulate meaning. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—unwinding the past requires destruction, not fixing—without stating a moral. The ticket girl's shift from ghost to solid ("her fingers solid for the first time in decades") then immediate fading captures the paradox cleanly. Minor slip: "leaving the ghosts to their quiet, the circus to its dust, and the weightless burden of the past finally, mercifully, unwound" edges toward summary-statement of theme rather than letting the image hold it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance. Elias's perceptual signature—reading dust as language, knowing "fatigue didn't leave cracks that pulsed"—is character-specific and selective. Voice modulates appropriately from patient observation to accelerated action ("His fingers worked faster now"). The ghost dialogue is minimal and atmospheric. However, register occasionally drifts elevated without motivation: "the slow unspooling of shadows, the way dust motes hung suspended like tiny, forgotten acrobats" reads more literary-omniscient than a repair tech's natural noticing under pressure, even one who sees ghosts. Free indirect thought is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Strong specificity in "the dust smooth, undisturbed" versus "particles sharp-edged, restless." However, multiple figurative constructions cluster without pattern-teaching: "dead for thirty years," "ghost of laughter clinging," "edges blurred like smudged chalk," "pulsed faintly, like a slow breath" all within the opening third creates mild density drag (−0.3). The line "Dust was a language" is a micro tell-statement that could be cut (the next paragraph shows it). Template cadence appears in "Not the groan... but a *click*" and "Not from decay... They were seams"—both effective as emphasis but the repetition of the negation-structure across key beats becomes slightly algorithmic (−0.2). The closing sentence stacks three parallel phrases that feel summative rather than propulsive. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator-repair tech, ghost-seeing, and clockwork mechanism pausing a circus is specific and non-obvious. The dust-as-forensic-language and the mainspring barrel as supernatural key feel fresh. However, the ghost-circus premise treads familiar "abandoned entertainment venue with lingering spirits" territory; transformation occurs through the paused-not-failed mechanic and the choice to unmake rather than repair. The horologist object and dust-reading method provide occupational specificity that elevates beyond template. Risk-taking in the tonal register (lyric accumulation meeting mechanical procedure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting +0.2 within band. The ending's emotional stance—mercy through cessation—is earned but not wholly surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias (elevator repair tech who sees ghosts) is present throughout, drives investigation via dust/crack analysis, and makes the climactic choice to dismantle. Setup clear, middle beats show him using occupational skill plus ghost interaction, payoff is his unmake decision. Both trait aspects (repair skill, ghost-seeing) shape tactics and the ending. Causal pressure: his knowledge of structural versus supernatural cracks narrows options (+0.9). Closure linkage: his choice to unmake is the story's hinge (+1.2). Specificity: swap "elevator tech" for generic "repairman" and the piece holds, but the dust-reading expertise and the clockwork object choice feel tied to his cross-domain skill (+0.5). Cost: he destroys a preserved artifact and walks away from professional repair instinct (+0.4). Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0; round to 6.8 acknowledging full three-gate and strong closure tie, though one could argue his occupation is more "building inspector" than "elevator tech" given the work shown (slight generic drift, −0.2).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The horologist's mainspring barrel appears early (setup: "the thing that drew his hand now"), middle (used to listen and unlock the door), and ending (pocketed post-closure). Two distinct beats: listening, then turning to open. Causal pressure: it's the key that opens the ceiling-door (+1.1). Closure linkage: pocketing it "its purpose fulfilled" reweights it from mystery tool to resolved instrument (+0.9). Specificity: the grooves, the brass, the "centuries of winding time" make it irreplaceable; a generic key wouldn't carry the thematic resonance (+0.7). Cost: using it reveals the mechanism and forces the unmake choice (+0.4). Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1 floor; actual involvement and thematic charge push to 7.9. Could reach 8.2+ if the barrel's properties (winding, clockwork) more directly enabled the dismantling, but here it unlocks and then recedes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The core concept "cracks in the façade" frames the entire investigation. Setup: "cracks that pulsed faintly, like a slow breath" in opening third. Development: Elias's realization "The cracks weren't from decay. They were seams" is the central reversal that shifts his goal from repair to discovery/unmake. Payoff: "The cracks in the ceiling were just cracks now" after dismantling—concept resolved with visible cost. Three gates met. Causal pressure: the cracks-as-seams reframe the problem and compel new tactics (+1.3). Closure linkage: the final status of the cracks signals completion (+1.4). Irreplaceability: the dual meaning (structural failure versus containment seams) is load-bearing for plot and theme (+0.8). Cost: recognizing the cracks' true nature forecloses repair and mandates destruction (+0.5). Base 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0 floor; strength across all dimensions and dual-use (literal and metaphoric) justifies 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is demonstrated throughout: dust-pattern reading, recognizing pulsing cracks, inferring the mechanism's purpose. Setup: "His gloved fingers traced the plaster's veined fractures, skimming the dust...Dust was a language." Development: the skill enables the seam discovery. Payoff: observation leads to the unmake choice. Three gates. Causal enablement: without the skill, no discovery (+0.8). However, the attribute is shown in action rather than tested by a visible trade-off or cost—there's no moment where his observational focus causes him to miss something or pay a price, which would elevate it (+0.0 for cost-link). Specificity: the dust-language and crack-reading are character-particular (+0.6). Closure: his observation drives the ending but isn't itself transformed or charged in the final image (+0.4). Base 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8; strong demonstration across beats but no felt constraint or price nudges it to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Engage" appears explicitly: "Elias engaged. He pressed the barrel into the center seam and turned." This is the hinge action that opens the mechanism. Setup: implicit in his approach. Development: the engage moment is the turn. Payoff: the engagement reveals the mechanism, leading to dismantling. Two strong gates (middle, payoff). Causal pressure: engaging the barrel is the required move to access the hidden mechanism; without it, no discovery or resolution (+1.2). Closure linkage: the action enables the entire ending sequence (+1.1). Specificity: "engage" as a term fits his technical background and the mechanical context; less generic than "open" (+0.5). However, the action could be replaced with "unlock" or "activate" without major structural change (modest replaceability, −0.4). Cost: engaging commits him to confronting what's hidden (+0.3). Base 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7; narrative necessity and closure tie lift to 7.4, though it's more pivot than irreplaceable unique action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is shown early and in detail: "the dust that had settled in geometric precision, thickest where the air didn't stir. Dust was a language. It told him which cracks were old...and which were fresh." Setup clear by end of first third. Development: dust analysis informs his investigation tactics ("His gloved fingers traced...skimming the dust"). Payoff: the method leads to recognizing the seams, but does not appear in the ending itself. Two gates (setup, middle). Causal pressure: the method reveals crack age and movement, guiding his focus (+0.7). Specificity: geometric precision and particle sharpness are concrete, occupationally grounded details (+0.6). However, the method is front-loaded; once he identifies the seams, dust-reading recedes and doesn't shape the dismantling or final image (−0.5 for missing closure gate). Cost: no visible trade-off tied to this method (+0.0). Base 3.0 + 0.8 = 3.8 under two-gate cap of ~6.0; lyric reprise absent, so 5.8 reflects strong setup/middle but no payoff charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is present throughout and supplies crucial resources: the ceiling with cracks/seams, the access point to the mechanism, the atmosphere that holds the ghosts. Setup: opening anchors "ticket booth...abandoned places...circus dead for thirty years." Development: the setting's features (ceiling cracks, dust, space to work) enable investigation. Payoff: "The cracks in the ceiling were just cracks now" and "Outside, dawn bled through the broken skylight, painting the office in gold" frame the resolution. Three gates. Causal pressure: the office's condition (cracks as seams, accessible ceiling) is the story's physical puzzle (+1.0). Closure linkage: the office's state post-resolution signals thematic closure (+0.8). Specificity: circus ticket booth with popcorn/sawdust smell and ghost presences is particular (+0.6). Spatial choreography remains clear. Minor: the setting could be "abandoned theater" or "old train station" with modest edits (some replaceability, −0.3). Base 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1; full integration and closure presence push to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "when the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" is the opening trigger: "The fluorescent bulb...flickered once, twice, then surrendered with a sigh, plunging Elias into...dark." Setup met. However, the timeframe does not constrain or tighten decisions thereafter—Elias works at his own pace with no clock pressure. Development and payoff: the darkness is mentioned ("dawn bled through") at the end, but elapsed time is vague and does not alter tactics. One gate (setup). The element is ornamental after the opening; removing it would require a different light-loss trigger but wouldn't change the investigation or ending (high replaceability, −0.7). No causal pressure or cost tied to the timeframe (+0.0). Base 3.0 − 0.7 = 2.3; the opening atmospheric use prevents a score below 3.0, so 4.2 acknowledges functional setup but minimal development or narrative necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" is clear from Elias's focus: "He was here for the ceiling...Management had called it 'structural fatigue,' but Elias knew better." Setup by end of first third. Development: his investigation is goal-driven; each beat (tracing cracks, listening, engaging barrel) pursues the ceiling mystery. Payoff: discovery of the mechanism satisfies the want, then shifts to deciding what to do with it (unmake). Three gates. Causal pressure: the desire drives all investigation beats (+1.0). Closure linkage: discovering what's hidden triggers the final choice (+0.8). However, the motivation is stated more than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; there's no moment where wanting to know costs him something or pulls against another desire (no visible friction, −0.5). Specificity: "what ceilings hide" is particular to his occupation and ghostsight (+0.4). Base 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7; strength across setup/development/payoff and causal drive lift to 6.9, but lack of on-page cost or want-versus-fear tension caps it shy of 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone "weightless burden" is embodied throughout: the ghosts are described as trapped in performance ("the endless, weightless burden of performance"), the mechanism's slow pendulum holding "a child's laugh, preserved in glass," and the ending's release when "the weightless burden of the past finally, mercifully, unwound." Setup: tone established early via "ghosts...edges blurred like smudged chalk" and atmosphere. Development: tone modulates with discovery (wonder, then urgency, then somber resolve). Payoff: the phrase appears explicitly in the final line, reweighting prior material. Three gates. Coherence: the oxymoron (weightless yet burden) is sustained through imagery and action; the ghosts are present but trapped, light but heavy (+1.2). Closure charge: the final invocation ties theme and tone together with cost (the mechanism destroyed, the laugh shattered) visible on the page (+1.3). Specificity: "weightless burden" is unusual phrasing that fits the ghost-circus-mechanism synthesis (+0.6). Minor: the explicit statement in the last line edges toward summary rather than image alone (−0.3). Base 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8; full integration and strong closure tie justify 7.8.</comment>
