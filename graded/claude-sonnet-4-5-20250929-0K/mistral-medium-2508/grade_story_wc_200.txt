<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's collector role is established early with embodied detail (souls "snagging on her sleeves like burrs"), and her modest fearlessness reads as earned trait rather than label. The crocodile's tooth functions as memory anchor tied to her mother's death, providing grief as backstory that motivates present action. However, her internal contradiction remains thin—she moves through the encounter without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The soul's need for integration is realized smoothly, but Liora's own stakes never intensify; she arrives capable and departs unchanged, limiting characterization depth at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates motifs (laughter, crocodile's tooth, harp, petals) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration where the soul is integrated rather than released, fulfilling the "integration" premise. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without confusion. The closure reconfigures the collector's method—some souls need joy stitched back—and the harp's unaligned strings harmonize without correction, a clear before/after. Cost is felt but oblique: the soul's contentment and Liora's lighter satchel suggest relief rather than sacrifice, and no live option is visibly foreclosed for the protagonist. One meaningful deepening occurs when Liora shifts from release to integration, sufficient for this length, but the cost remains atmospheric rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (pale gold mist, wet earth, stone conspirators) filtered through Liora's collector lens. The gorge itself constrains and guides: cliffs lean in, echoes answer, and the harp waits at the site of loudest laughter, making setting a functional pressure rather than postcard. The crocodile's tooth—worn at her throat, warming as she descends—operates as micro-setting object that charges the final image when it glints in sunrise. Spatial choreography remains clear (boots on damp stone, kneeling at harp, scattering petals) and the dawn timeline brackets the action purposefully. Setting earns high marks for integration with choice and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: help the lost soul find peace, signaled when Liora hears the broken laughter and pursues it. The tightening occurs when she realizes the soul wants "to be the joke, not the punchline"—a shift from standard release to integration of joy. This reweights her method and narrows her toolkit to the petals and shared laughter. However, no live alternative is dramatized and rejected; Liora's path feels inevitable rather than chosen under pressure. The joke exchange and resulting chorus provide emotional resolution, but the protagonist faces no visible cost or trade-off that alters her later options. Escalation is present but gentle, fitting the Accumulative lens, yet lacking the sharpness that would push into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: grief as collection, laughter integrated into healing, distortion harmonizing without correction. The crocodile's tooth recurs as memory/promise, charging the final image when it glints in sunrise. The central question—how to honor the dead—receives a non-literal answer: some souls need joy restored, not release. Subtext operates in the harp's misalignment (brokenness need not be fixed to be whole) and Liora's quiet chuckle rising "golden and aching and whole." No overt moralizing, and the ending avoids tidy resolution while offering resonance. Minor slip: "luminous ache" is named in the final passage rather than purely shown, but the accumulation of image (petals, tooth, sunrise) earns the effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, anchored to Liora's perceptual signature: souls as burrs, the tooth as memory, the gorge as conspirator. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, balancing lyric elevation ("pale gold mist curling through jagged teeth") with concrete action (plucking strings, scattering petals). Dialogue with the ghost is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext in the joke exchange. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the encounter. One minor register slip: "integration" and "stitching of joy back into the fabric of their endings" leans slightly abstract for a character in the moment, though it remains plausible as Liora's professional idiom. No head-hopping, and the narrator's certainty matches what Liora can know.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("tuning fork vibrates against bone," "cracked harp string"). Information density is high, with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, overwriting pressure appears in stacked metaphors during setup: "seep into Echo Gorge, a pale gold mist curling through the jagged teeth of the cliffs like a held breath" layers three vehicles in rapid succession without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions: "not as X, but as Y" recurs three times in opening paragraphs. The phrase "luminous and gentle, the kind of ache that didn't hurt but reminded" in the penultimate paragraph approaches purple territory, telling the effect rather than trusting image. Paraphrase loop: "some souls didn't need release / They needed integration" is immediately restated as "the stitching of joy back into the fabric of their endings." Apply −0.6 for density and template issues, and −0.3 for the loop, totaling −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The soul-collector premise is familiar but receives a fresh inflection: integration rather than release, laughter as healing agent. The crocodile's tooth as inherited memory object and the misaligned harp that harmonizes without repair offer specific, non-obvious detail. The joke exchange ("crocodile cross the river" / "to get to the other snide") feels earned in hindsight, rising from Liora's personal anchor. However, the core emotional arc—empathetic caretaker helps troubled spirit find peace—remains close to template, and the resolution is heartwarming rather than surprising. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode and follows implications without retreat, but does not take bold structural or tonal risks that would elevate originality into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora, the lost soul collector, is introduced in paragraph two and drives all major beats: she hears the laughter, pursues it, identifies the soul's need, and facilitates integration. Her choice to scatter petals and share the joke is the pivotal turn. However, her role is more facilitator than agent under pressure—she arrives with the answer (petals, insight) rather than discovering it through conflict. Present in setup, middle action, and closure, but her decisions feel assured rather than costly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears in four beats: introduced as her mother's gift tied to grief, warms against her skin as she descends, she touches it during the joke exchange ("her fingers finding the tooth at her throat"), and glints in the final image catching sunrise. It functions as memory anchor and thematic carrier (grief as collection, inheritance as promise). The tooth's warming signals the gorge's responsiveness, and its final glint charges the closure. Early signal, recurring presence, closure linkage; cost is thematic (mother's death) rather than tactical, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Spectral confessions are named in paragraph four as Liora's usual fare, and this encounter subverts expectation: the soul laughs rather than weeps, wants to be "the joke, not the punchline" rather than unburdening regret. The concept shapes the stakes (what does this soul need?) and redefines Liora's method (integration vs. release). However, the confession itself—"I drowned... I learned what it means to be remembered"—is brief and does not create sustained friction. Present in setup and reweighted at closure, but the mechanics remain abstract rather than concretely pressuring choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Modest fearlessness is declared in paragraph nine: "wasn't bravery; it was the quiet certainty that the dead were just people who'd forgotten how to leave." It explains why Liora doesn't startle, but the trait functions as label rather than constraint. No on-page moment where fearlessness costs her (e.g., missing danger cues, overconfidence leading to misstep). Mentioned once, informs tone, but does not shape a decision with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pursuit is signaled early ("Liora pursued the sound now") and structures the first half: she follows the broken laughter through the gorge to the harp. The action delivers her to the encounter site and establishes her role as active seeker rather than passive receiver. However, once she arrives, pursuit ends and facilitation begins; the second half pivots to dialogue and ritual. Present in setup, enables the middle turn (finding the harp), and is echoed in closure ("carried it with her, out of the gorge"), but easily swappable with "investigate" or "approach." Strong early role, moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The misaligned harp is introduced at the climax as the object Liora finds where the laughter was loudest. She plucks strings twice, producing distorted notes that the gorge answers; the harp becomes the medium through which the soul speaks and, after the joke, harmonizes without realigning. The method is concrete and specific (strings at odd angles, notes "wrong and right all at once"), and it shapes the encounter's mechanics. However, the harp arrives late (past midpoint) and is not seeded earlier, limiting integration. Strong payoff, late setup: −0.4 for timing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is named in the opening line and anchors every beat: the cliffs lean in "like conspirators," the gorge answers Liora's plucked note with a sigh, and the walls stand tall at closure "as if they, too, had been healed." The gorge functions as living participant, holding its breath and releasing laughter. Spatial details (damp stone, wet earth, cliffs) guide Liora's descent and create intimacy. The setting constrains (she must go deeper to find the source) and charges the final image (sunrise touching her shoulders as she exits). Early signal, sustained pressure, closure participation, and thematic resonance (echo as memory and repetition).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the opening ("first light of dawn didn't so much rise as seep") and bookends the action ("hush of a hidden sunrise," "first true light of dawn touched her shoulders"). However, the clock does not tighten decisions—Liora's encounter unfolds without urgency, and the dawn's arrival feels atmospheric rather than deadline-driven. The "hidden" quality suggests the sun is not yet visible during most of the action, then emerges at closure, providing lyric frame but not tactical pressure. Early signal, closure reprise, but passive rather than constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to integrate laughter into healing is realized on the page when Liora shifts from expecting standard confession to recognizing the soul "want[s] to be laughed with" and needs "the stitching of joy back into the fabric of their endings." This insight drives her choice to scatter petals and share the joke, altering her method. However, the motivation is discovered mid-scene rather than driving Liora from the start; her initial pursuit is generic (follow the sound). The motivation shapes the climax and closure but lacks early friction or cost (e.g., conflict between joy and solemnity). Present in middle and ending, causal, but no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Luminous ache is maintained throughout: the dawn "pale gold," the crocodile's tooth as gift before fever, the broken laughter that "splits the air," the final light "luminous and gentle, the kind of ache that didn't hurt but reminded." Tone modulates with pressure—quiet in approach, warped during the laugh, softening into the joke, then rising into the chorus and sunrise. The tone charges the final image (tooth glinting, echoes laughing, "golden and aching and whole") and coheres across beats. Minor slip: "luminous ache" is named explicitly in the penultimate paragraph rather than purely embodied, but the accumulation earns the effect. Coherent, modulated, closure-enhancing.</comment>
