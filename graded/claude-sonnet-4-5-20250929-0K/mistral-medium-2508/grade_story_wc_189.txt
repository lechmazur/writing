<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chronicler's interiority is vividly embodied through her tangential observation style, and the fisherman's grief is rendered with concrete silence rather than therapy-speak. However, the protagonist's agency remains largely observational—she traces, withdraws, watches, and finally gives the cicada away, but none of these acts meaningfully narrow her own options or foreclose a path with visible cost. The fisherman receives more character work (his wife's death, his cracked voice, his eventual departure), yet he remains secondary. The ending gesture feels generous but not earned by prior struggle that tests the chronicler's own stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the grotto scene layers sensory detail, reflection, and the cicada's symbolic weight toward a final gift that reweights the fisherman's trajectory. Orientation is clear early (grotto, pause in conversation, fisherman present). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the gift) that shifts the fisherman's future texture, and the final dream image charges the piece with the damp sleeve. Cost is present but oblique—the chronicler surrenders her grandmother's gift, and the damp sleeve suggests a lingering burden—but the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. One tightening (the cicada's warmth, the shape of the future) deepens the stake without a sharp reversal, fitting the accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly anchored with moonlight pooling "like spilled ink," the drip-and-ripple water, and the scent of wet earth and jade. The tidal pools function as micro-setting that reveal the chronicler's method and return at the end with the hermit crab's cracked shell, charging the closure image. The stars, the tide's retreat, and the dawn horizon track the passage of time and pressure the fisherman's departure. No occupation-level depth is required here, and the sensory selection (metallic tang of jade, white breath cloud) remains purposeful and POV-filtered throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the chronicler can offer the fisherman a path through grief—is signaled early and remains coherent under the accumulative lens. The cicada's warming and the chronicler's vision of the fisherman's future constitute one meaningful deepening that reweights his options. However, the chronicler's own agency is passive; she observes, understands, and gives, but no on-page choice narrows her own path or imposes a felt trade-off. The fisherman's departure at dawn and the hermit crab's new shell provide closure participation, but the pressure remains more atmospheric than escalatory. One tightening is present, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—transition, the texture of time, the spaces between what was and what will be—emerges organically from the grotto's drip, the tide, the cicada's warmth, and the hermit crab's cracked shell. The chronicler's gift and the final dream with the damp sleeve offer a resonant, non-literal answer: some textures linger, and grief softens like a stone worn by the tide. No overt thesis statement mars the ending. The piece resists tidy resolution, embracing quiet complexity. However, the phrase "transitions were never truly over, only layered, like the sediment at the grotto's floor" in the penultimate section borders on thematic echo, nearly stating what the imagery has already shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the chronicler; perceptual signature is strong (tangential approach, crab-like observation, tidal-pool layering). Diction remains consistent and poetic without register clash, and the chronicler's interior voice is distinct. The fisherman's brief dialogue ("You don't have to say it") carries subtext and feels natural. Filter verbs ("she saw it," "she understood") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The prose modulates with pressure: short, breathless when the cicada warms; longer, reflective in the grotto. No head-hopping, no dialogue convergence. Psychic distance shifts purposefully from close interior to wider observation. One minor note: the cicada "didn't sing for the impatient" could be crisper, but the effect is minimal.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (moonlight pooled like spilled ink, the pinprick sound of the water drop, the hermit crab's hairline crack). However, several paraphrase loops and template cadences appear: "She had come here during the pause... the kind where words hung"; "The cicada had been a gift... who'd pressed it into her palm with instructions"; "The cicada grew warm... not with heat, but with a kind of humming potential." The phrase "as if the cicada had wept in the dark" is poetic but edges toward purple without clear causal grounding. Line-level momentum is strong in the grotto beats but slackens slightly in the penultimate reflection on transitions. No loops touch the closure beat directly, so the accumulation cap applies: two distinct issues (template stems, one figurative muddle) → approximately −1.2 within the category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler as a grief counselor through tangential observation is a fresh synthesis, and the jade cicada as a gift that teaches listening in transitions is specific. However, the core emotional arc—an observer helps a grieving person by offering a symbolic object and quiet wisdom—is familiar from contemplative literary templates. The grotto setting and the hermit crab's return provide specificity, but the transformation test is borderline: swap the tidal pools for another observation-based craft (e.g., a botanist, a calligrapher) and the arc holds with minor edits. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids safety hedging, but the emotional logic is well-worn. No proximity violations, and the ending's resonance (damp sleeve, lingering texture) offers a non-obvious inflection that lifts the score into the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler is present early (first sentence), her observation of tidal pools is referenced in the middle ("she'd spent years recording"), and she returns to the pools at the end to find the hermit crab. However, her choices are largely passive: she traces stone, withdraws the cicada, watches, and gives. The gift of the cicada is a decision, but it does not narrow her own options or impose a visible cost—she surrenders her grandmother's gift, but the piece does not dramatize what she loses or gains by the act. She shapes the fisherman's trajectory more than her own. Two beats (grotto observation, final tidal-pool return) and lyric reprise (first line → ending) qualify her for mid-band, but lack of causal agency or cost tied to her choices caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The jade cicada appears in four distinct beats: pressed into her palm by her grandmother (backstory anchor), held to her ear in the grotto, grows warm with "humming potential," and pressed into the fisherman's palm at the end. The cicada's warmth and silence teach her the shape of the future, enabling her gift and reweighting the fisherman's grief. Its return in the dream (damp sleeve) charges the final image with lingering cost. Early signal, middle constraint (it reveals timing and readiness), and closure participation are all present. The cicada is indispensable—remove it and the chronicler has no mechanism to perceive the fisherman's trajectory or to offer the gift that defines the ending. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability push this into the 7+ band, though the dream reprise is slightly oblique.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Transition periods frame the premise explicitly ("the pause in a difficult conversation," "transitions... in the spaces between what was and what would be") and thematically throughout (tide's retreat, dawn's approach, hermit crab's shell switch). The concept shapes the chronicler's method (she observes transitions in tidal pools) and the fisherman's stakes (grief as a transition). The ending image (the hermit crab's cracked shell, "transitions were never truly over, only layered") reprises the concept with cost. However, the concept remains primarily thematic rather than a tactical constraint that alters on-page choices. The chronicler's understanding of transitions enables her to perceive the fisherman's future, which allows the gift, so causal linkage is present but mediated. Three beats and closure participation, but swappable with "liminal moments" or "in-between states" with minor edits. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is signaled through the chronicler's tangential, crab-like approach and her years recording tidal-pool lives with care. The trait enables her method (she sees what others can't through sideways attention) and informs the gift (she presses the cicada with instruction rather than explanation). However, the attribute is never tested by a visible trade-off or cost—her warmth and observation are purely enabling, not constraining. No moment where her warmth leads to a mistake or where observation delays urgent action. The trait is consistent and integral to voice, but it does not foreclose a path or shape a difficult choice. Two beats (grotto observation, final gift) with thematic coherence, but no on-page friction or cost limits the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Foresee" is signaled when the chronicler sees "not the future, but the shape of it, the way a shell holds the memory of the creature that once lived inside." This moment enables her decision to give the cicada and frames the fisherman's eventual softening of grief. However, the act of foreseeing is summarized rather than dramatized—she closes her eyes, drifts, and when she opens them "she saw it." The mechanics remain vague (grotto language? cicada warmth? her own experience?), and the vision itself is abstracted ("the texture would be different now"). The action appears in one beat and is referenced at closure (the fisherman "wouldn't understand its weight for years, not until he stood on the shore one evening"), but it could be replaced with intuition or empathy with minor edits. Present in setup and middle, but not indispensable. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tangential approach is signaled early ("through a tangential approach, the way a crab sidles toward its prey") and demonstrated in the chronicler's method: she answers the fisherman's question about fate with silence, turns to the grotto's walls instead of direct counsel, and observes tidal pools to understand people. The method shapes her choice to give the cicada with instruction rather than explanation. However, the means is more thematic flavor than tactical constraint—remove the "crab sidles" line and the story's moves remain unchanged. The method is consistent across three beats (silence, grotto observation, gift with instruction) and supports the ending, but it is not irreplaceable. The chronicler could use careful listening or patient observation with similar effect. Causal role in the ending but swappable. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ancient grotto under stars is anchored early (first sentence) and used throughout: moonlight pools like ink, damp stone, dripping water, the metallic tang, hidden cracks sighing with wind, and the mouth opening to the stars. The grotto's atmosphere enables the chronicler's vision (the drip-and-ripple moment "she understood: the texture of time wasn't in the events themselves, but in the way they bled into each other"). The setting's liminal quality (pause, breath-holding, in-between space) directly supports the core concept and stakes. The stars return at the ending dream ("a sky dense with stars") to charge the final image. Three beats (arrival, vision, dream) and closure participation. The grotto is indispensable—shift to an open beach or a forest and the piece loses its acoustic and symbolic architecture. Strong integration pushes this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The pause in a difficult conversation frames the opening and the fisherman's question about fate, and time markers track throughout: the tide's slow retreat, stars blinking into existence, the first pale hint of dawn, and the fisherman's departure "at dawn." The timeframe pressures the fisherman's decision (he will leave because the tide turns and nets need mending), and the chronicler's reflection occurs during this pause. However, the clock is atmospheric rather than urgent—no moment where time running out forces a choice or alters tactics. The pause is signaled early, appears in the middle (the world holding its breath), and shapes the ending (dawn, departure), but it could be replaced with "overnight vigil" or "twilight walk" with minor edits. Two gates and thematic coherence, but no sharp pressure. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated explicitly in the penultimate section ("transitions were never truly over, only layered, like the sediment at the grotto's floor") but never dramatized as a conflicted desire. The chronicler's years recording tidal pools suggest a long-standing interest, and her observation in the grotto yields understanding ("the texture of time wasn't in the events themselves, but in the way they bled into each other"), but no on-page moment shows her wanting this knowledge, struggling to attain it, or paying a cost to pursue it. The motivation is thematic backdrop rather than active driver. The chronicler's actual on-page want is to help the fisherman, and her understanding of time's texture is the means, not the end. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but ornamental to the dramatized stakes. Low-mid band.</comment>
