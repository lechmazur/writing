<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena demonstrates patience and strategic thinking through her vault infiltration and guard trap, with embodied detail in her seed-handling and whispered mantra. However, interiority remains thin—her six years in a cell are told rather than shown through present micro-choices, and the "chained liberator" label does explanatory work without dramatized contradiction. The guard's confusion and her departure feel competent but lack visible internal cost or competing impulses that would elevate the characterization into higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under a Causal lens: Lena's decoding unlocks the vault, her piano-key gambit drops the guard, and her planting creates the closure image. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing—seeds as insurgency—with felt cost (empty pockets, stained hands, walking into hunger). Orientation anchors cleanly (carnival, tonight, wall falling). One structural friction: the arrow's notch-sequence ("impede, then proceed") and reverse-order insertion feel mechanically convenient rather than pressure-driven, and the guard's fall lacks clear causal setup (why does middle C collapse the floor?). These mid-sequence gaps prevent entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival is vividly particular—skeletal prize booth, yellowed piano keys, duck-pond pit now filled with rainwater—and the vault's glass vials and the arrow's corn-husk fletching supply tactile anchors. The piano itself becomes a trap mechanism, constraining Lena's tactics and charging the closure (she returns tomorrow "to the piano, to the keys"). Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not quite reach 8+ because the guard's positioning and the floor's collapse mechanism are under-explained, leaving one beat's geography fuzzy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—retrieving seeds to plant resilience—is signaled early and tightens when the guard appears, forcing Lena to choose between escape and completing her mission. Her piano-key trap narrows options and the planting act forecloses return (empty pockets, walking away). Cost is visible: she leaves herself exposed, walks toward hunger, and commits to tomorrow's risk. The escalation is clean under the Causal lens. The piece does not reach 8+ because the guard's threat deflates quickly (he falls into a pit with minimal struggle), reducing the felt price of her choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: patience as insurgency, resilience through scattering rather than rows, "not with a roar, but with a seed." The piano keys and arrow motifs accumulate pressure without overt statement, and the carnival's "Every Ticket a Winner" sign offers oblique closure charge. The final image—seeds as weapons, dirt-stained hands—reweights the premise without moralizing. Minor friction: "staggering grace" and "armed with life" tilt toward elevated abstraction in the final third, and the phrase "the lesson would plant itself" edges into theme summary, preventing full entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lena; perceptual signature is consistent (tracing keys, whispering mantras, sensing wind). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with compression ("the wall was already forgotten") supporting closure rhythm. Two frictions: the phrase "grace so staggering it looked like surrender until the moment it won" shifts into essayistic register at the climax, and the narrator's confident assertion that "no one would call it a miracle" claims off-page consensus. These slips prevent 8+ entry but do not obscure focalization or the ending image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the vault and trap sequences. Figurative language ("jagged scar," "roots through stone," "held breath") charges key images without muddle. Three accumulated frictions lower the score: paraphrase loops ("The wall was down" / "The wall was already forgotten"), template cadence in the final third ("Not with a roar, but with a seed. Not with force, but with grace..."), and the scaffolding phrase "She didn't look back" followed by "The future was ahead"—a stock pivot that could be cut. These artifacts in the closure zone trigger the −0.8 to −1.4 range and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of patient insurgency, seed-vault, and carnival trap is specific and non-obvious, and the piano-as-weapon turn feels earned in hindsight. The piece resists easy moralizing and commits to its premise. However, the "liberator who plants seeds after a wall falls" frame echoes familiar post-revolution narratives, and the trait "patiently strategic" paired with a clandestine vault feels prompt-assembled rather than organically discovered. The arrow's fletching and the reverse-key sequence add texture but read as obligatory puzzle elements. The transformation is partial, holding the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout, and her choices drive the vault unlock and guard trap. She plants seeds at closure, altering tactics from retrieval to scattering. The "chained liberator" label appears early but functions more as backstory flavor than on-page constraint. Her decisions create two turns (vault access, guard evasion) and she shapes the ending, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. Causal pressure is evident but the "liberator" identity does not impose a visible cost or dilemma that meaningfully narrows her options. Strong functional integration, mid-band ceiling due to lack of visible tradeoff tied specifically to the "chained" attribute.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arrow appears embedded in the roof, its fletching described (corn husk, blue dye), then snapped to reveal notches that guide key order. It recurs in the final third as a belt reminder. Two beats, early signal, and closure callback meet the reprise test. However, its core function—delivering a sequence—could be replaced by any inscribed object (a card, a carving). The strange fletching adds texture but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the notch sequence does the causal work. Functional but replaceable, mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vault is setup (mentioned early as "hidden seed vault"), drives the middle infiltration beat (pressure plates, key puzzle), and supplies the seeds that Lena plants at closure. Its contents—drought-resistant wheat, poor-soil apples—give specificity, and the vault's unlock is the story's central turn. The concept shapes stakes (retrieve seeds to replant) and tactics (decoding, trap). Strong causal role across setup, development, and payoff. Does not quite reach 8+ because the vault's mechanics feel convenient (keys fit neatly, no second obstacle) rather than imposing visible cost or forcing a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is stated as a descriptor and whispered at closure. Her months of decoding and the six-year cell wait are told, not dramatized as on-page choices with visible cost. The trait flavors her approach but does not force a tradeoff (e.g., patience causing her to miss an opening, or strategy requiring a sacrifice). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is weak. Functional label, lyric reprise, but no felt friction—mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Impede" appears in the arrow's notch instruction ("impede, then proceed") and governs the reverse-order key insertion that opens the vault. The guard-trapping piano beat also impedes his pursuit. Two applications, early signal, causal link to vault access. The action shapes a major turn but its execution feels mechanical—any obstacle or delay could serve the same function with minor edits. Strong presence, moderate irreplaceability, upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method is setup (keys described, wrapped in oilcloth), executed in the vault beat (pressure plates, reverse order), and enables the story's central resource gain. Early signal, middle development, payoff link. The decoding itself is told rather than dramatized (months of work off-page), and the symbols-to-vault match feels ordained rather than puzzle-like. The reverse-order twist adds a beat but does not impose visible cost or force a second attempt. Functional, moderate causal weight, mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The carnival supplies the vault location, piano trap, duck-pond pit, and ruins for seed-planting. It appears in every major beat: opening anchor, vault infiltration, guard trap, closure planting, and the final sign callback ("Every Ticket a Winner"). The setting's physical features—prize booth roof, floor trap, broken tickets—alter tactics and charge the ending image. High specificity, strong causal role, closure linkage. Does not quite reach 8.5+ because the piano-floor mechanism is under-explained, leaving one beat's spatial logic fuzzy.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is setup (opening line: "tonight it would fall"), marks the vault infiltration ("When the first bricks trembled, she moved"), and frames the closure urgency ("by dawn," "She would return...tomorrow"). The wall's collapse is a signal, not a live ticking clock that forces choices mid-scene. Time shapes the overall arc but does not tighten a specific beat decision or impose a visible cost (Lena completes her plan without time pressure altering tactics). Setup and payoff gates met, development weak—mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation—plant resilience—is stated early, drives the vault retrieval, and is enacted at closure (kneeling, pressing seeds, scattering). It shapes two major beats and the ending image. The desire is clear but not dramatized as conflicted: Lena never hesitates or weighs an alternative want. The motivation is told ("to plant resilience in dry soil") and enacted, but no internal friction or cost appears on the page. Strong functional presence, minimal dramatized want-versus-cost tension, upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone is established through compressed lyricism ("jagged scar," "quiet persistence of roots," "armed with life") and modulates at the closure ("not with a roar, but with a seed"). The piece sustains a reverent, insurgent register. Two frictions: the phrase "grace so staggering it looked like surrender" at the climax shifts into essayistic abstraction, and the final third's repetitive "Not with X, but with Y" cadence flattens rather than charges. Tone is coherent and purposeful but does not fully heighten the closure image without slipping into summary. Mid-6s.</comment>
