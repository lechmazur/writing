<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dreamer's agency is present but shadowed by heavy symbolic layering; her internal contradictions remain implied rather than dramatized in scene. Key micro-choices—climbing the ladder, tearing the page, writing the third letter—show motive, but the pivot from "finding what was unsaid" to "learning to say it" arrives through summary rather than on-page struggle. Embodied emotion is intermittent: "pulse quickened," "hands trembling" register physically, but much of the interiority floats in abstract register ("heart no longer a cipher"). The final act of writing and posting earns the change only if we accept the library epiphany as sufficient causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational. The piece accumulates symbolic pressure through recurring motifs (watch, mist, letters) and a pattern-taught ellipsis style. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the dreamer reweights "unspoken" as something she must now speak, and posts the third letter with visible cost (leaving the watch behind). The orientation anchors are present by the opening paragraph (veiled dreamer, library, mist), and the pattern is taught early enough for the mosaic shards to cohere. One meaningful tightening occurs when the second letter is posted and the library collapses, narrowing her window. The cost is legible—she forfeits the cipher and steps into vulnerability—but it remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The library as micro-setting constrains choice: shelves labeled, books blank until touched, the watch's humming that triggers vision. Sensory detail is purposeful—mist, amber glow, burnt sugar—and filtered through the dreamer's priorities. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (ladder, stacks, door), though the vision of the confidence man in "a room" momentarily floats without grounding. The final image of the watch on the windowsill and the mist rolling in charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for setting participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: document the unspoken words before the library dissolves. The watch's countdown and the second letter's posting provide one meaningful tightening. Agency is present in tearing the page and writing the third letter, but the escalation feels conceptual rather than tactical—no live trade-off dramatized on the page (e.g., what she risks by writing versus staying silent). The cost at closure is the watch's surrender, which reweights her stance, but the pressure remains atmospheric rather than forcing a visible choice under competing harms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence versus speech, what remains unspoken versus what must be said—emerges through recurring images (watch, letters, library) without overt statement. The final image offers a resonant answer: "Some things only needed to be said," crystallized by the posted envelope and abandoned watch. The ledger entry "The library isn't a place. It's the gap between what we say and what we mean" gestures toward thematic articulation but stops short of echo; it primes rather than resolves. Subtext operates in the confidence man's velvet voice, the mist's hunger, and the veiled dreamer's silence, but some beats rely on abstract philosophizing ("heart no longer a cipher") that dilutes particularity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the dreamer; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric register with purposeful compression ("breath curling like ink," "velvet unspooling"), and the pattern is taught early. Perceptual signature is present—she notices the watch's warmth, the shelf labels, the page's glow—but some diction ("propagation delay," "cipher," "epistles") drifts into elevated register that feels more authorial than character-bound. Thewatch vision momentarily shifts to the confidence man's present without clear transition cue, though it reads as magical rather than a focalization leak. Filter verbs are sparse; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or symbolic language—which creates texture but risks overwriting in peak beats ("heart no longer a cipher, but a door" stacks abstraction at closure). Minor paraphrase loops: "The library groaned, its glow dimming" followed by "shelves began to collapse inward" restates dissolution. Template cadence appears in the final third: "Some things didn't need... Some things only needed..." registers as purposeful parallelism but borders on scaffold. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates with pressure, but information density dips in expository beats ("The watch wasn't just a key—it was a thief"). No major clarity breaks, but elevated diction and stacked metaphors dull immediacy in the sprint sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—library of unspoken words accessed via backward-ticking watch—offers a fresh angle on regret and communication. Execution leans on familiar beats: magical library, time artifact, mist as threat, the third letter as resolution. The transformation is partial: the dreamer's arc from finder to speaker is earned, and the watch's reversal mechanic shapes her attempts, but the emotional template (woman learns to voice what was hidden) remains recognizable. The ending's quiet confidence—abandoning the watch, posting the letter—feels specific to this character, lifting the piece above derivative, though not to rare synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Veiled dreamer: present throughout, frames expectation early, and her choices (climbing, tearing the page, writing the letter) create key turns. She appears in the closure unit, writing and posting the third letter with visible cost (leaving the watch). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is moderate—her agency drives the sprint and the final act—but many beats (the library's collapse, the watch's visions) happen to her rather than through her decisions. Integration is solid but not indispensable; a similar seeker could occupy the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Confidence man's watch: appears in paragraph four, used in at least three beats (humming against her thigh, flipping it open to trigger the vision, burning against her ribs during the sprint), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (left on the windowsill, "its reversed hands catching the light like a promise"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The watch's backward motion enables the vision and shapes her urgency, but its specific properties (brass casing, cyclically reversed arcs) remain decorative rather than mechanically decisive. The final image charges the closure, but the watch's role is more symbolic anchor than irreplaceable causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Unfolding cipher: mentioned in paragraph five ("The watch was a cipher") and referenced in the final third ("her heart no longer a cipher"). The concept does not shape on-page tactics—she does not decode anything step by step—and remains thematic label rather than dramatized stake. No setup in the opening third; it arrives late and is told rather than shown. Missing development and closure participation gates. Largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cyclically reversed: specified for the watch's hands in paragraph six ("its hands moving in cyclically reversed arcs"). The reversal enables the vision beat ("hour hand jerked counterclockwise, and the library shuddered") and is referenced again during the sprint ("its reverse motion tugging at the seams of time"). Setup is present by the first third, and the attribute enables one key beat (the vision), meeting two gates. However, the reversal's mechanics remain abstract—how it "bends the air" or "unravels time" is asserted, not demonstrated through cost or constraint. The attribute shapes one turn but could be swapped for generic "magic" with minor edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Document: her stated goal from paragraph three ("She had to document them before the mist dissolved the library") and executed in two beats (pressing her palm to the book, tearing the page free). The action drives her urgency and the sprint, and the stolen page appears at closure ("In her pocket, the stolen page pulsed"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The documenting attempt creates one key turn (the page-tearing), but the final act is writing a new letter rather than using what she documented, which undercuts the action's closure weight. Causal pressure is moderate; the action is essential to the middle but sidelined at the end.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Through propagation delays: mentioned in paragraph six ("each tick a propagation delay unraveling time") and again in paragraph twelve ("its cipher now unraveling her"). The method is labeled but not demonstrated—no on-page mechanics show how delays work or what cost they impose. The concept does not shape her attempts; the watch simply "works" when she opens it. Missing development gate (no middle choice constrained by this method) and weak closure participation (mentioned in passing during the sprint). Late signal, summary-only, swappable with "magic time travel" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Glowing library in mist: present from the opening line, anchors every beat, and supplies resources (shelves, books, ledger) and constraints (collapsing, mist pressing closer) that drive her choices. The library's dissolution forces the sprint, and her escape is the physical climax. The setting participates in the closure: "the library folded into nothing, leaving only the path and the watch." Setup, development, and payoff gates are strongly met. The library is irreplaceable—remove it and the story's logic fails. Causal pressure is high, and the setting charges the final image by its absence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Between two fateful letters: framed in paragraph three ("the silence between two fateful letters: the first, sent in haste; the second, never posted") and the timeframe tightens when "the second letter had been posted" in paragraph fifteen, triggering the library's collapse. The clock is live and tracked, shaping her urgency. The timeframe participates in closure when she writes the third letter, superseding the first two. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The letters constrain her window and charge her final act, but the mechanics of how the second letter's posting causes the collapse are asserted rather than shown. Strong integration with one abstraction gap.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To find the library of unspoken words: stated in paragraph three and drives her climbing, pressing palms to books, and tearing the page. The motivation is present and shapes multiple beats. At closure, the desire transforms: she realizes "it wasn't about finding what was unsaid. It was about learning to say it," and posts her own letter. Setup and development gates are met; payoff gate is met through transformation. Friction between want (to document) and emergent need (to speak) is present but told in summary rather than dramatized as on-page conflict. The motivation is functional and reweighted at the end, but the shift feels conceptual rather than costly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance: intermittently legible. Exuberance appears in the opening's sensory richness and the dreamer's quickened pulse; caution in her veiled state, trembling hands, and the watch's ominous hum. Under peak pressure (the sprint), tone shifts to urgency without clear modulation back to exuberance at closure—the final beats read more as quiet resolve than exuberant discovery. The tone is present but does not charge the final image; it remains atmospheric rather than integral. Setup gate is met, development is partial, payoff is weak. Functional but not cohesive across turns.</comment>
