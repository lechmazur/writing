<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The keeper's interiority is present but remains abstract and generic—"loose grip on reality," dissolution of thoughts "like ink in rain"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The "buried their name" moment gestures at renunciation but never dramatizes what was traded or how options narrowed. Internal experience stays static across the entire arc; no competing impulse acts in scene, only meditative observation. Agency is observation, not decision with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece opens in media res without clear who/where/when anchors by ~120 words (the keeper's name, the library's location, and temporal frame remain vague throughout), triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the ending reprises the swan-folding ritual and "the waiting was the point" echoes earlier material, but no tightening or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with visible cost—the keeper remains unchanged, the ritual identical. The closure image ("let the library swallow them whole") asserts transformation without demonstrating a before/after or foreclosed path. No decisive change, no felt cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The moss-covered library, underground river, and obsidian monolith are vivid and purposeful, establishing a coherent hermetic space. The origami swan and the black water constrain the keeper's ritual actions across multiple beats. However, the setting does not force a choice or charge the final image with a visible consequence; it remains atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment enables repetition rather than escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to witness change without judgment"—is signaled early but never tested or complicated on the page. No reversal, no tightening, no choice that narrows options. The keeper performs the same ritual at the beginning and end without friction or cost; the refuge opens, they enter, they watch, they leave, they fold another swan. The stake remains abstract and uncontested. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a cadence shift should reweigh the stake; neither occurs—only looped description.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of regenerative silence and dissolution emerges through image and atmosphere rather than statement, which is commendable. However, the ending offers no reweighted answer or non-literal insight—it simply restates the premise: waiting is the point, silence is the answer. The swan motif recurs but does not shift meaning; it dissolves and reforms identically. No conceptual repricing, no earned resonance from particulars, just thematic echo. The piece gestures at profundity without landing a specific cost or change.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a consistent, incantatory rhythm that suits the hermetic mood. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("regenerative silence," "crumbling peace"). However, syntactic patterns become repetitive—short declarative followed by metaphoric expansion—and several lines loop conceptually: "watching, unjudging" and "witness, a fold, a breath" recycle the same image without propulsion. No head-hopping, but voice lacks the perceptual particularity that would distinguish this keeper from any mystic-hermit archetype.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is polished and atmospheric, but multiple paraphrase loops appear: the keeper's dissolution is restated across three paragraphs without added pressure ("edges blurring," "become something else," "swallow them whole"). Template cadence in the middle section: "The way the walls exhaled... the way the air hummed..." (parallel stems without taught pattern). Filter verbs ("seemed," "appeared," "as if") cluster in the refuge sequence, dulling immediacy. Stock metaphors: "ink in rain," "river silt," "patient tongue." These artifacts do not break causality but measurably reduce propulsion and density (−0.8 accumulation in Q7).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The hermit-scholar-in-a-hidden-library premise is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through fresh synthesis or a non-obvious angle. The origami-swan-as-key is a surface detail rather than an ingenuity that drives turns. Emotional arc and plot could transfer to any mystical-refuge story with minor edits. Atmosphere is well-executed but the concept reads as a writing-prompt assembly: assign a recluse + object + hidden place + abstract concept. No bold risk or transformative particularity that makes the story's logic feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is present throughout and performs the swan ritual in multiple beats, but all actions are observation and repetition—no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The keeper unfolds the swan, enters the refuge, watches, exits, folds a new swan. Functional presence but no decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge appears in the opening third, is entered mid-story (two beats: threshold and interior), and the final paragraph notes it "was seamless again." It enables the ritual but does not constrain a choice or evolve in meaning. The keeper's interaction is identical each time: press swan, enter, sit, leave. Purposeful early signal and spaced involvement, but the refuge remains a static portal without reweighted cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is named in the second paragraph and echoed in the final section ("The silence was the answer"). It frames the atmosphere but does not shape an on-page decision or tactic—no moment where silence constrains or enables a choice with cost. Theme-claim use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is labeled in the opening paragraph ("Their grip on reality was loose") and mentioned again ("edges blurring"), but the trait is never dramatized in a choice with visible trade-off. No scene where loose reality perception costs the keeper something or enables a tactic that tighter perception would not. Label-only attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Burrow" appears once in the third paragraph ("to burrow into the quiet") as a metaphor for immersion, not a repeated physical action that drives turns. It does not return or shape the closure. Single ornamental mention; swappable with "sink," "settle," or "retreat."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The origami swan is signaled early (first third), used in two beats (unfolding to open the refuge, dissolving inside, folding a new swan at the end), and present in the final paragraph. It enables the threshold crossing and the closing ritual. However, the mechanics never constrain a choice—the swan always works identically, no cost or friction. Spaced involvement and closure presence earn mid-band, but the method is a key rather than a tactic that shapes attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The overgrown library and catacombs are established in the opening lines, anchor all action, and supply physical resources (river, shelves, moss corner). The setting pressures the keeper's seclusion and the refuge's location along the river matters spatially. The final image ("library swallow them whole") reprises the space with slight reconfiguration. The library does not force a tactical choice, but it constrains the keeper's world and charges the ending. Solid integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Untold seasons" appears in the opening and "years" and "long ago" scatter the text, but no live clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. The timeframe is deliberately vague and static—time "drifted," "pooled"—which suits the mood but does not create pressure. Functional to tone but does not drive escalation. Mentioned, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To witness change without judgment" is stated in the refuge section and underlies the keeper's repeated watching, but the desire is never dramatized in friction or conflicted choice. The keeper succeeds in witnessing without obstacle or cost on the page; no moment where judgment intrudes or witnessing exacts a visible price. Told-only motivation with no on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Crumbling peace" is signaled in the second paragraph and sustained through consistent imagery: decay, moss, groaning shelves, slow water. The tone modulates slightly (the refuge is "deeper, alive"; the final image is calm resignation), and the closing lines charge the tone with a faint intensification ("sharp enough to cut," "swallow them whole"). Coherent across beats and purposefully resonant at the end, though the shift is subtle rather than decisive.</comment>
