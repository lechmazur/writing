<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elyas's motivation to decode the watchers is established and his interiority shows purposeful focus ("quietly driven, not by fear, but by the gnawing certainty"), but the protagonist remains largely observational until the final sequence. His micro-choices—kneeling, blowing the whistle, pressing his forehead—read as ritualized rather than conflicted. The final walk forward carries cost (whistle crumbles, city trembles), but the embodied emotion and internal contradiction needed to elevate the choice are abstracted by lyric distance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through pattern revelation (cracks as language, watchers as memory-keepers, gate as threshold) and coheres at closure when Elyas steps through and the gate "screams." Orientation is prompt (city, cartographer, watchers on horizon) by the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elyas crosses to the watchers with the city beginning to move, reweighting the expedition's fate and his own waiting. Cost is felt in the whistle's dust and the city's trembling foundation, though the consequence remains poised rather than paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is vivid and purposeful: the grooves encode maps, cracks speak, the turtles' exhalations mark time and anchor the watchers' shifts. Spatial choreography is clear (horizon, edge of city, gate), and the shells constrain Elyas's knowledge-gathering method. The reed whistle and the cracked shell function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection (pressure in the grooves, harmonic resonance in his ribs, gate's scream) is filtered through Elyas's cartographic focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the watchers and the expedition's fate. Pressure accumulates through each revelation (map crack, harmonic reply, watchers' advance, twin gate) and tightens when Elyas blows the final sequence, forcing the watchers to approach and the gate to open. Agency is present in his decision to sound the notes and step forward, with visible cost (whistle crumbles, city destabilizes). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shells reveal the expedition was "taken" rather than lost, narrowing Elyas's options to confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: maps as invitations, asking as destination, the expedition as "waiting" rather than lost. The final image (Elyas stepping through the watchers as the gate screams and the city remembers how to move) reweights the opening premise without explicit moralizing. However, the penultimate line—"Some questions weren't meant to be answered—only asked, again and again, until the asking itself became the destination"—edges toward thematic echo by articulating the story's thesis in near-prompt language, reducing resonance by ~0.4–0.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elyas; perceptual signature is consistent (cartographic framing, pattern recognition, haptic and auditory focus). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated for a scholarly cartographer decoding ancient languages. The lyric compression ("threads of light," "chorus of voices not meant for human ears") serves the textural lens and charges the ending. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully between intimate (palm to fracture) and panoramic (watchers turning as one).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse, but several beats carry overwritten figurative density without pattern-teaching: "silhouette unspooling into threads of light," "their silence splitting into a chorus of voices not meant for human ears." The final third contains template cadence in short declarative runs ("The watchers parted... The city trembled... The expedition had never been lost") that flatten propulsion at closure. Minor paraphrase loop: "The watchers were no longer on the horizon. / They were at the edge of the city" restates position without added pressure. Deductions: density without payoff −0.5, template cadence in closure third −0.6, paraphrase loop −0.2; total −1.3, capping at 6.9 per artifact-in-closure-third disallow-9+ rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of turtle-shell city, cartographic pattern language, and watchers as threshold-guardians is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms familiar "lost expedition" material through the crack-as-communication mechanic and the gate's dual function (seal-in vs. seal-out). However, the emotional arc (solitary scholar decodes mystery, steps toward unknown) follows a recognizable template, and the final sequence's lyricism prioritizes atmosphere over fresh human complexity. No proximity echoes detected; occupational detail (cartography, reed whistle coordinates) is well-integrated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elyas is present throughout and his choices (kneeling, blowing the whistle sequence, stepping forward) drive the final two beats. Setup is immediate (cartographer tracing grooves), development involves decoding the shells, and payoff is his walk through the watchers. However, most middle beats are observational (he reads patterns, feels resonance) rather than decisive until the ending. Causal pressure is moderate; cost is visible (whistle crumbles). Two beats with agency, closure linkage present, but swappability is moderate—another knowledge-seeker could fill the role with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.6, summary-only middle −0.4 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reed whistle appears in beat 1 (hung silent, once sang coordinates), beat 2 (Elyas lifts it and blows the expedition leader's melody), beat 3 (next note cracks the air, watchers advance), and closure (crumbles to dust, purpose fulfilled). Setup early, development constrains the communication method, payoff is integral to the gate's opening. Specificity is high (coordinates, melody, harmonic reply, dust). Cost is tied to its destruction. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.5 = 7.8 (round down). Irreplaceability is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lost expedition is seeded early (map of Northern Wastes where they vanished), developed when Elyas realizes they were "taken" rather than lost, and reweighted at closure ("The expedition had never been lost. / Only waiting"). Setup present, development alters Elyas's understanding, payoff reframes the premise. However, the expedition's fate is told rather than dramatized, and no expedition member appears on the page; their absence limits causal pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.4 = 5.9 (round down). Missing middle dramatization caps potential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is stated early ("quietly driven, not by fear, but by the gnawing certainty") and implied in his decade of decoding and the final unhesitant advance. However, the trait is label-only; no on-page moment shows a tradeoff between quiet persistence and another impulse. It colors his affect but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Early signal +0.4, one beat (closure walk) +0.4, label-only −0.5, ornamental middle −0.5 = 4.8 (round down). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development would apply, but closure participation lifts it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crack is central: Elyas kneels at the fracture (beat 1), it splits the map and whispers old languages (beat 2), it replies harmonically and pulses with translated watcher question (beat 3), and he presses his forehead to it for the final sequence that realigns the shells (closure). Setup, development, and payoff all present. The crack enables the communication method and cannot be swapped. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4 = 8.1 (round down). Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Pattern languages" appears early (stress fractures as warnings, breaths encoding paths), is developed when Elyas decodes the watcher's advance as a question, and is essential at closure when the final sequence realigns the shells and opens the twin gate. The mechanic is signaled and shapes multiple attempts. Setup present, development constrains the method, payoff integral. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 = 7.3 (round down). The method is irreplaceable but slightly abstracted in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is introduced immediately, the shells supply the maps and communication substrate (beats 1–3), and at closure the turtles groan and the city "remembers how to move," directly affecting outcome. The shells constrain Elyas's knowledge-gathering and enable the pattern-language method. Setup, development, and payoff all strong. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5 = 7.6 (round down). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted gate is present from the opening ("before the gate rusted shut"), frames the watchers' spatial fixation ("shadows stretched only toward the rusted gate"), and at closure "began to scream" as Elyas steps through. Setup and payoff present; the timeframe provides backdrop pressure (city sealed, watchers arrived after). However, the gate's closure does not tighten a live clock or alter Elyas's tactics mid-scene—it is static context until the ending. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, static middle development −0.5, swappability −0.4 = 6.4 (round down). Lyric reprise reweights but does not drive choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elyas's desire to question the watchers is stated early ("years decoding the patterns in their silence") and drives his final approach. The motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choice; no on-page beat shows friction between this want and a competing cost until closure. Setup present, payoff is the walk toward the watchers, but middle development lacks a visible tradeoff. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.7, told-only friction −0.6 = 6.7 (round down). Desire is consistent but not tested until the end.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is coherent throughout: bright particulars (spiral-shell, reed, horizon shimmer) layered with threat (watchers, sealed gate, taken expedition). Tone modulates from patient observation to charged confrontation and charges the final image (gate's scream, city's tremor, Elyas's unhesitant advance). Diction and rhythm support the accumulative lens. Setup early, development consistent, payoff integral. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7 = 7.7 (round down). Tone is indispensable to the story's atmospheric escalation.</comment>
