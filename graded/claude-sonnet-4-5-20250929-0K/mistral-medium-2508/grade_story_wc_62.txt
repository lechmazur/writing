<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carver's motivation is clearly established and his internal conflict between grief and craft drives choices. The spectral father's intervention is embodied through physical guidance of hands, though the carver's acceptance lacks visible hesitation or cost. The daughter's trembling at the table suggests emerging characterization, but her presence feels designed to receive the lesson rather than complicate it. The final smile and teaching resolve too smoothly without wrestling through contradictory impulses in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered imagery (butterflies, ribbon, hollows) toward a final reconfiguration where collective grief becomes "a door" rather than "a wound." Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the butterfly placed on the table crystallizes options and reweights the opening question with visible ritual cost. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The tightening occurs through the shift from carving names to carving hollows, then to teaching the daughter, with the cost legible in the carver's smile and the thunder's confirmation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse at dusk anchors the opening with vivid sensory detail (cracked glass, bruised violet, wet soil, fading jasmine). The butterflies function as both atmosphere and a constraining presence that blocks light and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The stone, chisel, and ribbon roll are handled tactilely across beats. The greenhouse-to-house transition is clean, and the storm outside mirrors internal pressure at the dinner table without becoming overtly symbolic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and tightens through the father's lesson ("Grief isn't a line. It's the space between them"). The carver's chisel slip and the resulting crack in Liora's stone provide a micro-reversal that deepens pressure. Agency manifests in the shift from etching letters to hollowing space, then in the decision to teach the daughter. The cost is visible: fifteen years of weight, the scream never voiced, and the acceptance of guidance from the dead. The final image of the butterfly on the table forecloses solitary mourning and commits the family to shared ritual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between absence and presence, hollows and fullness, without didactic statement. The recurring images (butterflies, ribbon roll, hollows) gain resonance through accumulated pressure rather than mechanical repetition. The father's spectral lesson ("names are just the edges of the story") reframes the carver's work without moralizing. The final image—grief as "a door…one they could open together"—offers a non-literal answer to the opening question with conceptual cost. The grandmother's belief in butterflies as "the breath of the dead" moves from scoffed-at superstition to embodied truth, earning the shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains consistent focus on the carver's perception throughout. Psychic distance is controlled, tightening during the chisel slip and the spectral encounter. Diction remains within the carver's voice, though phrases like "a current" and "the hollows" occasionally drift toward thematic articulation. The father's italicized voice is distinct and purposeful. The daughter's whispered line and the carver's smile feel slightly under-embodied for the weight of the moment. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance supports the meditative tone without stalling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively, with shorter beats during the chisel slip and longer passages during reflection. Some phrases lean toward elevated register: "pressure coiling around him," "veined with starlight," "constellations." The opening paragraph carries strong sensory density. Minor template patterns appear: "The carver [verb]" repeated across several paragraphs. The final two paragraphs compress multiple beats (walking to the house, dinner, the butterfly exchange, the ending epiphany) with summary phrasing ("as the butterflies returned each year, as the stone weathered") that flattens immediacy. Information density is high in the greenhouse scene but thins toward the end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of spectral mentorship, butterfly migration, and gravestone carving creates a specific angle on grief ritual. The shift from carving names to carving hollows offers a fresh conceptual turn. The ribbon roll as a multi-generational poem repository is particular. The story avoids stock grief templates by grounding the carver's realization in physical craft and family custom. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending elevates the piece. Some elements (butterflies as breath of the dead, rain on wings like chisel on stone) approach familiar metaphor without fully transforming it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carver is present throughout and makes the key choice to hollow space rather than etch letters, then to place the butterfly on the table. The chisel slip is an action, but the father's guidance does much of the conceptual work. The carver's smile and teaching moment at the end demonstrate decision, though the cost of accepting spectral mentorship is implied rather than dramatized as internal friction. Established early, shapes two beats (the hollowing, the dinner), and participates in closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ribbon roll is introduced early, handled when the carver unspools it to find his sister's poem, and returned to at dinner when it will be "passed again." It appears in three beats but its mechanics are described more than used to constrain choice. The carver adds his own poem beneath his sister's, a functional action. At dinner, it is gestured toward but not shown being traded. The object's presence supports theme but does not alter tactics or create visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is dramatized on the page when the father's translucent hands adjust the carver's grip, teaching him to carve hollows instead of lines. This intervention changes the carver's approach and redefines the gravestone's purpose. The concept is signaled as "a family custom older than the ribbon roll" and shapes the central turn. The father's dissolution and final instruction ("Trade this at dinner") drive the ending. The concept is causally active, not merely thematic, and its cost (accepting guidance from the dead) is visible in the carver's exhale and letting himself "be led."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is claimed implicitly in the carver's sustained focus and the thoughtful pacing, but the trait is not tested by a competing impulse or shown to constrain an action with cost. The carver pauses, retraces, exhales, and sets the chisel again—actions that suggest meditation—but no moment dramatizes the "fierce" half of the attribute in conflict with the meditative stance. The trait is atmospherically consistent but does not drive a turn or foreclose an option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears explicitly when the carver retraces the letters on Liora's stone, triggering the chisel slip and the crack that represents his unvoiced scream. This action initiates the spectral encounter and the lesson about carving hollows. The verb recurs thematically in the idea of retracing the family's grief through the ribbon roll and poems. The action is causally necessary to the major turn, though it could be replaced by another preparatory gesture (e.g., "polish," "measure") without fundamentally breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The custom of trading poems at dinner is introduced early in the second paragraph, signaled as a multi-generational tradition via the ribbon roll. It frames the ending when the carver places the butterfly on the table and his daughter takes it. The method's mechanics (reading poems, passing the ribbon) are described but not shown in action during the dinner scene itself. The carver's addition of his own poem to the ribbon demonstrates engagement with the method. It shapes the ending's ritual stakes but does not constrain middle tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse provides the entire first two-thirds setting, anchoring the carver in "damp earth," "cracked glass," and among tools and stone. The butterflies' arrival transforms the space into "a lantern" with projected constellations, charging the atmosphere and pressuring the carver's work by blocking light. The greenhouse's threshold is crossed purposefully when the carver steps out into rain. The setting constrains the spectral encounter and supplies the sensory texture (jasmine, violet dusk) that modulates tone. Its "ancient" quality and liminal dusk timing support the spectral custom.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The butterfly migration is introduced in the second paragraph and functions as a temporal bracket: "The migration would last three days. By the end, he would teach her…" This timeframe is declared but not dramatically tracked beat by beat. The butterflies arrive on cue, thicken, and are present at dinner, but no on-page pressure arises from the three-day limit. The migration anchors the ending's ritual cycle ("as the butterflies returned each year") and provides atmospheric escalation, but does not tighten decisions within the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover the shape of collective grief"—is introduced as the opening question ("Could grief be carved?") and recurs when the carver realizes he must "carve the hollows until they become a shape we can all live in." This desire drives the shift from solitary carving to teaching the daughter. The cost is legible: fifteen years of solitary mourning and the acceptance of spectral guidance. The motivation is dramatized through the chisel work and the final butterfly trade, though the phrase "collective grief" leans abstract. Friction exists between the carver's impulse to carve names (individual markers) and the father's lesson about space.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is enacted through the juxtaposition of quiet, meditative beats (kneeling, retracing, exhaling) and sudden intensity (the chisel slip, the crack, the spectral presence). Thunder appears twice: first as "the moment before thunder breaks" (pressure without sound), then as literal thunder that "arrived not as sound, but as a vibration in his ribs." Rain falls "like a chisel on stone." The tone modulates with pressure, tightening during the spectral encounter and softening at dinner, then charging the final image with the thunder's "confirmation." The oxymoron is sustained through syntax and imagery rather than stated.</comment>
