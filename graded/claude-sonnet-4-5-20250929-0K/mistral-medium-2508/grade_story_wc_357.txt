<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veyra's motivations are clear and intensify through the discovery sequence, but her interior experience relies heavily on stock adventure-pilot gestures (breath hitched, grinned) rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The mentor backstory seeds the quest but remains exposition; the final transformation ("wasn't just a pilot anymore") asserts change without embodying the contradictory cost of that shift. The moss spreading on her skin offers a concrete physical marker, yet the piece never dramatizes her struggle with or resistance to this alteration—she simply accepts and smiles, flattening what could have been genuine conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered discovery beats (moss, arch-mouth, seed, sapling) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights "resilience" from sought mystery to embodied instruction. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The closure lands with Veyra's bodily transformation and resolve to plant the sapling at the core, reconfiguring her role from seeker to answer-carrier. However, cost remains largely asserted rather than felt on the page: the mentor's arrow crumbles (symbolic but not visceral), and Veyra's acceptance of the moss lacks visible friction or trade-off, weakening the final beat's charge under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard planet's inversion mechanics, floating arches, upward-flowing river, and bioluminescent moss are vivid and purposefully filter through Veyra's professional attention (glider shudder, rudder adjustment). Spatial choreography remains coherent across the dive and landing. The arch-as-mouth and seed discovery constrain her final choice to plant at the core, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—closer approach intensifies moss-pulse detail—and the world rules (gravity flip, accelerated growth) stay consistent and shape tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>One dominant stake—find the source of resilience—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery sequence (moss properties → arch fracture → seed retrieval). Veyra's agency drives each beat: she chooses to dive, land, reach inside, and aim for the core. The inversion's hour functions as a live clock that forces her retreat and return. However, the escalation is largely additive (new wonders appear) rather than a genuine narrowing of options or forced trade-off; Veyra never loses anything or confronts a competing cost on the page, muting the pressure that would elevate this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—resilience as growth rather than discovery—emerges through concrete images (moss, seed, sapling) without overt thesis statements until the penultimate line ("resilience wasn't something you found. It was something you *grew*"), which borders on moralizing but is anchored by prior embodiment. The echoes-as-instructions twist and the moss-transformation reweight the mentor's mystery with thematic resonance. The final image (aiming for the core, silence as held breath) offers a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the mentor's absence and the arrow's crumbling, though the ending risks slight over-articulation of its own meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent distance and a clear perceptual signature—Veyra notices glider mechanics, moss pulse, and the upward river through a pilot's trained attention. Diction is mostly controlled, though stock adventure phrases ("breath hitched," "grinned," "smiled") and italicized emphasis (*accelerated*, *creation*, *instructions*, *grew*, *singing*) inflate emotional beats that the prose has already earned, signaling authorial anxiety rather than voice confidence. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully through the inversion sequence, and the "whirling silence" motif recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final beat despite the occasional tic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or world detail. However, runs of italicized emphasis (*accelerated*, *creation*, *mouth*, *pulsed*, *singing*, *instructions*, *grew*) in peak beats function as emotional scaffolding, telling the reader which moments matter rather than trusting the dramatization—this triggers the filter/artifact penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "It was something you *grew*" repeats the sapling-growth image already shown on the page. The moss-spread description ("prickled with new strength, veins thrumming") stacks generic body-charge clichés. Propulsion remains strong through the dive and discovery sequence, but line-level craft slips when the piece most needs precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard-planet inversion, floating arches, and gravity-flip mechanic offer a vivid SFF frame; the moss-as-growth-accelerant and echoes-as-instructions provide a fresh synthesis of environment and theme. However, the mentor-vanished-with-a-mystery setup and the protagonist-discovers-transformative-seed arc follow familiar genre templates without sharp deviation. The arrow-tip relic crumbles conveniently at the moment of understanding, a symbolic gesture that lacks friction. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes competently, but the core turns feel predictable in hindsight rather than inevitable through specific, non-obvious character calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyra as intrepid orchard pilot is established immediately, her profession shapes every choice (adjusting rudder, banking hard, navigating by currents, landing on the arch), and her final decision to aim for the planet's core and plant the sapling drives the closure. Two distinct beats: mid-flight discovery and the post-inversion resolve. Her agency is visible and causal throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip is introduced early as a mentor relic, vibrates at the arch-mouth discovery (a concrete callback), and crumbles at the moment Veyra gains understanding—a purposeful lyric reprise. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics; its role is symbolic resonance rather than causal pressure. The piece satisfies the two-gate minimum (setup, payoff) but lacks middle development and swappability is high (any mentor token could serve the same function).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"A gathering of echoes" is seeded early (mentor's voice "echoing in the hollows of the arches"), recurs as the arch-mouth hum and the soundless whirling silence, and is reweighted at closure ("echoes weren't ghosts. They were *instructions*"). The concept shapes Veyra's interpretation of the planet's signals and charges the final image ("arches hummed in harmony, their echoes… gathered… into a chorus"). It participates in closure but does not constrain a tactical choice on the page; its role is thematic resonance rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Accelerated growth is discovered early ("coaxing seeds to sprout midair, vines to lash out like whips, all within minutes") and demonstrated again when the retrieved seed splits and unfurls a sapling on the page. The trait is specific and irreplaceable—it underpins the planet's resilience mechanism—and shapes Veyra's understanding at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; its function is world-logic and thematic illustration rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Discover" is the narrative spine: Veyra discovers the moss-pulse correlation, the arch-mouth, the seed, and finally the planet's instruction. Every beat traces to this action, and the closure hinges on her interpretation of what she has discovered (echoes as instructions, resilience as growth). The action is specific and drives two major turns (arch-mouth descent, seed retrieval). It is not easily swappable; substituting "fight" or "escape" would require a full narrative rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is signaled early ("navigating by the shifting currents of an underground river now flowing *upward*") and its mechanics matter—the inverted river provides a visible reference during the gravity-flip, shaping Veyra's spatial orientation. The method appears in one distinct beat (the initial bank-and-dive sequence) and is used to ground the reader in the inversion's disorienting environment. It does not constrain a later choice or return at closure, capping its integration, but its presence is purposeful and specific to the setting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is established immediately and pressures every choice: gravity inversion forces the flight, the arches provide landmarks and the final discovery site, the upward-flowing water guides navigation, and the arch-mouth supplies the seed. The setting is indispensable—removing the arches would collapse the story's spatial logic and closure mechanism. Multiple beats involve environment-driven tactics (banking past boulders, diving to inverted treetops, landing on the arch curve). The final image (glider soaring over golden groves, aiming for the core) is charged by the setting's established scale and mystery.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The inversion's hour is mentioned early ("the inversion's hour was ending") and provides a live clock that forces Veyra's retreat ("barely had time to shove the seed into her belt before the glider lurched skyward"). The timeframe tightens one decision—she must leave the arch before gravity resets—but the piece does not track elapsed time during the dive or landing, and the hour constraint does not recur or shape the post-inversion resolve. Functional but underutilized; more consistent time-pressure tracking would raise integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Find the source of resilience" is Veyra's stated goal from the mentor's last transmission and drives her choice to fly into the inversion, dive to the arch, and reach inside. The motivation is dramatized through her actions and the mentor-relic callback. At closure, the discovery redefines resilience from external source to embodied practice ("resilience wasn't something you found. It was something you *grew*"), and Veyra's resolve to plant the sapling at the core enacts the shift. The friction between seeking and becoming is present but understated—Veyra accepts the transformation without visible internal cost, muting the motivation's full dramatic charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" is introduced at the arch-mouth ("a soundless hum, a whirling silence that pressed against her eardrums like a physical force"), recurs when the sapling unfurls ("*singing* in a voice that wasn't sound but something older"), and charges the final image ("the silence didn't feel empty. It felt like a breath held before a shout"). The tone is coherent across the inversion's disorientation and Veyra's discovery, modulates with pressure (from physical force to bloom of understanding), and reweights the dominant stake at closure. The phrase is specific, irreplaceable, and integral to the story's sensory and thematic architecture.</comment>
