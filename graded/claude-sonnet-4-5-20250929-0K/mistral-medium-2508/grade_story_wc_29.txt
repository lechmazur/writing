<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interior is concrete and embodied ("thumb hovered," "cautiously hopeful heart pounding"), with professional competence balanced by isolation and doubt. Her agency drives the key choice to transmit the counter-signal, foreclosing her academic safety with visible cost. However, the protagonist's arc feels somewhat passive in the middle—she calibrates and watches reactions rather than making multiple on-page choices under contradictory pressures. The final beat ("the universe was still talking. And now, so was she") lands as intention rather than a fully earned renunciation with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (Liora, radio station basement, present night). The piece operates under a Situational lens: external pressure (the signal, university fractures) forces Liora's stance crystallization. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—she engages the signal, the community pauses, and her final choice to continue the dialogue reconfigures her status from outcast to participant with undeniable conceptual cost (defying the dean, risking further censure). One meaningful tightening occurs when the signal responds with "laughter" and then shifts to curiosity. Cost is felt in her isolation and the dean's search, though the exact price remains implicit rather than dramatized in a final forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The basement radio station is vivid and purposeful: "forgotten current," "equipment older than the university's newest power struggles," charts with "smudged" ink. Spatial choreography is clean (headphones, console, dial, door). The setting constrains choice—Liora's access is limited to this neglected space after her keycard was revoked. The recurring charts and the dial return at closure, charging the final image. Sensory selection (static "like angry stars," pressure in skull, ventilation kick) reflects urgency and POV filter effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prove the signal is manipulative and disrupt its pattern to restore agency. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora sends the first pulse and the signal "knew"—the response as laughter raises cost. Her choice to adjust frequency again and persist narrows options (defying the dean, accepting isolation). The final image shows consequence: the campus pauses, the signal shifts to curiosity, and the dean searches for her. However, the escalation is somewhat linear—Liora calibrates, transmits, observes—without a second on-page reversal that forces a harder trade-off. Coincidence does not resolve; her action drives the change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: communication as resistance, proving agency against unseen manipulation, and the university's fractures as microcosm of cosmic indifference. The signal's alignment with community divisions is a strong particular that grounds the concept. The ending avoids overt moralizing; "I was just fixing the radio" and her decision to keep talking offer a resonant, non-literal answer to whether humans are pawns. The charts as recurring motif constrain her approach and charge the closure without becoming a token symbol. Minor slip: "proof they'd survived something" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance modulating cleanly (tight during transmission beats, wider for context). Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices frequencies, patterns, academic politics filtered through her exile. Diction remains within her register ("celestial signal interpreter," "cosmic chatter," "dare"). The grad student's brief dialogue feels natural and advances plot. Minor issue: "the air still thrummed with something unspoken" is slightly abstract for the established concrete voice, and "laughter, or something like it" hedges where a more definite choice would sharpen the beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. The opening simile ("nest of angry stars") is vivid and voice-consistent. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor issues: "the university's divisions felt less like wounds and more like scars—proof they'd survived something" edges toward summary in a peak moment, and "the charts fluttered as the ventilation kicked on, the inked stars seeming to shift" stacks two passive constructions where a sharper verb choice would propel. Clarity remains strong throughout; no artifacts obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—cosmic signal manipulating human conflict, outwitted by subsonic interference—offers a fresh synthesis of first-contact and academic-politics genres. Liora's exile and her use of forgotten equipment are specific rather than generic. The transformation test mostly passes: the emotional arc and thematic question depend on these particulars. However, the "trickster aliens observing human division" setup trends toward a familiar SFF template, and the piece does not fully subvert or deepen it beyond the surface. The ending's shift from predatory to curious reads as convenient rather than a hard-won reversal with visible cost to Liora's understanding or safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora as celestial signal interpreter is signaled in paragraph 5, frames her expertise and exile, and drives the key choice to transmit the counter-signal. Her professional knowledge enables the tactic (subsonic frequencies) and her isolation motivates the risk. The role appears in the closure beat ("I was just fixing the radio") with ironic reweighting. Two beats: calibration decision and transmission. Causal pressure is solid; visible cost is her defiance of the dean. Strong integration, though her passivity in the middle (observing rather than making multiple hard choices) prevents full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in paragraph 3 ("spread across the console," "inked constellations smudged," "margins scribbled with frequencies"), return when the ventilation kicks on ("the charts fluttered," "inked stars seeming to shift"), and are present at closure ("the charts rustling under her elbow"). They prove the signal's alignment with community fractures and frame her tactical approach. Two beats: initial evidence and closure reprise. However, the charts are more prop than active constraint—they inform her choice but do not narrow options or impose a cost in the moment. Lyric reprise reweights them as proof of survival, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Power plays shape the on-page conflict: faculty factions, grant disputes, the dean's loyalty memos, and Liora's exile are all power struggles. The signal's manipulation of these divisions is the central stakes driver. The concept appears early (paragraph 6-7) and culminates in Liora's counter-play to disrupt the pattern. Two beats: the university's fractures as setup and Liora's interference as climax. Causal pressure is clear—power plays motivate her isolation and her gambit. However, the concept operates more as thematic backdrop than as a tactical constraint that forces specific hard choices on the page, keeping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is stated once ("her cautiously hopeful heart pounding," paragraph 13) during the transmission beat. The trait fits her risk-taking within professional bounds but is label-only; no on-page action shows her balancing caution against hope with visible cost. The attribute does not constrain her choice—she proceeds with the gambit without dramatized hesitation or a moment where caution nearly prevents her action. Functional presence in a key beat but no demonstrated trade-off, capping it in low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Interfere" is signaled in paragraph 9 ("if she could interfere, just enough to disrupt the pattern"), executed in paragraph 11 ("The first pulse sent a shiver"), and drives the climax when the signal responds and shifts. Three beats: decision, action, and consequence. The action is causally indispensable—removing it collapses the plot and closure. Visible cost: Liora's defiance of the dean and acceptance of further exile. The specificity (subsonic counter-melody) ties to her expertise and the method element. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are introduced in paragraph 10 ("subsonic frequencies were her gambit, a counter-melody too low for human ears"), appear in the transmission beat (paragraph 11, "The first pulse"), and are adjusted in paragraph 13 ("She adjusted the frequency again, finer this time"). The method is specific, tied to Liora's expertise, and enables her tactic. Two beats: initial transmission and fine adjustment. The mechanics matter—human inaudibility is the key to bypassing conventional communication. However, the method is introduced relatively late (~40% mark) and could be swapped for another technical interference without deep story rupture, capping it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>University radio station in the basement of the old physics hall is anchored in paragraph 2, provides the resource Liora needs after her keycard was revoked (paragraph 2, "the astronomy building's doors locked tight"), and frames the final beat (the grad student's arrival, the dean's search). The setting constrains her choices—she must use forgotten equipment, work in isolation, and accept the risk of discovery. Three beats: setup as refuge, the physical act of transmission, and closure confrontation. Micro-setting (the console, dial, headphones) charges the final image. Essential to her tactics and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"As the community divides" frames the entire narrative: faculty factions, the grad student walkout, the physics/astronomy split all occur in the present window and escalate to the quad chanting. The timeframe is signaled early (paragraph 7, "The university was splitting at the seams") and culminates in real-time when Liora's pulse pauses the arguments and protests. However, the timeline is vague—"three nights ago" anchors the signal change, but the story does not track a ticking clock that forces faster decisions. The divisions motivate Liora's action but do not tighten her window in a way that alters her tactics beat-by-beat, keeping it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The desire to outwit cosmic tricksters is stated in paragraph 10 ("outwit whatever tricksters lurked in the dark"), motivates the transmission gambit, and is dramatized when the signal responds with "laughter" and then shifts to curiosity. The motivation is conflicted—Liora's hope wars with caution, and she accepts the cost of defying the dean. Two beats: decision and climax. However, the "tricksters" framing is somewhat abstract and not deeply embodied in her interior struggle; the desire reads more as professional pride than a visceral need. Functional with moderate pressure but not fully indispensable, mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Ethereal grit is coherent throughout: "static hissed like angry stars," "cosmic chatter," "pressure in her skull, a soundless hum," combined with concrete basement setting, academic exile, and manual dial adjustments. Tone modulates with pressure—calm in the setup, tense during transmission, expansive at closure ("The universe was still talking. And now, so was she"). The final image charges the tone without overt statement. No single static mood; the blend of the numinous and the material is sustained across turns. Strong integration that shapes the reader's experience and supports the thematic question.</comment>
