<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's core contradiction (arsonist's daughter turned firefighter) is established, but her interior life remains largely abstract. The boy-rescue demonstrates competence without meaningful internal conflict—she moves through the sequence with professional smoothness rather than dramatized ambivalence. The village's judgment is told rather than felt through micro-choices under pressure. The final "she had long since learned to tell them apart" asserts resolution without showing the cost of that knowledge in a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with symbolic recurrence (black sand, coin, red thread, fire/healing duality). Orientation is clean. The boy's injury provides a micro-reversal, but it functions more as demonstration than escalation—Liora's stance does not meaningfully shift. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the final alarm, but the cost remains abstract: "she had long since learned to tell them apart" tells us the work is already done off-page. The ending gesture (running toward smoke with coin pulsing) is atmospheric but does not reconfigure options or exact visible price in the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, volcanic black sand, and fireproof coat anchor setting with specificity. The coin's weight "steady against her ribs" provides recurring tactile pressure. The lagoon functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—the boy could bleed anywhere. Strong sensory texture ("kelp-drift peace," "clouds...like kelp on an unseen tide") occasionally tips into decorative lyricism that pauses momentum rather than charging action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving compassion as strength, not weakness) is signaled but never concretely tested. The boy's rescue is low-cost: Liora faces no dilemma, no material trade-off, no choice that forecloses another path. The village's whispers remain distant threat rather than present pressure. The final alarm offers potential escalation but occurs off-page. One tightening is present (wound-binding with the red thread), but it demonstrates existing skill rather than forcing a values-choice under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (compassion as fire that warms rather than consumes) is coherent and emerges through imagery. The coin/thread/scar constellation recurs with modest reweighting. However, key insights are stated rather than earned: "compassion wasn't the absence of fire. It was the choice to let it warm instead of consume" is articulated wisdom rather than discovery forged through on-page friction. The boy's question about scars invites earned reflection but Liora's answer ("All the best stories do") feels like delivered philosophy rather than hard-won truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with strong sensory signature ("jagged," "crackling like dry kindling," "kelp-drift peace"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully. The boy's single line of dialogue feels natural. However, several passages drift into elevated register that exceeds the immediate perceptual frame: "graft it to something new," "migration of clouds above mirrored the slow, deliberate rhythm of her work." Filter verbs are used sparingly and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent. Three friction points: (1) "gracefully alert precision" stacks modifiers without clear embodiment; (2) "kelp-drift peace" recurs as atmospheric label without fresh inflection; (3) minor paraphrase loop in paragraph 8–9 restating the village's judgment and Liora's counter-knowledge. Information density is generally high. Syntax varies effectively. The "migration of clouds" motif appears three times but does not meaningfully evolve—it reads as atmospheric recurrence rather than pressure device.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arsonist's-daughter-firefighter premise is familiar but given specific grounding through the black sand, drilled coin, and red thread. The synthesis of fire/healing duality with scar-as-song is handled with sincerity. However, the emotional arc (Liora has already reconciled her dual nature before the story opens) and the village-judgment motif are well-worn. The boy's rescue does not transform Liora's stance; it demonstrates what she already knows. Risk is modest: the piece commits to its lyric texture but avoids putting Liora's compassion under genuine duress.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her profession matters (fireproof coat, firefighter's lore, station hearth, final alarm). However, her role as firefighter functions more as thematic parallel than causal driver—the rescue uses first-aid skill, not fire-response. Her choices (binding the wound, sewing the coin, running toward the alarm) demonstrate existing commitments rather than forcing new decisions. Present in all three gates but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Black sand appears in the opening beat with strong specificity ("jagged, a remnant of the fire") and is promised return in the final section ("she would return to it"). Middle development is thin: the sand anchors memory but does not constrain or enable the boy-rescue choice. It functions as thematic marker (fire's aftermath) rather than tactical resource. Two-gate presence with lyric reprise; setup and payoff signal are clear but causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is named directly and illustrated through the rescue, but it does not create friction or cost on the page. Liora's compassion flows without obstacle—no one questions her in scene, no choice pits mercy against safety or duty. The concept operates as thesis rather than pressure generator. Present thematically but does not constrain options or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears in the opening sentence as description of hand movement. It is not revisited or tested; the rescue sequence shows competence but does not dramatize a tension between grace and vigilance. The trait could be replaced with "steady" or "practiced" without structural loss. Label-only mention; no on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Graft" anchors the central image: Liora grafts the coin to her coat, then grafts compassion to her heritage. The word recurs purposefully ("graft it to something new," "sky itself had decided to graft its light to the water"). The boy-rescue enacts grafting (binding wound with red thread). The concept shapes multiple beats and charges the final image (coin pulsing as she runs). Swappable with "mend" or "stitch" at modest cost, but the agricultural/surgical connotation does thematic work. Present across all gates with thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coin is seeded early (father's talisman, drilled and strung on red thread), used in the rescue (thread binds wound, coin's weight anchors Liora's resolve), and pulses in the final beat. It accumulates meaning across three beats: memory of father, tool for first aid, emblem of dual fire. Specificity matters: the drilled hole enables threading, the red thread darkens with blood, the weight is felt. Mechanics shape action; removal would require redesign of the rescue and final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Obsidian lagoon is established early with vivid detail (black sand, volcanic origin, still surface mirroring sky). The boy wades into it, making it the rescue site. However, the lagoon does not constrain choices—any body of water would serve. Its obsidian/volcanic properties echo Liora's fire heritage thematically but do not alter tactics. Present in setup and middle, thematically resonant at closure (dunes/sea horizon), but functionally replaceable. Three-gate presence with strong atmosphere but modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Migration of clouds" appears three times as atmospheric marker but does not function as timeframe or clock. The phrase evokes slow duration but no urgency or deadline. Time remains vague throughout; the boy's rescue could take minutes or an hour. The clouds do not tighten decisions. Ornamental recurrence without temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Scars can sing" is voiced explicitly in dialogue and frames the thematic question. Liora's binding of the boy's wound with the red thread enacts the desire to transform injury into story. However, the motivation is demonstrated more than tested—she faces no friction, no choice where proving this costs her something else. Present in setup (her father's scars), middle (boy's wound), and ending (her own quiet fires), but the friction between wanting and obstacle is minimal. Told and illustrated; choice-friction is low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named once and echoed in imagery (clouds drifting "like kelp on an unseen tide"). The tone is contemplative and textured but does not modulate sharply with the boy's cry—the rescue proceeds with the same measured lyricism. The ending maintains the elegiac register rather than shifting to urgency or triumph. Tone is coherent but static; it does not charge the final image with new pressure. Present as atmosphere, modest participation in closure.</comment>
