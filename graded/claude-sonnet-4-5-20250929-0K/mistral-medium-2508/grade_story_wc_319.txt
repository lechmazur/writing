<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyssa's interior voice carries consistent particularity—the aching teeth, the slippery time—and her final choice to hand over the pendant is earned by accumulated longing. However, the figure's nature remains abstract ("stretched between," "edges blurring"), reducing the relational pressure that might have forced harder trade-offs. The laugh at terror feels psychologically specific, but the dissolution into "vast, breathing page" abstracts the embodied cost of her transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The mist, pendant, and books accumulate pressure toward the final image where Lyssa releases herself into dissolution. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she hands over the pendant and laughs into terror, crystallizing her choice to stop guarding and start dissolving. Cost is legible: she forecloses her role as keeper and her bodily coherence ("words lifting from her bones"). Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~100 words (garden, Lyssa, library ruins). One meaningful deepening occurs when the figure names the books' fear of being read, which reweights Lyssa's guardianship into a prison.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden, skeletal trees, and thawing soil are vivid and selective. The pendant is handled twice (picked up, then handed over), and the mist "inhales" at the transfer, directly charging the closure image. The garden "unravels" into a breathing page, using the micro-setting to visualize the dimensional shift. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to remain keeper or release the books (and herself). The figure's arrival and demand ("Give it back") tightens options. Lyssa's hand-over is an on-page decision with visible cost—her body dissolves, her purpose ends. The escalation is quiet but coherent under the Accumulative lens: the books' whispers become shouts, the mist shifts, the figure appears, Lyssa chooses. Agency is renunciation with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—cages versus release, preservation versus consumption—emerges from the books' homesickness and Lyssa's realization that "purposes could curdle into prisons." The pendant's spiral "eating itself" seeds self-consumption without stating it. The final image ("other side of light... looked exactly like darkness, but softer. Like a friend") offers a non-literal answer: dissolution is intimacy. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight sensory signature: "teeth ached," "hungry cold," "sound of a page turning in an empty room." The figure's dialogue carries subtext (ownership, fear). Psychic distance modulates smoothly—closer during the hand-over, receding into the dissolution. One brief register wobble: "stretched between" and "unfolding from it" lean slightly ornamental but remain within the lyric mode the piece teaches early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; the opening's long breath gives way to clipped exchanges and then dissolves into the lyric final sequence. "She'd heard them for years, a low murmur beneath the creak of shelves and the sigh of turning leaves, but now they were shouting" is dense and propulsive. However, "edges blurring like ink in water" and "roots reversing" are stock metaphors, and "vast, breathing page" borders on purple in a high-pressure beat. No loops or major clarity breaks, but figurative density in the climax nudges the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" books and the spiral pendant eating itself offer a fresh synthesis. The closure—laughing into terror because "uncertainty had been her only friend"—feels earned and non-obvious. The risk of dissolving the protagonist into abstraction is bold and mostly successful; the final image ("other side of light... softer. Like a friend") personalizes the cosmic. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lyssa is present throughout and her final decision to hand over the pendant drives the closure. She constrains herself by waiting, then acts. Setup, development (realization that books want release), and payoff (hand-over and dissolution) are all clear. Her guardianship role shapes every beat. However, "feral" is not dramatized through action—she crouches, traces, waits, but never displays wild or untamed behavior. The descriptor is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pendant appears early (half-buried, picked up), is examined (spiral symbol tied to cultists), hums with "hungry cold" when pressed to sternum, grows heavier, and is handed over in the closure beat, triggering the mist's inhalation and the garden's unraveling. Three distinct beats. Causally active at closure. Irreplaceable: its spiral and ownership drive the figure's demand and Lyssa's release.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The figure promises "the boundaries of light" if Lyssa returns the pendant; the final image delivers "the other side of light... exactly like darkness, but softer." The concept shapes the ending's charge and reweights the cultists' phrase. However, it does not constrain mid-story tactics—Lyssa's waiting and hand-over would proceed identically if the phrase were absent. Present in setup (cultists' chant) and payoff, but not development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is attributed to the books: they whisper "about a place where light didn't cast shadows, where words didn't need pages to exist." This realization shifts Lyssa's stance from keeper to releaser, enabling her final choice. The trait is thematically charged and present in setup and payoff, but it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page scene shows the books acting homesick. One key turn enabled, but swappable with "trapped" or "longing" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Wait" is Lyssa's dominant mode: "Waiting was what she did best. She'd spent a lifetime waiting..." The climax hinges on her cessation of waiting—she acts by handing over the pendant. The action is irreplaceable: the story is built on stasis breaking into motion. Present across beats (she waits in the garden, waits for cultists, then stops waiting and chooses). Causally drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" might map to Lyssa's perception that the garden, mist, and books externalize her internal state, or the books' dimensional longing, but the method is never signaled as a technique or constraint. The dissolution blurs interior/exterior ("the veil slept through her"), but this reads as closure effect, not a means that shaped prior attempts. Ornamental fit at best.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The frozen garden pressures Lyssa throughout: the thawing soil reveals the pendant, the skeletal oak shelters her, the mist "exhales" and later "inhales," directly participating in the climax. The ground dissolves under her feet, making her choice irreversible. Setup, development (pendant found in soil, mist shifts), and payoff (garden unravels) all present. The setting is causally active and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears only in the final sequence: "for now, she slept through the veil, and the veil slept through her." Time has "gone slippery since the fire" and Lyssa "hadn't slept in—well, she couldn't remember," but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. The sleep metaphor charges the closure image but does not constrain tactics. Present in payoff only; late lyric reprise without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lyssa's desire to "make friends with uncertainty" is dramatized: "uncertainty had been her only friend for so long that finally meeting it face-to-face felt like coming home." Her laugh and hand-over enact the motivation with visible cost (dissolution). However, the phrasing is abstract and arrives late; earlier beats frame her as waiting rather than seeking. Present in setup (implicit in her role), development (realization), and payoff (laugh and surrender). One key turn shaped, but the specificity is conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" coheres throughout: concrete sensory anchors (frost, teeth ache, pendant hum) are filtered through dream-logic syntax ("edges blurring," "ground... dissolving into something that wasn't ground"). Tone modulates smoothly from patient observation to climactic dissolution without tonal rupture. The final image—"other side of light... softer. Like a friend"—charges the tone with earned intimacy. Present across all beats and shapes the reader's orientation to the unreal.</comment>
