<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior is largely atmospheric declaration rather than embodied contradiction. Her "decision" to descend and redesign the box arrives as poetic assertion without prior visible resistance or trade-off; the character dissolves into metaphor at the closure beat. The transformation to "canvas" reads label-only, lacking a micro-choice that forecloses a concrete path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the closure unit—"she stepped into it...as the canvas"—offers reconfiguration through metaphor without legible cost on the page. The "redesign" action is told in summary ("began to redesign it...by untangling"), and the walls-closing timeframe never tightens a concrete decision. Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and why she is in the lighthouse remain vague past the first third, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library fusion supplies vivid sensory detail (salt, parchment, ozone, wet ink) and the "walls pressing closer" recurs with purpose. However, the environment does not constrain a visible choice or alter tactics; Elara's actions remain abstract. Spatial choreography (stairs "crumbled long ago," yet she "descends" and "steps into" the dark) is incoherent, breaking the 9+ gate and capping the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—painting truth by "letting the dark shape what remained"—is declared rather than tested. No live option is foreclosed; the "redesign" occurs in summary without visible resistance or cost. The walls' hunger and Elara's surrender carry atmospheric weight but no causal tightening that narrows her choices on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of embracing fragmentation and necessary darkness emerges through recurring images (tarot fragments, luminescent ache, the artist-as-canvas). The final image—fragments floating in "luminescent ache"—offers a non-literal answer. However, the thematic pivot ("she smiled. / Nothing, now.") arrives as epiphany without prior dramatized friction, and the metaphor density in the final third ("part of the story, part of the unmaking") borders on overt philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with vivid metaphor ("its beam a flicker of memory," "the kind of scent that clung to the back of the throat"). However, under peak pressure the voice becomes abstract and over-elevated ("luminescent ache," "part of the unmaking"), losing embodied texture. Psychic distance wavers between close interiority and omniscient narration ("the library's hunger," "the sky was a bruise"), and no dialogue appears to test subtext or goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative density saturates nearly every sentence in the second half without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, triggering the overwriting penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "letting the dark shape what remained" / "a luminescent ache...the kind that lived in the bones" restate atmosphere without advancing causality. Template cadence is present ("She let...," "She smiled," "She reached out"), and the closure beat is metaphor-heavy without concrete action, applying the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frame—artist in a collapsing mystical space confronts creative failure—echoes familiar tropes (tower, tarot, lighthouse as metaphor) without transformation through specific lived detail. The "redesign" action and the final image (fragments floating, artist-as-canvas) read as poetic abstraction rather than a non-obvious synthesis. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece plays safely within lyric-mode conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and identified as a portrait artist whose latest work was called "unfinished." However, her choices (kneeling to gather cards, beginning the redesign, stepping into the dark) are narrated as poetic gestures without visible friction or trade-off. The "crestfallen" attribute is implied but not dramatized; she does not fail or refuse a concrete action that alters tactics. Late-middle involvement and swappability (any artist could perform these acts) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken tarot box appears in paragraph two (Elara tracing its cracks), returns in paragraph seven (she gathers fragments), and again in paragraph twelve ("began to redesign it"), and finally in paragraph nineteen ("hummed in her palms...glowing faintly"). The redesign action hinges on the box's brokenness enabling a new map. However, the mechanics of "untangling threads of each card's meaning" remain abstract, and the box's glow at closure is ornamental rather than causal. Setup, development, and closure presence are met, but specificity and causal pressure are limited.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fragmented reality" is signaled early (tarot cards "scattered like shards of a life") and sustained through imagery (cracks, unraveling, the Tower's collapse becoming a doorway). At closure, the "landscape of fragmented reality" appears explicitly, and the floating fragments embody the concept. However, fragmentation functions as theme and atmosphere rather than a constraint that narrows Elara's options or tactics on the page. Closure linkage lifts the score, but lack of causal pressure limits it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Two rhetorical questions appear on the page: "Why do we cling to the frames we've broken?" (paragraph three) and "What if the pieces don't fit?" (paragraph eight). Both are interior queries without visible consequence; Elara does not pause, revise, or choose differently because of them. A third question ("What do you fear in the dark?") is posed by the library, not Elara. The attribute is ornamental, not a trait that constrains action or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Redesign" is introduced in paragraph twelve ("began to redesign it, not with glue or force, but by untangling the threads") and recurs as the pivot action. The Tower's collapse and the Hanged Man's surrender become doorway and key through this act. However, the redesign itself is told in summary without step-by-step dramatization, and its mechanics remain abstract. The walls' final closure and the fragments floating are atmospheric rather than direct results of the redesign. Setup and middle presence are met, but causal specificity and closure linkage are weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The method "untangling threads of each card's meaning" is named in paragraph twelve and linked to the redesign. The text states that threads "weave into something new: a map of fractures," and the final paragraph describes fragments floating as if "suspended...by all the things that had ever been too bright to hold." However, the untangling is not shown in action; no specific thread is traced or choice made visible. The method is present and thematically consistent but remains metaphorical and non-causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "forgotten library inside a lighthouse" is established in paragraph one and sustained throughout (shelves pressing closer, books sighing, the library's breath, the beam guttering). The dual setting supplies atmosphere and the "walls closing in" timeframe. At closure, "the library's hunger" and "the dark [opening]" participate in the final image. However, the setting does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters Elara's tactics; spatial incoherence (stairs crumbled, yet she descends) undermines causal weight. Presence across all three gates and closure participation elevate, but lack of tactical constraint limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is signaled in paragraph eight ("the library's walls inched inward") and recurs in paragraphs twelve and eighteen ("the walls pressed closer," "the walls had finally closed in"). The timeframe creates atmospheric pressure but does not tighten a visible decision or force a trade-off. Elara's actions proceed without adjustment to the encroaching walls. Setup, middle, and closure presence are met, but the clock does not alter tactics, limiting causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to descend into necessary darkness" is stated explicitly in paragraph nine ("She needed to descend. / Not to escape...but to *see* the dark"). At closure, Elara steps into the dark and answers the library's question ("Nothing, now"). However, the descent is not dramatized as a conflicted choice with visible cost; no resistance or alternative path is foreclosed. The motivation is told and thematically present but lacks friction or visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears explicitly in paragraph seventeen ("the dark *opened*...as presence—a luminescent ache") and again in paragraph twenty ("suspended in the luminescent ache of a world finally seen whole"). The phrase encapsulates the story's tone: beauty in brokenness, melancholy suffused with light. The tone remains coherent and modulates subtly (from dread to acceptance). The final image is charged by this tonal signature. However, the phrase's late first appearance and its function as atmospheric label rather than active constraint limit the score.</comment>
