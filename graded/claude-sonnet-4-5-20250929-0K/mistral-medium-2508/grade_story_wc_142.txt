<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's dual allegiance is clearly established and her internal contradiction operates in scene through micro-choices (prying the chip, embedding it in the mural). However, interiority leans heavily on abstract self-narration ("her dual allegiance gnawed at her") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The protagonist's choices feel motivated but are never genuinely difficult—she consistently chooses resistance without visible internal cost or foreclosed paths, weakening the sense of contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid; the mural sequence links because/therefore but the closure relies on accumulative density ("caught between two worlds, but building a third"). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by ~80 words. The closure offers Charged Poise—Elira's final spray-paint action crystallizes her stance—but the cost is asserted ("There was still time") rather than dramatized on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed in the ending beat. The foundation chip embedding reads as symbolic gesture without tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lumina's carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (kite lanterns, frying dough, sequined masks) and the raft city's fluid architecture matters thematically. The brass cuff and spray cans function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elira's identity and tactics. Spatial choreography is clean across the mural site, fortune-teller's stall, and clocktower. The setting charges the final image ("lights reflecting off the water like a thousand scattered promises") with purposeful tone, lifting the score into the mid-7s despite lacking a moment where environment forces a costly choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving Lumina's fluid autonomy against developer encroachment—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elira embeds the chip in the mural, reweighting her choice from internal conflict to public commitment. However, the escalation lacks on-page cost: the developers remain off-stage, no live confrontation occurs, and Elira's final action ("picked up her can again") reads as continuation rather than a decision that narrows options or forecloses a path under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of fluidity versus order emerges organically from the raft city's architecture and Elira's mainland upbringing. The mural encoding and water redirection offer concrete dramatization of resistance strategies. The final image ("building a third") gestures toward synthesis but stops short of a resonant, non-literal answer—the line states the thematic premise rather than reweighting prior material through image or action. Subtext operates effectively in the child's laughter and Jax's skepticism, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate beat's didactic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (brass cuff whirring, paint streaks as bodily markers). Dialogue with Jax is naturalistic and goal-driven, carrying subtext effectively. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts above Elira's established register ("labyrinthine charm," "eternal now") without voice-motivated reason. Free indirect style is clean; internal thought formatting is consistent. The prose reflects Elira's artist's eye through selective, texture-rich detail, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is generally high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., "foundation stone chip in her pocket burned like a guilty secret" anchors prop and emotion). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "They'll see it as vandalism" / "Let them" recaps the resistance theme already shown, and "building bridges" / "building a third" synonym-churn the same idea. Register drift into writerly abstraction ("labyrinthine charm," "eternal now") clashes with the gritty carnival setting. Proofreading is clean; no major artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting the deduction to mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The raft-city carnival setting offers a fresh synthesis of fluid architecture and resistance aesthetics, and the graffiti-as-tactical-communication premise is specific. However, the dual-allegiance mediator navigating gentrification closely matches workshop templates (outsider returns, torn loyalty, symbolic defiant act). The story does not transform the template through non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost—Elira's choices feel predetermined, and the ending reaffirms her initial stance without friction. The transformation test fails: swap Lumina for any threatened community and the emotional arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elira's role as culture shock absorber is established early (paragraph 3) and frames her position between mainland and Lumina. However, her mediator function never manifests in on-page action—she does not absorb, translate, or broker between the two sides; she simply chooses resistance. The label exists, but the character's choices (prying the chip, painting murals) do not require her mediator skill set. Removing the "absorber" designation would not alter any beat or the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in three beats: pocket burn (paragraph 5), blueprint theft (paragraph 6), and mural embedding (near-end). Its use escalates from concealed guilt to public monument, and it carries symbolic weight as developers' bedrock made monument to resistance. However, its physical properties never constrain a choice or alter tactics—it functions as thematic token rather than causal pressure. The closure participation is visual but passive; the chip does not enable or block the final action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is signaled early (paragraph 4: "loved Lumina's wild heart, but her mainland upbringing had drilled into her the value of order") and shapes the protagonist's internal framing. However, it never creates an on-page dilemma that alters tactics—Elira consistently chooses Lumina without visible cost or mainland pull in the peak beats. The concept operates as backstory pressure rather than live friction; removing the mainland allegiance would not change the mural sequence or ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is gestured at through the brass cuff (mainland order) and her ability to decode graffiti patterns (intuition), but the trait never constrains or enables a specific action with cost. The story tells us she recalibrates her breathing to the city's pulse, yet this trait does not shape any tactical choice or trade-off on the page. It remains a label rather than a dramatized capability that alters an outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reorganize" drives the core action: nightly mural creation redirects carnival folk, encodes meeting locations, and shifts stall placements to keep the city fluid. The action is present across multiple beats (paragraph 8 onward) and directly enables the resistance strategy. The final beat ("picked up her can again") extends the reorganization forward, making it indispensable to the story's logic. However, the developers' response remains off-page, so the reorganization's cost or success is not dramatized at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Graffiti messaging is introduced early (paragraph 8), its mechanics are explained ("A twist here meant a meeting at the Ferris wheel"), and it shapes two distinct beats: the hand-clutching-stone mural and the clocktower sundial plan. The method is specific and causal—messages guide carnival folk's tactics. However, we never see the messages received or acted upon; the method remains a one-way broadcast without on-page confirmation that it alters outcomes, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raft city is established immediately and its carnival nature—patchwork barges, kite lanterns, Ferris wheel, fortune-teller stalls—provides resources (plywood walls, mobile architecture) that enable the reorganization strategy. The setting's fluidity is the stake: developers plan to "anchor their sterile grids" and drain waterways. The final image of lights on water and a raft drifting free directly charges the closure with the setting's defining property. The setting is indispensable to both tactics and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Timeframe "before privatization" is signaled clearly ("By dawn, the developers' surveyors would arrive") and creates urgency for the night's mural work. The clock tightens Elira's window to spread the message. However, the surveyors never arrive on-page, so the deadline does not force a final tactical choice or cost. The time pressure shapes the middle beat but does not participate in closure, landing the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to navigate gentrification is dramatized through Elira's tactical choices (chip theft, mural encoding, water redirection planning) and her internal framing ("navigating it, turning the developers' own tools against them"). The desire is active across beats. However, the motivation lacks on-page friction—Elira's allegiance to Lumina is never tested by a competing pull or cost; she simply executes resistance without visible sacrifice or trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Hopeful desperation is coherent throughout: the carnival roars "defiant and bright" even as the foundation chip "burned like a guilty secret" and waterways are already drained. The tone modulates with pressure—Jax's doubt ("Think they'll get it?") undercuts optimism, and Elira's grin at the clocktower plan charges hope against developer encroachment. The final line "There was still time" embodies both urgency and possibility, anchoring the tone directly in the closure image and lifting the score into the mid-7s.</comment>
