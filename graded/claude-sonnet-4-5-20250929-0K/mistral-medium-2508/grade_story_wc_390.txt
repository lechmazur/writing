<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The engineer's motivation is clear and her choice to turn the key despite lethal cost is earned by prior causality. Her embodied perception through vibrations and the molars-aching subsonic whine grounds the interior. The monks' "heretic" accusation and her counter-logic ("not about erasure...about matching") establish internal contradiction. However, the final transformation ("nerves rewriting themselves into something less human, more ethereal") edges toward abstraction without concrete micro-choices that anchor the shift, and "forgiven by physics" risks label-speak at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph (engineer, drift-ice marina, dusk). The drive lens is Causal: she descends, slots the key, turns it → sphere sings → ice fractures → resonator redirects energy → artifact stabilizes. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she endures cellular unraveling to redirect the sphere's energy, foreclosing her human form with on-page cost ("her nerves rewriting themselves"). One micro turn when the ice "sang back" shifts from cage to conduit. The cost is legible in ragged gasps and the body's transformation, though the final smile and "rest" soften the price slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina's groaning plates and "language...of cracks" establish the setting as a living constraint early. The sphere's cradle, spiral stairs with pearl-dust, and the resonator all anchor spatial choreography. The ice's "natural dampener" and thinning status directly shape her choice to act now. The final image of the lighthouse beam and the stirring presence "beneath the ice" uses environment to charge the closure. Sensory selection (brass, cold metal through gloves, subsonic whine in molars) is POV-filtered and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the artifact is "a bomb" and the ice is thinning. One meaningful tightening occurs when she must act before the tide turns and the ice fails. Her agency is a decision with on-page cost: turning the key unravels her "cell by cell." The monks' misunderstanding of absolution versus her insight ("matching") sets up the reversal. The cost is visible in her ragged gasps and transformation. No antagonist appears, but the sphere's unstable energy and the ice's decay supply coherent pressure under a Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of absolution-as-matching emerges through the engineer's insight and the sphere's resonance, not abstract statement. The crypt key, initially a stolen relic, reweights as a conduit when it glows blue and the sphere "answers." "Forgiven by physics" risks overt thematic phrasing, but the image of her body becoming "more ethereal" and the lighthouse beam as "hymn" offer non-literal resonance. The monks' martyrdom versus her "work" frames a quiet anti-romantic stance. The final line "She'd left it nothing to fear" reprices the story's central question without moralizing, though "something ancient and patient" introduces a new element late that dilutes focus slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance modulates appropriately (close during the key turn, slightly elevated in the final paragraphs). Diction is mostly character-consistent ("logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay"), but "forgiven by physics" and "fleshly" in the prompt's "fleshly ethereal" push toward elevated abstraction at peak moments. Perceptual signature is strong: she reads vibrations as "language" and feels frequencies "hum through her gloves." No dialogue. One minor register slip: "a state where logic and emotion were the same thing" feels over-articulated for someone mid-transformation. Psychic distance widens in the closing paragraphs, which serves the ethereal tone but slightly reduces embodied immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the artifact in the lighthouse basement wasn't a relic. It was a bomb" and "they didn't understand" could condense. Template cadence: "She descended...She knelt...She turned the key" clusters identical stems in the climax. Stock metaphor: "sunset bled gold" and "bruised sky." "Fleshly" in "the cost would be fleshly" reads as prompt-label insertion rather than organic diction. Filter-verb stack: "she understood...she laughed...she smiled...she'd left" in the final section. The line "a chord so pure it peeled the salt from the air" is vivid, but adjacency to multiple artifacts lowers cumulative density. Apply −0.8 for loops, template stems, and filter stack touching closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina as natural dampener and the sonic-absolution premise offer a fresh synthesis. The engineer's choice to "match" rather than silence, and the cost of cellular transformation, avoid the template rescue. However, the "something ancient and patient" stirring beneath the ice in the final lines echoes a familiar framing device (cosmic listener, Lovecraftian watcher) without transformation. The crypt key's provenance (cathedral ruins, monks) and the sphere's "black glass veined with silver" read as genre-standard mystic objects. The transformation from heretic to martyr is specific but not wholly non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its premise and the final "work" line resists abstraction, earning mid-upper band placement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line. She tightens the resonator (setup), descends and slots the key (development), turns the key and endures transformation (closure). Her decision to "match" rather than silence drives the climax. Choices create all key turns. Cost is tied to her: she collapses, nerves rewrite. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph four (late first third). She slots it into the sphere's lock, turns it; it glows blue and clatters at the end. Two functional beats (turn, glow/answer). The glow reprises its role but does not reweight prior material decisively. Swappable with another key-like object. Cost is tied to her action, not the key's unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mentioned early ("sonic absolution...sound could unmake sin"). Shapes her insight ("not about erasure...about matching") and the climax tactic (tuning resonator to sphere frequency). However, the mechanics remain abstract; the concept is more thematic backdrop than a constraint that narrows options. Present in the ending ("forgiven by physics"), but closure hinges on her endurance, not the concept's rules.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Logic demanded she run. Emotion demanded she stay" is the lone on-page invocation. It frames the key-turn choice but does not constrain or enable the action causally—either path was available. Label-only at the moment of decision. No visible tradeoff where one mode foreclosed the other. The transformation into "something less human, more ethereal" may echo the trait but is told rather than demonstrated through contradictory micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled early: ice as "natural dampener...cage of disharmony." Her choice to act is premised on the ice thinning. At climax, "the ice beneath her feet sang back, fracturing into geometric patterns as the vibrations aligned"—the marina shifts from cage to conduit. This move is central to the resolution. Two beats: setup (thinning threat), climax (fracture and alignment). Not easily swappable; the setting's adaptive response is specific to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Introduced in the descent: "If she could tune the lighthouse's resonator to the sphere's frequency, she could redirect its energy." Mechanics signaled but not detailed. At climax, "the lighthouse resonator screamed as it bent the sphere's energy into a beam." Present in two beats (plan, execution) and shapes the ending (beam as hymn). Swappable with another tuning method without major rewrites; the specific means (vibrational matching) is more thematic than mechanically unique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Present from the first line. The marina's groaning ice is read as "language," the thinning ice creates urgency, and the "natural dampener" role is established early. At climax, the ice fractures into patterns and becomes a conduit. The setting's dual role (cage → conduit) is causal and irreplaceable. Three beats: opening (pressure and language), descent (dampener explanation), climax (fracture and song). The ending references "the ice settling into a new pattern" and something stirring beneath. Drives tactics and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sunset bled gold...fleeting as a held breath" and "she knew the tide would turn soon." The timeframe creates urgency at setup. However, the clock is not tracked during the descent or climax; no line references fading light or tide pressure during the key turn. The ending notes "the first stars pierced the bruised sky," confirming time passed, but the interval is vague. Two-gate presence (setup, implied closure) without middle development. Live pressure is asserted but not dramatically tightened.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stated early: "the artifact...wasn't a relic. It was a bomb." Her goal to stabilize it is clear. She rejects the monks' erasure logic in favor of redirection. The motivation drives her descent, the key turn, and her willingness to endure transformation. On-page cost: "her breath coming in ragged, wet gasps...nerves rewriting themselves." Friction appears in the trade-off ("the cost would be fleshly") and her laughing acceptance of it. Three beats: setup (bomb threat), choice (turn key despite cost), closure (artifact stable, self transformed). Essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Fleshly" appears once ("the cost would be fleshly") as a label; "ethereal" appears in the transformation description. Tone is consistent: cold metal, subsonic whine, cellular unraveling, "hymn" beam. The final image of stars, wind as "choir of ghosts," and the lighthouse song sustains the ethereal register. However, the tone is more atmospheric than modulating—static high register throughout. Does not degrade under stress or shift with pressure. Charges the final image but does not develop beat to beat.</comment>
