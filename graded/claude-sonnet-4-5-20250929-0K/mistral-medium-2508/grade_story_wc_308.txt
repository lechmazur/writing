<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The skimmer's interior is present through embodied sensing (arrowhead vibrations, breath control) and the final stance crystallization—becoming stone rather than fleeing—feels earned by the constraint. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("pulse left wandering," "anchor") without concrete micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses under pressure. The protagonist's competence is asserted through lineage and mystic ability rather than shown struggling against genuine limits; the Hollow Maw threat is resolved through stillness without visible cost beyond waiting.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (canyon, bone towers, skimmer's position). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the skimmer crystallizes his stance ("He was the stone") and the threat passes, reconfiguring survival from motion to stillness. Cost is felt (renunciation of flight, endurance of proximity to predator) but remains conceptual; no on-page forfeiture or tactical alteration is legible in the final image beyond waiting. The flock's reform and the arrowhead cooling signal resolution, but the price paid is atmospheric rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are vividly rendered and recur across beats (groaning towers, twisting echoes, dust layers). The arrowhead functions as micro-setting, constraining the skimmer's choice to press it harder and whisper binding words, then charging the final image when it cools. Sensory detail is selective (bruised twilight, wind howl, shadow blotting) and filtered through the skimmer's mystic perception. Spatial choreography is clear (atop highest rib, predator passing beneath).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: survive the Hollow Maw by embodying stillness. The flock's disruption (lagging bird) signals the anomaly and the skimmer's arrowhead ritual tightens pressure, but no meaningful reversal or escalation narrows his options—he performs the ritual and waits. The Maw's passing is coincidental (it does not find him) rather than forced by the skimmer's tactical alteration. Agency is present (whisper binding words, press arrowhead) but cost legibility is low; survival feels assured by ancestral knowledge rather than a trade-off with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—stillness as survival, pulse as identity—emerges through the arrowhead ritual, the flock's reformation, and the skimmer's final embodiment of stone. The piece avoids moralizing and the closing image (canyon breathing, skimmer listening) offers a resonant answer to "navigate without moving." However, the thematic payoff is somewhat abstract; the skimmer's internal shift from observer to anchor is told more than dramatized ("he had learned, at last"). The "dust remembered his name" line edges toward portentous abstraction rather than earned wisdom from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (vibrations as sensing, wind and echoes personified). Diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("bruised twilight," "historically reverent") that fits the mythic frame. However, runs of similar syntactic stems appear ("The skimmer [verb]" x5, "He [verb]" clusters) and some figurative language borders on stock ("hunger," "pulse," "echo" recur without fresh inflection). The final paragraph's repeated declaratives ("He was the stone. He was the echo.") read as intentional incantation but flatten momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high without overwhelming clarity. However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "He didn't need to see...but he heard it anyway" / "He didn't need to see to know" repeats the construction; "pulse" and "echo" recur across many lines without evolving meaning; "The canyon held its breath. Then, the echo came" uses stock suspense pacing. Template cadence is present in multiple "The skimmer [verb]" openings. Some metaphors are strained ("things that moved like hunger"). Information density is moderate; several beats restate the skimmer's stillness without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The fusion of sensory navigation (vibrations through arrowhead), bone-tower setting, and mystic survival ritual offers a specific synthesis. The turn—becoming anchor rather than fleeing—is thematically coherent. However, the core arc (lone mystic uses ancestral knowledge to outwait supernatural threat through stillness) follows a familiar template; the skimmer's competence and the threat's convenient departure reduce narrative risk. The flock as diagnostic tool and the arrowhead as resonance anchor are the most distinctive elements, but closure relies on atmospheric assertion rather than a non-obvious choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The skimmer's choices (press arrowhead harder, whisper binding words, close eyes, remain still) shape the middle and ending beats. However, these are ritual gestures rather than tactical decisions that narrow options; survival follows from ancestral knowledge rather than a difficult trade-off. Present in all three gates (introduced early, middle ritual, ending embodiment) but causal pressure is moderate—stillness is chosen but the Maw's departure is not forced by the skimmer's action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arrowhead appears in at least four beats: chest-pressed introduction, vibration sensing (flock anomaly), ritual binding (whispered words), and cooling at closure. Its vibrations enable detection, its weight anchors the skimmer, and its warmth/coolness signal threat and resolution. Cost is tied to its use (pressing harder, binding pulse). Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; causal and closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "pulse left wandering" is introduced as thematic language ("a pulse left wandering was never an accident") and referenced in the lagging bird, but it does not shape on-page tactics beyond prompting the skimmer to press the arrowhead. The skimmer "calls it home" at the end, but this is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible choice with cost. Present in setup and closure but functions as metaphor rather than a concrete stake that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" appears once in the closure paragraph ("unyielding, historically reverent") as a descriptor. It does not constrain or enable any prior action; the skimmer's reverence for ancestors is implied throughout but not tied to a specific choice with cost. Label-only; no functional beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears in the sixth paragraph: the skimmer "began to appraise their patterns—not with eyes, but with the resonance of the stone." This action enables detection of the anomaly (lagging bird) and triggers the escalation (threat recognition), shaping the middle turn. However, it does not return at closure; the final act is stillness rather than further appraisal. Present in setup and development; causal role in one major beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The flock is introduced early (fifth paragraph) and the skimmer reads their patterns to detect the anomaly, driving the middle escalation. The flock's scatter and reformation bracket the threat. However, the method (pattern-reading) is asserted rather than shown with specific mechanics; the skimmer's vibration-sensing is described but not tested against a difficult choice. Present in setup, middle, and closure (flock spirals upward); lyric reprise reweights survival but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bone towers provide the skimmer's perch (highest rib), emit groaning echoes that serve as warning, and anchor the final image ("the bone itself had learned to listen"). The canyon's echoes twist sound and frame the threat. Setting constrains the skimmer's position (atop the tower, predator passing beneath) and charges the closure (canyon breathing, towers standing firm). Present in setup, middle pressure, and ending image; essential to spatial logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Centuries of layered dust" appears in the opening and mid-story ("Centuries of dust had taught him"), framing the skimmer's ancestral lineage. Time depth is atmospheric but does not tighten present decisions; no live clock pressures the skimmer's ritual or the Maw's approach. The phrase "until the next wandering pulse" implies future waiting but does not impose cost on the present beat. Present in setup and thematic layer; no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is introduced as ancestral knowledge (seventh paragraph) and dramatized in the climax: the skimmer chooses stillness over flight, embodying the goal. The motivation drives the final choice and is tested against the Hollow Maw threat. However, the internal conflict is told ("for the first time, he understood why") rather than shown through contradictory impulses. Present in setup, middle realization, and closure; causal role with moderate friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" coheres across the piece: the skimmer's measured breathing, slow appraisal, unhurried ritual, and final stillness all embody endurance. Tone modulates slightly (breath hitches at the anomaly, tension during the Maw's approach) but remains steady through turns. The final image (listening, waiting) charges the tone with purpose. Consistent and apt; modulates with pressure without flattening.</comment>
