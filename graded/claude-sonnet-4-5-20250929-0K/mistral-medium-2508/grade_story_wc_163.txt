<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is rendered through vivid particulars—the burnt feather, the celestial scope, the jellyfireflies—but her motivations remain largely asserted rather than tested under pressure. The "rhythm of belonging" is told as her drive, yet no on-page choice forces her to trade off competing goods or accept visible cost. Kael arrives as a mirror rather than an antagonist, and their shared moment reads more as convergence than a choice that forecloses a path. The final separation (she stays, he surfaces) carries implied weight but lacks dramatized struggle or contradiction that would earn the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and lyric particulars (bioluminescent maps, jellyfireflies, the respite hour) build atmosphere and recur with shifting context. However, the closure—Elara tucking the feather into the logbook and smiling—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) whose cost is largely implied rather than dramatized on the page. The final image reweights prior material but does not make the cost of staying undeniable in action or felt consequence, capping the score below high bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drowned facility is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: cracked glass domes, bioluminescent algae as living maps, corroded wiring, the pressure groaning in harmony with tides. The underwater environment constrains action (oxygen tanks, the weight of water) and charges the final image (Elara staying below, Kael surfacing). Micro-setting elements—the burnt feather, the scope, the observation deck—recur with reweighted meaning. The facility's pressure and the "respite" hour shape the emotional arc, meeting the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara seeking "the rhythm of belonging"—is signaled early but remains abstract and never faces a concrete on-page test. Kael's arrival introduces the possibility of connection, yet no reversal or tightening forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The shared exhale and jellyfirefly surge are accumulative texture, not escalation under pressure. By sunrise, Elara stays and Kael leaves, but this separation is presented as mutual acceptance rather than a choice that narrows options or forecloses a live alternative with dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of belonging as frequency rather than place emerges through vivid particulars: living maps, the respite hour, jellyfireflies as a secret language. The burnt feather recurs with shifting charge, and the final logbook entry offers a quiet, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the thematic resolution—"Some things didn't need to be mapped to be understood"—edges toward summary statement rather than letting the image alone reweigh prior material. The piece resists simplistic morals but does not fully trust the reader to infer the thematic answer from action and consequence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in tight third with Elara throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the observation-deck scene, broader in the final paragraph). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "softly ingenious," "held breath finally released," "the ocean had its own way of keeping time." Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (Elara's question to Kael, his non-verbal response). The prose rhythm shifts under emotional pressure without losing coherence. One micro-slip: "captivated—not by the light, but by the way it made the burnt feather...cast shadows" introduces Kael's perception with unwarranted certainty when Elara is the focalizer, a brief filter leak that does not recur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level execution is mostly clean with varied syntax and strong image density. However, several loops and scaffolds dull momentum: "the respite wasn't for data; it was the hour before sunrise when..." unpacks in synonym phrases; "She realized then that he wasn't here for scrap. He was chasing the same thing she was" restates the same inference twice. The phrase "softly ingenious" appears once without on-page demonstration, reading as a label. Figurative language is dense ("maps were alive, shifting with the tides," "the deep had its own fireflies") but occasionally stacks without breathing room, risking overwriting in a lyric mode. The final image is clean and propulsive, which limits cumulative penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The drowned-facility premise and "landscape astrologer" conceit offer fresh specificity, and the jellyfireflies as Morse-code communication provide a non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc—two isolated people finding connection through shared wonder—follows a familiar template, and the final separation (one stays, one surfaces with a token) is a stock closure for this subgenre. The burnt feather and bioluminescent maps are vivid particulars, but the story does not transform the "connection through wonder" frame into something that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is present in the lyric density but does not heighten stakes or moral calculus beyond the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation (landscape astrologer) frames her worldview—reading bioluminescent algae as constellations, interpreting jellyfireflies as language. However, her choices do not create key turns. She observes, records, and accepts Kael's presence without a decision that alters tactics or forecloses options. The final act of tucking the feather into the logbook is a gesture of closure but not a choice under pressure. Present and functional, but replaceable with a similarly introspective researcher role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in three beats: behind Elara's ear with backstory, casting shadows when a jellyfish lands on Kael's wrist, and pressed to her lips before being tucked into the logbook. It carries thematic charge (memory of flight, connection to the surface) and reweights at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; its role is symbolic reprise rather than causal pressure. Strong lyric integration but falls short of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" is defined on the page as the hour before sunrise when pressure lessens and the city groans in harmony with the tide. It frames the story's temporal structure and is explicitly linked to Elara's motivation (the moment when she can "almost hear the rhythm of belonging"). The shared exhale at the respite's peak is the story's emotional climax. However, the concept does not constrain choices or alter tactics; it sets tone and stakes but remains passive background. Present across setup, middle, and ending, meeting two gates, but does not drive causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" appears once as a descriptor ("She laughed, softly ingenious, because of course the deep had its own fireflies"). The phrasing reads as label-only; no on-page action demonstrates ingenuity under constraint, and the adverb modifies laughter without clarifying how that laughter is ingenious. Does not enable or constrain a choice. Ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Captivate" appears when Kael stills upon seeing the jellyfireflies and is described as "captivated—not by the light, but by the way it made the burnt feather...cast shadows." This moment signals his deeper motive and initiates the connection with Elara, shaping the middle turn. However, the action itself is passive observation, and the story would function with "transfixed," "arrested," or similar synonyms. Functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (Elara watching for "the first firefly of summer" as a jellyfirefish pulse) and returns at the observation-deck climax: "Side by side...they exhaled in unison...and the jellyfireflies surged upward." The shared exhale directly enables the emotional peak and charges the closure (Elara stays, Kael surfaces with glass, the ending invokes "the first real fireflies of summer"). The method shapes two beats and contributes to the ending's resonance, though it does not constrain a tactical choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The underwater facility is established early (glass domes, bioluminescent algae, corroded wiring, observation deck) and provides spatial grounding throughout. The environment constrains action (pressure, the need for oxygen tanks) and shapes the stakes (Elara has spent three years mapping light through "salt and ruin"). The facility's "groans in harmony with the planetary tide" recur and charge the final image (Elara staying below, Kael surfacing). However, the setting does not force a choice at closure; it is backdrop and atmosphere rather than a tactical lever. Strong thematic integration but stops short of altering outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the title substitution and reinforced on the page: "the respite peaked," "By sunrise, the fireflies were gone," and the final paragraph invokes "the first real fireflies of summer...waking." The sunrise deadline structures the narrative arc and marks the moment of separation. However, time does not tighten decisions or force a tactical trade-off; it passes as atmosphere rather than as a live clock that alters moves. Present across all three gates but passive in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of belonging" is explicitly stated as Elara's drive: "trying to prove...that home wasn't a place but a frequency." The motivation frames her three-year isolation and her interpretation of the jellyfireflies. The connection with Kael dramatizes the desire in the shared exhale scene. However, the desire is never conflicted on the page; no choice forces Elara to weigh belonging against another live want or cost. The final separation (she stays, he leaves) is presented as mutual acceptance rather than friction. Told and illustrated but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" reads as a fusion of darkness and awe, coherent throughout: cracked domes holding "slow, insistent weight," bioluminescent algae as living maps, jellyfireflies as "a pulse of light from the abyss, rising like a held breath." Tone modulates with pressure (Elara's quiet laugh, the shared stillness on the observation deck, the final smile) and charges the ending image without flattening into single-note reverence. The prose sustains the blend of melancholy and discovery across turns, meeting the high-band requirement for tonal coherence that supports closure.</comment>
