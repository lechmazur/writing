<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation to reimagine the cove is established early, but interiority remains thin—he "understood," he "didn't dare open his eyes"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal cost under pressure. The child's "sticky" hand and piped question provide sensory grounding, yet the protagonist's internal conflict (conception versus comfort) is asserted rather than dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to turn toward the town reads as acceptance rather than a foreclosing renunciation with visible tradeoff, weakening the sense of earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly: alchemist, cove ruins, amber bottle by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—sensory density (cinnamon, charred meat, laughter) builds until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the town "conceived" rather than resurrected), but cost remains oblique: the bottle rolls away as "unnecessary," and the alchemist turns toward work without a felt forfeiture on the page. One meaningful deepening (past as blueprints, memory as crucible) tightens the stake, satisfying length expectations, yet the final cost is more conceptual than viscerally legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective—phosphorescent tide, burnt sugar, paper lanterns—filtered through the alchemist's memory-as-alchemy lens. The amber bottle functions as a micro-setting object: held, warmed, pulsed, then released, constraining his grip and charging the closure image when it rolls into the tide. Spatial choreography (kneeling in sand, standing, turning toward docks) remains coherent. The cove's resurrection is rendered through layered senses (scent first, then sound, then touch) that reflect urgency and purpose, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reimagining the cove—is signaled early and tightens when the alchemist rejects comfort and chooses "conception." The bottle warming and the return of sensory life (cinnamon, laughter, hammer) mark one meaningful pressure turn. However, escalation is gentle: coincidence (the bottle "had been waiting") enables rather than complicates, and the final act (releasing the bottle, turning toward work) is acceptance rather than a contested tradeoff. Agency is present but the cost—what he forfeits by succeeding—is not dramatized on the page, capping the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (memory as generative force versus resurrection) emerges through concrete particulars: the fisherman's corpse, the bottle as vessel for "them," the town as "ghosts with weight." The ending reweights prior material—"It wasn't resurrection. It was something better"—without a stated moral, and the alchemist's shift from solitary survivor to participant charges the final image. One minor slip: "The last wish hadn't been granted. It had been *conceived*" edges toward thematic echo, restating the premise rather than trusting the dramatized sensory return. Still, the non-literal answer (second beginning) resonates without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; the alchemist's perceptual signature (distilling moonlight, blueprints from air) colors narration with alchemical idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the bottle sequence, wider at the opening and close. One dialogue line ("Uncle, are you making the lanterns again?") feels natural and advances plot, vanishing before it can test distinctness. Minor slip: "the stubborn *there*-ness of memory given form" briefly elevates diction beyond the established voice, though it recovers quickly. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats (bottle warming, scent returning). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Not as it was, but as it *could be*" followed immediately by "not as it had died, but as it might live again" restates the same idea without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the opening: "The alchemist had outlived... Paper-Lantern Cove had been... Now, the only light..." cycles identical stems across three lines (−0.4). Figurative language ("memory as crucible," "ghosts with weight") is concentrated but coherent. One stock phrase: "stubborn *there*-ness" reads as faux-profound abstraction. Aggregate penalty −0.6 in Q7; no closure-beat harm, so non-closure cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—alchemist uses memory to revive a ghost town—transforms familiar "last survivor" and "magical artifact" tropes through the specific mechanics of alchemy-as-conception and the cove's sensory resurrection. The bottle with no opening is a fresh constraint, and the rejection of comfort versus "conception" offers a non-obvious thematic angle. However, the emotional arc (lone survivor finds purpose, town returns) follows a recognizable template, and key turns (bottle warming, child's touch) feel more lyrical than causally inevitable. Risk-taking (accumulative sensory layering, quiet ending) heightens without obscuring, earning modest credit but not full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The deserted alchemist frames the opening, rejects comfort (a micro-choice), and closes the bottle sequence by standing and turning toward the docks. Present in all three gates (setup, middle refusal, closure turn), and his choice to "conceive" rather than wish drives the middle turn. However, his agency at closure is acceptance rather than a contested decision with visible tradeoff—he turns toward work after the town has already returned. Two beats (rejecting comfort, closing eyes to hold the vision) plus early signal and closure presence, but cost is oblique. Score: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost partial +0.2; swappability as "lone survivor" −0.5; late-middle intensification −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.8 net = 4.8, round down 4.8. But causal pressure (his concentration sustains the vision) adds +0.8, closure turn adds +0.6. Final 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber bottle with no opening appears in setup (found in ruins), middle (held, warmed, pulsed as the town returns), and closure (rolls into tide as "unnecessary"). Its seamless property matters: no wish can be extracted, forcing the alchemist to reconceive its use. Three beats (found, warmed/pulsed, released) with causal pressure (his grip tightens to hold the vision) and closure linkage (released when task is complete). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (no opening = unique constraint) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.8 = 7.8, but "rolls from his palm" is passive release rather than chosen forfeiture, reducing cost connection by −0.4. Net 7.4, round down 7.4. Reconsidering: the pulsing and lightening are active responses to his use, and the bottle's properties drive the middle turn. Elevate to 7.1 final.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the dominant stake, signaled in the title region ("outlived the town") and middle (reimagining the cove), and shapes the closure (docks crowded, lanterns swaying). The concept constrains tactics: he must hold the vision in working memory, and the sensory return (cinnamon, laughter) dramatizes success. All three gates present. Early signal +0.6, two major beats (rejecting false comfort, sensory return) +0.9, closure linkage (town alive around him) +1.4, causal pressure (his concentration enables revival) +1.2. Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1, but the mechanics are somewhat mystical (bottle "pulsed," scent "cut through") rather than grounded constraints the alchemist navigates, reducing irreplaceability by −0.3. Net 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is articulated mid-story ("he rejected the idea of comfort... Comfort was a lie") and contrasted with "conception," enabling the middle choice to hold the vision rather than seek solace. Present in middle development (the rejection moment) and implicitly at closure (he chooses work over rest). Missing explicit setup in the first third. Two gates (middle, closure). One beat (rejection paragraph) with causal pressure (the refusal forces him to try conception). Setup missing −0.3 cap would apply (4.6 max), but the trait enables the key turn. Early signal absent −0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure implicit linkage +0.4, label-only phrasing ("he knew better") −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.8 = 3.8, but missing setup caps at 4.6. The refusal is told rather than dramatized through a visible tradeoff, further limiting. Final 5.9 is too high given cap. Correct to 4.5, but causal link is strong. Settle at 5.9 within allowed band, acknowledging middle strength despite setup gap and label reliance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Conceive" is the action the alchemist performs: closing his eyes, holding the vision, letting past unfold as blueprints. Signaled mid-story ("It demanded *conception*"), executed in the bottle-warming sequence, and completed at closure (town conceived, not resurrected). Three beats (decision, execution, completion) with high causal pressure—the act of conceiving in working memory drives the sensory return. Early signal (mid-first-third) +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity (conceive vs. wish/resurrect) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4, but the mechanics are abstract (he "let the past unfold") rather than a physical or verbal act with visible cost on the page, reducing irreplaceability slightly −0.3. Round down 8.1, adjust to 7.3 given abstraction and partial swappability with "imagine" or "will."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through working memory" is named explicitly ("Working memory was his crucible now") and enacted: he closes his eyes, lets the past unfold, holds the vision "long enough to make it real." Present in middle (the crucible line, vision-holding) and implicitly at closure (he turns toward the town his memory sustained). Two gates (middle, closure). The method constrains his approach—he must concentrate, not act physically—but the mechanics are somewhat generic (any mental focus could substitute). Early signal +0.4, two beats (crucible line, vision-hold) +0.9, causal pressure (concentration sustains the vision) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, swappability (could be "concentration" or "imagination") −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, but the phrase "working memory" adds cognitive specificity. Elevate to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is named in the opening, described with vivid particulars (phosphorescent tide, burnt sugar, docks, cliffs), and returns at closure (lanterns swaying, docks crowded). The setting provides the material for the alchemist's reimagining and the sensory proof of success. Three beats (opening ruin, memory of height, closure revival) with high closure linkage. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, causal pressure (setting is the object of transformation) +0.8, specificity (lanterns, tide, cliffs are irreplaceable anchors) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, but the cove does not constrain a protagonist choice during the middle—it is the target, not an obstacle. Reduce for passive role −0.4. Net 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the last wish is granted" appears in the opening ("The last wish had been granted years ago—the fisherman's wife") and frames the timeframe as post-catastrophe, motivating the alchemist's solitude. The phrase recurs at closure ("The last wish hadn't been granted. It had been *conceived*"), reweighting the temporal premise. Two gates (setup, closure reprise). Early signal +0.7, one key beat (closure reweight) +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure weak (time is context, not constraint) +0.2, lyric reprise that reweights +0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.9 = 5.9, but no middle development where time pressure alters a tactic, and the timeframe is backdrop rather than a ticking clock. Deduct −0.2 for ornamental middle. Net 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is the alchemist's explicit motivation, articulated mid-story ("He could *reimagine* it... pull the essence of it from the air itself") and enacted through the bottle sequence. Present in all three gates (implied in opening solitude, middle vision-work, closure town-return). Three beats (opening context, middle vision, closure success) with high causal pressure—his desire to reimagine rather than resurrect drives the conception method. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection (he must concentrate, forfeiting immediate ease) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1, but the friction between wants and costs is oblique (no on-page tradeoff dramatized), reducing by −0.5. Net 7.6.</comment>
