<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lirien's core motivation—retrieving her master's legacy while offering transformation—drives clear choices, and the Keeper's trembling recognition of his name earns the exchange. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic assertion ("chivalrous thief," "apprentice of wonder") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The swap mechanics are telegraphed but the Keeper's shift from threat to gift-giver compresses too quickly, losing the friction needed to make his choice costly on the page. Backstory about the master and three winters of carving functions but remains tell-heavy rather than anchored in present micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: violet sun, wrong sky, and ice spire seed atmosphere that deepens through the swap, name-reveal, and sky-mending closure. Orientation anchors quickly (spire, wrong sky, Lirien scaling). The closure—sky mending, first right star, spire singing—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost: the world begins to heal but Lirien steps into the unknown with only promises. One mild causality gap: the Keeper's instant capitulation after seeing his name feels under-motivated, compressing the turn that should test Lirien's thesis about doors and keys.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire, violet sun, and wrong sky create vivid, purposeful atmosphere filtered through Lirien's sacredly playful stance. Spatial choreography is clear: scaling, chambers, chessboard, window, descent. The ice shaping itself into footholds during descent and the spire singing at closure demonstrate setting-as-pressure and object constraint. Sensory detail—"breath curling in shapes that weren't quite smoke," "clouds churning like a restless sea"—remains selective and voice-consistent. The wrong sky functions as both constraint and stakes-marker, charging the final image when the first right star blinks into existence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieving the sundial lid to restore the sky/honor the master—signals early and tightens through the swap sequence. The Keeper's confrontation and Lirien's counter-offer ("the chance to embrace it") narrow options, and her pressing palm to the window before the exchange adds one meaningful pressure point. Closure shows visible cost: Lirien steps into the unknown with open arms, the sky begins mending, but the ending's escalation is more Accumulative (pattern completion) than causal squeeze. The Keeper's transformation lacks a visible price on his side—what does giving the lid cost him beyond trembling hands?</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the unknown as door, not void; amendment over theft—emerges organically from the swap mechanics and Lirien's philosophy without moralizing. The sundial lid, carved twin, and secrets-inside-chess-pieces motif recur with reweighted meaning: original holds old sun's light, hers holds the Keeper's name, final form holds shifting blue of a healing sky. The spire singing and first right star offer a resonant, non-literal answer to "what else will you amend?" without stating a thesis. One minor slip: "apprentice of wonder" and the master's laughter risk sentimental framing, but the concrete image of the blue light and wind carrying the master's name keeps it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric-fantastical register: "needle of black ice piercing the belly of the wrong sky," "sacredly playful," "wind howled with voices not quite human." Diction stays internally consistent, though elevated phrasing ("shrine to stillness," "slithered from the dark") occasionally tilts toward decorative rather than urgent. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the Keeper's "You think time is a thing to be stolen?" and Lirien's "I think it's a thing to be amended" carry subtext and goal-pursuit. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. One hiccup: "The question hung in the air, unanswered" in the penultimate beat edges toward meta-commentary rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language supports tone, but density issues emerge: "The spire groaned, the wrong sky outside twisting like a wound" and "the clouds churned like a restless sea" repeat atmospheric gestures without advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops appear in the descent: "She walked, each step lighter" followed by "The descent was easier now, the ice shaping itself" restates ease. Stock constructions—"slithered from the dark," "heavy with the weight of a confession"—cluster in high-pressure beats. No grammar errors; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The violet-sun-as-heartbeat and spire-singing final images redeem earlier slack, but mid-story scaffold and synonym churn (stillness/precision, trembling/hitching) lower momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wrong sky, ice spire, and swap-with-carved-twin premise offer a fresh synthesis of heist and cosmic-restoration fantasy. "Chivalrous thief" who leaves something brighter and the secrets-inside-chess-pieces mechanic show ingenuity. However, the emotional arc—lonely apprentice honors master, restores world through kindness—follows a familiar redemptive template without a non-obvious moral calculus or cost that resists tidy resolution. The Keeper's instant transformation and the sky's cooperative mending dilute the boldness of Lirien stepping into the unknown. The piece commits to its premise but retreats from the hardest questions: what if the Keeper had refused? What did Lirien sacrifice beyond three winters of carving?</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lirien (chivalrous thief) drives three key turns: scaling the spire (setup), executing the swap and revealing the Keeper's name (middle choice under pressure), pressing palm to window and accepting the lid (closure participation). Her choices alter tactics—carving the twin, embedding the name—and the final act of stepping forward with open arms charges the ending. Specific cost: three winters carving, risk of confrontation, stepping into the unknown. Introduced in the opening line, active across all three beats, irreplaceable to the swap logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid appears in four distinct beats: Keeper's grip (setup), Lirien's carved twin reveal (middle swap), true lid handed over (resolution), lid opening to blue light (closure image). Its properties evolve: old sun's light → Keeper's name inside the false twin → shifting blue of healing sky. Causally indispensable—without the lid, no swap, no sky mending. Visible cost: three winters carving the twin. The lid's transformation from relic to promise charges the final image and makes the story logic collapse without it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" appears as a label in backstory ("the man who'd called her *apprentice of wonder*") and echoes thematically in the master's closing question ("Well done, apprentice. Now—what else will you amend?"). It frames Lirien's role but does not constrain on-page choices—her actions read as chivalrous thief, restorer, or seeker without needing the "wonder" designation. Swappable with "apprentice" or "student" with minimal impact. Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" modifies Lirien's movement once in the Keeper's chambers: "Lirien moved sacredly playful, her fingers dancing over his chessboard." It colors the swap sequence—reverence plus mischief—but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The trait could be replaced with "careful" or "deliberate" without altering outcomes. Present in the middle beat, supports tone, but lacks causal necessity. Lyric reprise absent; no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Amend" drives the central conflict: Lirien tells the Keeper "I think it's a thing to be amended," her carved lid offers "the chance to embrace it," and the closing question asks "what else will you amend?" The action defines her philosophy (amend vs. steal), shapes the Keeper's choice, and charges the ending when the sky begins to mend. Swapping "amend" for "fix" or "restore" would flatten the thematic nuance. Introduced early, present in the confrontation beat, and reweighted at closure with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside—is signaled in setup (carved twin, three winters, Keeper's knight/Lirien's rook) and executed in the middle beat. The mechanics matter: the rook holds the sundial lid, the knight holds a map. Lirien's carving enables the swap; the secrets inside change the Keeper's stance. However, the map inside the knight is revealed only in summary after closure, diluting on-page pressure. Two-beat involvement, causal pressure present, but swappability moderate (another container could work). Closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire pressures Lirien's climb ("slick face with fingers numbed"), houses the Keeper's chambers, and actively aids her escape ("ice shaping itself into footholds, as if the spire itself wanted her to leave"). The wrong sky above tightens stakes and the spire's song at closure signals cosmic shift. Setting constrains movement, supplies resources (ice footholds), and charges the final image. Introduced in the opening line, present across all three structural beats, irreplaceable to spatial logic and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" is signaled early (violet sun, stars moving like fish) and remains present throughout via atmospheric cues and the Keeper's warning ("Before the sky remembers itself"). The wrongness tightens Lirien's urgency and the ending shows the sky beginning to mend—first right star, sky learning to breathe. However, no live clock or countdown is visible on the page; time pressure is conceptual rather than tactical. Timeframe shapes stakes and charges closure but does not alter Lirien's moment-to-moment choices with a felt constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lirien's motivation—"to embrace the unknown with open arms"—is dramatized in the closing beat when she literally steps forward with arms open into the clouds. Her earlier philosophy (doors need keys, unknown as opportunity) sets up this choice, and the cost is visible: leaving certainty, stepping into the hungry unknown. Friction exists: three winters spent carving, risk of confrontation, but the Keeper's cooperation reduces the cost mid-story. Desire is shown through action at closure, not merely told. Introduced thematically early, tested in the Keeper exchange, and crystallized in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" modulates across beats: Lirien scales with numbed fingers (caution), moves "sacredly playful" during the swap (abandon within reverence), and walks rather than runs during escape (cautious abandon synthesis). The tone coheres but remains somewhat static—no sharp shift under peak pressure. The final image (arms open, stepping into the unknown) charges the tone's payoff. Present throughout, supports voice and closure, but does not intensify or break pattern in a way that redefines prior material. Solid tonal control without a decisive crescendo.</comment>
