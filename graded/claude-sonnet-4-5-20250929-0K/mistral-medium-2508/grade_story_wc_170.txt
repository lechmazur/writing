<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to paint mirages is established early, but her interiority remains abstract—"perceptively calm gaze" and choosing not to look at her own reflection are labels rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The choice to let the mirror slip feels thematically purposeful but lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; we're told she tried once before, but that backstory doesn't anchor a present micro-choice. The soldier's borrowed heartbeat and the woman's payment structure suggest stakes, yet Liora's agency at closure reads more as routine withdrawal than a decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Liora, mirage painter) and where (terrace) within the opening lines; the timeframe (hush before bells) is signaled early and paid off at closure when the last bell tolls and she vanishes. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through recurring images (mirrors, heartbeats, lullabies, bells, rainbows) and the final cadence shift—"The last bell tolled. The rainbows faded."—reweights the dominant stake with a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she walks away, pockets empty, never looking at her own reflection). Cost is conceptual and felt in the image of the empty terrace she once saw, but on-page cost at closure is muted; the heartbeat unravels, the woman receives her vision, and Liora simply continues her pattern without visible consequence in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terrace functions as micro-setting: the prism parapet refracts light into rainbows (charged early and reprised at closure when they fade), the stone balustrades and flagstones establish spatial grounding, and the bells' echo rolls over the stones to mark time's passage. The cracked mirror on the parapet's edge is handled twice, once as borrowed prop and once as the vessel for the heartbeat's unraveling. However, the terrace itself does not constrain a choice—Liora could perform this ritual anywhere—and the spring setting (wet earth scent, fireflies) remains atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Liora's ongoing trade in borrowed heartbeats and possibilities, knowing every vision steals from another—is signaled early and operates throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs: the heartbeat unravels, the woman receives her vision, the soldier will forget, and Liora walks away empty-handed, a pattern she repeats. Yet this is presented as routine rather than a turn that narrows options; the stakes are declared (the cost to the soldier, the woman's repeated payments) but not tested by a choice that forecloses a live path. The city "needs its mirages" and Liora needs "the hush before the next ringing," but no on-page pressure forces her to alter tactics or endure a new cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: mirrors that show possibilities rather than reflections, the cost of borrowed heartbeats, and the image of an empty terrace devoid of rainbows or songs. The final passage—"just a painter of the almost-real, trading in heartbeats and echoes, always careful never to look too long at her own reflection"—risks thematic statement but is anchored by the earlier dramatized moment when she let the mirror slip before it could show her own face. The closing image (rainbows fade, scent of spring, ghost of a song, Liora vanishes) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of what it costs to show others their possibilities while refusing your own. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph, and the dusky harmony between "what was and what could be" reweights the premise with quiet integrity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person close; psychic distance is stable and Liora's perceptual signature—calm, methodical, attuned to coded lullabies and borrowed pulses—is consistent throughout. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("slick with rain," "fractured rainbows that bled across the damp flagstones," "her breath curling into the spring air") that modulates naturally with emotional beats. Purposeful compression in the opening and the final sequence teaches the pattern and pays off at closure without obscuring clarity. The single line of dialogue ("Show me my son as he could be") is natural and goal-driven. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the narrative stance remains elegiac and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening/closing images are charged, but the middle third shows template-cadence runs: "She would see this. / She would weep. / She would pay again." followed by "The woman would have her vision. / The soldier would forget his dream. / And Liora?" This parallel phrasing across multiple beats reduces propulsion and flattens momentum. The phrase "as the bells swallowed the last of the light" mixes metaphors (bells don't swallow light), and "her lullabies still humming just beneath the sound of her footsteps" strains the vehicle. These artifacts appear in non-closure beats, but the −0.6 deduction for template cadence in Q7 and the slight muddle in figurative language prevent entry to the high 7s. Information density is otherwise strong, and the closing sequence recovers clarity and rhythm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—mirage painter who shows possibilities in mirrors, paid in borrowed heartbeats—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar fantastical-realism tropes. The coded lullabies, the cost structure (soldier's fear, woman's grief), and the image of an empty terrace as Liora's own possibility distinguish the execution from template urban-fantasy. The choice to let the mirror slip before it shows her face is a specific inflection that grows from prior particulars. However, the broader arc—artist who gives others what she cannot have for herself—echoes well-worn territory, and the ending's vanishing act ("Then she vanished, like she always did") risks cliché without a final image that transforms it. Strong particularity in world-building and tone elevate the piece within the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora, the elusive mirage painter, is present throughout and her choices frame the narrative: she takes the heartbeat, hums the lullaby to activate the mirror, lets one mirror slip before it shows her face, picks up another cracked mirror, and walks away as the bells toll. These are decisions, not mere observations. However, the key turns are iterative rather than transformative—she repeats a pattern she has performed before ("her twelfth that month," "like she always did")—and the final choice to walk away with empty pockets does not visibly alter her stance or options. Early signal (+0.5), beat involvement across three distinct moments (+1.0), and closure linkage (she vanishes in the final line, +0.9) raise the score. Swappability (−0.5) and the lack of a causal cost tied to her choices at closure (−0.4) limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prism parapet appears in the opening sentence ("the prism parapet refracting the dying light into fractured rainbows that bled across the damp flagstones") and returns with reweighted meaning in the penultimate passage ("The last bell tolled. / The rainbows faded."). Setup (+0.6), lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake (+1.2), and closure linkage (+0.9) push the score upward. However, the parapet itself is not handled or used in a second beat—the cracked mirror rests on "the parapet's edge," but the parapet as prism does not constrain a choice or supply a resource. The element functions primarily as atmospheric anchor and symbolic bookend rather than causal agent, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is introduced early (the woman pays "in a heartbeat… a pulse stolen from a sleeping soldier, still warm, still thrumming"), shapes the middle beat (Liora uses it to animate the mirror's vision), and is present at closure ("the heartbeat she'd been given begin to unravel, its borrowed time seeping back into the air like mist"). Setup (+0.7), beat involvement in two distinct actions (+0.9), causal pressure (the heartbeat enables the mirage and carries the cost to the soldier, +1.0), closure linkage (+1.1), and specificity (the warmth, the ghost of fear, the unraveling, +0.6) combine for strong integration. The visible cost—soldier wakes with ribs aching, dreams of a child he never met—ties the concept to consequence and stakes. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "perceptively calm" appears once as a label: "her perceptively calm gaze never flickering as she traced the coded lullabies." It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; calmness is asserted but not dramatized through a tradeoff or a choice under pressure. No setup in the first third, no beat involvement beyond the single mention, no closure linkage. Label-only trait (−0.6) and swappability (−0.5) keep the score low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Grace appears twice: "her grace not in movement but in stillness—the way she let the mirror slip from her fingers before it could show her own face" and "she would walk down the terrace steps… her hands steady." The first instance ties grace to a specific action (letting the mirror slip) that avoids self-confrontation, a micro-choice with thematic weight. Setup in the middle third (−0.3 for late first appearance), beat involvement in one key moment (+0.4), and thematic closure linkage (the stillness reprised in her steady hands, +0.7). However, the action is easily swappable—steadiness or composure could replace grace with minor edits (−0.6)—and the cost is conceptual rather than visible on the page. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coded lullabies are signaled early ("coded lullabies in the margins—children's songs with notes bent just slightly sharp, the way only the desperate could hear them") and used in the middle beat ("she hummed the first line, her breath curling into the spring air as the mirror… clouded, then cleared to reveal a boy"). The method enables the mirage and its mechanics are shown on the page. Setup (+0.7), beat involvement in one distinct action (+0.4), causal pressure (the humming activates the vision, +0.9), and specificity (bent-sharp notes, desperation as the cipher, +0.5) support integration. However, the lullabies do not shape attempts or return at closure; the ending references children's voices and "her lullabies still humming just beneath the sound of her footsteps," but this is atmospheric rather than mechanically active (−0.4). Strong mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The echoing terrace is established in the opening and serves as the sole location throughout. The bells' echo rolls over the stones, children's voices rise from alleyways below, and the terrace holds the scent of spring and the ghost of a song at closure. Setup (+0.7), closure linkage (the terrace is empty of rainbows and songs in the final image, +0.8), and the echo motif that ties to the dominant stake (+0.5). However, the terrace does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter tactics; Liora could perform this ritual in any location. Micro-setting credit for the parapet and mirrors is noted, but the terrace as echoing space functions primarily as atmospheric frame rather than causal agent. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe—"the hush before bells ring"—is signaled in the opening ("the hush before the cathedral bells began their evening toll"), tracked through the middle ("the cathedral bells began to stir… their first chime still unspoken but coming"), and paid off precisely at closure ("as the first bell rang," "The last bell tolled"). Setup (+0.8), beat involvement across three distinct moments (+1.4), causal pressure (the bells mark the ritual's window and Liora's departure, +1.0), closure linkage (the tolling bell coincides with her vanishing, +1.3), and specificity (the hush as a live resource she needs, +0.6). The live clock tightens decisions and the final toll reweights the dominant stake. Strong integration, essential to the story's rhythm and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to persuade mirrors to show possibilities is introduced early ("Her gift was not in pigments but in persuasion: she coaxed mirrors to show not reflections, but possibilities") and dramatized in the middle beat (she hums the lullaby, the mirror clouds and clears to show the boy). Setup (+0.7), beat involvement in one key action (+0.4), causal pressure (the desire drives the transaction and shapes the mirage, +0.8), and closure linkage (she picks up another cracked mirror, continuing the pattern, +0.7). However, the motivation is not conflicted in the final choice; friction between want (to give others possibilities) and cost (never seeing her own) is told rather than tested on the page at closure (−0.5). Solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dusky harmony is signaled in the opening (dying light, fractured rainbows) and woven throughout: the hush before bells, the balance between rain and spring warmth, the space "between what was and what could be." The tone modulates with pressure—elegiac stillness in the opening, brief intensity when the heartbeat unravels, quiet resolution as the rainbows fade—and charges the final image ("that dusky harmony, between what was and what could be, she was neither thief nor saint"). Setup (+0.7), tonal coherence across all beats (+1.2), closure linkage (the harmony explicit in the final passage, +1.1), and the modulation that supports rather than flattens pressure (+0.6). The tone is purposeful and integral to the story's effect.</comment>
