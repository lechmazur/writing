<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias exhibits clear motivation (selling driftwood, finding his way) and his carving skill shapes concrete choices at the archway. Interiority is specific and embodied ("fingers found the lantern slide," "breath curling into the storm"). However, the transformation at the archway—from lost to guided—feels more mystical than earned by prior internal contradiction or struggle; his decision to carve lacks a visible cost that forecloses another path. The piece gestures toward "perpetually learning" but this remains more label than dramatized limiter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. The archway functions as a loom where past and present hands converge; the lantern slide's "layered meanings" and Elias's carving create a pattern that deepens rather than causally narrows options. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the storm shifts, the path "unspools," and Elias walks forward with a new understanding of connection across time. Cost is oblique—he loses the slide and GPS but gains direction—yet the final image of slipping driftwood into the woman's pocket reweights the opening stake (reaching Port Veyra) into a recursive act of guidance. One meaningful deepening is present, though the transition from mystical revelation to pragmatic path-finding could be more causally taut.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway is vividly rendered ("salt-crusted stone," "jagged mouth," "ribcage of some ancient leviathan") and pressures Elias's situation by blocking his route and forcing engagement. The lantern slide functions as micro-setting, its "brass edges warm as if alive" and layered surface constraining his perception and choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wind's "turbine-hum," gulls wheeling left). The archway's stones "humming with the same layered frequency as the slide" charges the closure when Elias carves and embeds the blackthorn hand, making the environment indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reach Port Veyra and sell the driftwood. One meaningful tightening occurs when the GPS fails and the storm traps Elias at the archway, forcing him to engage the lantern slide and carve. The slide's light "threading through the storm" and the subsequent path reveal constitute a deepening rather than a causal reversal—pressure accumulates via the mystical loom metaphor rather than narrowing options through protagonist agency. Cost is present (he loses the slide and GPS) but feels more like mystical exchange than a trade-off Elias consciously weighs. The carving choice alters his immediate tactic but the agency feels more reactive than self-determined.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—connection across time, the desire to leave a mark, scaffolding complexity with simplicity—emerges organically from the archway's history (sailor's compass rose, violets, "we were here") and Elias's carving. The lantern slide's "scaffold of simplicity holding up something vast" directly enacts the core concept without stating a moral. The final image (slipping driftwood into the woman's pocket) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: guidance recurs, and the storm's cycle continues. No overt thematic statements mar the closure, though "the archway wasn't a door. It was a loom" hovers near explication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, filtering setting and action through Elias's driftwood sculptor's eye ("bones of the world, the way time carved and connected"). Diction is consistent and elevated but character-appropriate for an artist. One brief conversation at the docks distinguishes the woman's brisk pragmatism from Elias's reflective voice. Perceptual signature is strong (carving metaphors, attention to material and form). However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository register ("*timewoven alliances*—not images, but moments stitched into light") that feels more authorial than Elias's idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid ("blue dot winking out like a dying star," "golden stitches"). Information density is high in the archway sequence. However, line-level issues accumulate: "He pressed his palm" / "He pressed the lantern" / "He pressed the finished piece" recycles the same verb stem across key beats, creating template cadence. "The storm roared approval" and "the archway groaned as if in answer" personify without earned pressure. Filter verbs ("he wondered," "Elias saw," "Elias understood") stack in the middle third, dulling immediacy. The final third recovers momentum, but the mid-section loops ("Their motives weren't his, but their *need* was") without advancing pressure. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of driftwood sculptor, magic lantern slide, and time-layered archway offers a fresh synthesis. The "loom" metaphor and the notion of leaving a mark across centuries transform familiar "artist finds inspiration" material. However, the mystical mechanics (slide pulses, light spills sideways, wind changes on cue) rely on convenient magic rather than grounded rules; the lantern's properties are declared rather than discovered through constraint. The ending gesture (slipping driftwood into the woman's pocket) feels slightly convenient—a thematic bookend rather than an inevitable consequence. Emotional truth is present but the resolution skews toward surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's sculptor identity is present early (driftwood reimagined as "winged beasts and hollow-eyed saints") and shapes his perception ("bones of the world, the way time carved"). He carves the blackthorn hand at the archway, a key turn. However, his sculpting skill is more backdrop than constraint; any traveler with a knife could carve. The trait enables the closure gesture (driftwood boat in the woman's pocket) but lacks a visible cost tied to his craft. Middle development is weak—he observes and interprets more than he acts. Two gates met (setup, closure participation); cap at ~6.0 range. Swappability and lack of middle pressure lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lantern slide is bought from the blind cartographer before the story opens (setup gate met). Elias handles it twice: turning it over to see "layered meanings" and pressing it to the archway, where it "spills out" light and reveals the time-layered hands. It drives the mystical revelation beat and enables the path forward, then vanishes. Three touches (pocket, examination, archway) across two beats. Closure linkage is indirect—its absence is noted ("no slide, no GPS") but it does not appear in or shape the final image. Strong mid-story pressure, but the ending shift away from the object and the fact that it could be any magical catalyst lower the score. Two gates firmly met (setup, middle); closure participation is weak. Swappability friction applies.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" is named early (the blind cartographer's phrase) and echoed in the archway's history (sailor, lighthouse keeper, refugee). The concept shapes Elias's interpretation—he sees the archway as a "loom" connecting hands across time—but it remains more thematic lens than tactical constraint. It does not narrow his options or impose a cost; instead, it explains the mystical mechanics post-revelation. The final gesture (leaving driftwood for the next traveler) enacts the concept, granting closure participation. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is interpretive rather than constraining. Functional but largely swappable with "echoes across time" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" is declared in the middle third ("He was perpetually learning, wasn't he?") as a reflection on driftwood's lesson. It does not constrain an on-page choice or impose a visible cost—Elias does not struggle with ignorance, mislearn something, or pay a price for curiosity. The trait is label-only, compatible with the theme but not dramatized. Late first appearance (past midpoint) and no middle or closure participation. One gate at most (thematic mention). Ornamental use and swappability frictions apply heavily.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Reimagine" is present early (driftwood reimagined as beasts and saints) and recurs at the archway when Elias carves "not a beast or a saint, but a hand." This shift—from decorative art to connective symbol—drives the story's key turn and charges the closure. The action is specific and irreplaceable; removing it would break the final image's logic. However, the reimagining is more aboutosis than constraint—it does not narrow options or impose felt cost beyond effort. All three gates met (setup, middle choice, closure shaping). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but cost connection is thin. High 6s to low 7s range; rounding and friction for swappability at the conceptual level (any artist "reimagines") keep it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" is signaled when the slide shows "not images, but *layers*" (fisherman's net, child's shell, woman's basket). The method matters in the revelation beat—Elias sees multiple temporalities at once—but it is more mystical description than mechanics he manipulates. He does not decode layers, choose between them, or pay a cost for misreading. The method enables the archway revelation but does not shape his carving attempt. Setup and one middle beat; closure participation is indirect (the carved hand continues the pattern). Functional but largely passive receipt rather than active use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway is introduced early ("ribcage of some ancient leviathan") and pressures every choice: it traps Elias, houses the historical marks, and serves as the locus for the lantern's revelation. He carves into its highest crack, embedding the blackthorn hand. The archway's stones "humming with the same layered frequency as the slide" make it indispensable to the mystical mechanics. At closure, the archway "had another layer," directly reweighting its meaning. All three gates met; strong causal pressure and closure shaping. Cost is present (effort, mystical exchange). Irreplaceability is high—no other setting could hold the time-layered history. Slight swappability at the symbolic level (any ancient structure could serve) prevents a score above 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe anchor ("after the GPS fails") is met early when "the last flicker of Elias's GPS" winks out. The loss of navigation technology forces engagement with the archway and primes the mystical solution. However, time does not tighten further—no countdown, no worsening storm, no escalating cost. The ending notes "no GPS" alongside "no slide," marking the cost, but the timeframe itself is more setup than ongoing pressure. Two gates met (setup, closure mention); middle development is weak. Functional but replaceable with "lost" or "stranded."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To scaffold complexity with simplicity" is dramatized in the lantern slide's image (simple acts—mending, pressing, weaving—"holding up something vast") and in Elias's carving choice (a hand, not a beast). The motivation is visible in his final gesture (leaving driftwood for the next traveler) and in the archway-as-loom metaphor. However, the desire is more interpretive theme than conflicted choice—Elias does not struggle between complexity and simplicity, nor does he pay a cost for choosing one over the other. Setup is present (driftwood as distilled form), closure participation is clear (simple hand charges the ending). Middle friction is minimal. Two gates; functional but not deeply pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" is established early (storm's "turbine-hum filled his skull") and sustained through lyric diction ("breath curling into the storm," "golden stitches," "light flared once, bright as a struck match"). Tone modulates from urgency (GPS fails, storm howls) to mystical calm (the wind stills, Elias sees the layered hands) to quiet resolution (walking toward the festival glow). The final image (slipping driftwood into the woman's pocket) maintains the contemplative register. Coherent across turns and purposefully charges the closure. Strong execution with minor dips into expository voice ("the archway wasn't a door. It was a loom") that slightly tension the reverie. All three gates met; high integration.</comment>
