<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist is established through action (collecting photographs, framing them) and clear motivation (transmuting collective pain), but remains abstract. Her choices—kneeling, plucking lavender, arranging photos—feel illustrative rather than pressured by contradiction. The piece gestures toward internal conflict ("her chest didn't ache") but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously. Body and gesture remain generic (traced clasps, slight smiles) without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (photographs, lavender, butterfly, ruins) and the final shot attempts to consolidate meaning. Orientation anchors (archivist, lavender field, factory ruins) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the photograph will be hung, the town will feel the past reaching forward), but cost remains implied rather than legible on the page—no visible price paid, no option foreclosed. The piece teaches its pattern but the ending assertion ("the world walked with her") tells rather than shows the reweighting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly rendered ("purple haze," "metal bones half-swallowed," "scent of crushed lavender and old iron") and constrain the archivist's final shot—she waits for shadow to stretch "just so." The micro-setting (fence, field's edge, light shift) directly shapes the photograph's composition. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the archivist's professional eye, grounding the abstract work in concrete place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: transmute the town's grief into collective healing through art. Pressure accumulates through gathering images and waiting for the right light, but no live complication tests the protagonist's approach—the girl, butterfly, and light all cooperate. The photograph is taken without resistance or cost; the bakery son's future response is narrated rather than dramatized. One meaningful deepening occurs (adding lavender to the case beside the weeping man's photo), but escalation remains gentle and the final act feels assured rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (collective healing through reframed pain) emerges from concrete action—photographs layered beneath the lens, the girl chasing the butterfly framed by reaching hands. The final image offers a resonant answer: "the way the past could stretch forward like a hand, not to pull them under, but to lift." However, late-paragraph moralizing ("healing wasn't subtraction, but rearrangement," "time was just another kind of light") undercuts earned resonance with stated thesis. The line "Some pains were too big for one person to hold. But a town? A town could carry anything, if you showed them how" articulates theme too directly, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—the archivist notices light angles, shadow stretches, the arrangement of hands in photographs. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("breath held too long," "grief might unravel into art"). However, elevated register occasionally drifts from the grounded professional voice ("perceptively calm" as descriptor, "transmuted pain" in narration). The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains narrative distance, but some lines ("That was the trick of it") feel like helpful narrator syndrome, over-explaining what the images have already shown.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece exhibits significant pattern-artifact density. Template cadence runs throughout: "She opened... She pressed... She closed... She smiled... She adjusted... She walked." Paraphrase loops appear frequently—"healing wasn't subtraction, but rearrangement" immediately follows "their weight had changed," restating the same concept. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh vehicle logic ("threads," "constellation," "stitches in a wound," "veins of light"). Filter-verb stacks cluster in the final third ("she knew," "she didn't look back"), dulling immediacy during the closure beat. These artifacts trigger −1.4 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—artist healing community trauma through reframed photographs—reads as a template for socially engaged art narratives. The archivist character, the collective grief, the symbolic objects (lavender, butterfly, ruins) align closely with workshopped therapeutic-art frameworks without fresh inflection. Transformation test fails: swap names and setting with minimal loss. The photographs-as-healing device and the itinerant-artist-moves-on structure feel familiar. No bold risk elevates the material; the piece chooses median safety throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The archivist appears throughout and makes choices (plucking lavender, waiting for light, pressing the shutter), but these are illustrative of her established method rather than pressured decisions that alter tactics. Present by first third, touches multiple beats, but lacks causal turning power—remove her specific choices and the emotional arc remains unchanged. Swappable with a generic contemplative artist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dove gray case appears in paragraph 3, is opened to reveal photographs (paragraph 16), closed (paragraph 25), and returns in the final passages ("adjusted the strap," "its weight now a promise"). The case holds the photographs that are central to the work, but the object itself remains passive container—its specific properties (leather worn smooth, dove gray color) do not constrain choice. Present across beats and at closure, but replaceable with any portfolio case.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Collective healing is stated as goal early ("town's grief might unravel into art") and returned to frequently in narration, but shapes stakes more as theme than on-page tactics. The bakery son's future response is told rather than shown; no dramatized moment where healing attempt meets resistance or cost. The concept drives the archivist's motivation but does not alter options in scene—she executes her method without complication.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears once as label ("Perceptively calm, she waited") but is not dramatized through constrained action or visible tradeoff. The attribute is told rather than shown through choices—we see her waiting and working methodically, but no moment where this calmness enables one path while foreclosing another. Ornamental descriptor without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Linger" appears twice as specific action: "she lingered where the lavender met the rusted fence" (paragraph 6) and "She lingered once more at the field's edge" (paragraph 27). The first linger is causally connected to waiting for light and taking the final shot; the second frames the ending image. The action is purposeful and shapes the photograph's composition, but could be replaced with "waited" or "paused" without structural loss. Present early and at closure with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Black-and-white photographs of reaching hands are introduced early (paragraph 4), layered beneath the lens for the final shot (paragraph 13), and recur in the ending ("the arcs would glow like veins of light"). The method shapes the archivist's approach—she collects and arranges these specific images—and the "arcs" return at closure. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we never see the practical work of layering or how this technique imposes constraint. Present across beats with thematic reprise but lacks on-page causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory ruins are established in the opening lines, provide the location for all action, and constrain the final photograph—she waits for the factory's shadow to "stretch just so across the field." The setting supplies both the historical wound (factory's last whistle) and the present healing image (field in bloom). The fence, field's edge, and light angle directly shape the composition. Essential across beats and drives the ending's visual logic; difficult to relocate the story without losing causal links.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"As vines climb" appears once in the opening ("vines that climbed higher each year") and returns in the penultimate passage ("the vines behind her climbed higher"). Time passage is narrated rather than dramatized—thirty years since the whistle, no on-page clock tightening decisions. The vine-growth is metaphoric backdrop, not a pressure mechanism. Present at opening and ending but ornamental; no tactics altered by temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to transmute pain into a masterpiece" is stated early ("transmuted pain: not by hiding it, but by letting it breathe") and drives all on-page action—collecting photos, waiting for light, taking the shot. The archivist's chest "didn't ache" marks a small internal shift, suggesting desire partially satisfied. However, the motivation is never dramatized in conflict—no moment where creating the masterpiece costs her something else she wants, no friction between artistic vision and immediate need. Functional but frictionless; told more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone blends lyrical sincerity ("breath held too long," "grief might unravel into art") with gentle optimism (girl chasing butterfly, "the world was full of hands reaching"). The register remains consistent—earnest but elevated—throughout. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure; the archivist's calm assurance persists without tonal shift when stakes might heighten. The ending's declarative optimism ("the world walked with her") reinforces rather than complicates the opening mood. Coherent but static; does not charge the final image through contrast or deepening.</comment>
