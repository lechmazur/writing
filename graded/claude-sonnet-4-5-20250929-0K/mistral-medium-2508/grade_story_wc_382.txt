<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand his whispering brownstone is concrete and drives his choices across the arc. The transformation from passive listener to active interrogator is earned through the seal-signing beat and the building's grief revelation. Veyra functions more as mechanism than character with distinct wants; his teacher role feels atmospheric rather than interpersonally charged. Minor: "patiently nimble" appears as a label without embodied cost in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elias inherits Veyra's tutor role, the cycle explicitly repeats with the new scholar and desk mention, and the cost—becoming "patient as the dead, nimble as a lie"—is legible on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: meteor showers frame lessons, the seal's warmth shifts to cold, and the rooftop tea ritual recurs with reweighted meaning. Orientation anchors (Elias, third-floor door, borrowed sugar premise) arrive within the first ~100 words. One escalation beat (signing the contract that opens the building's grief) tightens the dominant stake sufficiently for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during meteor showers supplies both atmosphere and a recurring frame that charges the closure tea scene. The seal's tactile warmth/cold shift and the brownstone's spatial details (third-floor window, basement stairs counting differently on Tuesdays) ground the language-of-buildings conceit in micro-setting that constrains Elias's interrogation. Spatial choreography across apartment, rooftop, and the final empty room remains clear. The meteor shower functions more as backdrop than constraint; it does not alter a tactic, keeping the setting in the strong-support band rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the building's language to understand its whispers—is signaled early and tightens when Elias signs the blood contract, which opens the building's grief and transforms passive listening into active interrogation. The woman's silhouette revelation and Elias's question "What did you do to her?" supply a meaningful deepening with felt cost (he staggers, the building exhales decades of grief). Agency operates through renunciation and inheritance: Elias accepts the tutor cycle, foreclosing a path away from the brownstone's demands. The escalation is Accumulative; one decisive intensification (contract signing) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—agreements as entrapment, lies as structure—emerges from the seal contract, Veyra's "agree to the lies first," and the cyclical tutor inheritance without overt statement. The final image (Elias offering tea, echoing Veyra's opener) reweights prior material: the patient-as-the-dead smile and "some agreements were tombs" charge the ending with conceptual cost. The woman's silhouette grief and the building's interrogation layer ethical ambiguity (what did the building do?) without neat resolution. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance appropriately tightens during the contract-signing beat. Diction ("ink-stained fingers," "dry as old parchment," "patient as the dead") creates a distinct, slightly archaic texture that suits the dead-language conceit. Minor register drift: "interrogating" and "renunciation" edge toward elevated abstraction in a few beats, though the context supports them. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Veyra's lines ("you've come about the seal," "agree to the lies first") carry subtext and goal pursuit. The perceptual signature—Elias's attention to building whispers, brick textures, and silhouette shapes—remains character-specific throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance world logic (language of buildings), character arc (listener to interrogator), or atmosphere (meteor showers, wisteria question marks). Minor paraphrase loop: "the tutor said" / "Veyra stated" / "the tutor murmured" recurs across adjacent beats without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "wisteria vines curled like question marks" and "steam curling into the shapes of forgotten letters" lean decorative. Rhythm varies appropriately; the final paragraph's short declaratives ("He kept the seal. And when...") accelerate closure momentum. No major scaffolding or template cadence runs, but figurative density in the rooftop lesson paragraph slightly slows the beat without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dead-language-tutor-as-cycle and buildings-with-memory premise is fresh within the mentor-inheritance trope; the blood-contract signature and the building's grief (woman's silhouette) provide specific, non-generic inflections. The rooftop meteor-shower frame and the "language resisted being known, slipping like mercury" image avoid stock occult-school beats. Risk: the cyclical ending commits fully to the agreements-as-tombs conceit without hedging or explaining away the building's complicity. Minor: the "some lies were agreements, and some agreements were tombs" formulation edges toward aphorism, though it grows from prior particulars (seal contract, Veyra's vanishing) rather than arriving as a standalone moral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veyra signals setup (appears by paragraph two, hands Elias the seal), enables middle development (teaches rooftop lessons, presents the blood contract), and shapes closure participation (his vanishing and the lease listing no tenant trigger Elias's inheritance of the tutor role). His choice to offer the contract and then disappear creates two distinct beats. Causal pressure: the contract-signing beat narrows Elias's options and opens the building's grief. Specificity: "dead language tutor" with ink-stained fingers and the smell of "damp earth and chalk" supplies irreplaceable detail. Cost connection: Veyra's prior death ("a man who'd died once already") and his vanishing tie directly to the cycle's price. The element is present across all three gates and drives two beats; strong middle-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The brass seal appears in beat one (on the antique desk, etched script), beat two (Elias turns it over, metal warm and humming), beat three (signing the blood contract, seal burns his palm), and closure (seal now cold when Elias wakes, he keeps it). Development: the seal enables the contract-signing choice that opens the building's whispers. Closure linkage: Elias keeping the cold seal signals his full inheritance of the tutor cycle. Specificity: the seal's warmth-to-cold shift and its function ("marks contracts in the language of old buildings") make it irreplaceable. Cost: the burn and the building's grief release tie directly to the seal's use. Four-beat involvement, causal pressure, closure presence, and specificity place it in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: Veyra's "agree to the lies first" appears early (paragraph ~7). Development: the concept constrains the middle choice—Elias must sign knowing "the lie" is "that you'll walk away unchanged." Closure participation: the final paragraph's "some lies were agreements, and some agreements were tombs" and Elias's "patient as the dead, nimble as a lie" smile charge the ending image. The concept shapes stakes (accepting the building's language means accepting the cycle) and tactics (Elias must interrogate rather than passively listen). Cost: the transformation into another tutor, foreclosing escape, is visible. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; slight late thematic formulation ("some lies were agreements") edges toward statement rather than pure dramatization, keeping it mid-to-upper band rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" appears twice: once as label ("Elias sat, patiently nimble") and once at closure ("patient as the dead, nimble as a lie"). Setup is present by paragraph ~8. Closure participation: the final smile reframes the trait with cost (patience = death-like endurance; nimbleness = deceptive skill). No middle development: the trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible tradeoff. Label-only use in the first mention (−0.3). The closure reprise reweights the phrase but does not demonstrate a tactical cost during a choice beat, limiting causal pressure. Two-touch lyric reprise with closure charge lands in functional-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "interrogating" is named explicitly (paragraph ~22: "the language wasn't for learning. It was for *interrogating*"). Development: the brownstone's grief takes shape as a woman's silhouette, and Elias presses the seal to the bricks demanding "What did you do to her?"—this action narrows his role from learner to investigator. Closure participation: the interrogation reveals "some agreements were tombs" and charges Elias's inheritance of the tutor role with moral ambiguity (the building's complicity). Causal pressure: the demand scene opens the building's sharp-edged whispers and redefines Elias's relationship to the structure. Specificity: swapping "interrogate" for "question" would flatten the coercive, ritualized pressure. Three-beat involvement (naming, demand scene, closure implication), strong causal work, and closure linkage place it in the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph one establishes "borrowing sugar—though neither of them needed it" as the false premise for the first meeting. Development: "The lessons were never in the apartment. They happened on the rooftop during meteor showers" signals the weekly ritual, though no single middle beat dramatizes the transition from one meeting to habitual sessions. Closure participation: Elias knocks on the new scholar's door "with a cup of sugar he didn't need," and "The rooftop garden was already set for tea," explicitly completing the cycle. The method shapes the frame (false errand → recurring ritual) but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost. Lyric reprise (sugar opener → sugar closer) reweights the cycle's trap; mid-band for frame participation without middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: rooftop garden introduced by paragraph ~9; meteor showers anchor the lesson scenes. Development: the rooftop during meteor showers supplies the frame for Veyra's teaching ("press Elias's fingers to the bricks, tracing symbols"), and the meteor-split-sky beat occurs when Veyra hands Elias the blood contract. Closure participation: "The rooftop garden was already set for tea" in the final line closes the cycle. The setting provides atmosphere and a recurring frame but does not constrain a tactical choice (e.g., the rooftop's exposure or the meteor timing does not alter what Elias can or cannot do). Micro-setting note: the bricks and the seal's tactile warmth function more as tool/object than spatial constraint. Three-beat presence, strong closure charge, but limited causal pressure on tactics keep it in solid mid-to-upper functional range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: "Elias had been lingering outside this apartment for weeks, pressing his palm to the bricks, listening" and "the brownstone he'd inherited whispered to him in creaks and drafts, and he was tired of not understanding" establish the motivation by paragraph ~12. Development: the desire to learn drives the contract-signing choice (middle beat) that opens the building's grief. Closure participation: Elias's interrogation ("What did you do to her?") and his inheritance of the tutor role are direct outcomes of the language-learning desire; the cost (becoming the next dead tutor) reweights the initial want. Friction: the motivation is told in summary rather than shown through a failed attempt to understand the building before meeting Veyra (−0.3 for summary-only in setup). Strong causal linkage and closure presence elevate despite the told origin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "as if he'd been expecting Elias for years" and the pot "that hadn't been there a moment before" establish mysterious familiarity by paragraph ~6. Development: the tone modulates across beats—Veyra's knowing ease, the building's exhaled greeting, the seal's humming warmth—without jarring shifts. Closure participation: Elias's "as if she'd known him for years" echo and his "patient as the dead, nimble as a lie" smile charge the final image with the same uncanny recognition, now reweighted as cyclic trap. The tone coheres under pressure (contract signing, building grief revelation) and the final reprise deepens rather than merely repeats the opener. Strong coherence and closure charge; slight reduction for the tone operating more through atmosphere than direct constraint on a choice beat.</comment>
