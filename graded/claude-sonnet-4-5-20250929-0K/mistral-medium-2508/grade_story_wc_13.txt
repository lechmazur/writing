<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elspeth's interiority is concrete and shows genuine stakes—the moths disappearing, the pendant's hum, the decision to hurl the jar—but her internal conflict remains understated. The boy appears as a cryptic device rather than a pressure source, and her motivations shift without visible struggle: she moves from seeking echoes to destroying the jar without dramatized deliberation. The final choice (pulling the echo's leash) arrives without a felt cost that forecloses a visible path; the moths simply return and she resumes work, suggesting endurance rather than transformation but without the visible price Earned Stasis requires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: motifs layer (moths, pendant, canal, echo, giant) and the final act—pulling the echo's leash—reconfigures the city's dreaming state. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the giant shifts but does not wake, moths return, and Elspeth resumes her work with the echoes "only just beginning to speak," crystallizing a fragile equilibrium. The cost is implicit rather than visceral—we infer effort and risk but do not see a forfeited path or visible wound. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, stakes), and the accumulative pattern is taught early, but the final beat's cost legibility falls short of undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop canals are vivid and purposeful: "black and slow as ink," "crumbling parapet," the boy's boat drifting backward. Spatial choreography is clean (Elspeth at the parapet edge, boy below in the canal), and the setting constrains action—the jar is hurled *into* the canal, the thread pulled *from* it. The canal water as medium for time and echoes charges the final act. Minor: the giant's anatomy (towers as ribs/bones, canals as veins) is asserted more than felt in tactical pressure, but the canal itself meets the 9+ gate by shaping the closure move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the moths and preventing the giant's waking—is signaled early and sustained. Elspeth's choice to hurl the jar is a meaningful tightening that narrows options, and pulling the echo's leash escalates pressure into the final beat. However, agency feels reactive rather than driven by internal contradiction: the boy offers a problem, she solves it with an object from her satchel. The cost of the action (the boy unraveling, the pendant burning cold, the giant stirring) is described but not felt as a trade-off or forfeiture that Elspeth visibly weighs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—time borrowed, echoes born, the city's dream-state—emerges from image and action rather than statement. The infinity pendant, moths dissolving/returning, and the echo's leash function as motifs that reweight by the end. The final image ("The echoes—well. They were only just beginning to speak.") offers resonance without moralizing. Slight reduction: the boy's "Not stealing. Borrowing." and the narrated rule "time borrowed must be repaid" veer close to thematic statement, and the giant metaphor (city as slumbering titan) is told more than dramatized in choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "interrupted cadence," "a pulse of light throbbed like a trapped heartbeat," "thin as paper," "teeth sharp as a clock's hands." Psychic distance is stable third-limited on Elspeth; no head-hopping. The boy's dialogue ("Clever girl") feels slightly generic, but his cryptic idiom is consistent. Under peak stress (jar thrown, thread pulled), syntax compresses appropriately without losing coherence. Free indirect blends description and perception cleanly throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("wings like stained glass," "veins through which time leaked like slow blood"), but density flags in the middle: "She didn't ask what would happen if the giant woke. She already knew." is scaffolding that could be cut, and "The canals would run backward. The towers would unbuild themselves." summarizes consequences rather than charging the present beat. "Throbbed like a trapped heartbeat" and "ink bled upward, defying gravity" are vivid, but "thin as paper" and "sharp as a clock's hands" read stock. No loops or major template cadence, but some lines do single jobs when the length demands more.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—natural history illustrator in a time-warped canal city where moths escape frames and echoes arrive before sounds—is specific and non-obvious. The infinity pendant, echo's leash, and boy-as-time-thief avoid direct allegory. However, the "city as sleeping giant" and "time must be repaid with interest" are familiar fantasy premises executed competently but not transformed by unique lived detail or moral calculus. The ending's poise (work resumes, echoes begin) feels earned rather than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elspeth's role as natural history illustrator seeds her attention to the moths (first paragraph) and her act of sketching the moth whose wings bleed into a key shape, but her key choices—hurling the jar, pulling the thread—are not illustrated by her observational skill. Present across beats, causally involved in the inciting image (ink bleeding into a key), but the profession does not constrain or enable the closure action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pendant hums when "the city's rhythm faltered" (early signal), "grew warm" when the boy extends his hand, and "burned cold" when Elspeth pulls the thread (three beats, evolving tactile response). It is identified as her mother's relic from the last full sleep, tying backstory to stakes. However, it does not causally enable the climax—Elspeth uses the jar and the thread, not the pendant—so its role is atmospheric marker rather than tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is named by Elspeth and demonstrated on the page: echoes arrive before sounds, reflections move independently, hours loop unevenly, the boy's boat rewinds. The concept shapes the city's stakes (the giant's fitful nap) and the final act (pulling the echo's leash restores cadence momentarily). It appears in tactics (seeking "the place where echoes are born") and charges the ending ("the space between hours"). Causal and atmospheric throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The attribute "sculpts time itself" is asserted in narration ("clocktowers wound by unseen hands, their gears sculpting the hours into uneven loops") but not enacted by a character on the page. The city's time-warping is environmental backdrop; Elspeth and the boy borrow or manipulate time's effects (echoes, loops) but do not sculpt hours directly. Label-only, no visible cost tied to this trait in a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Uncage" appears in the boy's line ("You have to uncage it") and Elspeth's act of hurling the jar can be read as uncaging the trapped pulse of light, which then allows her to pull the echo's leash. The action is implicit rather than dramatized with a literal cage, and the verb itself does not return or reweight at closure. Present in two beats (boy's instruction, jar destruction), but swappable with "release" or "free" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Borrowing time" is stated by the boy ("Not stealing. Borrowing.") and linked to the rule "time borrowed must be repaid." Elspeth's act of throwing the jar (a "pulse of light throbbed like a trapped heartbeat") and pulling the thread can be inferred as reclaiming or repaying borrowed time, but the mechanics—how she borrowed it, what the jar contains, why it works—are elided. Signaled early, shapes the boy's role, but the means remain cryptic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system is established in the opening line, provides the medium for all key actions (boy arrives by boat, jar thrown into canal, thread pulled from canal), and its black water becomes the literal source of the echo's leash. Spatial choreography (Elspeth at parapet edge, boy below) is clean and the canal's rewind effect (boat drifting backward) dramatizes time disruption. Micro-setting that constrains and enables the climax.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Across a giant's nap" frames the timeframe conceptually (the city's slumber, the giant shifting but not waking) and appears in Elspeth's pendant backstory ("from the last time the city slept"). The ending hinges on disturbing but not breaking the nap. However, the duration of Elspeth's search and the immediacy of the boy's arrival are not tracked, so urgency is atmospheric rather than clock-driven. Present at setup and closure, but does not tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elspeth's goal "to find the place where echoes are born" is stated in paragraph six and drives her to the rooftops. The boy's arrival and his line "find the echo before the giant wakes" redirect her action toward pulling the thread. The motivation seeds the quest but does not generate visible internal friction—she shifts from seeking to acting without dramatized conflict between competing wants. Present across beats, but told more than tested.</comment>
