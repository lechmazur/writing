<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's interior is specific and embodied—stillness as "a remade hush pressed into the bones," the knife whittling "without thought." Her final scream and crooked smile feel earned, not declared. The past-performer detail grounds her impulse to narrate and her ultimate refusal to perform grief. Harkin's flat affect and micro-gestures (grunt as affection) provide relational pressure, though his arc is sketched rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands clearly: Lena's scream releases the stasis, and the next-morning whittling-lesson offer reweights "carrying grief" from passive clutching to active making—Earned Stasis with visible cost (the burned tin, the shared bouquet fragment). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases from objects (bouquet, tin, knife) to actions (scream, burn, teach) to the final "choice not absence, a remaking" cadence shift. Orientation is prompt (turbines, porch, Mandate context by paragraph five) and the single-scene window holds. One beat—standing on the rail, the scream—tightens pressure decisively before the closing beats reweight the dominant stake (how to hold grief). Minor gap: the happiness-tin burn feels convenient rather than causally prepared, shaving the top edge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Turbines as "slow, indifferent gods" recur to frame and charge the scream; the porch's splinters and the farmhouse's groaning dust anchor micro-setting. The knife and bouquet are handled tactically (whittling as displacement, petals scattering as release). The setting constrains choice—Lena's isolation on the porch, the wind's role in swallowing sound—and the turbines' mechanical mourning charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is tight: wind, dust, brittle petals filter through grief-numbed attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to hold grief without performing or preserving it falsely) is signaled early and tightens when Lena mounts the rail, announces the scream, and delivers it—forecloses the Mandate's stillness with visible cost (the cracked mask, the burned tin). The whittling-lesson offer is a tactic shift that narrows options (no return to silent clutching). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: objects and gestures accumulate weight until the scream breaks the pattern. No antagonist required; the post-Mandate hush itself is the constraint. One reversal (scream) with a clear escalation path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the bouquet's scentlessness as grief's shape-loss, the empty tin as the Mandate's hollowness, whittling as embodied counter-practice. "It's easier to carry grief when your hands are busy" is close to moralizing but is earned by on-page action (knife, sticks, shared fragment). The final "choice not absence, a remaking" reweights the opening's "remade hush" without stating a thesis—the hush shifts from imposed to chosen. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the turbines and silence recur with altered charge. Subtext in Harkin's silence and Lena's half-smile carries the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; psychic distance modulates from close ("the habit of stillness lingered") to embodied action without head-hopping. Dialogue is spare and subtext-rich ("Still breathing?" as affection-via-deflection). Perceptual signature is consistent: grief filters into objects (bouquet, tin) and textures (dust, brittle petals). Lena's interior idiom—"uselessly delicate," "thing you carried not because it hurt, but because you'd forgotten how to put it down"—is lyric without register drift. Harkin's grunt and single-beat responses feel distinct. No POV leakage. Purposeful compression in the Mandate backstory anchors without scaffolding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives ("She didn't cry") anchor beats, longer lyric sentences ("a thing you carried…") exhale reflection. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high—each image (turbines, bouquet, tin, knife) does double work (setting and symbol, action and theme). Minor filter-verb presence ("seemed to exhale") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. Opening line ("slow, indifferent gods") and closing image ("a choice not absence, a remaking") frame the arc cleanly. One small slip: "something like peace… something like fear, something like hope" repeats the "something like" stem within three lines, a minor scaffold moment that does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The post-authoritarian-cheer premise (Happiness Mandate) is familiar dystopian material but is grounded through specific objects (tin, bouquet) and the performer-turned-silent detail. The scream-as-release beat is earned rather than imported, and the whittling lesson as grief-practice offers a non-obvious synthesis. The turbines as framing gods and the "remade hush" idiom feel particular to this voice. Emotional specificity (scream as "raw, ugly… torn") avoids template catharsis. Risk-taking is modest—structure and turns are legible—but the quietness of the final resolution (teaching, sharing, choosing silence) resists melodrama. Transformation is present but not bold enough to break into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena (blank-faced performer) drives all key turns: standing on the rail, choosing to scream rather than jump, offering the whittling lesson, burning the tin, splitting the bouquet. Her performer past motivates the final choice to make silence active ("dramatically narrating" becomes choosing stillness). Present in setup, middle escalation, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dried bouquet appears in beat one (lap, crumbling), is dropped and scattered during the scream, tucked into pocket after, then split and shared in the final beat. Its scentlessness and brittleness literalize grief's shape-loss; the act of splitting it reweights preservation as active sharing. Four distinct beats, closure participation, visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Remade hush" is named early and frames the opening's imposed stillness. The scream and the final "choice not absence, a remaking" reweight the hush from Mandate residue to chosen practice. It shapes the dominant stake (how to hold grief) and the tactic shift (whittling, teaching). Present in setup and closure, but middle development is more implicit than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Moral ambiguity is gestured at ("The real subversion had never been the performances… It had been the refusal to fill the silence with lies") but not tested on-page with visible cost. Lena's past subversion is told rather than shown constraining a present choice. No clear tradeoff between competing goods; the scream and lesson are presented as unambiguous release and repair.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Whittling appears in beat one (knife, stick, curls falling), recurs as teaching offer post-scream, and is present in the final beat ("the knife moving, the wood falling away"). It literalizes the theme (hands busy carrying grief) and the tactic shift from passive clutching to active making. The lesson offer is the clearest turn; without whittling, the closure would lose its embodied anchor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Dramatically narrating mundane tasks" is referenced in backstory ("And now, we adjust the pillow…") but does not shape present tactics or the final image. The Mandate called it subversion, but Lena's current actions (whittling, screaming) are not narrated dramatically—they are silent or raw. The method is contextualized, not enacted on-page in a way that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The farmhouse and turbines frame every beat (opening, scream, closing work). The turbines swallow the scream, making the setting active in the key turn. The porch railing enables the rail-standing beat. The turbines' indifference and the farmhouse's groaning dust charge the emotional void tone. Present throughout, but the setting does not narrow options as sharply as in higher-scoring examples—it provides atmosphere and symbolic charge more than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the Happiness Mandate" is anchored early ("ended three years ago") and contextualizes the stillness and blank face. The tin's discovery and burning literalize post-Mandate reckoning. Time does not tighten decisions within the scene—the pressure is atmospheric residue rather than a live clock. The timeframe shapes mood and context but does not alter present tactics with urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To cultivate lightness in grief" is dramatized through Lena's past (narrating mundane tasks for patients) and tested in the present via the scream (release) and whittling lesson (active carrying). The final line ("easier to carry grief when your hands are busy") names the desire with visible cost (shared bouquet, burned tin, taught skill). Friction between lightness and the "remade hush" is embodied rather than told. Present across setup, middle choice, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Emotional void" governs tone throughout: blank face, no tears, Harkin's grunt, the scentless bouquet, the turbines' indifference. The scream is "raw, ugly" rather than cathartic release—tone holds even at the break. The final "crooked smile" and "hush… felt like a choice" modulate tone from numb to chosen without warmth flooding in. Coherent through turns, charges the final image with cost (peace is "light enough to hold," not overwhelming).</comment>
