<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to release borrowed guilt is dramatized through the unhooking action and yields concrete cost (dissolving threads, releasing confessions). Internal contradiction operates clearly: his role as guilt-absorber versus his need for personal clarity. The woman's late arrival feels convenient—she announces "I'm here to help you carry yours" without prior setup, which weakens the earned quality of his shift. Embodied emotion is present (trembling fingers, breath hitched) but therapy-adjacent phrasing ("welcome nuance into certainty") in the final third dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (lighthouse keeper, weathered steps, dawn routine) land early. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the shard whispers accumulate pressure, the cloak-unhooking sequence deepens through repetition, and the final image (beam as pulse, quilt from cloak) reconfigures the certainty premise with conceptual cost (dust settles, beam wavers). Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing: the lighthouse's function shifts from rigid guide to uncertain signal, reweighting the premise. One escalation issue: the woman's arrival introduces help without prior friction, softening the cost Elias pays alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse, weathered steps, rail, and tide-line sand ground action and constrain choice (Elias kneels to unhook the cloak buried below). Sensory detail is selective (salt foam, wind howl, steam curling) and filtered through Elias's professional attention. The beam's shift from steady to pulse charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor issue: "breezy dark" and "gloriously, terribly unclear" lean toward abstraction when concrete wind effects (chimes, cloak movement) are already doing the work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (release borrowed guilt to reclaim self) is signaled early and tightens through the unhooking sequence, which forecloses his conscience-for-hire role with visible cost (threads dissolving, cloak becoming quilt). The shard's hiss ("You never unhooked") creates clear internal pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase and cadence shift (from polished routine to uncertain beam) reweight the stake. The woman's arrival deflates solo cost: her offer to "help you carry yours" grants external support at the moment Elias should face the full weight of his choice alone.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (certainty vs. nuance, light's shape in darkness) emerges through concrete particulars: the hollow shard, dissolving cloak threads, beam as pulse rather than command. The final image ("learning its shape") reweights the opening's "polishing certainty" with conceptual cost. The quilt transformation is purposeful and non-literal. One slip: "sacred heaviness of questions that refuse to be answered" states theme directly in the final third, reducing earned resonance. The tea/steam image and chimes' "approval" melody work as subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; Elias's perceptual signature (lighthouse keeper's attention to beam, oil, routine) is consistent. Psychic distance modulates well under pressure (close during unhooking, pulled back for the woman's arrival). The woman's dialogue ("I'm here to help you carry yours") and Elias's reply feel natural and goal-driven. Two slips: "gloriously, terribly unclear" and "sacred heaviness" drift toward elevated register during peak beats, and the final-paragraph interiority ("This is how light begins") reads slightly sermonic rather than filtered through Elias's working idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the unhooking sequence. Concrete action (kneeling, trembling fingers, thread dissolving into foam) propels the middle. Several scaffold patterns accumulate: "The wind X, and the Y Z" structure repeats (wind howled/chimes screamed, wind chimes laughed, wind chimes sighed). Paraphrase loop: "not with the usual golden command, but in fragile strips" closely echoes the later "not by banishing dark, but by learning its shape." Late-paragraph abstractions ("gloriously, terribly unclear," "sacred heaviness") stack figurative language without grounding in action. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and loops touching non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The conscience-for-hire premise and literal cloak woven from confessions offer a fresh synthesis. The beam-as-pulse transformation and unhooking action are specific and non-obvious. Risk: shifting the lighthouse from warning to "room for uncertainty" is thematically bold. Two frictions lower the score: the woman's late arrival as helper follows a familiar support-character template, and the quilt metaphor (doubt as weight/warmth) edges toward therapeutic commonplace. The shard and wind-chime mechanics add texture but don't fully escape symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Conscience-for-hire shapes Elias's backstory (absorbing merchants', judges', poet's guilt) and motivates the central conflict (releasing borrowed confessions). The trait enables the unhooking action and constrains his prior routine. Present in setup (burlap sack, note) and closure (beam shift, woman's arrival). Not swappable: the specific mechanic of shouldering guilt for payment drives the cloak logic. Limiter: the woman's offer to "help carry" dilutes the cost Elias pays alone, reducing irreplaceability of his solo transformation at closure. Two beats (shard whispers, unhooking) plus closure linkage, but cost dilution caps mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hollow mirror shard appears in setup (burlap sack), functions in two beats (listening to whispers, hiss "You never unhooked"), and reprises at closure (hung from rail, "wind could take its turn confessing"). The hollowness and whispering mechanics are specific and irreplaceable. Cost connection: the shard forces Elias to confront his own sins, driving the unhooking choice. Limiter: after its hiss, the shard becomes passive (hung, silent by noon); it does not constrain the final encounter or the beam transformation. Three beats plus early signal and closure reprise support mid-to-high 6s, but passive ending role prevents 7+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cloak of doubt is central: woven from borrowed doubts (setup), buried in sand and unhooking action (middle escalation), transformed into quilt (closure). The concept shapes tactics (each knot = one confession; dissolving threads = release) and the ending's stakes (quilt for weight, not warmth). Irreplaceable: removing the cloak would collapse the unhooking sequence and the final quilt image. Cost connection: releasing the cloak forecloses Elias's conscience-for-hire role with visible loss (threads to foam). Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sincerely insincere describes Elias's past role ("absorbing regrets like a sponge, wringing them out"), but the trait does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It is told in backstory and does not recur to shape a choice. The unhooking sequence and the woman's arrival proceed without reference to this attribute. Swappable: "professional detachment" or "emotional mercenary" would fit equally well. Present in setup (one mention) but absent from middle development and closure participation. Label-only use and swappability cap at 4.6; no middle or closure work prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unhook drives the central escalation: Elias kneels and unhooks each knot (fisherman's remorse, bride's silence), with each thread dissolving into salt foam. The action is specific (first knot, next knot, each unraveling), irreplaceable (no synonym fits the cloak logic), and shapes the middle's pressure and the ending's cost (cloak gone, doubt transformed). Present in setup (shard hiss "You never unhooked"), executed across multiple beats, and directly enables closure (cloak becomes quilt). Cost connection: each unhooking forecloses a piece of his former role with visible loss. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage support high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Deciphering wind chime selections is taught in setup (mother's lesson: three high notes = storm, descending scale = lie), invoked in escalation (frantic rising trill = "Change"), and reprises at closure (chimes laugh, sigh, sing approval melody). The method is specific and enables Elias to read environmental pressure. Limiter: the chimes signal but do not constrain Elias's choices; he proceeds to unhook without altering tactics based on their messages. Lyric reprise (approval melody) reweights the stake but does not impose cost. Three beats plus early signal and closure participation support upper 5s; lack of tactical constraint prevents 7+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Breezy lighthouse at dawn grounds action (weathered steps, rail, beam, tide pulling at cloak) and supplies resources (sand for burial, rail for hanging shard, beam for signaling). The beam's shift from steady to pulse charges the final image. The breeze drives the chimes and will "take its turn confessing" through the shard. Environment constrains the unhooking (Elias kneels in sand) and the ending's signal (beam as pulse). Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor limiter: the dawn's "fragile strips of pink and gray" leans decorative rather than shaping a choice, and spatial choreography (steps to sand to rail) is clean but not tactically complex.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>After the campfire's last spark dies frames the opening and establishes night-to-dawn progression (tonight → dawn broke → by noon → next dawn). The timeframe tightens the unhooking sequence (completed before dawn) and allows the beam shift and woman's arrival within one continuous window. Limiter: the clock does not impose live pressure; Elias is not racing time, and the woman's evening arrival ("That evening") loosely extends the frame without tactical urgency. Present in setup and tracks across beats, but does not alter tactics or narrow options. Functional but replaceable; swapping to "after sunset" would work equally well with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To welcome nuance into certainty is articulated explicitly in Elias's reflection ("I didn't know how to welcome nuance into certainty") and dramatized through the unhooking (releasing binary guilt/innocence for layered doubt) and the beam shift (from command to pulse/question). The motivation shapes the ending's stakes (lens polishing refused, dust settles) with visible cost (certainty foreclosed). Present in middle development and closure. Limiter: the phrase itself is stated rather than implied, reducing subtext, and the woman's arrival provides external help that softens the solo friction between want (certainty) and cost (ambiguity). Two beats plus closure linkage support mid-6s; direct statement and diluted cost prevent 7+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Protected vulnerability is coherent and modulates with pressure: the opening's "hollow mirror shard," trembling fingers during unhooking, the woman's "smile that didn't hide the cracks," and the final "protected vulnerability of a man who'd finally stopped pretending." Tone charges the final image (beam wavering "not with weakness" but with earned uncertainty) and shapes the quilt metaphor (weight, not warmth). The tone is consistent through turns and distinct from formulaic comfort or stark exposure. Present across all three gates with closure linkage and conceptual cost. Minor slip: "gloriously, terribly unclear" slightly over-articulates the tone in the final third, nudging toward declaration.</comment>
