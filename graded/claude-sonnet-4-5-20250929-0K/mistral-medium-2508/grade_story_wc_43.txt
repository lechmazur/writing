<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation is clear and embodied through gestures (vinyl shard pressed to lips, staying until the nurse arrives) that reveal her contradictory impulses—kindness as both gift and "betrayal." Mrs. Calloway's arc from white-knuckled despair to clear-eyed goodbye is earned through the music's concrete effect (fingers tapping, shoulders unclenching). The piece avoids diagnostic label-speak in peak beats, though "decisively kind" reads slightly abstract. Interior contradiction operates in scene rather than summary, and the final renunciation (dropping the vinyl) forecloses attachment with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story deepens through cadence shift—Mrs. Calloway's white-knuckled grip loosens, her tap keeps time, her clarity returns—culminating in Lena's release of the vinyl shard as Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation with felt cost). Orientation anchors (hospice, dusk, seven years' tenure) land early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mrs. Calloway's memory surfaces and reweights the hymn from denial to honored goodbye. Cost is legible in the dropped shard and the knowledge that "another goodbye would have to be flawless."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recurring vinyl shard (jagged, pressed to lips, dropped at the edge) charges the final image and constrains Lena's stance throughout. Sensory anchors—rose gold dusk, chamomile, lavender scent, lemon soap—are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lena's priorities. Spatial choreography (common room, window, edge of the haven, sink) tracks cleanly. The "radiant haven above the clouds" remains somewhat postcard-generic, but the body (hands, ribs, palms) and the vinyl function as micro-setting that alters tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: executing a goodbye that honors rather than begs. Pressure tightens when Mrs. Calloway's bitterness ("hell of a hymn") gives way to memory, then to acceptance ("You play it flawless"), forcing Lena to stay present through the nurse's arrival. The vinyl drop is protagonist-driven renunciation that forecloses maternal grief with visible cost. Agency is clear in Lena's choice to play despite protest, to remain until breathing slows, and to release the shard—each narrowing her options under the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—hope as scent, clean and ephemeral, residing in honored goodbyes rather than cure—emerges from concrete particulars: eggs burned while humming, fingers tapping time, the vinyl "made whole again" in echo. The final image (Lena playing "for the living who would carry them forward") reweights the premise without stating a moral. Mrs. Calloway's "flawless" is thematically earned, meaning faithful witness rather than perfect technique. Subtext operates in gesture (squeeze, tap, breath) and the piece resists tidy resolution, allowing the goodbyes to accumulate cost without false consolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature filters sensory detail through Lena's seven-year hospice lens (scent as a temporal marker, "the exact moment hope shifted"). Diction remains voice-consistent, though "decisively kind" and "pulsing stillness" edge toward elevated register. Dialogue is spare, natural, goal-driven: Mrs. Calloway's bitterness and Lena's calm deflection advance the goodbye without exposition. Free indirect style is clean, and the piece avoids head-hopping. Minor slip: "radiant haven" recurs as descriptor rather than evolving through Lena's changing perception under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at turns, longer cadences in reflection) and information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Figurative language is controlled: "hope shifted from a flame to a scent" and "clouds parted like a promise she no longer believed" are coherent and purposeful. Minor issues: "the pulsing stillness of those waiting" appears twice verbatim, creating a small loop; "radiant haven" recurs as stock phrase without fresh angle. Propulsion is strong, and the final sequence (drop, wash, pick up harp) drives cleanly to closure without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—hospice goodbye charged by broken vinyl and scent-as-hope—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding template grief narratives. The vinyl shard as tactile anchor (pressed, then dropped) transforms the trope of holding onto the past. Mrs. Calloway's memory of burned eggs grounds the hymn in lived mundanity rather than religious abstraction. The frame (heaven-analogue hospice, music therapist) is familiar, but the piece earns freshness through micro-particulars: the jagged bite of vinyl, the tap keeping time, the hum carried on wind. Risk-taking is modest but effective; the quiet ending avoids sentimentality and the moral calculus (kindness as witness, not cure) is non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's choices—playing despite protest, staying until breathing slows, dropping the vinyl—create two key turns (Mrs. Calloway's shift and Lena's release) and shape the closure. Early signal (adjustment of harp strap, seven years' tenure) frames expectation; middle beat (playing *Morning Has Broken*) narrows options; closure beat (washing hands, picking up harp) crystallizes her stance with visible cost. High causal pressure and closure linkage; "serene" is asserted but her contradictory impulses (kindness as betrayal) are dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vinyl shard appears in three distinct beats: opening (pressed to lips for the bite), middle (in pocket during the session), and closure (dropped at the edge, with echo of hymn "made whole"). It constrains Lena's stance (the bite keeps her "decisively kind"), returns with reweighted meaning (from wound to release), and charges the final image. High specificity (jagged sliver, *Abide With Me*, snapped the night of diagnosis) makes it irreplaceable. Strong causal linkage to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scent of hope is introduced early ("faint, like crushed lavender") and recurs in the closure paragraph ("tasting the last of the lavender"). It shapes the dominant stake (hope resides in honored goodbyes, not cure) and reweights Mrs. Calloway's arc (her clarity is the scent made real). Middle development is thematic rather than tactical: the scent does not alter a mid-beat choice but deepens meaning. Closure participation is clear but oblique; the concept is more resonance than engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" appears once as label (vinyl bite "to keep her decisively kind") without clear on-page constraint or visible trade-off in that beat. Lena's kindness is dramatized through actions (playing the hymn, staying, releasing the vinyl), but the attribute itself does not enable or constrain a specific choice with cost. It reads more as thematic claim than causal lever. Present by setup, but no middle development beat where the trait alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reunify" is signaled early ("not to distract, but to *reunify*—to stitch the woman back into the tapestry of her own existence") and drives the middle turn when Mrs. Calloway's memory of her husband surfaces, shifting her from bitterness to connection. The action is specific to Lena's method and irreplaceable—swapping it for "comfort" or "soothe" would flatten the stakes. Closure participation is indirect: the hymn made whole again echoes reunification. Strong causal pressure in one major beat; high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is signaled early ("not with the grand swell of a choir, but with the quiet rhythm of a spoon stirring sugar, of a rocking chair") and its mechanics shape the middle turn: Mrs. Calloway's memory of her husband humming while frying eggs is the exact fruit of this method. The approach enables the goodbye by grounding the hymn in lived detail rather than transcendence. Closure beat (Lena playing "for the living") extends the method's logic. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the means is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" is introduced early but functions mostly as postcard frame. The edge (where Lena drops the vinyl, where "the air was thin") supplies one spatial resource at closure, and the common room's window anchors Mrs. Calloway's gaze. Setting does not constrain mid-beat tactics or alter options under pressure. Two gates (setup, closure participation via the edge), but development is thin. Lyric reprise (dusk at opening, moon at closure) reweights atmosphere but not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the blood work comes back" is the setup anchor (Mrs. Calloway's results in the manila folder) but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. No clock pressure; Lena's session with Mrs. Calloway unfolds at a contemplative pace. The phrase frames the stakes (terminal diagnosis) but does not function as a live constraint. Missing middle development and closure participation. Present but replaceable with "the day of the prognosis" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire to execute a "flawless goodbye" is introduced early (vinyl bite to "keep her decisively kind, even when kindness felt like a betrayal") and conflicted throughout: Lena must honor the dying without mourning prematurely. Mrs. Calloway's "You play it flawless" reweights the goal—flawless means faithful witness, not control. Closure beat ("Another goodbye would have to be flawless") shows the cost of iteration. High causal pressure, friction between wants (perfection) and costs (repetition, emotional toll), and closure linkage. Desire is dramatized, not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" appears in the opening third ("the air thick with the pulsing stillness of those waiting for permission to let go") and recurs verbatim in the closure paragraph ("The radiant haven hummed around her, alive with the pulsing stillness"). Tone is coherent through turns—neither static nor chaotic—and modulates subtly as Mrs. Calloway's breath slows and Lena's tension releases. The phrase charges the final image, framing the ongoing work. Minor deduction for verbatim loop without fresh angle at closure, but the tone shapes atmosphere and ending.</comment>
