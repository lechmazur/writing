<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is given a coherent through-line—physician haunted by unspoken care—but his present choices are mostly observational until the final gesture. The memory surfaces whole rather than being earned through on-page contradiction or micro-choices that test his commitment. Embodiment is intermittent: "fingers trembling" works, but much interiority leans on poetic assertion ("certainty that this was the spark") rather than sensory particulars that would ground his state under pressure. The final laugh and shadow-whole moment gesture at transformation, yet the cost of carrying versus letting go is asserted more than dramatized through a foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: images (jasmine, fog, jade, breath) recur and deepen until the final viaduct-blooms image reweights the premise. Orientation anchors—who, where, when—arrive by paragraph two (camera obscura artist, viaduct at twilight), satisfying the ~120-word test. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow no longer split, love reclaimed into the living world), but cost remains abstract: what option did Elias foreclose by taking the jade, and what tactic changed? The river's floating embers and the child's shadow on the distant bridge suggest ongoing stakes, yet the pilgrim-become-keeper shift is declared rather than earned through a visible renunciation or tactical pivot. The lens holds, but the final image's cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The viaduct's arches, twilight haze, night-blooming jasmine, and moss-covered jade anchor place and atmosphere with sensory specificity filtered through Elias's focus. The camera obscura functions as both tool and micro-setting, its brass lens warm against his palm and its mirror catching faint light—these details recur and charge the final projection moment. Fog curling around ankles and wrists, the scent of wet earth and iron, and the river's ember-scattered surface all pressure mood and provide the means (breath shapes, shadow split) that enable the climactic reveal. The twilight-bloom motif seeds early and returns transformed in the closing beat, meeting the 9+ test of environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: find where unused love goes. The jade press to sternum and the camera obscura's shadow-split serve as one meaningful tightening that narrows uncertainty to revelation. However, escalation is largely textural—density of image and motif—rather than a decision-forcing bind. Elias faces no live trade-off or visible price; the jade grows "warm, then weightless, then gone" without dramatizing what he gave up or what path closed. The child's shadow in the final beat hints at ongoing responsibility, but Elias's agency in becoming "keeper" is asserted post-closure rather than tested on the page. Cost clarity falls short of the 8.0+ gate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—unused love waits until claimed—emerges from the viaduct's stones, the jade legend, and the floating embers without overt thesis statement. The breath-as-thread motif shifts meaning from hitching lies to steady admission, and the camera obscura projects the lost patient's image onto Elias's eyelids, weaving memory into present. The final line ("Here is where the unused love goes. / Until it is ready to be found.") risks moralizing but functions as the stones' chant rather than authorial sermon, keeping it within the world's voice. The pilgrim-to-keeper turn offers a resonant answer to the central question, though the lack of visible cost in Q4 slightly undercuts thematic weight. Still, the integration of motifs (jade, fog, breath, embers) into a non-literal closure meets the 7+ standard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable focal distance; Elias's perceptual signature (warm brass, fog shapes, hitching breath) is consistent. The spectral woman's direct-address dialogue ("You kept me in your ribs") shifts register toward lyric incantation, acceptable within the twilight-bloom tone but briefly flattening Elias's active perception. The closing paragraph's syntactic rhythm ("deepened… no longer felt… was a threshold… was the keeper") stacks verb patterns in a way that reads template-like rather than voice-driven under peak emotion. Diction remains elevated throughout ("wreathed," "lucid fog," "reclaimed sparks"), fitting the accumulative mode, but lacks modulation when pressure should tighten or breathe. Dialogue is minimal and serves motif over interpersonal friction; no second living character tests voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is very high: nearly every sentence in the opening and closing thirds carries metaphor or elevated diction (spine of stone, violet haze, petals unfurling, thread of silver). While purposeful for the accumulative mode, the unrelenting lyricism in peak beats—"It stays. It waits." / stones hummed / fog parting—flattens momentum rather than accelerating it. Paraphrase loops appear: "the jade's weight… burned as it answered" immediately followed by "grew warm, then weightless, then gone" re-states the transformation without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph ("no longer felt… was a threshold… was the keeper… trained on the horizon") runs three passive constructions in sequence. No major clarity breaks, but cumulative line-level debt (density without modulation, mild loops, template stems) triggers −0.6 to −0.8 within Q7 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pilgrim-of-sparks premise and jade-as-sorrow-receptacle offer a fresh synthesis of ghost story and emotional archaeology. However, the emotional arc—physician seeking unspoken kindness—echoes widely used templates (caregiver guilt, past-life closure), and the transformation hinges on receiving rather than choosing: the jade "answered" and the shadow "split" without Elias making a trade-off that would irreversibly mark this as his story. The viaduct-in-bloom and camera obscura anchor specificity, and the breath-as-thread motif is executed with care, lifting the piece above generic. Risk-taking in tone (foggy lucidity sustained throughout) deserves within-band credit (+0.2), but the lack of a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that personalizes the template caps the score in mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is on the page throughout. He adjusts the lens, presses the jade to his sternum, turns the camera toward the sky, and laughs—four distinct physical actions. However, these are largely observational or receptive; the jade and shadow "reveal" rather than Elias making a choice that alters tactics. His final stance as keeper is asserted in the closing paragraph but not tested by a cost-bearing decision. Present in setup, middle, and ending (all three gates), but causal pressure and irreplaceability are modest: a generic seeker could perform the same arc with minor edits. Swappability and lack of on-page trade-off cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's Tear appears in three beats: Elias sees it half-buried, presses it to his sternum, and it grows "warm, then weightless, then gone." The jade's legend (holds sorrow, reveals truth of breath) is seeded early and pays off in the shadow-split and thread-of-silver moments, meeting setup and closure gates. However, the jade's mechanics remain opaque—does it dissolve because the love is reclaimed, or is it a one-use artifact?—and its departure does not visibly foreclose an option or impose cost. The object enables revelation but does not constrain a choice under pressure. Early signal, two-beat involvement, and closure linkage support mid-6s; lack of specific cost and modest irreplaceability (a generic talisman could substitute) prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" frames the quest from paragraph three and returns in the closing image (embers rising, Elias as keeper). The concept shapes the dominant stake—find where unused love goes—and the ending reconfigures his role from seeker to custodian. However, the pilgrimage is complete upon arrival; no on-page tactic shifts because he is a pilgrim rather than, say, a mourner or thief. The concept functions as thematic overlay rather than a mechanical constraint that narrows choices. Setup, weak middle development, closure participation: two gates, eligible to ~6.0. Causal pressure is low; the concept could be rephrased without altering events. Lyric reprise (sparks in paragraph three, embers at end) adds modest resonance, landing the score in lower-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is implied by Elias's years chasing images and his willingness to press the jade to his chest, but the trait is never named or tested by a visible trade-off. Does curiosity cost him safety, time, or skepticism? The text does not dramatize such a friction. The trait is consistent with his actions but replaceable with "determined" or "haunted" without structural change. No on-page cost tied to curiosity specifically. Present in setup (chasing images) and weakly in closure (training lens on the next spark), but missing middle constraint. Swappability and label-only presence cap the score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Heal" appears explicitly: "healing wasn't mending what was broken, but revealing what had always been there." The revelation—shadow no longer split, love reclaimed—is framed as healing, and the closing gesture (training the lens on the child's shadow) implies ongoing repair. However, the action itself is passive: the jade and camera obscura do the revealing, not a medical or relational intervention by Elias. The insight is delivered as epiphany rather than earned through a choice that risks failure. Setup (physician past life) and closure (keeper of sparks) gates are met; middle beat is weak. Causal role in one major moment (the breath-thread reveal) and thematic payoff support mid-5s. Swappability with "redeem" or "restore" and lack of on-page cost tied to the act of healing prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early: jade "could heal… by revealing the truth of a breath—how it hitched when lies were told, how it steadied when the heart finally admitted what it wanted." Elias's deliberate inhalation and exhalation drive three beats: fog shapes (serpent, key), shadow split, and the silver thread connecting chests. The breath-as-thread motif recurs and charges the final image (viaduct's stones sing back the refrain). Mechanics matter: slow, deliberate breathing is the tactic that unlocks the jade's power. Setup, development (breath shapes, shadow), and closure (thread woven into air, embers drawn to breath of the living) gates are met. Causal pressure and specificity are strong. Irreplaceability is high: removing breath-changes would require a full rewrite. Score reflects solid integration across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct provides the location for all action, its arches and fog anchoring mood and the jade's resting place. The setting's legend (village below, no one dared touch the jade) and bloom (night-blooming jasmine, stones humming, arches alive with glow) recur and charge the closing image. However, the viaduct does not constrain a choice: Elias could perform the same arc in a ruin or temple with minor edits. The spatial micro-setting (moss, central arch) enables discovery but does not alter tactics under pressure. Setup, closure participation, and thematic resonance (threshold between worlds) meet two gates and lyric reprise, eligible to ~6.3. Causal pressure is modest; the viaduct is atmospheric more than tactical. Beat involvement (arrival, jade press, final bloom) and closure linkage support mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the past life memory surfaces" is met: the memory surfaces whole in paragraph four, and the rest of the story occurs in the present twilight. However, timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency beyond mood. The "tonight" cue in paragraph one and "last light" anchor the single continuous scene, but time's passage does not alter tactics or raise cost. The before-memory / after-memory structure is present but not leveraged to escalate pressure. Setup gate (memory surfaces mid-story) is met; middle development weak; closure does not hinge on time running out. Functional but replaceable. Swappability (could be "after the vision" or "after the encounter") and lack of cost tied to timing cap below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to find where unused love is stored is voiced in paragraph three ("where the love he'd failed to give—or receive—had been stored all this time") and drives Elias to press the jade and train the camera. The legend's answer ("It stays. It waits.") and the embers drifting below directly address the motivation. Closure reconfigures the question: not finding, but remembering how to carry. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants. Does Elias fear what he'll find, or sacrifice something to learn? The text asserts certainty rather than friction. Setup, development (jade press as motivated act), and closure (pilgrimage "had never been about finding") gates are met. Causal linkage and closure resonance support mid-6s; lack of visible cost or on-page friction between want and fear prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Foggy lucidity—hazy yet precise—is sustained throughout: violet haze, fog curling, breath forming shapes, lucid fog as bridge, twilight deepening. The tone modulates subtly: initial observation (arches, jasmine) gives way to kinetic intensification (shadow split, thread woven) and resolves in crystallized calm (viaduct no longer between worlds, stones singing). Diction remains elevated and dreamlike without breaking into sharp realism, coherent with the accumulative lens. The final image (fog curling like invitation, stones' refrain) charges mood without tipping into abstraction. Tone constrains word choice and pacing, and the foggy-yet-clear effect mirrors the thematic revelation (hidden love made visible). Setup, middle modulation, and closure charge meet all three gates. Strong coherence and payoff at ending support low-7s.</comment>
