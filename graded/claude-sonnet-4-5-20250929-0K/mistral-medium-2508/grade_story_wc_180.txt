<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mender's interiority is textured and specific—"brushing the damp earth as if it were a pulse"—and embodied contradictions emerge (pride vs. yearning, duty vs. discovery). The daughter is rendered through absence and traces, yet her feistiness and deliberate leaving ("a taunt, a plea, a breadcrumb trail") create a legible relationship crucible. Minor slip: the peak moment of eating the apple feels slightly under-motivated as a live choice; the micro-choices leading to it are present but the trade-off could be sharper. The final binding of the ribbon around the mender's wrist carries visible cost—acknowledgment of their blindness—earning the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise (the mender eats the forbidden apple, binds the ribbon, leaves the doll as promise) with felt cost (pride yielded, the daughter's absence persists). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the orchard-cathedral setting, recurring ribbon, and seed all accrue meaning, culminating in the sprout's accusatory twist and the apple-bite as contract-break. Orientation is swift (mender, cathedral-orchard, post-contract breach). One meaningful deepening: the question whispered to the seed triggers the sprout's answer, reweighting all prior material. Cost is legible: the mender must admit their failure to "read the cracks" in their daughter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard-within-cathedral is vividly particular ("apple boughs sagged...their roots tangled through the cracked marble like veins") and constrains the final choice: the mender plants the seed "where the light bends" (rose window), anchoring the closure image in spatial specificity. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (quartz dust, loam pulse, tart apple). The ribbon tied to the branch and the doll left beneath the sprout charge the ending with micro-setting pressure. The interplay of stone, fruit, and light grounds every beat without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: bridging the rift with the daughter by understanding why she left. One clear tightening: the mender digs for the root, finds the box, reads the note—pressure narrows to the whispered question and the sprout's accusatory reply. The apple-bite at the end is protagonist agency with visible cost (breaking their own compliance). Escalation is Accumulative: the mender's persistence deepens as the orchard "hums," the seed pulses, the sprout points. The final reconfiguration—untying the ribbon, binding it to their wrist—closes a live option (clinging to old wisdom) with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (deciduous vows, generational blindness) emerges entirely through particulars: the frayed ribbon, the half-finished doll, the note's challenge, the mender's whispered question. The final image—apple-bite, ribbon-bind, doll left cradling the sprout—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates cleanly in the daughter's absence and the orchard's hum. The mender's shift from duty to choice reweights all prior material. No thematic echo or sermonizing; the ending trusts image and action to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in the mender's perceptual signature: quartz-dust touch, pulse-reading, the ribbon as "bruised twilight." Diction is consistently lyric-tactile ("the contract was dust / The vow was not") without register breaks. The daughter's voice in flashback ("Vows are deciduous") and the orchard's whispered reply ("You taught me to read the cracks. Why didn't you read mine?") are clearly sourced and distinct from narration. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during digging, pulls back for final summary lines). No head-hopping; all knowledge remains character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("roots tangled through the cracked marble like veins," "seed pulsed like a second heart"). Minor slip: slight overwriting in the middle third ("the orchard seemed to hum, the way the cathedral's ghosts might if they still had lungs") borders on self-conscious lyricism but doesn't obscure causality. Information density is high; nearly every line advances. No loops or scaffold. The final lines ("The contract was dust. / The vow was not.") achieve propulsion and image clarity. Grammar and tense are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral fusion and the "deciduous vows" conceit are fresh angles on legacy and abandonment. The mender's occupation (quartz-eye) signals specificity without over-explaining. The daughter's deliberate ribbon-trail and the sprout's finger-pointing accusation avoid generic reconciliation beats. The ending resists tidy closure—she's still gone, the doll is a promise—while delivering emotional particularity. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact details (quartz, ribbon, seed, apple). One small hedge: the "accidental wisdom" framing in the final lines ("for the first time in years, it wasn't out of duty") slightly summarizes rather than trusting image alone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: mender introduced immediately, kneeling at the cathedral. Development: digs for the root, finds the box, reads the note, decides to plant the seed. Closure: whispers the question, eats the apple, binds the ribbon, leaves the doll. Three distinct beats driven by the mender's choices (dig, plant, ask, bite, bind). The mender's agency shapes all key turns. Causal pressure is clear. Visible cost: pride yielded, daughter's absence persists. Minor cap consideration for passivity in the middle (orchard "hums" rather than mender acting), but final beats are decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Setup: ribbon tied to branch, "frayed at the edges, the color of bruised twilight," introduced early. Development: flashback reveals the mender gave it to the daughter; it's a deliberate taunt/plea. Closure: mender unties it and binds it around their own wrist, "the frayed edges biting just enough to remind them." Three beats, each reweighting meaning. The ribbon constrains the final choice (acknowledgment of failure) and charges the ending image. Cost is visible: the mender accepts the reminder of their blindness. Irreplaceable specificity (bruised twilight, frayed edges). Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "vows were like leaves...They fall when they're ready" introduced in the daughter's dialogue. Development: mender recalls whispering "Vows are deciduous" to the daughter. Closure: "The contract was dust. / The vow was not. / Some things fell away so others could take root." The concept shapes the dominant stake (understanding why the daughter left the binding vow) and the mender's final realization. Cost: the mender must let go of the contract's rigidity while honoring the relational vow. Two beats plus closure. Causal pressure is moderate; the concept operates more thematically than tactically, but it does narrow the mender's options (acknowledge fallibility).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "her chin jutting out in that endearingly feisty way that made the mender's chest ache." Development: the trait is mentioned in flashback but doesn't constrain a middle choice. Closure: implied in the sprout's "finger pointing" and the ribbon's defiant placement, but the daughter is absent. The trait colors the mender's memory and explains the daughter's departure, but it doesn't enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Present in two beats (flashback, implicit in ending), but swappable with "stubborn" or "defiant" without structural loss. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "Persist, the orchard seemed to hum" signals the action early. Development: "The mender dug...They remembered...They stood...They knelt again...The mender persisted." The action drives multiple beats (digging, planting, questioning, apple-bite). Closure: "The mender persisted. / And for the first time in years, it wasn't out of duty." The action redefines the mender's stance (from duty to choice) and is causally linked to the ending's reconfiguration. Cost: persistence now carries personal vulnerability rather than rote obligation. Three or more beats. Indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: "the mender's satchel—long forgotten in the rush of the breach—yawned open beside them, spilling its guts: a rusted trowel, a pouch of crushed quartz...and the half-finished doll." Development: trowel used to dig and strike the box. Closure: doll left beneath the tree, "its empty hands cradling the sprout like a promise." Two beats (trowel enables discovery, doll charges ending). The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter (forgotten contents become active tools). Minor cap: the quartz pouch is mentioned but not used, reducing specificity. Still, the doll's return with reweighted meaning (promise vs. abandonment) ties the method to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: "cathedral's ribs still arched overhead...apple boughs sagged with fruit...their roots tangled through the cracked marble." Development: mender digs in the loam, finds the box buried among roots, walks to "where the afternoon sun slanted through the broken rose window." Closure: plants the seed where light bends, sprout breaks earth, apple is eaten (contract-breaking fruit). The orchard-cathedral fusion constrains every choice (dig here, plant there, eat the forbidden apple). Micro-setting (rose window, tangled roots, branch-height) alters tactics and charges the final image. Indispensable; the setting is the story's armature.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "It had been three years since the contract broke" anchors the timeframe early. Development: the breach creates the situation (daughter left, mender free to act). Closure: "for the first time in years, it wasn't out of duty" references the elapsed time. The timeframe shapes the mender's emotional state (three years of estrangement) and the stakes (long silence now broken). One clear beat (post-breach freedom enables the dig and question). Cost: three years of missed connection. The timeframe doesn't tighten pressure beat-by-beat (no live clock), but it does reweight the ending (persistence redefined after years). Two gates (setup, closure). Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: mender recalls teaching the daughter ("the wisdom they'd tried to drill into her"). Development: mender digs for the root to understand what the daughter saw, finds the note ("Then ask me again why I left"), whispers the question ("What did you see that I couldn't?"). Closure: orchard's reply ("You taught me to read the cracks. Why didn't you read mine?") and the mender's acknowledgment (ribbon bound to wrist). The motivation drives the dig, the question, and the final reconfiguration. Friction: want (bridge the rift) vs. cost (admit failure). Three beats. Visible cost: pride yielded, daughter's absence persists. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: tone is lyric-tactile and contemplative from the first line ("quartz-eye mender knelt in the loam...their fingers brushing the damp earth as if it were a pulse"). Development: tone modulates through memory (ache, pride), discovery (trembling fingers), and questioning (whispered). Closure: "The mender laughed, sharp and sudden" at the sprout's accusation, then the quiet apple-bite and ribbon-bind. The tone charges the final image (accidental wisdom arrives not through epiphany but through the daughter's planted seed and the orchard's reply). Coherent across turns. Minor slip: the final summary lines ("for the first time in years...") slightly over-explain rather than trusting the image. Still, tone is consistent and supports the accumulative design.</comment>
