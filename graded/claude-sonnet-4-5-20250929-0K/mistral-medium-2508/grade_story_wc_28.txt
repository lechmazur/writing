<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and purposeful—the Mender identity, grief as weapon, surgical precision in hands—but the commander's sudden pivot feels under-motivated; we see his sword waver and fall, then kneeling, without sufficient prior cues to earn that shift. The final image of shared sorrow works emotionally, yet the commander's arc compresses a likely complex history into a single beat without visible internal contradiction beforehand. Embodied emotion is strong in Elias (calloused fingers, thumb pressure, breath fogging), and the renunciation of vengeance for "holding" is credible, but the secondary character's transformation arrives too neatly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through the ritual of naming tesserae, each stone a beat that deepens Elias's act of resistance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the commander joins, the stones glow, cracks fill with gold—the plaza becomes unforgettable, reweighting the fire's erasure with a communal act of memory. Cost is conceptual and social: defiance risked death, and the commander's participation forecloses his prior role. One meaningful deepening (the commander's arrival and capitulation) tightens the stakes. Orientation anchors early (plaza, post-fire, Elias kneeling, mosaic). The lens holds; the ending image recharges prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The plaza and tesserae constrain Elias's method and charge the closure: he must work stone by stone, and the mosaic's glow is the story's final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (charred cedar, burnt parchment voice, scuffed boots with blood flecks, cobalt blue sliver). The shattered sky and skeletal minaret frame the wound/jewel opening and recur to anchor tone. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, commander's shadow falling, blade clatter, both kneeling). The mosaic as "map" of the fire's path is a micro-setting that drives plot and theme.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve memory against erasure, signaled early ("the stones remembered"). The confrontation with the commander is the story's one meaningful tightening, raising the cost of Elias's defiance from abstract threat to immediate death. His choice to continue ("Go ahead") and his declaration of what mercy *carries* force the commander's reversal. The resolution hinges on Elias's stance crystallization, and the commander's joining alters the plaza's state with visible cost (sword dropped, role abandoned). One additional reversal—the stones beginning to glow—follows from cumulative naming rather than protagonist agency, which slightly softens the escalation's sharpness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: naming the dead into stones, mercy as what you carry vs. what you burn, grief as weapon. The commander's "my son's name" line and the cracks filling with gold form a non-literal answer to the story's question—can memory resist erasure?—without stating a moral. The tesserae function thematically (fracture, repair, witness) and constrain Elias's method. Subtext operates in gesture (sword clatter, kneeling, hands "so like Elias's") and the fire as both literal event and metaphor for systemic violence. The final image (cracks filled with gold, "unforgettable") reweights prior material without sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elias; psychic distance is controlled and stable. Diction is elevated but consistent ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant," "heretic's compassion"), though some phrases border on purple without quite crossing ("smoke curled like a dying prayer," "voice rising like incense"). Dialogue is sparse and functional; the commander's line "They'll kill you for this" and Elias's reply carry subtext and advance pressure. Filter verbs ("He recognized," "He had learned") are few and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is clear: Elias notices cracks, patterns, and the bodies/names of the dead. Brief compression under peak stress (commander's arrival) does not muddle the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and supports tone; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the naming beats. Two issues lower the score: (1) minor overwriting in the opening third—"shattered sky," "dying prayer," "skeletal minaret," "incense"—cluster figurative language without clear payoff until the ending; (2) a few paraphrase loops, e.g., "The mosaic was a map... He had learned" immediately followed by "His fingers found the pattern" restates the same knowledge. The final paragraph ("The work was only beginning") edges toward summary rather than image. No major artifacts touch closure, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (density in opening, minor loop) warrant −0.8, bringing a baseline ~8.0 down to 7.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—naming the dead into mosaic stones as resistance—offers a fresh angle on post-atrocity memory work. The kintsugi-like image of cracks filling with gold is a strong synthesis of ritual, craft, and defiance. The commander's pivot is the story's boldest risk, elevating stakes by converting the antagonist, though it arrives without sufficient prior cues (noted in Q1). The "gentle radical" and "Mender" labels feel slightly templated, and "aberrant mercy" as explicit thematic vocabulary edges toward prompt-echo rather than earned discovery. Transformation test: the emotional arc (survivor memorializing, oppressor joining) could transplant to other settings, but the tesserae and mosaic ritual are specific enough to anchor freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias ("gentle radical") is named early, drives the naming ritual across multiple beats, and his choice to continue under threat precipitates the commander's reversal. His agency shapes the middle (naming Aisha, Farid, Layla) and the ending (defiant declaration, continuation after commander joins). The attribute "gentle radical" is stated but his decisions—risking death to "hold" memory—enact it. He is essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tesserae appear early (second paragraph), are handled in at least four beats (cobalt blue sliver, green/gold spiral, lightning-cracked stone, commander's tessera), and charge the final image (cracks fill with gold, stones glow). Each naming is a distinct use; the object's fragmented state and capacity to "remember" drive both method and theme. Removing the tesserae would collapse the story's logic and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named explicitly ("Elias called it *aberrant*. / Mercy should cradle, not consume") and contrasted with the rulers' "purging." It shapes Elias's motive and his confrontation line ("mercy isn't what you burn. / It's what you *carry*"), which precipitates the commander's turn. The concept appears in the first third, recurs in dialogue, and informs the ending's communal act. However, the exact phrase "aberrant mercy" reads as thematic assertion rather than enacted pressure; the story demonstrates *cradle vs. consume* more than *aberrant* specifically. It is present across beats but could be swapped for "defiant compassion" or "heretical care" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is stated early but functions primarily as narrative color rather than constraint. Elias's memories of children, imam, bread inform his grief but do not visibly foreclose a tactical option or enable a distinct action on the page. The attribute enriches interiority but remains ornamental; removing the label and keeping "haunted by what had been" would leave the plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Rename" is signaled early ("if he renamed the dead"), enacted in three distinct beats (Aisha, Farid, Layla), and the commander's participation ("my son's name") is the story's climactic turn. The act of renaming is the method by which the plaza "remembers *them* instead of the ashes" and drives the ending image (stones glow, cracks fill). Removing "rename" and substituting "honor" or "invoke" would require rewriting the logic of how stones respond.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method—speaking names into chipped mosaic patterns on stepping stones—is taught early ("The mosaic was a map, if you knew how to read the cracks. / He had learned") and used in every naming beat. The cracks guide Elias's sequence (green/gold spiral "the path the fire had taken") and the stones' warming response validates the method. It shapes attempts (finding fracture, speaking truth) and is indispensable to closure (cracks fill with gold). The phrase "via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" is present but slightly generic; "tesserae" is more specific and functionally identical, so swappability lowers the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" is named in the opening line, anchors spatial choreography across beats, and the plaza itself "holds them both" at closure, "cradling their sorrow." The setting's post-fire state (shattered sky, skeletal minaret, mosaic survival) supplies the resource (tesserae) that enables Elias's method and pressures the choice (soldiers patrol, commander arrives). The sky remains "broken" at the end, a persistent environmental detail that charges the final image. Removing the plaza would require a different spatial and thematic anchor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the great fire" is stated early and frames the entire action. The fire's aftermath (ashes, skeletal minaret, scent of charred cedar) pervades the setting and motivates Elias's ritual. However, no live clock tightens decisions within the story's present; the timeframe is static backdrop rather than active pressure. The fire is a past event whose consequences drive motive but do not alter tactics on the page. It is essential context but not a constraint that shapes moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated explicitly ("the slow, defiant act of *holding*" / "Steel lived in his bones now... not for vengeance, but for this"). Elias's motive is dramatized in his choice to continue under threat and his declaration to the commander. The phrase "arms of steel" recurs at closure ("The plaza held them both, cradling their sorrow in arms of steel"). However, "empathy" is less visible than "memory" or "grief" in his on-page choices; the story demonstrates *holding the dead's names* more than *cradling empathy for the living*. Friction exists (defiance vs. death) but the exact phrase feels slightly imported rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is embodied throughout: Elias's "gentle radical" and "heretic's compassion" paired with "steel in his bones," breath fogging in cold while stones warm, the commander's "rough as burnt parchment" voice breaking, the plaza "cradling... sorrow in arms of steel and shattered light." The tone modulates coherently—grief tempered by resolve, threat met with calm defiance—and charges the ending image (stones glow, but sky remains broken). The oxymoron is purposeful and sustained without becoming static.</comment>
