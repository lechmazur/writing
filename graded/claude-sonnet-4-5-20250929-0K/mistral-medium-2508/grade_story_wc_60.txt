<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's skepticism and defiance anchor her choices (refusing to believe in patience, then pushing the door). Internal texture is present ("sharp-edged" memories, the "luminous skeptic" framing) but some moments lean toward metaphoric assertion rather than embodied contradiction. The younger-voice confrontation ("They're not yours to take") offers internal friction but arrives late and resolves quickly without sustained cost on the page. Micro-choices (following breadcrumbs, pressing the box, pulling threads) are visible but the final departure lacks a foregrounded trade-off that charges the ending image with felt interpersonal or knowledge cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a closure via Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise—fountains weep light, the city breathes, Liora departs). Orientation anchors who/where by ~80 words (Liora, city of forgotten fountains, rust pump). The box-to-door alignment and thread-pulling sequence tighten pressure through one meaningful reversal (hesitation, younger voice, then pull). Cost is present but oblique: memories torn free, voices unmuzzled, Liora leaving imply consequence yet the exact forfeiture to Liora herself (what she loses by liberating them) remains atmospheric rather than concretely legible in the final lines. The lens holds, closure lands on the page, but conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The city of forgotten fountains supplies vivid, purposeful detail: rust pump, green coins, calcified wishes, Bone Fountain, tarnished brass door. Spatial choreography is clean (alleys → fountain → door → chamber → outside). The stained glass box as micro-setting object constrains the action (box-to-door alignment solves the puzzle, threads cling to her fingers). The final image (fountains weeping light) charges the closure and reweights the opening rust-pump descriptor. Sensory selection is strong (damp wool, burnt sugar, lavender scent) and filtered through urgency, though the vault's "suspended light" and "threads of color" lean slightly generic in the climactic chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: liberating trapped memories, signaled early and tested at the door and in the chamber. One meaningful tightening occurs when the younger-voice hiss creates friction and Liora hesitates before pulling. Agency is decision (pressing box, pulling threads, leaving) but the younger voice's challenge resolves without sustained negotiation or visible trade-off that narrows future options. The chamber trembling and voices unmuzzling imply consequence, yet the departure ("didn't wait to see what happened next") sidesteps on-page aftermath cost. Escalation is present but the peak choice lacks a hard either/or that forecloses a path with legible price to Liora herself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of entrapment, liberation, and the cost of "unsticking" emerges through concrete images: insects in amber, wishes calcified, threads sticky as honey. "Liberating memories isn't kindness" and "some locks needed breaking" are close to direct statement but remain anchored in action. The box's hum and the threads fighting back embody moral friction. The final image—fountains weeping light, city breathing—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No overt thematic echo in the ending paragraph. Subtext operates in the younger-voice confrontation and Liora's departure, though "realistically imaginative" as her mother's phrase feels slightly expository.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance and focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is present: "sharp-edged things, the kind that cut," "luminous skeptic," bread-crumbs as patterns. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with some elevated register ("sidereal patience," "vault of suspended light") that fits the lyric-fabulist mode. Psychic distance tightens during the chamber beat (threads "sticky as honey," younger voice hissing). No head-hopping. The stranger's voice and Liora's younger self create brief dialogue; the stranger's whisper is distinct, the younger voice accusatory. Minor filter-verb presence ("realized," "knew") does not dull immediacy. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short sentences during the pull). No template cadence or voice convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythm accelerate cleanly through the door/chamber sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance image, choice, or atmosphere. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language ("V-formations dissolving like a breath," "memories sharp-edged things," "threads like spider silk") is vivid and coherent, though "sticky as honey" and "stretching like taffy" both use food similes within two lines. Opening line ("geese had left the sky empty") and closing frame (geese returning, city breathes) create purposeful resonance. Grammar, tense, and pronoun reference are clean. No scaffolding or template stems. Prose propulsion is strong with no momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—forgotten fountains, trapped memories in a glass box, following breadcrumbs to unlock a sealed door—synthesizes familiar quest and liberation tropes with specific anchors (rust pump, calcified wishes, brass door fused to stone, threads of color). The "luminous skeptic" frame and the younger-voice confrontation offer fresh angles. The ending choice (Liora leaves as fountains weep light) avoids tidy resolution. Some elements (damp wool/burnt sugar stranger, sidereal patience phrase, realistically imaginative label) feel prompt-derived and slightly ornamental. The transformation is present but not fully inevitable; swapping "stained glass box" for another key-like object would require minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora (luminous skeptic) is present throughout and her choices drive key beats: following breadcrumbs, pressing the box to the door, pulling threads despite the younger voice's objection, leaving before aftermath. Skepticism is shown in "didn't believe in patience" and "some locks needed breaking." Setup early, two distinct beats (door, chamber), and closure linkage (departure). However, "luminous skeptic" functions more as descriptive frame than a trait that constrains a choice with visible cost; her skepticism does not create a on-page trade-off or friction that alters tactics. Specific cost tied to the skepticism itself is not legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stained glass box is handled in three beats: received from stranger (setup ~10%), pressed to door (alignment solves puzzle), held warm/dark after pulling threads (closure). The box hums, pulses, bleeds light through skin—evolving states alter Liora's perception and enable the unlocking. Removing it would break door-opening logic. Specific cost: the box goes "dark and quiet" after use, implying depletion or closure of its function. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor swappability concern: another key-like object could serve with edits, though the "fractured light casting jagged shadows" and alignment motif are purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sidereal patience" is named by the stranger early, then reprised in Liora's realization: "sidereal patience…wasn't waiting. It was knowing when to push." This frames the door-opening choice but does not constrain prior tactics or create a visible trade-off. The concept is thematic rather than mechanical; Liora does not employ star-time or celestial observation as a method. Lyric reprise reweights the phrase at a key beat, lifting it above ornamental, but it remains label-level rather than shaping on-page options or costs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginative" is attributed to Liora via her mother's past label ("back when Liora still believed in unlocking things instead of breaking them"). The phrase appears once, mid-story, as backstory reflection. It does not constrain an on-page action or create a visible cost. The trait may implicitly inform Liora's willingness to press the box and pull threads, but no specific beat turns on this attribute versus general determination. Label-only use without dramatized tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unstick" is seeded by the stranger ("Only sidereal patience can unstick what's been sealed"), echoed in Liora's internal narration ("some things, once unstuck, couldn't be contained"), and enacted when she pulls the threads free, causing the chamber to tremble and memories to unravel. The action drives the climax and changes the city's state (fountains weep light). Removing "unstick" would require rephrasing but the core action (opening, liberating, releasing) is mechanically similar. The specificity of "unstick" versus "unlock" or "free" is moderate; it carries slight stickiness/resistance texture but is not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Following breadcrumbs" is signaled early ("alleys curled like old questions…breadcrumbs—not the kind for birds") and detailed (glass shards, chalk arrow, lavender scent). The method shapes the middle beat: Liora tracks these cues to reach the Bone Fountain. Removing this mechanic would break the spatial progression. However, the breadcrumbs do not create friction or cost; they guide without complication. Two beats (noticing, following to destination) and setup present. No closure participation beyond having led her to the site.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>City of forgotten fountains is established early (rust pump, green coins, dry basins, calcified wishes at Bone Fountain) and provides spatial anchors for all beats. The tarnished brass door fused to stone constrains the approach (box needed). The final image—fountains weeping light—reconfigures the opening rust/dryness motif and charges closure. The city's environment pressures choice (door sealed, chamber vault) and supplies the thematic axis (forgotten/liberating). Removing the specific fountains setting would break the arc's symbolic and causal logic. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"From the pause of migrating geese" frames the opening ("geese had left the sky empty") and closing ("geese would return eventually"), creating a seasonal or migratory window. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or constrain tactics on the page; no urgency is tied to the geese's absence or return. Liora's actions proceed without a live clock. The framing is lyric and atmospheric but ornamental to choice and cost. Setup and closure reprise present, but no middle development or pressure effect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To liberate trapped memories" is signaled early (stranger: memories trapped like insects in amber) and drives Liora's choice to press the box and pull threads. Internal friction appears: "'Liberating memories isn't kindness,' she muttered, but her hands didn't waver" and the younger voice: "They're not yours to take." Desire is dramatized through hesitation and action. The final departure implies consequence (voices unmuzzled, Liora not staying to see aftermath). Cost is present but oblique; the exact price to Liora (what she sacrifices or risks by liberating them) is atmospheric rather than concretely foregrounded. Three beats, closure linkage, visible tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Defiant hush" is coherent: quiet determination (Liora mutters, exhales "slow and deliberate," doesn't wait), restrained diction ("groaned," "sigh of stale air," "hissed"), and subdued action (pressing, pulling, stepping back). Tone modulates with pressure: the chamber beat tightens rhythm and diction, then eases into the lyric closing. The final image (fountains weeping light, city breathing) maintains the hush while charging it with scale. No loudness or overt declaration. The tone supports closure and is consistent through turns, though "defiant hush" as a phrase is not explicitly dramatized in a single beat—its effect is cumulative.</comment>
