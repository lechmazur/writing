<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation is clear—defying a corrupt ritual through verse—and her past mischief establishes character continuity. Internal contradiction appears when she whispers her accusation while bleeding to carve it, showing simultaneous fear and determination. However, the final choice feels unmotivated: she "didn't watch the spire shatter" and descends with "heart lighter," but no on-page moment dramatizes her weighing the cost of potentially killing the elders or the canyon's transformation. The resolution asserts emotional change without earning it through a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (bone towers, mist, echoes) and Liora's counter-ritual that releases buried confessions. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the spire shatters, the canyon "would remember now," and she begins to carve openly, reweighting the premise of absolution with visible communal cost (elders' screams, mist swallowing them). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One weakness: the phrase "refract through the ritual's light" in backstory is vague, and the mechanics of how her carved words trigger the cascade remain slightly abstract, but the final image reconfigures the social order with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bone towers, mist, and echo-canyon create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere filtered through Liora's defiant POV. The "pale spire" and "jagged rib" constrain her climb and shape her tactical choice to reach "the fissure in the third tower, where the bone was thin enough to carve." Sensory detail—chalked fingers, cold bone, vibration of chant—grounds action. The canyon functions as both setting and antagonist: its echoes amplify her words to shatter the spire, charging the final image when she carves into "the spire's remains, where the light would refract it forever."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: expose the elders' false absolution before the ritual completes. Pressure escalates when the chant begins, Liora climbs against the clock, and her whispered accusation falters the ritual—each move narrows options. The spire's shattering and the elders' screams provide visible consequence. One gap: Liora's agency in the climax is assertion-heavy ("She didn't watch... she knew") rather than a dramatized decision with visible cost. The "forged hush" and her resumption of carving suggest Earned Stasis, but the emotional or tactical price of potentially causing deaths is told, not shown in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the price of forgiveness and who bears it—emerges through concrete images: the spire that "scatters" sin so "no one bears the weight," the elders' buried confessions returning as "cacophony." Liora's question "who decides which face it shows?" threads from her mischievous poems to the climactic carving. The final image—carving truth into the spire's remains "where the light would refract it forever"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: collective memory replaces individual absolution. One thematic echo: "the price of forgiveness was never the sinner's to pay" is close to an authorial statement, but it lands as Liora's realization rooted in years of listening, avoiding a lecture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains tight focus on Liora's perceptions: "her ears tuned to the fractures in their voices," "breath came quick, her pulse a counterpoint." Diction fits her defiant, poetic stance—"lie," "arrows," "bone-dust"—and elevated register at peaks ("opalescent," "penitent") reads voice-motivated for a character who "slips poems into prayer bowls." One slip: "The canyon breathed before dawn" and "humming with the weight of unspoken names" in the opening feel slightly detached from Liora's grounded anger elsewhere, a minor POV waver. No dialogue present to assess. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climb and carving.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is dense: "jagged rib," "slick with the condensation of a thousand held breaths," "bleeding fingers." Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, several figurative phrases cluster without clear propulsion: "needle drawing thread from the sky," "salt in the endless echoes," "arrows" for echoes feel ornamental. Template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "She knew... She didn't watch... she descended... she picked up... she would carve..." (five consecutive "she [verb]" stems). This stack triggers −0.5 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally. Minor paraphrase loop: "bone-dust settling" echoes "dust of old carvings" and "chalked with dust" without added meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—defiant poet versus a corrupt absolution ritual—combines familiar rebellion-against-authority with a fresh angle: the spire as refractor that "splits the weight of guilt into shards" rather than erasing it. The bone-canyon setting and the method (carving counterpoems that the echoes amplify) feel specific and non-generic. One derivative element: the young artist who "had been innocently mischievous once" and now confronts elders is a stock bildungsroman beat. The ending's bold choice—openly carving into the spire's remains—follows logically from Liora's established defiance, but the transformation from secret poet to public witness feels compressed, reducing the synthesis to mid-band freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora (defiant artist) is present throughout and her choices—climbing to the fissure, whispering the accusation, carving faster despite bleeding fingers, descending to write openly—drive all major turns. Setup: immediate. Development: her climb and carving narrow options and trigger the spire's collapse. Payoff: she resumes carving "where the light would refract it forever," committing to public defiance. Specificity: her past mischief (slipping poems into bowls) and her years of listening establish irreplaceability. Cost: bleeding hands, potential guilt over the elders' deaths (though not dramatized), and the shift from hidden to exposed artist. Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in paragraph four ("Needle of Absolution"), reappears when it begins to glow during the ritual, pulses unstable during Liora's accusation, shatters off-page, and its remains become the surface for her final carving. Setup: early signal. Development: the spire's glow and instability heighten pressure. Payoff: carving into "the spire's remains" transforms it from symbol of false mercy to permanent record of truth. The spire enables two beats (ritual glow, shattering) and charges the ending. Specificity: its refracting property is irreplaceable to the core concept. Cost: its destruction forecloses the elders' ritual path.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The price of forgiveness shapes Liora's tactics (exposing the ritual's cost-displacement), her whispered accusation ("mercy doesn't ask for payment"), and the climax (buried confessions "twisting back" upon the elders). Setup: Liora's past beating for questioning forgiveness anchors the concept early. Development: her realization that "the spire doesn't take your sin. It scatters it" constrains her method—she must make the cost visible. Payoff: the final line promises to carve "the cost of truth" into the remains, crystallizing the concept. The concept is dramatized through action (carving, spire shattering) rather than merely echoed as theme. Irreplaceable and causal across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Innocently mischievous is signaled early ("slipping poems into the prayer bowls") and explains her past tactics. Setup: clear. Development: the trait constrains her method—she uses verse and implication rather than direct confrontation, climbing "where the elders wouldn't look." However, the trait does not create visible on-page cost or friction; her mischief has matured into open defiance without dramatizing the shift. Payoff: her return to carving openly suggests the trait has transformed, but the cost of abandoning stealth for exposure is asserted ("she wouldn't hide it") rather than tested. Functional across two gates (setup, partial development) but lacks a third beat where the trait's limit or price shapes a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Refract appears in Liora's backstory poem ("words refract through the ritual's light"), her realization ("the spire... refracted—split the weight of guilt"), her whispered accusation ("the canyon refract it into a hundred overlapping voices"), and the final image ("where the light would refract it forever"). Setup: seeded in paragraph six. Development: the refracting property constrains her tactic—she must reach the echo-fissure to amplify her words, and the spire's refraction becomes the mechanism of collapse. Payoff: the verb recurs in the ending, reweighting the spire's function from scattering guilt to broadcasting truth. Major turns (chant faltering, spire shattering) trace directly to this action. Specificity: the canyon's acoustics and the spire's optics are irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage across three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Impromptu poetry sessions: Liora's past mischief involved "slipping poems into the prayer bowls" and her current act is carving verse, but the phrase "impromptu poetry sessions" does not appear and the method reads as solitary carving rather than collaborative sessions. Setup: the poetry method is signaled early. Development: carving and whispering verse shape her climb and trigger the climax. Payoff: she resumes writing/carving openly. However, the "sessions" plural and social implication are absent—Liora works alone throughout. The element is partly swappable with "defiant inscription" or "counter-verse." Functional for verse as method, but the collaborative "sessions" framing is missing, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bone towers and echo-canyon pressure every choice: Liora must climb "the lattice of bones," select "the fissure in the third tower, where the bone was thin enough to carve," and use the canyon's echoes to amplify her words into "a hundred overlapping voices." Setup: immediate. Development: the towers' spatial layout and the bone's thinness constrain her tactics; the canyon's acoustics enable the spire's collapse. Payoff: she carves into "the spire's remains" in the final line, and the canyon "would remember now"—the setting becomes a permanent witness. The towers are grown from "sins of the contrite," making the setting causally tied to the ritual's logic. Irreplaceable across all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the ritual" anchors expectation and creates urgency: "Now, before the ritual, the canyon held its breath." The ritual's start ("first notes... rose") triggers Liora's climb, and its progress (chant swelling, spire glowing) tightens the window. Setup: clear by paragraph seven. Development: the live ritual clock forces her to climb and carve quickly; "one chance" signals the constraint. Payoff: the ritual is disrupted on-page and the aftermath ("forged hush") shows time has passed. However, exact elapsed time is vague—no sense of minutes or beats that would sharpen urgency further. The timeframe shapes two beats (start, disruption) and alters tactics, but tracking is loose. Functional, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's desire to refract a single truth into many is dramatized: she whispers one accusation that the canyon "refract[s] into a hundred overlapping voices," releasing buried confessions. Setup: her past question ("who decides which face it shows?") and her realization that the spire "split the weight of guilt into shards" establish the motivation early. Development: reaching the echo-fissure is goal-directed action to achieve this refraction. Payoff: the ending promises to carve truth "where the light would refract it forever," crystallizing the desire. Friction: bleeding fingers and the risk of exposure create on-page cost. The motivation is specific and irreplaceable, driving two beats and the closure image. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Forged hush: the phrase appears once ("the forged hush" after the spire shatters), but the tone of oppressive silence threaded with defiance permeates the piece—"canyon held its breath," "mist swallowed the echoes whole," "whisper of verses that refused to die." The tone modulates appropriately: contemplative during Liora's climb, urgent during the ritual, and resolute in the ending. Setup: established in the opening paragraphs. Development: the tone charges the ritual's oppressive atmosphere and Liora's quiet resistance. Payoff: "forged hush" names the aftermath and her resumption of carving maintains the tone. However, "forged" (suggesting artificiality or construction) is used only in that single phrase and not woven through earlier beats, reducing specificity. The tone is coherent and supports pressure, but the exact phrase's integration is late and narrow.</comment>
