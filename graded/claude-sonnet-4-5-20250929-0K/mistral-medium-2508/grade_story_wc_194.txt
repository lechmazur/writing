<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's internal state is reasonably embodied through his interaction with physical objects (the crank handle, mirror), and his shift from "eloquently silent in his failure" to bridge-crosser shows an arc. However, the transformation relies heavily on metaphysical revelation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; his grandfather's voice and the mirror's instruction feel externally granted rather than earned through internal wrestling. The final choice to write "for the next eloquently silent soul" forecasts future rather than costing present options on the page, weakening the felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through recurring motifs (standing waves, the crank handle, golden light) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias recognizes the room itself as ledger, shifting from seeker to bridge-crosser. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land early. Cost is legible in the foreclosure of his "dynasty ender" identity, though the final image of writing "for the next" pushes some consequence forward rather than fully paying it on the page, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sepia reading room constrains Elias's search (hidden ledger in foundation, precise twilight angle, floorboard vibration) and charges the closure: "every shelf, every groove in the floorboards, every golden shadow cast at this precise angle" becomes the record itself. The gramophone and mirror function as micro-setting anchors that recur with reweighted meaning. Sensory detail (the cold handle, pressure through shoe soles, blackened mirror silvering) is filtered through Elias's focalized perception and integral to his discovery, meeting the 9+ test for constraint and closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth to end his failure—is signaled early and tightens when the letters arrive, then deepens when the mirror reflection corrects his approach. The reversal (striking the wrong note → tuning the wave) narrows options and the resolution depends on Elias's shift from seeking to listening. However, the escalation is more conceptual than visceral; the standing-wave mechanism and mirrored guidance feel externally provided rather than hard-won through protagonist agency under pressure, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth found in silence and the space between questions—emerges organically from image and action (the bridge of intuition, standing waves, tuning rather than striking). The final image of writing for "the next eloquently silent soul" and ink drying golden reweights prior material without explicit moralizing, offering a resonant non-literal answer. The recurring motifs (crank handle, standing waves, golden light) charge the closure without becoming checklist symbols, meeting the 9+ quick test for emergent thematic closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; distance and filter use ("as he had every evening," "Of course") fit the reflective register. The prose carries a consistent lyric texture with purposeful figurative density ("golden shadows stretched like lazy fingers," "ink in rain"). However, elevated diction in high-pressure beats ("eloquently silent," "marrow of his skull," "culminated in this") occasionally drifts above the immediate perceptual grounding, and the narratorial certainty in metaphysical moments ("the bridge, it turned out, had been waiting") softens urgency, preventing entry to the 7.5+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and occasionally muddles clarity: "standing waves of thought," "the shape of intuition," and "the room glowed…with the golden hue of a thing long dormant, now awake" layer metaphor without grounding the mechanics concretely. Paraphrase loops appear ("He was no longer the end of anything. He was the first to cross" restates the transformation). Template cadence in reflection passages ("not a thing built, but a resonance," "not to wind a spring, but to tune the wave") and filter-verb stacks in the opening third ("had spent," "had dismissed," "had whispered") dull immediacy, triggering −0.6 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of metaphysical discovery with physical resonance (standing waves, tuning-fork method) and the ledger-as-room reveal offer a non-obvious angle on inheritance and hidden knowledge. However, the core arc—lone scholar deciphers ancestors' coded legacy through mystical insight—follows a recognizable template, and the resolution relies on externally provided guidance (letters, mirrored instruction, grandfather's voice) rather than transformation through lived friction. The "eloquently silent" framing and golden-light motif feel thematically apt but not surprising in hindsight, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias as "dynasty ender" frames the opening and his shift to "the first to cross" closes the arc, participating in setup and closure. His decision to tune the wave (middle beat) alters tactics, and his choice to write for the next inheritor forecasts consequence. However, his transformation is prompted more by external revelations (letters, mirror, grandfather's voice) than by choices that narrow his own live options with visible cost on the page, capping the score near the 5–6 boundary per the causal-pressure guidance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crank handle appears in setup ("resting against the mahogany"), is used twice (striking the floorboard, turning against the mirror), and returns in closure ("set the crank handle back in its place"). Each use advances plot: the strike loosens the floorboard, the turn tunes the wave and triggers the revelation. Its brass grooves and coldness are noted, and the final replacement bookends the arc, meeting the three-gate model and demonstrating beat involvement and closure linkage for a solid 7+ score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "bridge of intuition" is defined early ("not a thing built, but a resonance"), shapes Elias's middle attempt (tuning the wave to align frequencies), and is validated at closure ("the bridge held"). The concept constrains his tactics—listening rather than seeking—and the standing-wave mechanism operationalizes it on the page. However, much of the bridge's work is metaphorical and asserted rather than dramatized through visible friction or cost, placing it in the upper 6s rather than the 7+ band for causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" is introduced as a label in the opening paragraph and recurs in the final instruction ("the next eloquently silent soul"). It characterizes Elias's failure and eventual insight (silence as receptivity), enabling the thematic turn. However, the trait is more thematic tag than on-page constraint; no scene dramatizes a choice where his silence costs him an alternative or forces a visible tradeoff, leaving it functional but not causally weighted, hence mid-5s per the gate and cost-connection guidance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Muse" (reaching for the handle "to muse, as he had every evening") seeds the reflective mode and his ritual relationship with the object. The action of musing leads to his decision to strike the handle (inciting the floorboard discovery) and later to tune it (turning point). However, "muse" as verb blends into general contemplation; swapping it for "reflect" or "consider" would not break causality, indicating mid-range integration. It shapes two beats and primes closure but lacks irreplaceable specificity, landing upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Standing waves are signaled early ("bridge…between standing waves of thought"), demonstrated mid-story (vibration through shoe soles, "quivering in place like a held breath"), and validated at closure ("standing waves hummed softly"). The mechanics matter: Elias must tune the wave's frequency rather than merely strike, altering his approach. However, the physical mechanism remains abstract and metaphorical; the piece does not ground how standing waves constrain his attempts beyond the conceptual, preventing a 7+ score for causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is anchored in setup (golden shadows, spines, gramophone), supplies the hidden ledger/floorboard discovery (middle), and is revealed as the ledger itself at closure ("every shelf, every groove…all of it was the record"). The room's precise twilight angle and spatial features (foundation, floorboards, shelves) constrain Elias's search and charge the final recognition. The setting is indispensable; the story's logic collapses without this exact space, meeting the three-gate and irreplaceability tests for upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"The first yawn of evening" is noted in setup and repeated at closure ("the evening, at last, exhaled"). The timeframe establishes atmosphere and the precise angle of golden shadows that form part of the ledger-as-room revelation. However, the window does not tighten Elias's decisions with live urgency; he could perform the same actions at dawn or midnight without structural change. The reprise reweights meaning lyrically but does not constrain tactics, landing upper 5s per the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to uncover a hidden truth" drives the entire arc: the letters prompt his search, the floorboard and mirror discoveries escalate it, and the room-as-ledger revelation satisfies it. His motivation is dramatized through action (striking, turning the handle) and tested by the need to shift from logic to intuition. The cost—foreclosing his "dynasty ender" identity—is felt at closure. The motivation is essential across all three gates and shapes the final choice, justifying mid-7s for causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" anchor the opening ("golden shadows stretched like lazy fingers"), recur in the room-as-record beat ("every golden shadow cast at this precise angle"), and charge the closure ("ink dried golden in the fading light," "the room glowed…golden"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly from melancholy (failure) to wonder (discovery) without breaking. The golden motif becomes indispensable to the thematic and visual logic of the ending, meeting closure-linkage and specificity tests for upper 6s, shy of 7+ due to modest tonal arc.</comment>
