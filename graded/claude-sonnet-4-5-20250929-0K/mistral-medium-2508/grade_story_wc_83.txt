<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's motivation—hunting unused potential—is clear and embodied through the geode handling and console interaction. Internal contradiction exists (survivor vs. perturbation) but her micro-choices feel more concept-driven than psychologically grounded; the shift from grief to "bleak exhilaration" arrives without visible intermediate cost. The final stance ("She was the perturbation") reads as a label rather than an earned interior reckoning. Embodied detail is present (burnt sugar smell, pulse hammering) but the wedding-to-hunter arc compresses three weeks into declarative summary rather than dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with causal accent (geode→frequency→lattice→thread). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lena sees the unmade past, feels the weight of potential, and steps into hunting mode—options crystallize and pressure is undeniable. Cost is conceptual (she forgoes fixing the past) and felt (the observatory dies, she exhales in darkness), legible in "She wasn't there to fix the past" and the final "hunting." One meaningful tightening occurs when she keys in the frequency and the lattice resolves. The three-week backstory block (~20% of text) anchors in present stimuli (hospital bed→morgue footage→field notes) and primes the console choice, satisfying BRR. No causality breaks; the "awaken" cue and harmonic frequency link prior setup to the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory's spatial anchors (dome, console, emergency lights) and the geode's tactile shifts (cold→warm→cold) are vivid and filtered through Lena's priorities. The circuit-breaker cooldown timeframe and the storm below create atmospheric pressure, though neither materially constrains her console choice—she acts despite the warning. The geode's "fractured planes refracting…into something almost holy" charges the final image and recurs with reweighted meaning (gift→map→awakening tool). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; no occupational depth for "atmospheric research" is needed at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find where potential pools—is signaled early ("pocket of unused time") and tightens when Lena places the geode on the console and keys in the frequency, narrowing options to reach/pull the thread or stop. The reversal occurs when the lattice resolves and one thread glows brighter, presenting the choice. Her agency is clear: she keys the frequency, ignores the warning, and reaches in, forecloses the path of passive survival with the cost that "The observatory's lights died." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens (density increases from hospital→morgue→observatory→console) and the final "She was the perturbation" crystallizes her stance. The cost is visible (observatory shutdown, darkness) and conceptual (she chooses awakening over restoration).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—unused potential and the violence of knowing—emerges from the geode, perturbation theory metaphor, and Lena's shift from survivor to hunter without overt statement. The final image (wedding tent fluttering, drone hesitating, "I do," then dark) offers a resonant answer: she doesn't fix the past but remembers standing on its edge, reweighting survival as awakening. Subtext operates in "potential wasn't something you spent—it was something you hunted" and "warnings were for people who still believed in consequences." The geode's shift from gift to map to tool accumulates meaning across beats. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph; "hunting" lands as image rather than thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with close psychic distance; Lena's perceptual signature (noting the veil's float, calling the geode "a map of something she couldn't name") is consistent and voice-particular. Diction remains controlled ("intangibly tangible," "knife," "bleak exhilaration") without register drift. The scientists' intercom voices provide contrast without head-hopping. One brief elision (three weeks compressed) is paid off when field notes and footage anchor present action. Rhythmic control holds under pressure: short sentences at the climax ("The screen went white. Then—") accelerate momentum. Minor slip: "Subject 7" feels slightly external for close third at that beat, but the immediately following "Lena didn't turn" recovers interior stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, especially at the climax. Two minor loop artifacts: "Lena smiled. For the first time since the strike, she wasn't a survivor. She was the perturbation" recycles structure across three beats without added pressure (−0.3), and "the geode pulsed…warm now, as if the storm outside had seeped into its core" uses filter-adjacent phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy (−0.2). Figurative language ("a knife," "lattice of bright threads") is coherent and sparse. No grammar errors; spatial choreography (dome, console, intercom, darkness) tracks cleanly. The final line "stepped into the dark, hunting" is concrete and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—using perturbation theory to access unmade past—offers a specific angle on survivor trauma and temporal metaphysics. The geode as "pocket of unused time" and the lattice-of-threads visual are fresh inflections. Emotional complexity (grief, exhilaration, refusal to fix) avoids generic templates. The transformation test holds: plot and arc depend on this exact observatory, geode, and perturbation framing. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and conceptual closure, though the "awakening" motif and observatory-as-research-facility lean slightly toward familiar SFF templates. No close echoes of famous lines; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena (drone strike wedding survivor) drives all key turns: she steals the hard drive, finds the coordinates, keys in the frequency, and chooses to reach in despite the warning. Her survival status frames the dominant stake (find unused potential) and her final stance (perturbation, not survivor) articulates the closure. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending; specific cost (forecloses restoration) is tied to her arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The geode appears in beat one (pocket), beat two (pulsing warm), beat three (placed on console, "fractured planes…almost holy"), and implicitly in the ending ("cold again in her hand"). It enables the harmonic-frequency choice, shifts temperature to mirror pressure, and is handled across the arc. Its "pocket of unused time" premise seeds the entire quest and its final coldness signals closure. Specific properties (fractured planes, harmonic resonance) constrain the console action. Very strong integration; falls short of indispensable only because the perturbation-theory mechanism could theoretically function without a physical token (though the story would lose considerable texture and cost).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" shapes Lena's motivation (find where potential pools) and her final realization ("She called it an awakening"). It appears in her father's note ("awaken"), drives the middle choice (key in the frequency to see the unmade lattice), and charges the ending when she "stepped into the dark, hunting." The concept constrains tactics (she must use the observatory equipment while breakers cool) and alters options (awakening vs. fixing). Present in all three gates with causal pressure; the label recurs but the stakes are concretely tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" appears once as a descriptor for the veil's float in the blast wave. It captures a vivid image but does not constrain or enable any on-page action, nor does it return or alter tactics. The phrase is poetic and voice-consistent but remains ornamental; swapping it for another sensory paradox would not change the story's logic or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hunt" frames Lena's arc from beat one ("potential…was something you hunted"), appears in her week-two morgue theft (hunting footage), drives the climax (she hunts "the place where change had been possible"), and lands in the final word ("hunting"). The action redefines her from passive survivor to active seeker, shapes the perturbation-theory choice, and charges the closure image. Swapping "hunt" for "search" would flatten the predatory urgency and thematic cost. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named early ("tracking perturbations"), explained metaphorically ("a knife…you cut until the equation bled"), and mechanically realized when Lena keys in the harmonic frequency and the lattice resolves into threads. It shapes her middle attempt (use the console) and enables the climax (reach for the thread). The method is signaled and its mechanics matter, though the specifics remain abstract; a reader unfamiliar with perturbation theory can follow the logic. Present in setup and climax; causal role in one major beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory provides spatial isolation, the circuit-breaker cooldown imposes a nominal time constraint, and the console/dome/intercom structure the climax. The setting enables the perturbation-tracking equipment and the "splinter in the sky" image charges atmosphere. It shapes the middle choice (Lena must use this specific equipment) and appears in the ending (lights die, darkness). The observatory's "steel ribs groaning" and emergency lights are handled across beats. Falls short of 7.0+ because the cooldown warning does not materially constrain Lena's choice—she acts anyway—and the location could theoretically be another research facility without breaking core logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Circuit breakers cooling is mentioned in the opening and mid-story warning ("don't touch the equipment while the breakers cooled") but the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page. Lena ignores the warning without visible cost until the observatory shuts down after her action, making the cooldown a backdrop rather than a live clock. The three-week post-strike span structures backstory but does not create urgency in the present scene. Time is present but not tracked or pressuring tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena's desire to "find where unused potential pools" is seeded in her father's gift, dramatized in her week-by-week escalation (hospital→morgue→observatory), and drives the climax choice (key in the frequency, reach for the thread). Friction exists between her stated goal (not to fix the past) and the implicit wish (to see the wedding as it could have been). The cost—she forgoes restoration and embraces darkness—is felt in "She wasn't there to fix the past. She was there to remember." Present across all gates with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named once mid-story but tonally present throughout: the opening's cold glass and groaning ribs (bleak), the "sharp as the geode's edges" smile and "violence of knowing" (exhilaration), and the final "exhaled…stepped into the dark, hunting" (both). Tone modulates under pressure—calmer in backstory beats, accelerating at the console—and charges the final image where cost and thrill coexist. Coherent through turns; the ending sustains the promised duality without flattening into a single mood.</comment>
