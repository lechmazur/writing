<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena is established through concrete choices—fixing the radio, diagnosing rheumatism, trading stories—but her interiority remains thin. The "desperate jocularity" is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift toward not feeling lonely lacks causal grounding in prior embodied struggle; it reads as assertion rather than earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative lens with mosaic structure (station arrival, town interactions, Carter discovery, departure). Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lena's final realization that motion itself may be the cure reweights the quest premise. The cost is conceptual—she abandons ownership of the rock and acceptance of perpetual transit—and the image of someone else picking up the rock charges the ending. One structural slip: the virologist-to-forger reveal feels like a convenience pivot rather than earned misdirection.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The station—ivy-choked platforms, kudzu-buried freight car, glass-strewn ticket booth—supplies tactile grounding and constrains Lena's movements (she must navigate debris, unseal the padlock). The moon rock functions as micro-setting, passed hand-to-hand and charging each transaction. Sensory selection is strong (camphor, old paper) and filtered through urgency. The final image of ivy swallowing the nameplate participates in closure, reweighting the station as a site of perpetual erasure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding Carter/the cure—is signaled early and tightens through Lena's tactical choices (fix radio, trade story, follow Mira). The virologist-to-forger reveal narrows options and reframes the quest. The ending delivers conceptual cost: Lena relinquishes the rock and accepts that the cure isn't possession but circulation. One weakness: the ledger-of-names concept arrives late and doesn't face on-page resistance, so the final trade feels more thematic than pressure-tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—reciprocity, transit, the cure as circulation rather than possession—emerges organically from the rock's passage, the station's history of bound travelers, and Lena's final choice to pass it on. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "Maybe it was just the motion" reweights the quest without moralizing. One slip: "The cure...is just a list of names" borders on thematic statement, though Carter's forger identity and the ledger's specificity rescue it from abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "swallowing its own echoes," "slow-motion earthquake," "NEXT STOP: POSSIBLY" carry idiosyncratic texture. POV remains stable; Lena's perceptual filter (logistician's eye for systems, elusive necessity) shapes what she notices. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("You're looking for the doctor" / "I'm looking for someone who understands reciprocity"). One brief register slip: "synthesized a cure for loneliness—not the poetic kind" over-explains in a way that breaks the established voice's compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (moon rock is gift/bribe/mistake in one line). Figurative language is strong ("ivy swallowing its own echoes," "kudzu-buried freight car") without overwriting. Two patterns lower the score: paraphrase loops ("By noon...By dusk" template cadence; "Maybe that was the cure. Maybe it was just the motion" restates without added pressure) and one stock phrase ("desperate jocularity of someone who'd long since accepted") that tells rather than embodying the trait. These artifacts don't obscure closure but dull mid-story momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—aid worker as rumor-catalyst, moon rock as social currency, railway ledger as cure—feels specific and non-obvious. The virologist-to-forger twist subverts expectation in hindsight-earned ways. Risk-taking (mosaic structure, conceptual closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One limitation: the "cure for loneliness" premise echoes workshop templates; transformation through the ledger/transit specificity rescues it but doesn't fully escape the derivative frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena's choices (fix radio, diagnose rheumatism, trade story, leave the rock) drive three beats and shape closure. Her logistician/elusive identity constrains tactics (she makes herself useful, works through rumor chains). The final departure and relinquishment demonstrate agency with cost. Early signal strong; middle and closure participation clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The moon rock appears in five beats: pocket-carried gift, trade-leverage with baker, pressed back by Mira, left on desk, imagined picked up by next person. Its meaning evolves from leverage to key to perpetual catalyst. The rock's coldness and smoothness are handled on the page, and its circulation structure constrains Lena's final choice. Closure linkage strong; cost visible (she releases ownership).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reciprocity shapes stakes (Lena's method: "make herself useful," trade stories for bread) and the ledger reveal (passengers bound by "unspoken contract of transit"). The ending choice—pass the rock rather than hold it—enacts reciprocity on the page. Setup clear, middle functional, closure present. One weakness: the concept is named directly in dialogue ("someone who understands reciprocity"), reducing pressure to thematic echo in that beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is told once ("the desperate jocularity of someone who'd long since accepted") but never embodied in contradictory on-page action or dialogue that shows the cost of forced lightness under pressure. No visible trade-off where humor enables or constrains a choice. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is seeded early (geologist's whisper), enacted through Lena's rumor-work (fixing, trading stories, leaving the rock), and fulfilled at closure when the rumor changes and someone picks up the rock. The action shapes two beats (baker trade, final departure) and participates in closure. One gap: the catalysis is more distributed than a single decisive turn; removal would flatten but not break the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rumor chains are signaled early ("the rock had a way of turning up...through improbable rumor chains"), shape Lena's method (she trades stories, "The rumors did the rest"), and reappear at closure ("By morning, the rumor had already changed"). The mechanism matters: it enables her to reach Mira and Carter, and the final mutation (meteorite/saint's bone/bridge) charges the ending. Three beats; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The station supplies spatial pressure (glass-strewn booth, padlocked freight car, ivy-choked platforms) that Lena navigates and others inhabit (offerings on tracks, stationmaster's desk). The kudzu-buried car constrains the Carter discovery; the desk becomes the handoff site. Ivy swallowing the nameplate charges the final image. Early signal, middle constraint, closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When the story changes" operates meta-textually: the story-within-story (rumor of the rock) changes by morning, and Lena's internal story shifts from seeker to circulator. The timeframe anchors two beats (dawn arrival, dusk meeting, night handoff, morning departure) and tightens the arc. One limitation: time doesn't impose urgent pressure or a ticking clock that alters tactics mid-scene; it marks transitions more than constrains choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation (find the cure for loneliness) drives Lena's quest, is tested through Carter's reveal (the cure is a list, then circulation), and resolves at closure ("for the first time in years, she didn't feel like she was running...Not today"). Friction appears when the cure isn't possession but passing. One weakness: Lena's loneliness is asserted more than dramatized in contradictory on-page choices before the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone—"polite anarchy"—is legible in the hand-painted "NEXT STOP: POSSIBLY," Lena's useful-subversion method, and the freight-car poet-forger. It modulates under pressure (the tone lightens at the departure after the freight-car intensity) and charges the final image (smile, rolling on, not lonely). Coherent through turns; one structural note: the politeness occasionally tips into over-explanation (the loneliness parenthetical) that softens the anarchic edge.</comment>
