<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and her quest to understand why houses feel alive drives her choices. The orris shard placement and spiral arrangement show micro-choices under pressure. However, the character remains somewhat static—her "understanding" at the end feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final realization ("houses that had learned to listen") lacks visible cost or renunciation that would elevate this to high-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Liora, bay dock, spring evening). Pressure accumulates through sensory density and the ritual arrangement, deepening toward the final image of carrying the hush with her. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she leaves the shard, accepting that witnessing rather than possessing is the path. Cost is implied in the renunciation but remains oblique; pointing to "she left the shard where it lay, knowing some things weren't meant to be kept" as the clearest cost marker. One meaningful deepening present; lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dock, bay, and scattered objects (teacup, key, ribbon) constrain Liora's ritual choices and charge the final image. The orris shard's scent and the stilling water create sensory specificity that reflects urgency. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The recurring objects—teacup trembling, key pressed into wood—shape the ending's resonance. Setting detail is filtered through Liora's perception and integrated into action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding alive houses) is signaled early and sustained. The orris shard placement and ritual arrangement constitute one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The final renunciation (leaving the shard) narrows options with felt cost. However, the escalation is gentle—no sharp reversal or high-stakes choice tests commitment. The voice whispering "You're close now" adds a micro turn but doesn't sharply raise pressure. Cost is visible but understated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (the sacred pause, listening as aliveness) emerges from the orris shard ritual and the objects' arrangement rather than direct statement. The final image—"she was carrying it with her"—offers a non-literal answer to why houses feel alive without moralizing. Subtext operates in the trembling teacup and the dock's creak joining the quiet. Minor slip: "Some houses felt alive because they had learned to listen" borders on thesis statement but is integrated enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with Liora's perceptual signature consistent (noticing shifts, sensing beneath surfaces). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "creeping normality," "daydreaming glow," "shard of hush." No head-hopping. Minor stylistic density in some lines ("the scent of orris and wet stone") risks slight overwriting but remains voice-motivated. The voice modulates appropriately from observation to ritual action. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, overwriting clusters appear: "the kind that lived beneath it, the kind that made a house feel like it was breathing" is a paraphrase loop. Figurative language is dense in several high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching payoff ("streetlights' daydreaming glow," "bay's sighing breeze," "breath curling...like a question"). Stock metaphor "like a cup holds light" in the penultimate insight. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues. No causality breaks but momentum sags slightly in mid-section reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—understanding alive houses through displaced objects and a "shard of hush"—offers a lyric, non-obvious angle. The orris root and ritual arrangement feel specific rather than generic. However, the emotional arc (seeking understanding → achieving it through witnessing) follows a familiar contemplative template without sharp transformation. The "alive houses learned to listen" conclusion, while poetic, lacks the bold risk or fresh moral calculus that would elevate originality. Solid but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora notices shifts (streetlights humming, water stilling) and her observation drives the ritual placement. However, the noticing itself doesn't create key tactical turns—the story would function similarly if she were simply a "seeker" rather than specifically a "creeping normality noticer." Present in setup and development but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orris shard appears in Liora's pocket early, is placed among the displaced objects at the bay (beat two), and is left behind at closure (beat three). Its scent ("earth and something older") and the ritual it enables shape the ending's renunciation. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables the ritual but doesn't narrow options sharply. All three gates met; irreplaceability is strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" frames the orris root and shapes the thematic question (silence that lives beneath sound). It appears in the tin label early and recurs as "the hush" in the final realization. However, it functions more as thematic resonance than tactical constraint—it doesn't change Liora's on-page options. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but causal pressure is light. Two gates (setup, payoff).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is gestured at in the line "her hands moved as if they remembered a ritual she didn't" but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The trait is implied rather than demonstrated through action. Ornamental mention without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ritual arrangement ("sanctify the spot") drives the middle beat and sets up the closure renunciation. Liora's hands arrange the objects in a spiral, the teacup catches light, the water stills—these acts shape the ending. However, "sanctify" could be replaced with "arrange ritually" or "honor" without major structural change. Strong development and payoff but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Displaced objects (teacup, key, ribbon) are signaled early, handled in the ritual arrangement, and their trembling/stillness charges the ending. The method shapes Liora's tactics (what to arrange, where) and the final understanding (objects carry weight of what was). All three gates; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The bay dock, weathered wood, tide's scatter, and spring air are anchored early and affect Liora's choices (kneeling at water's edge, pressing the key into damp wood). The setting supplies the displaced objects that enable the ritual. Micro-setting (dock, water's edge) constrains action. Development and payoff gates met; setup is quick but present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Streetlights that "daydream" provide tonal color and appear in setup and ending ("streetlights' hazy glow"). However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or track elapsed time—no live clock. The element is atmospheric rather than tactical. Two gates (setup, payoff) but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Liora's desire to understand why houses feel alive is stated early and drives her to the bay, to handle the orris shard, and to perform the ritual. The ending delivers an answer ("learned to hold silence...learned to listen"). Friction between wanting to own versus witness creates the renunciation cost. All three gates; causal pressure is moderate. Could score higher if the friction were sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is coherent throughout—quiet action (kneeling, arranging) charged with sensory intensity (orris scent, amber glow, trembling teacup). Tone modulates from observation to ritual to renunciation and charges the final image ("steps fell softer," "air tasted different"). Strong tonal control that supports rather than overpowers the ending.</comment>
