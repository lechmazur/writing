<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to find her brother is clear and drives the journey, but the crucial moment of "letting go" arrives through dialogue exposition ("You have to repent") rather than earned through her own contradictory impulses acting in scene. The embodied details (trembling fingers, throat tightening) anchor emotion well in early beats, but the climactic renunciation lacks visible cost—she simply "unfastens" and the grief releases without the struggle that would make the choice credible. The brother's appearance as adult-but-unchanged reads more symbolic than causally motivated within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the ink-tracing ritual and glade as reservoir, but the closure unit suffers from告told transformation rather than shown pressure. The saucer shatters and Liora "let[s] go" through a three-line list ("The satchel's clasp. / The knot in her chest. / The idea...") that declares change without demonstrating the foreclosed path or visible cost required for Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early), and the before/after is legible, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page. The brother's exposition ("Time doesn't leave... It just waits") does thematic work but doesn't create the pressure reversal needed for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The midnight glade "suspended above the clouds" with "spongy moss" and trees that "lean in" provides vivid sensory grounding and actively constrains Liora's movement ("boots sinking... as if the earth itself was reluctant to let her go"). The saucer on the flat stone becomes a functional tool for the ink ritual, and the setting's properties (clouds churning, canopy knitting) respond to the ritual's progress, charging the final image. The micro-setting of the saucer and inkwell at her belt does meaningful work across beats, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting constraining choice or charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering lost time and finding her brother—is signaled early and remains coherent, but the escalation lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows Liora's options under pressure. The glade shifts, the brother appears, and the ink reveals the ledger-map without Liora making a high-cost decision that forecloses alternatives. The brother's directive to "repent... For time" initiates the release rather than Liora's agency driving the turn. One observable cost appears (her fingers pass through him, confirming loss), but it arrives passively rather than through protagonist choice, placing the piece in the functional mid-band for conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme of grief-hoarding and temporal accumulation emerges organically from the ink ritual, saucer-crack imagery, and the brother's explanation. The final image—Liora pocketing the acorn and walking down with stars as "benediction"—offers a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without moralizing. However, the brother's line "For the way she'd hoarded grief like a miser" edges toward direct thematic statement rather than full emergence through particulars, and the "Like a benediction. / Like a beginning" closure risks soft declaration. The recurring motif of unfastening (clasp, knot, idea) charges the ending but the thematic articulation in the penultimate beats slightly undercuts full resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance with a distinct lyrical-archaic register ("bled through the canopy," "silence: the kind that swallows hours whole") that fits the cartomancer's voice. Perceptual signature is strong—Liora notices constellations "only she could read" and interprets the crack as "a jagged sigh." The brother's dialogue ("You found me") uses purposeful compression (mouth doesn't move) to signal his liminal state. Minor strain appears in elevated diction during peak beats ("the slow unraveling of regret") that slightly distances reader from urgency, but the voice remains coherent and the focalization clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well with lyric fragments ("Like a benediction. / Like a beginning.") and the prose carries high information density in most beats. However, two adjacent sentences near climax loop conceptually: "She understood then: the glade was a reservoir. / All the seconds she'd spent staring... had gathered here" restates the same realization without added pressure (−0.2). The three-part unfastening list reads slightly mechanical, and "choking beauty" appears in elevated metaphor ("breath... like a forgotten breath") that occasionally blurs clarity under pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs, and the propulsion remains strong through most beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The combination of cartomancy, cloudbound setting, and temporal reservoir offers fresh synthesis, and the detail of "Onyx-Ink Cartomancer" with bruise-stains particularizes the magic system. The family custom of hand-tracing and the saucer-crack as temporal map show ingenuity. However, the core emotional arc—grieving woman journeys to liminal space, encounters lost loved one, learns to let go—follows a recognizable template without full transformation through lived specificity. The acorn callback and "willingly perplexed" trait add texture, but the brother's exposition about time accumulation delivers the conceptual turn rather than Liora discovering it through action. Solid within-band execution without the risk or inevitability needed for high scores.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora chooses to journey to the glade, performs the ink-tracing ritual, and ultimately decides to "let go" and pocket the acorn, creating two key turns (ritual initiation, release). However, her agency is diluted by the brother's directive ("You have to repent") which tells her what to do rather than her discovering it through independent choice. Present across setup, development, and payoff with some decision weight, but the crucial closure choice lacks full protagonist ownership.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The saucer appears in setup (carried to the glade), is actively used in development (ink-tracing ritual), and shatters at the climax to trigger the transformation. The crack functions as both physical object and metaphor-map, with its properties (jagged line, porcelain surface) mattering to the ritual mechanics. The shatter is causally active in the closure beat, not merely ornamental. Scores solidly for three-gate presence and functional use across beats, though the object serves the magic system more than it constrains Liora's tactical choices under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept of "cloudbound repentance" is thematically present—the glade floats above clouds and Liora must "repent... For time"—but it functions more as atmospheric frame than tactical constraint. The cloudbound setting isolates her spatially but doesn't create a specific choice dilemma (she could conduct this ritual anywhere liminal). Repentance arrives as the brother's spoken directive rather than a stake she navigates through competing options. Present and coherent with tone, but swappable with "liminal reckoning" or similar without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" is labeled directly ("the kind of woman who chased riddles into the dark and called it devotion") but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. Liora's actions (journeying, performing ritual, accepting loss) would read identically if she were determined, desperate, or resigned instead. The trait adds voice texture but remains ornamental to the plot mechanics. Late mention (past the 40% mark) and label-only use cap the score despite thematic consonance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfasten" bookends the story (opening with the satchel clasp, closing with the triadic release) and the final unfastening triggers the transformation moment. The action is specific and its mechanics (clasp → knot → idea) drive the closure image. However, the unfastening is executed through three-line declaration rather than a difficult physical or emotional choice that forecloses alternatives, limiting causal weight. Strong setup and payoff presence with symbolic resonance, but the middle beats don't require unfastening as a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The family custom of hand-tracing on birthday tablecloths is mentioned once in exposition ("The family custom demanded... pressing her palm into the linen") but is immediately abandoned ("But the tablecloth was back in the valley"). It never appears again and is replaced by the ink-tracing ritual on the saucer. Present in setup only, with no development or payoff; the actual ritual mechanics (ink on porcelain crack) could function identically without this custom existing. Decorative backstory that doesn't shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The midnight glade frames the entire story, supplies the moss that holds Liora, and transforms actively during the ritual (trees leaning, canopy knitting, clouds churning). Its properties as a temporal reservoir are essential to the plot logic—lost time accumulates here, enabling the brother's appearance. The setting is irreplaceable: this specific glade above clouds serves the "cloudbound" concept and makes the ritual's success legible. Strong presence across all three gates and causal necessity for the closure to land.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"After the birth" of silence establishes a vague post-event timeframe but no live clock pressures Liora's choices in scene. The twenty-year gap since her brother's vanishing is referenced but doesn't tighten decisions—she has apparently unlimited time in the glade to complete the ritual. Present in setup as context but absent from development and payoff as a constraint. Could be "after the funeral" or "after the anniversary" without altering story mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liora's desire "to find where lost time accumulates" drives her journey to the glade and shapes the ritual's purpose (tracing the crack to reveal the temporal map). The motivation is dramatized through her physical choices (kneeling, spreading the saucer, dipping finger in ink) and creates friction when she discovers the cost ("the way she'd hoarded grief"). However, competing wants are absent—she pursues this goal without conflicting desires or visible trade-offs during the attempt. Solid setup and development with moderate payoff friction, but lacks the "want versus fear" tension that would elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone of "choking beauty" is sustained through lyric compression ("moonlight bled," "breath... like a forgotten breath," "crack a jagged sigh"), embodied constriction ("throat tightened"), and sensory density ("damp earth and something older"). Modulates appropriately—tighter syntax during the ritual's peak, expansive rhythm at the starlit closure. The final image of stars as "gentle... Like a benediction" shifts from choking to release while maintaining the lyrical register, charging the ending. Coherent through pressure turns without static mood or tonal rupture.</comment>
