<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elira's devotion to the orchard is richly embodied through thirty years of mapping, copper-wire work, and her choice to die in the dirt rather than accept the temple's "quiet corner." Internal contradiction appears in her laughter at the diagnosis and her refusal of honor—devotion over defiance—though her final choice feels inevitable rather than torn. Brother Tomas's arc from disapproval to weaving copper by story's end is earned through his curiosity and her lesson. The embodied detail (joints "like brittle hinges," breath "thin, like wind through dead leaves") avoids clinical labels and grounds her physical decline in the work itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates pressure through layered images—copper, wire, diary, sapling—and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise transitioning to Earned Stasis): Elira's death mid-conversation with the sapling crystallizes her devotion, and Tomas's adoption of the copper wire reweights the orchard's future with visible cost (years of work). Orientation anchors (Elira, orchard, terminal illness) arrive early. The western-quadrant sapling sequence tightens options (elders want it uprooted; she binds it anyway), and the ending's "wrapping copper around his wrist" image reconfigures the premise—respect earned by bending—without stating a moral. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The temple orchard's living stone pillars and hollow chambers where roots trade nutrients are vivid and purposeful, grounding the architectural-secrets concept. Copper wire and sapling constrain Elira's final work (she kneels despite cracking joints, guides growth around pillar flaws). The orchard's "whisper" (wood against stone, copper chime) charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean: western quadrant, central pillar, sapling against ribcage curve. Micro-setting (wire, diary, bark) functions as world. Minor: the professional systems (nutrient trade in darkness) are sketched rather than tested under pressure, but the wire's oxidation feeding trees without poisoning them supplies one constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving interspecies respect through remodeling, against temple doctrine. Pressure tightens in the western-quadrant beat when elders demand uprooting for symmetry and Elira binds the sapling anyway, narrowing her options (she has six months; she spends them on heresy). The diary's final line—"We were never meant to outlast the things we love. Only to tend them."—and Tomas picking up the wire articulate cost: the work will take years, and Elira won't see it. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens: her defiance, the sapling's turn toward the pillar, Tomas's conversion. One meaningful tightening (bind the sapling) and one visible cost (her death, his inheritance of years) meet the length requirement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—respect earned by bending, not standing straight—emerges through copper-wrapped oaks, the sapling's embrace of the pillar, and the final diary line without moralizing. The story resists tidy resolution: Elira dies mid-work, and Tomas inherits years of labor, not miracle. Subtext operates in Tomas's crouching skepticism fraying to action, the orchard's "sigh" welcoming his hands. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: devotion persists beyond the devotee. Copper as motif charges the closure (Tomas wraps it around his wrist), transforming from heresy to inheritance. No prompt-echo in the final paragraph; the prose trusts image over thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited, Elira-focused throughout with clean distance; Tomas's brief POV in the final beats is section-separated and legible. Voice texture: "The pillars sighed, welcoming another pair of hands" and "her smile slow and brazen" carry distinct rhythm. Diction stays grounded in the caretaker's idiom—"corrupt their purity," "begging" vs. "asking"—without register drift. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Tomas's "You're teaching them to beg" and Elira's correction advance the theme through action. The penultimate paragraph's shift to Tomas is clean (new subject, new stance) and the ending's "He began to weave" holds focalization without head-hopping. Minor: "tuneless thing" leans generic, and the orchard's "whisper" risks personification without POV anchor, but the effect supports pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies well ("The stone pillars breathed" opens strong; "That was the point" closes with economy). Information density is high: "copper wire spiraled around boughs, notes on how the metal oxidized just enough to feed the trees" does triple work (object, method, world logic). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor figurative density in the opening paragraph—"breath to something thin, like wind through dead leaves," "joints to brittle hinges"—risks overwriting but stays legible and character-specific. The final image ("The pillars sighed, welcoming another pair of hands") charges without clutter. One template stem: "It was just Elira, stubborn to the last, remodeling the world into something kinder" borders on summary-tell but serves the ending's quiet turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Premise—dying botanist binds copper to trees as devotion—feels specific and non-obvious. The combination of terminal illness, architectural botany, and doctrinal conflict avoids template-plot markers. Copper-wire method and nutrient-trade chambers offer fresh detail. Trope transformation: the mentor-dies-passing-torch arc is personalized through the diary, the sapling's response, and Tomas's wrist-wrapping gesture. Risk: the quiet ending (death mid-conversation, no miracle) heightens stakes without gimmickry. Slight thinness: the elder-versus-botanist conflict is signaled but not dramatized beyond Tomas's visit; a second on-page friction point would deepen the heresy stakes. Still, the emotional specificity (laugh at diagnosis, hum to sapling) avoids generic templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Elira's choices drive all key turns: mapping rhythms for thirty years, refusing the quiet corner, binding the western sapling against elder orders, and dying mid-work. Her final diary entry reweights the premise. Introduced immediately, active in setup (refusal), development (copper work), and ending (hand on wire, Tomas inheriting the diary). Causal pressure: her binding enables the sapling's turn and Tomas's conversion. Irreplaceable: "island caretaker" title fits the orchard's isolation and her devotion. Visible cost: she spends her last months in heresy and dies without seeing the sapling mature.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Diary appears in three beats: lap in opening (thirty years of sketches), pressed blossoms mid-story (proof of copper's effect), and final page (line read by Tomas, catalyst for his choice). It constrains no mid-scene choice but charges the ending by passing Elira's knowledge and reweighting Tomas's stance. Early signal, closure participation, and specificity (bark rubbings, ink renderings) elevate. Not fully indispensable—Elira could have spoken the lesson—but the diary as artifact makes the inheritance tactile and the closure image (Tomas picking it up) resonant.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Architectural secrets—hollow pillars, root/fungi chambers, copper guiding growth—shape Elira's tactics (wrap wire to coax the sapling around flaws) and charge the theme (symbiosis over purity). Introduced early ("pillars, hollow in places"), active in the western-quadrant work, and implicit in the ending (Tomas begins to weave within the same system). The concept alters options: without the nutrient-trade knowledge, Elira's wire work would be decorative. Moderate causal role; it enables rather than forces the key turn, landing it in the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" appears in the nutrient-trade description ("so gently systematic it shamed the rigid doctrines") and informs Elira's approach (mapping rhythms for thirty years, humming to the sapling). It does not constrain a single on-page action with visible cost—her wire-wrapping is systematic, but the trait is not tested under friction. Thematic accent without tactical pressure. Present in setup and theme but absent from the closure beat, capping it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Remodel" drives the entire arc: Elira remodels the orchard one last time (stated explicitly), the western sapling's binding is the key remodel action, and Tomas inherits the remodeling project ("He began to weave"). All major turns trace to this action. Introduced early ("remodeling the orchard one last time"), active in the climax (copper around the sapling), and the ending line ("remodeling the world into something kinder") makes it thematic and causal. Irreplaceable: swapping "repair" or "tend" would lose the architectural stakes. Visible cost: years of future work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Copper wire appears in four beats: diary sketches (copper spiraled around boughs, oxidation notes), the blossoms it produced two decades ago, Elira wrapping the sapling's trunk and branch, and Tomas wrapping a length around his wrist. The method enables the sapling's turn toward the pillar and shapes Tomas's conversion. Specificity matters: copper oxidizes to feed without poisoning, a unique mechanic. Early signal, active in development and ending, with causal pressure (guides growth around flaws). Near-indispensable: without copper, the interspecies-respect metaphor loses its material anchor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Temple orchard within living stone pillars supplies all spatial pressure: the western quadrant's ribcage curve around the struggling sapling, the central pillar where Elira dies, and the hollow chambers that enable nutrient trade. Setting constrains Elira's work (she must kneel on stone, wrap wire around pillars' flaws) and charges the ending (pillars sigh, welcoming Tomas's hands). Present in every beat, drives choices, and the micro-setting (wire, sapling, stone) functions as the primary world. Indispensable: remove the living pillars and the architectural-secrets concept collapses.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Six-months timeframe introduced immediately ("Six months, the healers had said") and tightens Elira's decision (spend it remodeling, not withering). The clock is implicit in her physical decline (joints cracking, breath shallow) but not tracked beat-by-beat. Her death "by dawn" marks time passing but does not alter mid-scene tactics. Moderate pressure: the deadline justifies her devotion-over-defiance choice and Tomas's inheritance of "years" contrasts with her months. Present in setup and ending, but the middle beats (binding the sapling) do not show her racing against time, capping it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Interspecies respect is dramatized through Elira's thirty-year practice (copper feeding trees, sapling leaning into wire "like lovers"), her correction of Tomas ("teaching them to ask"), and the diary's final line (tend, not outlast). The motivation faces friction: elders call it heresy, Tomas doubts it will work. Her choice to bind the sapling despite elder orders and limited time tests the desire against cost. Active in setup (refusing the quiet corner to continue the work), development (western-quadrant binding), and ending (Tomas adopts the practice). Near-indispensable: without this motive, her wire-wrapping is mere horticulture.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" coheres through Elira's laugh at the diagnosis, her slow smile to Tomas ("brazen" used on-page), and her sitting against the pillar with shallow-but-steady breath, hand still warm. The tone modulates: opening calm through remembering thirty years, mid-scene brazenness in defying elders, and ending calm in her death and Tomas's inheritance. It charges the final image ("stubborn to the last, remodeling the world into something kinder") by holding serenity through defiance. Not static; not a single mood. Coherent escalation under pressure without breaking into panic or sentimentality, landing it in the high 7s.</comment>
