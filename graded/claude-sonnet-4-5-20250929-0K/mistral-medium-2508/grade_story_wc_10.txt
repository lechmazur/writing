<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and embodied through physical details (bleeding fingers, salt in veins, scars). The core motivation—to translate silence into music—drives on-page choices through the piano sequence. However, the mentor's philosophizing ("Sound is just emotion given shape") veers toward label-speak, and the final decision to "sail back into the storm" lacks visible cost or earned contradiction; the pivot feels asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (conservatory, post-capsize, tuning fork case). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the heat-map mechanics, the piano's awakening, and the storm's yielding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes her resolve to "play" the storm with the wreck waiting—but the cost remains implied rather than visible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the note emerges "warped and wet," reweighting silence as malleable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory constrains choice: frozen air prevents sound, forcing Liora to reverse the heat-map mechanics. The tuning fork case functions as micro-setting, pressuring her hands ("burning against her wrists") and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through grief ("salt in her veins," "frosted panes trapping the absence of vibration"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from glass to piano to open doors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating silence into music to redeem the *Capriccio*—is signaled early and tightens when the first key produces nothing, forcing reversal of the heat-map. The piano sequence escalates through bleeding fingers and the storm's yielding, a meaningful pressure point. However, the final choice to "sail back into the storm" lacks visible trade-off or forfeiture; it feels more declarative than costly, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence and sound as intertwined languages—emerges through concrete action (the piano's shiver, winterglass singing) rather than statement. The mentor's claim "silence isn't empty; it's a language no one had learned to speak" borders on thesis-speak but is partially redeemed by the heat-map mechanics. The ending offers a resonant image ("she would make it speak") that reweights prior material, though "proving they'd been the same thing all along" edges toward over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: grief filters observation ("cathedral of sound," "tomb of winterglass"). However, figurative density becomes effortful in peak beats ("raw, unshaken marvel," "the music of things breaking and reforming"), and the narration occasionally drifts into elevated register ("As-you-know" philosophizing from the mentor). Internal voice remains coherent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and sometimes mixed ("storm had stolen every decibel," "sound into something solid, something that shattered"). Template cadence appears in the closure sequence: multiple "She [verb]" stems without variation. Paraphrase loops surface ("not to escape it, but to play it" closely echoes prior phrasing). Information density is high in the piano sequence, but scaffold sentences ("Of course") and synonym churn ("fury," "silence," "quiet") dull momentum. No clarity breaks at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of shipwreck survivor, emotion-mapping mechanics, and frozen sound offers a fresh angle. However, the heat-map reversal feels under-mechanized—its operation is asserted rather than demonstrated through specific choices. The ending's lyricism ("The storm welcomed her like an old collaborator") leans poetic but risks abstraction; the choice to "play" the storm lacks the grounded particularity that would make it inevitable in hindsight.</comment>
