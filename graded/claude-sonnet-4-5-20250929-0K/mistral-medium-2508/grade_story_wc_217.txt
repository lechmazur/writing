<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The poet's interior world is rendered through embodied detail (fingers tracing sand, water beading on feather) and his consistent aesthetic—collecting fragments, tending incompletion. His micro-choices (retrieving the kite, winding the string, choosing not to write the water's shiver) reveal values under pressure. The final renunciation ("Some things were better left unstitched") feels earned by prior pattern, though the choice to stop writing lacks a visible cost that would elevate it further. Internal contradiction is present but muted; he remains comfortably aligned with his philosophy throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with cadence shift at closure. The piece anchors quickly (poet, lagoon, post-rain) and accumulates pressure through collecting/tending beats (feather, kite, winding string) that deepen the incompletion motif. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the poet's refusal to capture the water's shiver and his final line "coming undone" reweight all prior gathering with acceptance of fraying. The cost is conceptual—ceasing to stitch—and the final smile signals stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening present; the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain functions as active setting: wet salt and crushed reeds anchor sensory presence, the shallows provide the medium for the feather's prism effect, and the water's refusal to reflect perfectly mirrors the poet's thesis. The body (kneeling, wading, fingers brushing sand) and recurring objects (feather, kite, notebook) constrain multiple choices. The heron's return and the fisherman's patched boat supply thematic counterpoint. Spatial choreography is clean (shore to shallows to shore) and the environment charges the final image of the heron stepping through reeds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering/articulating beauty in incompletion, signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through collecting acts (feather, kite, string) and writing attempts, tightening when the poem "felt alive—not because it was finished, but because it wasn't." The poet's choice to retrieve the kite and later refuse to write the shiver are agency beats that narrow options. Cost is present but oblique—he forecloses capture in favor of fraying—which registers as renunciation with felt weight scaled to this length. One clear deepening under the Accumulative lens; no reversals required.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (incompletion as completion) emerges organically from the feather's fray, the patched boat, the unfinished lullaby, and thelagoon's imperfect reflection. The final line "We are all just woven dawns, coming undone" reweights all prior collecting without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the poet's envy of the scarred boat and his smile at mutual incompletion with the heron. The piece resists tidy resolution: fraying is embraced, not solved. No thematic echo or moralizing in the final paragraph; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with stable psychic distance and consistent perceptual signature: the poet notices texture (iridescent, frayed, barbed), sound (the kite's crack, the breeze in the feather shaft), and metaphor-ready images (oil on water, bruise healing). Diction remains lyric-elevated but voice-coherent throughout. No dialogue to assess. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure (shorter beats when the feather trembles, longer when reflecting on the boat). Filter verbs ("he saw," "he thought") are minimal and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; interiority stays particular to this character's aesthetic lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "breath between," "oil on water," "bruise healing," "torn curtain," "half-drowned" words. Two friction points: "weaving dawns" (metaphor vehicle unclear—dawns aren't woven) and mild template cadence in "He was weaving... He pressed... He wrote..." stems. Information density is strong; most lines advance image and philosophy together. Paraphrase check: "imperfect" and "incomplete" recur across paragraphs but with evolving context. No loops or scaffold that obscure causality. Propulsion slows slightly in the middle third with reflective asides (teacup, hinge, lullaby) but recovers at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of incompletion-as-beauty with a shoreline poet collecting fragments offers a clear aesthetic stance. The closing pivot—refusing to write the shiver, embracing fraying—feels earned rather than imposed. Risk is moderate: the piece commits to lyric accumulation over plot reversal, which suits the premise. Freshness derives from specificity (drake's tail barbed at the tip, kite spindle worn smooth, tar-and-hope boat seams) rather than a novel concept. The final line's phrasing ("woven dawns, coming undone") is memorable but borders on abstraction. Transformation test: the emotional arc depends on these particulars and wouldn't survive generic substitution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout; he kneels, retrieves feather and kite, writes couplets, wades in, winds string, and chooses not to record the shiver. These choices shape the arc (collecting → renouncing capture). Setup immediate; middle beats involve tactile engagement; closure depends on his final refusal and smile. Cost is conceptual (foreclosing perfect capture). Not indispensable—another reflective figure could serve—but causal across all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Object introduced early (broken shell grip, barbed tip, frayed edge), used as quill mid-story (ink bleeds, prism effect in water), and laid across notebook at closure as "bridge." Three distinct beats; specificity (iridescence, fray, hollow shaft hum) matters. Drives the poem's creation and final rest. Removing it would collapse the writing act and the bridge image. Not fully indispensable (another found object could substitute) but deeply integrated with strong closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Concept seeded in "weaving dawns" paragraph and paid off in final line "woven dawns, coming undone." Functions as thematic anchor rather than stake-shaper on the page; the poet's actions (collecting, writing, refusing) don't hinge on "weaving" as a method. Lyric reprise reweights prior material with cost (coming undone = acceptance of fraying). Two-gate model (setup + payoff) with resonant closure linkage reaches mid-band; no middle beat involvement caps higher range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Attribute shows in "warm, attentive silence" after the heron startles and implicitly in the poet's patient collecting and noticing. Label-only in the heron beat; more embodied in his decision to retrieve the kite and wind the string (care under no urgency). Constrains pacing but not a pivotal choice with visible cost. Present in setup and middle, weak at closure. Functional but replaceable; attentiveness could be shown through other traits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Action (tend) governs the poet's philosophy and all gathering moves: tending fragments (teacup, hinge, lullaby), the feather, the kite, the incomplete poem. Signaled early ("spent years tending to the incomplete"), drives middle beats (retrieval, winding string), and charges closure when he stops tending (leaves shiver unwritten, allows fraying). Three beats with causal weight and closure link. Removing "tend" would require reframing the entire arc. Strong integration; not fully indispensable (nurture, gather could substitute) but deeply woven.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Method stated once ("coaxed from the edges of ruin, by harmonizing discord") in the reflective paragraph but not dramatized as process. The poet collects and writes, but we don't see him harmonize opposites on the page—fragments simply coexist. No middle beat where discord is actively resolved. Absent from closure except as echo in the philosophy. Setup present, development and payoff missing. Swappable phrasing; mechanics don't shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setting establishes all action: the poet kneels at its edge, dips feather in shallows (prism effect), retrieves kite from water, observes the heron in reeds. Post-rain scent and wet salt anchor atmosphere. The lagoon's imperfect reflection and violet-bruise shallows supply the visual proof of incompletion. Three gates met; cobalt + rain specificity matters. Not indispensable (another shoreline could serve) but integral to mood, tactics, and thematic mirror. Strong closure participation when water "shivers" and heron reflects in cobalt shallows.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Timeframe (kite string snap) occurs mid-story, startles the heron into flight, and provides the kite object. The snap itself is a single event rather than a sustained clock. Does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the poet continues at his own contemplative pace. Setup and middle beat present; closure references the frayed string symbolically (wound on wrist as reminder). Functional cameo with thematic resonance but replaceable with another interruption. Lyric reprise (string = temporary connection) adds value but doesn't reach causal pressure threshold.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation (discover beauty in the incomplete) drives all choices: collecting the frayed feather, envying the patched boat, retrieving the kite, writing about the lagoon's refusal to apologize, and ultimately refusing to capture the shiver. Signaled early ("that was why he reached for it"), tested in middle beats (writing with bleeding ink), and crystallized at closure (smile at mutual incompletion, final line about coming undone). Desire is dramatized through on-page gathering and renunciation with felt cost. Three gates with strong causal and closure weight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone (burnished hush) sustained through diction ("breath between," "slipped through cracks," "warm, attentive silence," "delicately"), cadence (longer sentences, few abrupt stops), and absence of loud conflict. Modulates subtly: the kite snap briefly interrupts, then hush returns. Charges the final image (heron stepping delicately, poet's smile, unstitched edges). Coherent across all beats; distinct from generic calm by the burnished/worn quality (patched boat, frayed feather, worn spindle). Tone and content are inseparable; removing it would flatten the aesthetic. High integration with closure linkage.</comment>
