<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's interior work is heavily reflective and symbolic rather than dramatized under pressure. The couple remains abstract—their conflict is overheard, not enacted through choice or contradiction. Lena's final "clarity" is asserted through repetitive metaphor ("not secrets. Not lies. Just the shape of truth") rather than earned through an on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path. The lens and doodle habits are told as backstory; no internal conflict or visible tradeoff materializes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: lyric density, recurring motifs (lens, tickets, light), and a cadence shift toward "the world was speaking plainly." Orientation is prompt: registrar, lobby, forecourt by line three. Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Lena stops translating, accepts the lens as perfect, leaves tickets for others—but cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than dramatized. The couple's departure and Lena's morning walk feel like asserted resolution without a visible forfeiture or narrowed option. Closure reads more as thematic summation than a reweighted stake with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forecourt and lens are vivid and purposeful: "water trickling through crystal pavers, each step releasing a whisper of light," "lens…warping the lines of her skin." The lens constrains Lena's perception and charges the final image ("its weight familiar now, its imperfections perfect"). Spatial choreography is clear (desk, forecourt, door). The crystal setting brackets the piece (wet at opening, dry by dawn) and reweights the opening image at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for recurring object/environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Lena's desire to free honesty without words, signaled early via her doodle habit. The couple's arrival complicates but does not escalate Lena's internal stake; she observes, draws, slides the ticket—actions presented as smooth rather than pressured. No on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options. The couple's wordless recognition ("Us") is told, not earned by prior friction. Cost is conceptual (Lena's shift from "cryptic" to "clear") but not visibly forfeited or tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—honesty freed through image rather than words—emerges from Lena's doodles, the lens metaphor, and the couple's silent recognition. Subtext operates in the couple's gesture (ticket "passed back and forth like an accusation") and Lena's silence. However, the final third lapses into direct thematic statement: "The work wasn't about answers. It was about the asking"; "Not secrets. Not lies. Just the shape of truth." These echo the prompt concept ("freed by honesty") as label rather than image, triggering −0.5 in Q5 per the Thematic Echo penalty for prompt-like language in the final paragraphs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices light, texture, silence as presence. Diction is consistent and lyric: "the kind of quiet that wasn't empty but full—of echoes, of possibilities." Dialogue is minimal and functional ("You said you'd be there" / "That's—" / "Us"). The couple's voices are under-differentiated but their scant lines serve subtext. Rhythm modulates appropriately (short fragments at the couple's exchange, longer lyric sentences in reflection). No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Elision (Lena's backstory, the couple's unseen departure) is purposeful and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythmic control is strong: varied sentence length, purposeful fragments, vivid imagery ("water trickling through crystal pavers," "the lens caught the forecourt's scattered light, splitting it into fragments"). However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops and thematic restatements: "Not secrets. Not lies." is echoed across multiple beats; "the shape of truth, drawn in ink and trust" restates the premise; "She didn't need to hear it to know. She just needed to listen" is tautological. These loops dull the closure image and trigger baseline −0.6 in Q7 for paraphrase-loop and synonym churn across adjacent lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—night registrar uses doodles to thaw mistrust—is fresh in detail (concert tickets, projector lens, crystal forecourt). The lens as recurring motif and the couple's wordless recognition offer specific texture. However, the emotional arc (Lena moves from mistrust to clarity) follows a familiar shape: isolated helper observes strangers, intervenes obliquely, finds peace. The final paragraphs retreat into safe lyricism ("Of beginnings") and prompt echo ("freed by honesty") rather than a non-obvious synthesis. Transformation test: the arc would survive with different objects and setting, suggesting insufficient irreplaceability at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena observes, draws one doodle, slides a ticket, then reflects extensively. Her single on-page decision (drawing for the couple) is presented as smooth rather than a turn under pressure. She appears in the setup, middle (the doodle act), and ending (walking outside, leaving tickets), meeting all three gates. However, her choice does not narrow options or create visible cost; the couple's recognition and Lena's "clarity" are asserted outcomes. Causal pressure is low. One functional beat (the doodle) + closure presence + early setup, but no felt cost tied to her agency: baseline 5.0 + early signal 0.3 − swappability (another helper role) −0.4 + lyric reprise 0.3 = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lens appears in setup ("cracked projector lens she'd salvaged"), middle ("thumb pressed the lens to her palm, its ambiguously clear glass warping the lines of her skin"), and closure ("She tucked the lens into her pocket, its weight familiar now, its imperfections perfect"). It charges the final image and reweights Lena's perception (broken yet focusing). Specificity is high. However, the lens does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as symbolic recurrence rather than causal pressure. Three beats + closure linkage + specificity, but no cost or choice tied to the object itself: 5.0 + early 0.4 + three beats 1.4 + closure link 0.8 + specificity 0.5 − ornamental use (description, not action) −0.8 = 7.1, round down to 6.8 for swappability (another broken object could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" shapes Lena's desire and the couple's wordless recognition, appearing early (her doodle habit) and at closure ("honesty didn't need words to be free"). However, the concept remains thematic overlay rather than on-page stake that narrows options. Lena's "clarity" and the couple's understanding are told, not tested under pressure. Two gates (setup, closure) + thematic presence, but no mid-scene choice driven by this concept and no visible cost: 3.0 + setup 0.4 + closure link 0.7 + thematic claim (not causal) 0.3 − summary-only use −0.5 = 3.9, raised to 4.7 for coherent reprise across the piece.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is embodied in the lens ("ambiguously clear glass warping the lines of her skin") and Lena's doodles (cryptic, then clear). It appears early, recurs in the lens beats, and charges the final image. However, the trait is descriptor rather than constraint; it does not enable or foreclose an on-page action with cost. It colors perception but does not alter tactics. Two gates (setup, closure) + lyric coherence, but no choice tied to the attribute: 3.0 + early 0.4 + lyric reprise 0.5 − label-only (no tradeoff) −0.3 = 3.6, raised to 3.8 for specificity in the lens metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Eavesdropping is setup early ("Lena didn't mean to eavesdrop, but the forecourt's acoustics carried everything"), enables the middle beat (hearing the couple's conflict → drawing the doodle), and indirectly shapes closure (Lena's role as silent helper). However, the eavesdrop itself is passive receipt rather than pressured choice; Lena could have observed via any means. One functional beat (hearing leads to drawing) + early signal + closure link, but swappable and no cost: 5.0 + early 0.5 + one beat 0.4 + closure 0.7 − swappability (visual observation could replace) −0.5 = 6.1, raised to 6.3 for coherent use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method (cryptic doodles on concert tickets) is seeded early (Lena's past habit), used once on-page (drawing for the couple), and echoed at closure (leaving tickets for others). Mechanics are signaled: doodles convey what words cannot. However, the single on-page use is smooth rather than tested; the couple's recognition is asserted, not earned by prior friction over interpretation. Two gates (setup, closure) + one beat, but no mid-scene constraint or cost: 5.0 + early 0.6 + one beat 0.4 + closure 0.8 − summary (past habit told, present use smooth) −0.5 = 6.3, lowered to 5.9 for lack of pressure on the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is vivid, signaled early, and brackets the piece (wet/shimmering → dry by dawn). Acoustics enable the eavesdrop; crystals supply the "whisper of light" that charges imagery. The setting reweights at closure ("the crystals settling, the night releasing its last breath") and shapes Lena's final walk. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; it functions as atmosphere and lyric anchor. Three gates + strong lyric reprise + closure charge: 5.0 + early 0.6 + closure 1.2 + lyric payoff 0.8 − ornamental (no tactical constraint) −0.4 = 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is thematic rather than time-bound. The couple's silence and Lena's shift from "cryptic" to "clear" gesture at this timeframe, but no clock or deadline tightens decisions. The night-to-dawn bracket is scenic rather than causal. One gate (closure thematic echo) + diffuse presence: 3.0 + closure 0.4 − vague/untracked −0.7 = 2.7, raised to 4.1 for coherent thematic presence across the piece.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lena's desire "to thaw mistrust with transparency" is told early (her doodle habit born from mistrust) and enacted once (drawing for the couple). It drives the single middle beat and is asserted as resolved at closure ("mistrust thawed"). However, the desire is not tested under friction; Lena's transparency is smooth and the couple's reception is instant. Two gates (setup, middle) + one beat, but no visible cost or conflicting pull: 5.0 + early 0.5 + one beat 0.4 + closure 0.7 − told-only (no friction) −0.5 = 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is coherent throughout: silence as presence, whispered light, muffled voices, Lena's listening. Tone modulates subtly (the couple's cracked voice, Lena's smile, the bird's promise) without breaking the sustained quiet. It charges the final image ("the world, in its resonant hush, would keep whispering"). Strong tonal control across all beats and closure: 5.0 + setup 0.6 + three beats 1.4 + closure 1.2 + coherence through turns 0.4 − static (single mood, minimal modulation under pressure) −1.0 = 7.6.</comment>
