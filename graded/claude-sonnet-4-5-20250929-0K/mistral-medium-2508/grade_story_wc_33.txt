<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias demonstrates clear motivation (delivering storm, testing drone gaps) with embodied tension ("chest ached," scar). Internal contradiction appears when he calls himself "respectfully rebellious" versus "terrible smuggler"—a verbal formula rather than dramatized conflict. Lira remains functional but thin; her trembling fingers and dry laugh show character-particular gesture, yet her arc (sorting letters, releasing storm, vanishing by dawn) reads as a symbolic echo rather than a pressure-driven choice. The final choice to keep delivering feels asserted rather than costly; we don't see what he forfeits or what path closes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the storm bottle unfolds as a pattern-charging object, the alley of letters accumulates weight, and the final image (Elias walking through drone shadow) reweights the opening median-crossing. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—"the absences linked up like constellations" and "the broken things found each other in the dark"—with the cost implicit in perpetual repetition ("Again. And again"). Orientation anchors clearly (Elias, disputed strip, twilight, arcade). One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm reveals "They're not just lost… they're *waiting*." The lens holds, the final image reconfigures prior material, and the cost is legible as ongoing labor without resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt arcade, disputed strip, back alley, and haunted post office create a coherent micro-geography; drone patrol gaps and red-eye scanning constrain Elias's route and timing. The storm bottle's "cool against his palm" and the post office's "walls papered with undelivered mail" ground sensation in tactile detail. The arcade's lights "flickered once, then held" at closure charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean (median, alley, Seventh Street post office) and the seven-minute gap functions as both constraint and tactic. Sensory selection reflects urgency (drone hum, wax seals, rain scent) without catalog sprawl.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: deliver the storm to "where the promises broke." One meaningful tightening occurs when drones approach ("Time was up") and Elias must run, then the post office door opens before he touches it—pressure coheres. Agency is present in the choice to cross after dark and to carry the bottle to Seventh despite risk, though the final act (setting bottle on counter, storm sighing still) feels more ritualistic than agonistic. The cost is signaled as perpetual labor ("Again. And again") but remains abstract; we don't see a specific option foreclosed or a visible price paid in the final beat beyond continued effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through storm-as-map metaphor: "not a cure, but a map… showed you where the cracks had been all along." The ending offers a non-literal answer (absences linking like constellations, broken things finding each other) that reweights prior particulars without moralizing. The final image—Elias walking through the drone shadow—resonates as earned defiance. Subtext operates in Lira's "You're a terrible smuggler" and Elias's correction, in the storm's scent "like the moment before an apology," and in the letters "waiting" versus lost. No thematic echo or thesis statement mars the closure; the storm's mechanics (heal by revealing cracks) remain concrete and purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited through Elias; distance is controlled and perceptual signature is consistent (notice of drone rhythm, scar, postal cap weight). Diction is largely controlled, though phrases like "a thunderstorm in a bottle" and "brittle hush" risk lyricism over embodied perception. Dialogue feels natural ("You're late," "Respectfully rebellious") with subtext in Lira's "That's not mail" and Elias's hedged answer. One slip: "the moment before an apology" reads as narrator's metaphor rather than Elias's in-scene thought. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates (short bursts during drone approach, longer breath at post office) and vocabulary stays within a postal-worker-turned-smuggler's lexicon without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breathing. Information density is high (storm mechanics, drone gap, Lira's letter-fostering, post office haunting compressed efficiently). Two minor artifacts: "a thunderstorm in a bottle, its glass cool against his palm, the trapped wind howling when he tilted it just right" stacks modifiers without advancing plot in that beat; "Again. And again. Until the absences linked up…" loops the closure declaration. Figurative density is elevated ("twilight bled violet," "bruises," "wax seals and torn edges") but serves tone without obscuring cause/effect. No grammar errors; pronoun references clear; spatial sequencing tracks cleanly. Propulsion is solid through high-pressure beats (drone approach, post office entry) but softens slightly in the thematic summation at the end.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The storm-in-a-bottle and letter-fostering combination is fresh; the disputed-strip postal-smuggler angle offers a non-obvious synthesis. The final image (walking through drone shadow, whistling "low and respectful") transforms the opening constraint into earned stance. Risk-taking is present in the lyric compression and mosaic structure (arcade–alley–post office). However, the core arc—underground deliveryman defies authority to honor forgotten voices—echoes familiar resistance-narrative templates. Transformation is moderate: the storm's function (reveal cracks, not cure) and the haunted-by-letters post office add specificity, but the emotional calculus (keep delivering despite danger) remains broadly archetypal. No proximity echoes or stock metaphors beyond "bled violet" twilight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias (mailman) appears in first line; his choices drive three beats: cross median despite drones, deliver bottle to Lira, run to post office at Seventh. His final choice to continue ("Again. And again") shapes closure by asserting perpetual stance. However, the peak decision (place bottle on counter) feels ritualistic rather than agonistic; the door opens "before he touched it," reducing agency. Cost is stated (ongoing labor) but abstract. Early signal, three beats, closure linkage present; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm bottle appears in paragraph five, handled in alley beat (Elias sets it down, Lira unscrews cap, storm unfolds), then at post office (Elias sets it on counter, storm sighs still). Its properties (cool glass, trapped wind, scent of rain/apology) constrain Lira's reaction and shape the revelation ("not a cure, but a map"). Final image: "storm warm against his ribs" and its stilling at post office charges closure. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (reveals cracks), closure linkage, high specificity. Late first appearance (~40%) and moderately swappable mechanics (any revelation device could serve) prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drone border (motion-tracking, seven-minute gap, red-eye scanning) appears in paragraphs two–four and again at closure ("first drone passed overhead"). It constrains route/timing (Elias must test gaps, run when time is up) and shapes the final defiant walk. However, the border functions as obstacle-backdrop rather than evolving pressure; drones threaten but never catch or force a tactical pivot beyond "run faster." Early signal, two beats (crossing, final walk), moderate causal pressure, closure participation. Swappable with any patrol/checkpoint system; lacks specificity tying drone tech to storm mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Respectfully rebellious" appears once as Elias's self-label in dialogue, contrasted with Lira's "terrible smuggler." It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; the trait is declared but not dramatized through a choice where respect and rebellion pull in opposite directions. His whistle at the end ("low and respectful") echoes the label but remains gestural. Label-only use, no causal work, no cost; swappable with "cautious," "principled," or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Foster" appears when Lira is described as "fostering stray letters for months" and in her act of sorting envelopes. The action drives the alley beat (Lira as letter-keeper enables the storm's revelation) and primes the post office discovery (walls papered with undelivered mail). However, fostering as verb/concept does not recur at closure; the final image is Elias delivering, not fostering. Early signal, one key beat (alley revelation), moderate causal pressure. Swappable with "collect," "harbor," "shelter" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Linking absences" appears explicitly only in the final paragraph: "Until the absences linked up like constellations, and the broken things found each other in the dark." The method is not signaled earlier or shown in action; Elias delivers, the storm reveals, but we never see absences being actively linked on the page. The mechanics remain metaphor rather than dramatized process. No early signal, no middle development, closure mention only; ornamental thematic claim without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cobalt arcade at twilight anchors first line and reappears at closure ("arcade's lights flickered once, then held"). The arcade's back alley supplies the meeting space (drone shadows don't reach) and the twilight timing pressures the crossing (drones patrol after dark). The color "cobalt" and time "twilight" charge the opening and closing images. However, the arcade itself (as place with shops, games, specific layout) remains abstract; "cobalt" and "twilight" function as tonal paint rather than tactical constraint. Early signal, closure reprise, moderate atmospheric pressure, but limited irreplaceability (any landmark and dusk would serve).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Day's lone mail drop" appears in first line, framing Elias's final delivery of the day. Time is loose: twilight, "after dark," seven-minute gap, "by dawn" Lira will be gone. The timeframe does not tighten decisions in a live-clock sense; Elias has the gap memorized and moves at narrative pace. "Lone mail drop" sets stakes (one package today) but does not recur or constrain the ending choice. Early signal, no middle pressure, no closure linkage; swappable with "evening shift" or "final run."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Find where broken promises heal" is implicit in the note ("For the ones who wait where the promises broke") and Elias's realization ("This was what the note meant: not a cure, but a map"). The motivation drives the middle beat (storm revelation) and the decision to take the bottle to Seventh. However, it is more passively received (note tells him) than actively pursued through conflicted choice. Elias's internal desire to "fix" versus "deliver the storm" is not dramatized as friction. Early signal via note, one key beat (realization), moderate causal link, but want/cost tension is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Brittle hush" appears in paragraph ten ("the brittle hush between them") and the tone coheres across beats: "dry thing" laugh, "slow peel of thunder," "distant sirens," door "groaned," storm "sighed." Tone modulates under pressure (staccato urgency during drone approach, hushed breath at post office) and charges the final image (whistling "low and respectful," walking "straight through"). Purposeful fragility and quiet defiance hold without static mood or jarring breaks. Early signal, coherent through turns, closure linkage; high tonal control.</comment>
