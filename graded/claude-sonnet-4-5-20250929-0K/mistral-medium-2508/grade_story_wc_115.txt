<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is concrete and embodied—his father's confession drives him into the tunnel, and his skepticism ("a reflex, honed by years") anchors interiority. The micro-choice to turn the valve wheel under pressure is dramatized, though the final renunciation ("Some were meant to be carried") edges toward epiphany without fully embodying the cost. Internal contradiction appears when he flings the radio yet remains seated afterward, showing hypocrisy under stress. No secondary character applies immediate pressure; relationship bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under a Causal lens: the valve wheel turn triggers the geyser and Luz's apparition, then Elias's decision to carry the wheel rather than flee constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (he accepts the haunting as his inheritance). One meaningful tightening occurs when the water moves unprompted, forcing his hand. The radio's looped psychic voice at the end recharges the confession motif but does not obscure the closure unit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tunnel's damp ribs, pitted valve wheel, and black sump are vivid and selective. The valve wheel constrains Elias's final choice—turning it triggers the vision and its lighter weight afterward signals release—meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Sensory hierarchy reflects his scavenger's eye: he appraises the wheel "not by touch but by the way his pulse jumped." Spatial choreography is clean throughout; no impossible positions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting the weight of his father's confession—is signaled early and tightens when the sump water moves unprompted. Elias's agency is clear: he turns the valve wheel under pressure, triggering the geyser and apparition, then chooses to carry the wheel out rather than flee. The cost is legible (he inherits the ghost shift), though the escalation relies on a single reversal. Coincidence does not resolve; his action does.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the valve wheel's shifting weight and the opposition between swallowing (Luz's thread) and carrying (Elias's choice). The final image—tucking the wheel into his coat—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The psychic's looped voice and the father's confession provide scaffolding without label-speak. Minor slip: "Some truths weren't meant to be swallowed whole. Some were meant to be carried" edges toward direct thematic statement, though it remains tied to concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias appraises objects as a scavenger ("souvenirs of a dozen other ruins"), and diction remains character-bound ("drowsy, alert second"). No head-hopping. The psychic's radio voice provides external contrast without contaminating internal texture. Rhythm modulates appropriately from the opening's languid "exhaled damp" to the terse closure moves. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Opening and closing lines anchor cleanly. Sentence variety supports rhythm, and information density is high (e.g., "its beads cool and smooth as rosary stones" layers tactile detail with thematic callback). Minor paraphrase loop: "Some truths weren't meant to be swallowed whole. Some were meant to be carried" restates the same idea across adjacent sentences without added pressure (−0.2). One figurative muddle: "ribs of rusted track" mixes anatomy with infrastructure in a way that slightly blurs the image. No other scaffold or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of industrial ruin, immigrant labor tragedy, and inherited haunting feels specific rather than template-driven. The valve wheel as both physical and emotional regulator offers a fresh angle. The drowsy-alert tone and the psychic hotline as ambient noise layer in purposeful strangeness. Risk-taking in the geyser moment and the ending's refusal to explain heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Luz's throat "bulging with glistening thread" is vivid and particular, avoiding stock ghost imagery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his choice to turn the valve wheel drives the climax, but "reckless" does not clearly constrain or enable decisions—his caution and skepticism dominate. Observation (kneeling, listening) precedes action. The element shapes one key turn (valve wheel) but "abandoned-mill explorer" reads generic; the tunnel setting does more work than the explorer trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The valve wheel appears in four distinct beats: discovery, appraisal, the turning action that triggers the geyser, and the final carry-out where its lighter weight signals release. It is irreplaceable—its steam-pressure function and beaded texture tie directly to the factory and theme. The ending would collapse without it. Early setup, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The factory ghost shift frames the stakes (father's confession, Luz's death, the third shift's "thickened air") and the phantom loom sound mid-scene. It shapes Elias's motivation and the ending's inheritance image ("His had just begun"). Present in setup, middle, and closure, though its mechanics (why this shift, what differentiates it) remain somewhat abstract. Solidly integrated but not indispensable in the way the valve wheel is.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is signaled early ("his skepticism was a reflex, honed by years of watching his mother light candles") and tested when the valve wheel's weight and the loom sound challenge his disbelief. It constrains his initial hesitation but does not drive a high-cost choice—he acts despite skepticism rather than because of it. One beat involvement with modest causal pressure; closure does not hinge on this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Appraise" governs the valve wheel beat ("He appraised it not by touch but by the way his pulse jumped") and ties to his scavenger identity. The act of appraisal leads to the decision to turn the wheel, which triggers the geyser. Present in setup and climax, and the ending's lighter wheel implies a final reappraisal. Essential to two beats and closure-adjacent, though the turn itself (not appraisal) is the decisive action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The psychic hotline radio provides atmospheric dread and the looped voice at the end, but it does not shape Elias's tactics or decisions—he flings it away and proceeds without its guidance. The method is signaled early and returns at closure, offering a lyric reprise that reweights mood, but "interpreting frantic calls" is not dramatized; he listens passively. Functional reprise without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel supplies the sump, the valve wheel, the phantom loom sound, and the spatial pressure that forces Elias to the lowest point. It is irreplaceable—remove it and the story's logic collapses. Present in all beats, constrains movement, and the "mouth of the tunnel" frames both entry and exit. Micro-setting (the sump's black water) alters tactics when it moves unprompted.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush that follows a sudden confession" governs the ending beat ("He sat in the hush that follows a confession") and the dawn light at closure. It is signaled late (final third) but charges the final image with Earned Stasis. No live clock tightens decisions earlier; the hush is atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint. Lyric reprise with closure linkage but minimal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elias's desire "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" is dramatized in the valve wheel's heaviness, the appraisal beat, and the father's confession flashback. The motivation drives him into the tunnel and shapes the climax (turning the wheel to confront Luz). Friction between wanting proof and fearing it appears when he hears the loom sound. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure; the lighter wheel at the end resolves the weight motif with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is embodied in the opening's "drowsy, alert second" and sustained through languid descriptions ("exhaled damp," "slithered back") paired with sharp sensory jolts (the geyser, Luz's apparition). The tone modulates under pressure—short sentences at the climax—then returns to the reflective register at closure. It charges the final image (walking into dawn) and is consistent across beats without flattening into static mood.</comment>
