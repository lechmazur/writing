<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's mercury-glass eyes and silver streaks provide striking embodiment, and his interior contradictions (boy who pressed palms over ears / man who finally reaches for the stone) show genuine struggle. The pivot from refusing talent to embracing it feels earned through the specificity of the memories (humming tune, sketching constellations). However, the final transformation into "Keeper of the Unsaid" arrives with minimal on-page hesitation or visible cost in the peak moment—he picks up the pen without shaking hands, which flattens what should be a high-stakes threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric scaffolding. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the bookstore-as-mountain metaphor is taught and sustained. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elias commits to writing the glyphs, sealing the door behind him, foreclosing his former refusal). The cost is legible—"Some doors were meant to stay closed. Others were meant to be built"—and the final image of writing glyphs as seeds delivers felt weight. Minor causality seam: the false wall vanishes after he folds a page into a seed, but the mechanics of that trigger remain opaque, creating a small convenience leap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly grounded (shelves spiraling like fingerprint grooves, *Poetics of Silence* section, cracked atlas pedestal) and the mountain-as-throat metaphor sustains atmosphere. The stone itself—warm, pulsing, glyphs shifting when he blinks—functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: tracing the feather-texture rearranges glyphs into a map of his interior, directly enabling the pivot. The circular room with empty shelves and the lectern provide a charged final stage. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout all transitions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim buried talent vs. sustain refusal) is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes "the language wasn't for speaking. It was for *planting*." That insight narrows his options to one on-page act: writing the first truth. The pain-of-remembering thread and the feather clue create accumulative pressure. However, the final sequence offers little overt friction—Elias steps through the door, picks up the pen, and begins without a dramatized moment of hesitation or trade-off, which keeps the peak beat from fully testing commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (talent as seed, home as verb, the cost of the unsaid) emerges through concrete images: mercury residue as price of seeing, the stone as mirror, glyphs as roots. The final image—Elias writing glyphs onto empty shelves—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. The line "The pain of remembering wasn't the past. It was the future he'd refused to let unfold" borders on authorial summary but is grounded enough in prior particulars (age-twelve repression, twenty-seven pretense) to avoid pure moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in gesture (pressing palms over ears, hand not shaking) and in the feather-texture imprint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-limited focalization holds throughout; perceptual signature (mercury-glass eyes leaving silver streaks, seeing dreams as substitutes for reality) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity. However, elevated register occasionally drifts toward poetic convenience: "the texture of a feather, the way it caught light like a held breath" reads as authorial rather than Elias's interior idiom under stress. No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming from external action to memory flashes to present realization), and the final paragraph's declarative simplicity ("Some doors were meant to stay closed. Others were meant to be built.") fits the resolute tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but largely coherent (mountain as throat/book, stone as heart/mirror). Minor overwriting in peak beats: "the ink was the color of mercury, the color of storms, the color of a talent finally unearthed" stacks three synonymous clauses without added pressure. Template cadence in the memory sequence: "At eight… At fifteen… At twenty-seven…" reads mechanical. Paraphrase loop: "The stone wasn't a key. It was a mirror" followed immediately by extended explanation of what the mirror shows. No major clarity breaks, but density and scaffold drag slightly reduce propulsion in the final third. Information density is otherwise strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain-bookstore fusion and the glyph-as-seed mechanics offer fresh inflection on "lost artifact" templates. Mercury-glass eyes and silver-streak residue are specific and memorable. However, the core arc (reluctant seer reclaims suppressed gift via mystical object) follows a well-worn structure without bold transformation. The feather-texture clue and the "shape of home is a verb" twist add lyric surprise, but the final pivot (Elias becomes Keeper, writes glyphs, mountain remembers) lands within predictable genre boundaries. No proximity to famous lines; voice is consistent, but risk-taking is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (mercury-glass seer) is introduced immediately and drives all beats: moves through stacks, reaches for the stone, traces the feather impression, tears the page, steps through the door, writes the first truth. His perceptual gift (seeing too much, dreams as reality substitute) shapes his approach to the stone. However, many of these are observation-to-decision sequences rather than high-friction choices that alter tactics under resistance. The final act (picking up the pen, writing) is decisive but arrives without on-page hesitation or visible trade-off in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The language stone appears early (middle of first third), is handled in multiple beats (reaching, tracing the feather underside, holding in pocket at the end), and returns with reweighted meaning (not a key, but a mirror; not for speaking, but for planting). Tracing the feather impression rearranges glyphs into a map, directly enabling the next beat. The stone's warmth and humming anchor the final image, "humming. Not with loss, but with possibility." Strong causal role and charged reprise, though the stone's mechanics (how folding a page opens the door) remain somewhat opaque.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Buried talents (boy who swallowed his gift, humming/sketching suppressed, now unearthed) shapes the dominant stake explicitly. The concept drives the remembering-pain timeframe and the final pivot to writing glyphs. However, much of the work is thematic echo rather than on-page friction: Elias's past refusals are summarized in memory flashes, not dramatized as present temptations. The concept charges the ending image (talent as seed, written onto shelves), but the middle lacks a scene where burying vs. unearthing creates a live tactical dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is mentioned once ("dreams he substituted for reality each night") and colors his perceptual approach ("he'd seen it in the dreams"), but the trait does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. It reads as atmospheric label rather than a mechanic that alters choices or exacts a trade-off. No mid-scene moment where dream-substitution creates a mistake, forces a detour, or offers a unique solution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Seed action threads through the latter half: Elias folds the torn page "into a seed" and lets it fall, triggering the false wall's disappearance. The final act is writing glyphs as seeds ("each glyph a seed, each sentence a root"). This frames the resolution and is irreplaceable—"planting" vs. "speaking" redefines the stone's use and Elias's role. However, the seed mechanic arrives late (past midpoint) and the folded-page moment is brief, limiting its development across beats. Strong closure linkage and thematic charge elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The feather texture appears once as a clue: "Not a real one—no, it was the *texture* of a feather, the way it caught light like a held breath, pressed into the stone's underside." Tracing it rearranges glyphs into a map, enabling the next beat. The final paragraph reprises "It looked like a feather," charging the closure image. Mechanics matter (texture as key), but the feather is not signaled early and does not recur in the middle to shape tactics. Lyric resonance (early seed → final reprise) provides moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore-mountain is introduced in the opening line and sustained throughout: shelves spiral, sections (*Poetics of Silence*), false walls, the circular room with empty shelves. The setting supplies the stone's hiding place, the pedestal of atlas pages, and the final lectern. Spatial choreography is clear and the mountain's "exhale" and "groan" modulate atmosphere. However, the labyrinth does not impose navigation costs or dead-end friction—Elias walks directly to the stone, then through the new door. The setting enriches but does not pressure choices meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After remembering becomes painful" is anchored early: "The pain of remembering had started three months ago, a slow unspooling of self." The timeframe motivates Elias's arrival at the bookstore now and frames the memory flashes (age twelve, fifteen, twenty-seven). However, the present-tense action unfolds without a ticking clock—no urgency that the pain is escalating *during* the scene or that delay would foreclose the stone's use. The timeframe sets context but does not tighten on-page tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To understand the shape of home" is stated early ("a boy who could hear the shape of home in the wind") and echoed in the title *The Shape of Home Is a Verb*. The motivation drives Elias's search for the stone and his final acceptance of the Keeper role. The stone-as-mirror beat dramatizes the desire by showing home as an interior map. However, the motivation is more thematic throughline than conflicted choice-driver: no scene where Elias must choose between home and another want, or where understanding home exacts a visible cost. The desire is told and illustrated, but not tested under friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone—hidden thunder—is established through restrained intensity: mercury-glass eyes, "dreams where the mountain was a throat," glyphs pulsing, the mountain's exhale and groan, "dust rained from the ceiling, glittering like shattered stars." The prose withholds overt emotional declaration, letting atmospheric charge carry pressure. Tone modulates with beats: quiet approach, brief surge when the wall vanishes, calm resolve in the final room. The ending ("The mountain would remember. So would he.") delivers understated weight. Coherent and purposeful throughout, with strong closure participation.</comment>
