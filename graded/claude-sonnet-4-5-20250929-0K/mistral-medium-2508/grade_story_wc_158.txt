<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's interiority is vivid and embodied ("bones humming," "fingers tracing"), but her interior struggle remains abstract—ensconcing the postcard and singing louder are gestures without visible cost or competing impulses dramatized in scene. The ghost's exchange offers a moment of contradiction ("You sing to us" / "I sing through you"), but his transformation happens to him rather than through a choice the poet wrestles with. The manual-writing sequence introduces micro-choices (send, tuck, eat), yet these feel ornamental rather than rooted in a hierarchy of values under pressure. No meaningful path is foreclosed with felt cost; she continues her work unaltered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (lyric imagery, timeless setting, pattern of singing → transformation), and the final image of the shell sealing and the wind supplying a title offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, orientation anchors (who, where, when) remain vague past 120 words—"three hundred years" and "inside a gargantuan shell" lack spatial and temporal grounding that would help the reader track causality. The cost at closure is conceptual (rest without sleep, cocoon-like enclosure) but not legible as a decisive forfeiture or change in options; the poet's stance and tactics remain unchanged from the opening. The sequence of beats (postcard → ghost → manual → net cast → rest) reads as accumulation rather than because/therefore linkage, which fits the lens but does not deepen or tighten pressure meaningfully.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is anchored early and richly detailed (spiraled walls etched with war names, acoustics bent to holy, mouth open to the sea), and it constrains the poet's perceptual world (tide of memory, calcium veins vibrating). The postcard, helmet, and poppies function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. However, spatial choreography inside the shell remains abstract—no clear sense of how the poet moves between the niche, the mouth, and the ghost's position. The sensory palette is vivid but sometimes generic ("crushed violets and gunpowder turned to pollen" reads stock). The shell's role as setting that forces a choice or alters tactics is present but modest; it amplifies her voice rather than constraining it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—photosynthesizing pain into beauty, waking the dead, dissolving war—is signaled early and repeated, but it remains thematic rather than tested by on-page pressure. The ghost's arrival and transformation offer a micro turn, yet he dissolves without resistance or cost to the poet. The new war beginning beyond the horizon and her decision to "sing louder" suggest escalation, but the tightening is asserted rather than dramatized through narrowed options or a visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the poet's tactics (singing, writing, sending the manual) accumulate but do not shift under pressure. The manual sequence introduces variety but no rising cost or consequence that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—alchemy of sorrow into beauty, staying versus fleeing, growth from ruin—emerges through recurring images (postcard galaxy, poppies from rifle barrels, coral in helmet) and the final title supplied by the wind. The "reef-shadow joy" and "how to dissolve a war" motifs charge the ending without overt moralizing. However, the ghost's line "You sing to us" / "I sing through you" feels on-the-nose, and the manual's illustrated-with-pressed-flowers detail reads as symbolic convenience rather than earned particularity. The final image of the shell sealing and the wind naming the work offers resonance, but the thematic question—whether the poet's work changes anything—remains unexamined; she continues unchanged, which undercuts the non-literal answer the ending seeks.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent in diction ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy," "acoustics bent sound into something almost holy"), with a distinct perceptual signature filtering the world through song, growth, and warfare. However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats without variation, and the ghost's dialogue ("You sing to us," voice described as "rusted") converges in idiom with the poet's narration. POV distance is stable (close third), but the narrative occasionally drifts into omniscient summary ("They said she was trying to wake them") without anchoring the claim in the poet's perception. Purposeful compression (e.g., "The third she ate") works, but some figurative constructions feel strained ("to listen as the shell exhaled, its breath laced with the scent of crushed violets and gunpowder turned to pollen").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense and imagistic, but figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating overwriting in peak beats ("bones humming with the weight of unsaid verses," "acoustics bent sound into something almost holy," "petals whispering in a language older than grief"). Mixed metaphors recur: the shell "exhaled" with "breath laced with scent" personifies architecture inconsistently, and "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" and "turn the rot of old battles into something that could feed the next generation of stars" stack vehicles without clear tenor. Paraphrase loops appear ("She was trying to wake them" / "She was trying to photosynthesize pain into beauty") and template cadence runs in the manual sequence ("The first copy she sent… the second she tucked… the third she ate"). Clarity suffers in the net-snares-the-sun passage, where the action and its consequence are unclear. Information density is high, but momentum drags under the weight of ornamentation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of insomniac poet, war-to-beauty alchemy, and manual-as-artifact offers a fresh angle on tired peace-versus-war material, and the shell setting and galaxy postcard are specific anchors. However, the emotional arc and thematic question feel familiar—artist transforming pain, staying versus despair—and the closure (shell sealing, wind naming the work) relies on lyric resonance rather than a non-obvious synthesis. The manual sequence (send, tuck, eat) introduces ingenuity, but the poppies-from-rifle-barrels image and "language older than grief" read as stock poetic gestures. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform it through lived detail or moral calculus; the poet's immortality and tirelessness insulate her from genuine cost, which flattens the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout and frames the narrative, but her choices (pressing the postcard, singing, writing the manual) are reactive or continuations of her centuries-long practice rather than on-page decisions that create key turns. The ghost exchange is the only moment where her action (pressing palm to sternum) alters another character's state, but this reads as a demonstration of her power rather than a choice under pressure. Her decision to "sing louder" when the new war begins is asserted but not dramatized as a pivot with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard appears in three beats: pressed to chest at dusk, ensconced in the shell niche, glowing when the ghost blooms, and traced at dawn. The niche placement and the glow moment reweight its meaning slightly (from longing artifact to active catalyst), and it charges the final tracing beat. However, its role is largely symbolic; removing it would not break story logic, only thematic resonance. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Blossom armistice" is named early as both prayer and diagnosis and recurs in the postcard's depiction (weapons dissolved into petals) and the poppies-from-rifle-barrels beat. However, it functions as theme rather than a concept that shapes on-page stakes or tactics. The poet's work enacts the concept, but the concept itself does not change her options or force a choice. It echoes more than it drives.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is illustrated once in metaphor ("the way roots split stone: no one noticed until the cracks became canyons") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The poet's persistence is shown (singing, writing, sending the manual), but the trait remains a label rather than a tension that forces a trade-off. Her shyness and her unstoppability never come into conflict in a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ensconcing the postcard occurs mid-story in a brief beat ("Her hands… ensconced the postcard in a niche carved from the shell's inner curve"), and the postcard glows later when the ghost blooms, suggesting the action primes that transformation. However, the causal link is loose—the glow could occur without the ensconcing—and the action does not create a major turn or redefine options. It is purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind are signaled early ("The wind here was always off-key, carrying half-sung lullabies"), used in the middle (the deserter follows them "like a trail of breadcrumbs"), and charged at closure (the wind supplies the manual's title and carries the voice into the next century). The method shapes the ghost's dissolution and the children's waking with "strange, sweet ache," and the wind functions as accomplice throughout. However, the mechanics remain abstract; how the lullabies work (why they wake or transform) is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is anchored early, its features recur across beats (spiraled walls, niche, mouth open to the sea, calcium veins vibrating), and it constrains the poet's sensory world (acoustics, tide of memory) and charges the final image (shell sealing around her like a cocoon). The niche's acoustics enable the postcard's glow, and the vibrating walls transmit the ghost's transformation. However, the shell does not pressure a choice or force a tactic shift; it amplifies her work rather than limiting it. Spatial choreography inside remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The centuries timeframe is signaled early ("three hundred years," "centuries had taught her") and recurs (the ghost's "forgotten vows," the wind carrying her voice "into the next century"). However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the poet's immortality insulates her from urgency. The new war beginning at dawn suggests a clock, but the poet's response (sing louder) is continuation rather than a time-pressured choice. The timeframe functions as backdrop and thematic weight, not narrative constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated early and illustrated through recurring images (nebula blooming from clash, poppies from rifles, coral in helmet, manual from pressed flowers). The poet's actions (singing, writing, sending) enact the desire. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested—no moment where beauty fails, or where the cost of the work (isolation, exhaustion) forces her to weigh continuing versus stopping. The motivation drives her tactics but does not generate friction or choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy, dark and iridescent" is named once mid-story and illustrated through images (jellyfish bells like slow applause, reefs thriving in shadow of shipwrecks, coral budding in helmet). The tone—melancholy persistence, beauty emergent from ruin—is coherent through turns and modulates with pressure (the ghost's dissolution, the new war's drums). The final image (shell sealing, poet resting in quiet hum) carries the tone forward and charges closure. However, the tone is more consistent than dynamic; it does not shift meaningfully under escalation, and "reef-shadow joy" as a phrase arrives late rather than being taught early.</comment>
