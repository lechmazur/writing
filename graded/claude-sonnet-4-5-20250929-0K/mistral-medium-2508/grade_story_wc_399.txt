<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysan's interiority is concrete and embodied through tactile engagement with the parapet, her half-mask anchoring physical presence. Her motivation to preserve "quieter wisdoms" against the prophet's fervor drives choices with genuine cost—kneeling, consecrating through recalled silence, staying until borders hold. The voice in the pavilion functions more as thematic mirror than full character, but Lysan's micro-choices (pressing palm, adjusting mask, staying past exhaustion) reveal hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the prophet's followers remain abstract threat rather than immediate pressure, slightly diluting the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece teaches its pattern early—whispers, fraying clearings, peripheral awareness—and accumulates through sensory intensification and the parapet's responsive song. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lysan restores the clearing's borders, the weight eases, she steps back "strangely honest, strangely whole" with cost legible in her exhaustion and the knowledge she can only hold "long enough." Orientation is swift (Lysan, clearing edge, dunes, pavilion). One meaningful deepening when the parapet "shivered...then sang" and the clearing sharpened, narrowing from entropy to temporary stasis with visible effort-cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The parapet as micro-setting object constrains Lysan's choice—she must press, coax, stay until its song fades—charging the final act. Sensory detail (crushed mint, damp earth, silk walls sighing) is selective and modulates with pressure, sparse during concentration, richer when the clearing stabilizes. The half-mask recurs as physical anchor (bone cool, catching light "like a blade"). Spatial choreography is clean: clearing edge, pavilion heart, parapet curve, then stepping back into "the murmuring world." Minor limitation: the dunes and prophet's followers remain atmospheric rather than spatially navigated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the clearing's memory against the prophet's erasure—is signaled in the first two paragraphs and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening: the parapet "groaned, then sang" after Lysan recalls "the shape of silence," the clearing's edges sharpening from blur to hold. Agency is renunciation and endurance (kneeling, staying, touching light and reverent) with visible cost: the weight in her chest, the knowledge she cannot hold it forever but "long enough." The voice's regretful "*You can't hold it forever*" and Lysan's measured reply dramatize the tradeoff between immediate rescue and long-term survival. Under Accumulative lens, the single consecration deepens rather than reverses, fitting the inferred mode.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—wisdom surviving in peripheral spaces, whispers, the "half-glimpsed"—emerges from image and action without statement until the penultimate line, which operates as earned observation rather than thesis. The half-mask (one side bare, "strangely honest") charges the final image: Lysan steps back "strangely honest, strangely whole," the adjective pair reweighting her partial exposure as completeness through endurance. Subtext operates in the pavilion voice's silences and Lysan's tactile devotion. The prophet's "fire and fervor" versus "quieter wisdoms" risks binary, but the piece commits to its stance without false balance, and the ending's double assertion—"the desert would remember. And so would she."—lands as Conceptual Repricing of what survival costs and who carries it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering all perception through Lysan's line-walker idiom: "peripheral awareness," "the way one senses a storm before the clouds gather." Perceptual signature is consistent (touch prioritized, smell secondary, kinetics as felt pressure). The voice occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism—"the first word ever spoken," "the murmuring world"—that sits at the edge of Lysan's plausible register but remains legible as lyric mode taught early. Psychic distance is controlled; the pavilion voice reads as external stimulus, not head-hop. Dialogue (brief, italicized) carries subtext and advances Lysan's choice to stay. Minor density: some similes ("like breath through reeds," "like a blade") are conventional within the established tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, with short declaratives ("No. But I can hold it *long enough*.") breaking longer accumulative sentences. Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "her half-mask of bleached bone pressed close to her cheek, the other side bare—strangely honest" anchors object, character trait, and thematic seed). No paraphrase loops; the parapet's repeated touches are functionally distinct (press, trace, coax). Minor figurative density: "whispered," "threading," "breath through reeds," "like the first word" cluster in the opening, approaching saturation but held in check by concrete action. The line "This was how wisdom survived—not in proclamations, but in the spaces between" trends toward thematic statement but is brief and tied to immediate action (pressing forehead to parapet).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The core synthesis—mystical relic-tending versus evangelical fervor, embodied through a half-masked ritualist—is specific enough to avoid pure archetype. The half-mask (one side bare = "strangely honest") and the kinetic parapet singing under recalled silence offer fresh inflection on preservation-versus-change conflict. The "line walker" learning "tremors between what was and what might be" personalizes her skillset. Risk: the prophet remains off-stage abstraction, and "fire and fervor" is stock diction. The piece commits fully to its accumulative, sensory method and the final reprise ("strangely honest, strangely whole") reweights the opening image in hindsight, meeting the transformation test. Within-band: +0.2 for structural commitment to peripheral/accumulative mode under sustained pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lysan, the half-masked line walker, is present throughout. Setup: established in the opening line, her line-walker training detailed by paragraph 10. Development: her choices—kneeling, pressing palm, recalling silence, staying—constrain and enable the consecration across at least three beats. Payoff: she "stayed until the parapet's song faded...until the weight in her chest eased," then stepped back. Causal pressure: her tactile, patient method enables the parapet's response and the clearing's stabilization. Cost: exhaustion, the knowledge she can hold "long enough" but not forever. Swappability: another character without line-walker training and peripheral-awareness idiom would break the consecration's logic. High integration with closure participation and beat involvement across the piece.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet is introduced in paragraph 3 ("relic of the old ways that hummed when touched just right"). Development: Lysan presses palm (paragraph 6), feels its pulse, and it "shivered...then sang" (paragraph 14) in response to her consecration. Payoff: she presses her forehead to it (paragraph 17), traces its seams (paragraph 22), and stays "until the parapet's song faded to a whisper" (paragraph 24), the clearing's restoration depending on her sustained contact. Causal pressure: the parapet's kinetic response to unspoken things and recalled silence enables the clearing's borders to sharpen. Cost: the effort of coaxing "a wounded animal back to its feet." Irreplaceability: a non-kinetic or non-responsive object would not provide the tactile feedback loop central to the consecration. Strong beat involvement (three distinct touches with evolving function) and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are introduced in paragraph 1 ("the conjured clearing") and their fraying explained in paragraph 5 ("the clearings had begun to fray at the edges"). Development: Lysan's goal is to re-stabilize one clearing, and paragraph 15 shows "the clearing's edges sharpened." Payoff: paragraph 24, "the clearing's borders held steady once more." Causal pressure: the clearing's instability creates the dominant stake and its stabilization is the closure effect. Cost: Lysan's effort and the temporary nature of the fix. Minor limitation: "conjured" as descriptor appears early but the mechanics or origin of conjuring are not dramatized; the clearings function more as setting-condition than active concept that Lysan manipulates. Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); middle development is implicit in her effort but not distinctly shown as a separate beat where the conjuring itself changes tactics. Solid integration but trends toward setting-stake rather than manipulated concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" appears in paragraph 2 as descriptor of Lysan's half-masked state ("the other side bare—strangely honest in a place where truths were usually buried") and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("stepped back into the murmuring world—strangely honest, strangely whole"). Setup: early. Payoff: final image reweights the trait as earned completeness. Development: the attribute does not visibly constrain a middle choice; Lysan's honesty is thematic rather than tactical. Cost connection: her exposure (one side bare) is presented as existing condition, not a choice made under pressure in this scene. The reprise charges the ending but the attribute itself does not enable or foreclose an action between setup and payoff. Lyric early-final bracket lifts it into mid-6s per the allowance, but causal pressure and middle beat involvement are absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Consecrate is introduced as Lysan's purpose in paragraph 3 ("come to consecrate the kinetic parapet") and executed in paragraph 13 ("began the consecration—not with chants or blood, but by recalling the shape of silence before the prophet's arrival"). Development: the consecration unfolds across multiple beats (pressing palm, recalling silence, pressing forehead, tracing seams, staying until the song fades). Payoff: the consecration succeeds in stabilizing the clearing's borders (paragraph 24). Causal pressure: the specific method—recalling silence rather than chanting—drives the parapet's response and the clearing's restoration. Cost: sustained effort and the knowledge the effect is temporary. Irreplaceability: swapping "consecrate" for another ritual verb would require rewriting the tactile, patient method central to Lysan's line-walker identity. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through peripheral awareness" is signaled in paragraph 6 ("feeling its pulse through peripheral awareness—the way one senses a storm before the clouds gather"). Development: Lysan's line-walker training (paragraph 10) is described as reading "tremors between what was and what might be," which aligns with peripheral sensing. Payoff: the method implicitly shapes her patient, non-intrusive consecration approach. Limitation: "peripheral awareness" as mechanics is mentioned but not distinctly dramatized in a middle beat where it changes her tactics or enables a specific choice; the parapet responds to recalled silence and sustained touch, but we don't see Lysan shift from direct to peripheral sensing as a turn. The method is present and thematically consistent but its mechanics do not create a distinct causal gate. One clear gate (setup), payoff implied through method-coherence, middle development weak. Mid-5s fit for functional but under-dramatized method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is introduced in the opening line and anchored in paragraph 2 (Lysan at its edge) and paragraph 7 (the voice "from the pavilion's heart"). Development: the pavilion's silk walls ripple without wind (paragraph 4), its air smells of "crushed mint and something older" (paragraph 4), and it "breathed with her, its silk walls sighing in relief" (paragraph 18) when the consecration succeeds. Payoff: the silence between Lysan and the voice becomes "companionable" (paragraph 21) and she steps back into "the murmuring world" (paragraph 25). Causal pressure: the pavilion houses the parapet and the voice; its responsive atmosphere (rippling, sighing) mirrors the clearing's state and charges the closure by exhaling relief. Micro-setting function: the pavilion's sensory presence constrains Lysan's choices (she kneels within it, addresses the voice) and its final sigh validates her success. Strong setting-as-pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrives" is established in paragraph 5 ("After the prophet arrived, the clearings had begun to fray") and contextualized as recent past creating present crisis. Development: the prophet's ongoing presence pressures Lysan's urgency ("The prophet's echoes are loud," paragraph 8; "The prophet's followers had begun marking the dunes," paragraph 20). Payoff: Lysan's knowledge that "The prophet would leave eventually" (paragraph 19) and her commitment to hold the clearing "long enough" (paragraph 11) frame the timeframe's temporary but critical window. Limitation: the timeframe is backdrop-urgency rather than live ticking clock; we do not see Lysan racing against an imminent prophet arrival or follower intrusion within this scene. The "after" sets condition and stakes but does not tighten tactics in real time. Two gates met (setup, payoff connection), middle development is ambient rather than acute. Solid stake-framing, modest tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Lysan's motivation "to preserve the echo of wisdom" is dramatized in her dialogue ("They drown out the quieter wisdoms," paragraph 8) and her actions (kneeling, consecrating by recalling silence, staying until the clearing holds). Development: friction between her goal and the prophet's louder truths creates the dominant stake, and the voice's warning ("You can't hold it forever") forces her to articulate the cost ("long enough"). Payoff: "the echo of wisdom hummed, stubborn and bright" (paragraph 22) and Lysan's final assertion—"the desert would remember. And so would she"—completes the motivation arc. Causal pressure: her desire to preserve drives every beat from kneeling to departure. Cost: exhaustion, the weight in her chest, the knowledge her effort is temporary. Visible tradeoff: she forgoes immediate safety or rest to hold the clearing. Strong dramatization across beats with cost and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" is established in the opening ("The dunes whispered," "murmuring pavilion") and sustained through diction (sighing, breathing, hummed, murmur). Development: tone modulates under pressure—the parapet "groaned, then sang" (paragraph 14), the clearing's "fragile pocket of stillness" (paragraph 22)—without breaking into loud declaration. Payoff: the final paragraph's quiet assertion ("the desert would remember. And so would she") charges the ending by refusing bombast in contrast to the prophet's "fire and fervor." Coherence: tone holds across turns, intensifying through tactile intimacy (pressing, tracing, coaxing) rather than volume. The tone's restraint is thematically load-bearing—wisdom survives in whispers, not proclamations—and the final image ("strangely honest, strangely whole") crystallizes the calm as hard-won poise rather than passivity. Strong tonal discipline with closure charge.</comment>
