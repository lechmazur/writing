<comment>Veyra's drive to translate the dying language is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains abstract—we see "copper-veined" traits and "the hunger that had driven her ancestors" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in the moment. The key turn ("She should have stopped then. But…") reads as a declaration rather than a dramatized struggle with visible cost on the page. The ending forecloses her path, but the reader traces the closure more through summary ("tried to run," "tried to harness") than through immediate, embodied pressure.</comment>

<comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within opening lines and builds toward a clear RR/CR closure: Veyra becomes part of the echo, the diamond cracks, and the language's death is complete. However, the crucial moment—"You were never meant to understand"—arrives via exposition rather than a choice or renunciation that the reader watches unfold; the escalation is summarized ("echoes wrapped around her ankles") instead of enacted in real time. The Accumulative/Textural lens is legible and the closure image resonates, but the cost at the peak beat is asserted more than dramatized, keeping the score in the mid-6s rather than the 7+ band.</comment>

<comment>The bone towers and canyon setting are vivid and constraining: the towers hum, groan, and finally sing, directly shaping Veyra's final entrapment. The diamond at her throat and the starlings' cipher-patterns are micro-setting elements that alter tactics and charge the ending image. Spatial choreography stays clear throughout, and the environment evolves causally with events (towers silent → groaning → singing) without postcard-stall moments.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—capture the dying language before it dissolves—is signaled early and tightens once when the echoes turn "alive" and wrap around her. That single meaningful deepening fits this length, but the protagonist's agency is diluted: she "tried to run" and "should have stopped" rather than making a visible, on-page choice that narrows options with felt cost. Coincidence does not resolve, yet the peak turn reads as event-driven (the diamond pulses, the canyon inhales) rather than protagonist-driven under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically: translation as hubris, the untranslatable as boundary, and the echo as a living archive. The final image—"echoes are just sounds that have forgotten how to die"—resonates without stating a moral, and the starlings' new patterns reweight prior material. One phrase dips into thematic echo: "You were never meant to understand" articulates the thesis a bit directly, but it is embedded in dramatized consequence rather than final-paragraph moralizing, so the penalty is light.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Veyra, with distinct perceptual signature (copper-veined, texture-into-sound sensibility). Voice modulates under pressure ("warm as a heartbeat," "thick as chains"), and no head-hopping occurs. However, several peak beats rely on filter verbs ("understood too late," "knew the method") that dull immediacy, and the final third includes some redundant stems ("The canyon breathes. The storyteller does not. But the starlings keep flying.") that flatten rhythm slightly without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Information density is high, and figurative language ("grit of consonants," "silk of vowels") charges texture. Yet paraphrase loops appear: "The canyon answered—not with words, but with the texture of them" restates the premise across adjacent lines, and the coda section recycles "The canyon / the towers / the starlings" in parallel template cadence without adding new pressure. The loop and scaffold artifacts cluster in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of language-death, curse object, and bird-cipher is specific and non-obvious, and the ending feels inevitable in hindsight (the diamond was cursed for answering, not listening). However, the "cursed translator artifact" premise is widely used in speculative templates, and transformation here is partial: the copper veins and bone towers add texture but do not fundamentally shift the moral calculus or lived detail beyond familiar genre moves.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Veyra appears early, frames the central conflict, and her choice to press forward ("should have stopped… But") drives the key turn. She is present in the closure image as "part of the echo," reweighting her earlier role. The decision that narrows options reads more as summary than enacted pressure, preventing entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The diamond is handled across multiple beats: adjusted at the throat, pressed to her lips, pulsed warm, and finally cracked in the ending image. It harnessing the echoes enables the mid-story turn, and its curse reweights meaning at closure ("cursed for those who answered"). The object's unique properties (flawed, cursed, warm as a heartbeat) matter causally and are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The "Canyon of Endless Echoes" and its echo-dynamics shape stakes throughout: echoes are passive, then alive, then chains. The concept constrains Veyra's method and charges the final image ("echoes… have forgotten how to die"). However, it is introduced in the opening and does not tighten options in a dramatized middle beat, limiting it to the 5–6 band rather than the 7+ essential range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Quietly articulate" appears once as descriptor ("hands… moved with quiet articulation") without constraining or enabling an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is static rather than pressured; swappable with "careful" or "precise" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Harness" is the core action: Veyra harnessing the echoes via the diamond drives the inciting turn, the mid-story intensification, and the closure consequence (the echoes wrap her, the diamond cracks). The action is present in setup, middle, and payoff, and removing it would collapse the causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The flock of starlings is signaled early as cipher and method ("the birds' flight was a cipher"), and their patterns fracture when the echoes twist, showing mechanical consequence. They reappear in the final image with "patterns… different now," reweighting prior use. However, their mechanics do not constrain a middle choice with visible cost; they are observed rather than actively manipulated, keeping the score in the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The bone towers and canyon are present in setup, middle, and closure: towers hum, groan, sing, and entrap Veyra; the canyon "inhales" and "remembers." The setting constrains her escape ("echoes wrapped around her ankles") and charges the final image. Environment shapes tactics and the closure image with specificity and causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>The dying language provides urgency ("final breath before it dissolved") and frames the closure (death of the language coincides with Veyra's absorption into the echo). However, the timeframe is more thematic backdrop than live clock: no ticking countdown alters her tactics mid-scene. The element is functional but does not constrain middle choices with visible time-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Veyra's motivation—translate texture into sound—is stated early, dramatized in her exhaling onto the diamond, and tested when the echoes turn hostile. The desire conflicts with survival at the peak beat ("should have stopped… But the copper in her veins burned"). The friction is visible, though the final choice reads more as event-overtaking-her than a trade-off she enacts with clear agency.</comment>
