<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leeward's motivation ("to dub obstacles into rhythm") is present but operates more as thematic statement than dramatized choice. His internal experience is filtered through heavily metaphoric perception rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "restless energy" and final thrill are asserted more than shown through micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; he remains in the same exploratory stance throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: successive strikes layer sensory and cosmic response until the sea answers and Leeward laughs. However, closure relies on assertion ("the thrill of the next note") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost; the protagonist's options and stance remain unchanged on the page. The sea's "voice" arrives as external event rather than earned consequence of prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating orchard, driftwood circle, and improvised instruments (iron pot, coconut husk, seashells) create a vivid, tactile micro-setting. The blue hour and cloud movements are filtered through Leeward's perceptual signature and directly affect his actions (striking, listening, adjusting). Spatial choreography (tide lapping, orchard tilting) remains coherent and pressures his physical stance. The setting constrains and enables choice across multiple beats, meeting the 9+ gate, but some descriptions ("bruise," "hand conducting") veer toward forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—turning storm resistance into rhythm—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the rising "hum" and Leeward's escalating strikes, but this is primarily atmospheric intensification rather than a narrowing of options or a trade-off with visible cost. The sea's answer and Leeward's laugh feel like arrival at a goal rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No meaningful reversal or tightening that alters tactics is dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (obstacle as instrument, resistance as composition) emerges through action and image rather than statement. The fractal cloud patterns, the orchard's sway, and the sea's answering hum are concrete particulars that charge the motif. However, the final image leans on abstraction ("the thrill of the next note") instead of a non-literal, resonant answer. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into aesthetic harmony without friction or cost, trending toward sentimentality.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled metaphoric diction ("sky bled indigo," "unplayed sheet music," "bloomed like a bruise"). POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("euphony," "resonance waiting to be coaxed") that reads as writerly rather than character-particular. Under peak pressure (sea's voice, Leeward's laugh), the prose remains ornamental rather than compressing into sharper immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often stacked ("clouds coiled like unplayed sheet music," "fruits glowing faintly…as if lit from within by the same restless energy"). Mixed metaphors appear ("sound…bloomed like a bruise," "hand…conducting" then "clenched into a fist"). Template cadence runs: "He struck…He lifted…He didn't fight…He didn't know." Paraphrase loop in paragraph 2 (mallet description, orchard description) restates the floating-orchard concept. Artifacts touch closure paragraph ("restlessness…wasn't fear. It was the thrill"), triggering accumulation cap and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise (tide prophet on floating orchard conducts storms via improvised xylophone) is specific and visually striking. However, the emotional arc (restlessness → thrill) and plot trajectory (exploration → confirmation) follow predictable paths without trade-offs or non-obvious complications. The sea's answering "voice" arrives as affirmation rather than a turn that reweights prior material. Fresher than stock fantasy but stops short of synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Leeward is present throughout and performs all on-page actions (strikes, listens, laughs). However, his "choices" are exploratory rather than decisive; no turn hinges on a difficult trade-off. He reacts to the sea's voice but does not alter his stance or tactics in response. Setup and development present; closure participation is observational rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet is introduced early (paragraph 2), handled in multiple beats (strikes root, iron pot, coconut husk, seashells, central log), and present in the final image ("raised the mallet again"). Its carved origin (pear tree from the storm) seeds symbolic weight, and its pulsing warmth at the end reweights it as a "second heart." Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; cost connection is implied but not explicit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" shapes the method (strike → cloud response → fractal pattern) across multiple beats. The clouds "sketch" possibilities, and Leeward interprets them, altering his next strike. It enables tactics and is present in the closure paragraph ("the world leaned in to listen"). However, the concept does not impose a visible constraint or trade-off; it functions more as thematic flavor than a pressure that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cloud interpretation is signaled early ("to Leeward, they were the sketch of a song") and used in multiple beats (cirrus tendrils, geometric precision, hand-then-fist shape, spiral, shards of light). The trait enables his method and guides his strikes. However, no on-page cost or trade-off arises from this ability; it remains a perceptual gift without friction. Setup, development, and payoff present but no constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Dub" is mentioned once in paragraph 4 ("to dub [the storm]—to take resistance…and turn it into rhythm") as a restatement of his motivation. The concept does not drive a distinct beat or appear in the closure. The action of striking instruments recurs, but "dubbing" as a specific technique or turn is not dramatized. Present as theme, not as causal action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fractal" appears three times (paragraph 1 "fractal tendrils," paragraph 6 "fractals within fractals," paragraph 9 "clouds fractured"). The method—cloud patterns respond to sound in self-similar, nested forms—is signaled early and shapes multiple beats. Leeward adjusts his strikes based on the fractal response. However, the mechanics remain abstract; no concrete constraint (e.g., symmetry requirement, recursion limit) alters his choices. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard is introduced in paragraph 1 and remains the spatial anchor throughout. Its components (driftwood circle, pear tree roots, iron pot, coconut husk, seashells, central log) supply the instruments Leeward strikes. The tide lapping and orchard tilting force him to adjust his stance ("didn't fight the sway; instead, he leaned into it"), directly shaping tactics. Present in setup, development, and closure ("the orchard would sink or soar"). Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The blue hour is named in the title and paragraph 1 ("the world held its breath between dusk and dark") and revisited in paragraph 7 ("the blue hour's gift") and the final line ("The blue hour deepened"). It provides atmospheric pressure (liminal time when "the world…willing to be reshaped") but does not impose a live clock or tighten decisions. No countdown or cost tied to the hour's end. Early signal and closure reprise; weak causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to turn obstacles into instruments"—is stated in paragraph 4 and restated in the closure paragraph ("Obstacle had become instrument"). It frames Leeward's method across all beats. However, it is never tested by friction or competing desire; he pursues it without doubt or trade-off. The sea's cooperation confirms rather than complicates the goal. Told and illustrated, not dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" is embodied in the diction (rolling, chiming, vibrating language), the protagonist's restlessness ("hummed in Leeward's bones"), and the final laugh described as "rolling thunder of euphony." Tone modulates from tentative exploration to exhilaration. However, the euphony is asserted at closure rather than earned through friction, and the restlessness is resolved tidily into "thrill" without ambiguity. Coherent but trends toward single static mood (wonder) without charge from conflict.</comment>
