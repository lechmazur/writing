<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion in the star imprint moment and the final gesture of releasing the punch. The shift from ferry guide to vigil-keeper is earned through prior causality, with visible cost (forfeiting her role, releasing the tool). Internal contradiction appears in "I never left" versus the acknowledgment that she left every time she punched a ticket. Minor deduction: the other vigil-keepers remain underdeveloped, serving primarily as chorus rather than applying immediate pressure, though the woman with braids does offer one meaningful exchange.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Liora, the ridgeway, after her final crossing) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The accumulative/textural lens holds: density increases through layered images (ticket punch, vigil fires, star imprint) and the closure lands as Earned Stasis—Liora chooses to stay, forfeiting the crossing role with visible cost (releasing the punch into the shallows). One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the star into her palm, recognizing "the unused courage had been here all along, not in the crossing, but in the pause before it." The cost is legible on the page: she releases the tool that defined her identity, sits among the former guides, and accepts a new station.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ridgeway as threshold space is vivid and purposeful: "the land hesitated before becoming water," the path "twisted like a held breath," and the vigil fires create spatial anchors. The ticket punch functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice when she releases it into the shallows, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Liora's priorities (cold brass, damp sand, salt air). Minor gap: the mist and twilight, while evocative, remain somewhat ornamental in the middle third without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to continue crossing or to stay—is signaled early and tightens when Liora kneels by the fire and asks "What do you do when the courage you needed was for staying, not going?" One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the punch into her palm, narrowing her options. Agency is clear in the final act: she releases the punch, forfeiting her crossing role with visible cost. The escalation operates under an accumulative lens, building through layered images rather than reversals. Minor deduction: the woman's guidance feels slightly too convenient, reducing friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and choice: the unused courage of pausing, the vigil as alternative to crossing, the tension between propulsion and stillness. The final image—releasing the punch, sitting by the fire—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (the star imprint, the punch's arc into water) and in silence (the others watching with "quiet approval"). The piece resists tidy resolution: "some things are meant to remain unticketed" arrives as earned wisdom from concrete experience. One slip: "the most important crossings are the ones you don't make" edges toward thematic summary in the final movement, though it's integrated enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Liora's perceptual signature: her way of noticing is shaped by years of guiding (the "metronome" lantern, the ticket-punch mechanics). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("the leash of duty had finally snapped," "the shoreline's lullaby"). Brief dialogue feels natural and carries subtext. Deductions: the woman's line "You've come back" / "I never left" exchange, while thematically resonant, carries slight artificiality in its symmetry. The final paragraph accumulates stock phrases ("held note," "quiet certainty," "let the twilight hold her") that blur into generic lyricism under emotional weight, reducing immediacy in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening third. Clear propulsion through the middle with purposeful sentence variation. Major deductions: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("She had left every time she'd turned her boat toward the far shore, every time she'd punched a ticket and sent someone onward" restates the same content without added pressure). Template cadence in the final paragraph: "The fire crackled. The water sighed. Liora closed her eyes..." stacks short declaratives in a way that feels mechanical. Stock metaphors cluster in the ending ("held note," "quiet certainty," "let the twilight hold her"), dulling the closure image. These artifacts touch the final third, triggering the disallowance of 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—ferry guide choosing to stay rather than cross—offers a fresh angle on threshold and duty. The ticket punch as physical anchor and the vigil-keeper community avoid generic abstraction. The turn feels earned in hindsight: the star imprint and the release of the tool grow from prior particulars. Deductions: the "unused courage waits in stillness" frame echoes common contemplative-fiction templates (the weary guide finds peace by stopping). The emotional arc could work with different names and setting (the transformation test), suggesting the freshness relies more on lyric texture than on irreplaceable narrative particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Wise ferry guides appear in Liora (the protagonist) and the woman with silver braids. Setup: "the old ferry guide's words" in paragraph three and Liora's history signal the archetype early. Development: the woman's line "You wait where the light is thinnest" reframes Liora's question, enabling the palm-press insight. Payoff: "ferry guides she'd known" appear at closure, their empty hands marking the shift. Causal pressure is moderate: the guides model the choice but do not narrow options sharply. The woman's guidance feels slightly oracular rather than dramatized friction. Two-gate minimum met (setup, payoff); middle development is present but light.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ticket punch with star stamp appears in beat one (found in sand, "star-shaped stamp still sharp"), beat two (Liora holds it on the ridgeway, recalls its promise), beat three (she presses it into her palm, leaving a star imprint), and beat four (she releases it into the shallows, the star catching light). Setup, development, and payoff all present. The object constrains the final choice: releasing it marks forfeiture of her crossing role. The star's meaning reweights from "This crossing counts" to recognition of unused courage. Causal pressure is clear. Minor cap: while the object drives multiple beats, the mechanics (punching tickets, the star's teeth) do not alter tactics mid-scene as sharply as the rubric's highest band expects.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>A vigil in twilight shapes the setting and stakes from the opening ("the veiled ridgeway, where the land hesitated") through closure ("there was only the vigil, the ridgeway's veil"). Setup is immediate. Development: the vigil fires and the woman's "You wait where the light is thinnest" frame Liora's choice. Payoff: "for now, there was only the vigil" and "some things are meant to remain unticketed" close the arc. The concept shapes stakes (stay or cross, attend or depart) but operates more as thematic frame than tactical constraint—Liora's movements are not dictated by vigil mechanics. Two strong gates (setup, payoff); middle is present but light on causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" appears as descriptor for the water ("the water lapped at the ridge's edge like a gently persistent question") and implicitly in the woman's presence and Liora's own endurance. Setup is mid-story (paragraph nine), missing early signal. Development: the attribute colors tone and Liora's internal shift but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Payoff: the "shoreline's lullaby" and "quiet certainty" echo the trait at closure. The attribute is present and tonally consistent but functions as label and mood rather than enabling or constraining a choice. Gates: missing setup; development and payoff are present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears in "She traversed it now, her boots sinking into the damp earth" (paragraph six). Setup is delayed to the second third. Development: the traversal brings Liora to the vigil fires and the conversation that reframes her question. Payoff: sitting by the fire at closure completes the movement. The action is functional—it moves Liora from isolation to community—but is easily swappable with "walked," "crossed," or "approached" without structural loss. Causal role is present but not irreplaceable. Gates: missing early setup; development and payoff present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is signaled in "a place of indirect routes, where the path twisted like a held breath" (paragraph six). Setup occurs mid-story. Development: the indirection is described but does not shape Liora's attempts or create obstacles. Payoff: the vigil itself is an indirect form of crossing, and "deeper into the pause" at closure echoes the method thematically. The method colors tone and world but does not mechanically alter tactics. Gates: missing early setup; development is ornamental; payoff is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway is anchored in the opening ("the veiled ridgeway, where the land hesitated before becoming water") and recurs throughout ("the ridgeway hummed," "the ridgeway's veil"). Setup is immediate. Development: the threshold geography pressures Liora's choice—she stands at the edge where "neither land nor sea willing to claim it," and the spatial liminality mirrors her internal question. Payoff: "the ridgeway's veil, and the quiet certainty" closes the arc. The setting does not supply resources or block moves as sharply as the rubric's high band expects, but it does constrain the final image and charge the closure. All three gates met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" timeframe is signaled in "after the leash of duty had finally snapped" (paragraph five). Setup is present early. Development: the freedom following the break allows Liora to stand alone and question, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—there is no clock or deadline. Payoff: "Dawn would find her here, if it came at all" at closure acknowledges the open time. The timeframe frames the situation but does not escalate pressure or alter tactics. Gates: setup and payoff present; middle development is weak on urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits" is dramatized in Liora's question "What do you do when the courage you needed was for staying, not going?" and the realization "the unused courage had been here all along, not in the crossing, but in the pause before it." Setup: her internal conflict is present from the opening. Development: the palm-press moment and the conversation force the question into choice. Payoff: releasing the punch and sitting by the fire enact the answer. The motivation is embodied in choices with visible cost (forfeiting the crossing role). Friction between want (to guide) and the deeper need (to stay) is clear. All three gates met; causal pressure is solid.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" tone is established in "the shoreline's lullaby of creaking wood and distant waves" (paragraph twelve) and recurs at closure ("The shoreline's lullaby wrapped around her"). Setup is mid-story. The tone is coherent through turns—soft, meditative, elegiac—and modulates with pressure (the kneeling question feels more urgent, the final sitting more resolved). Payoff: the lullaby "wrapped around her" and the closing lines "The fire crackled. The water sighed." charge the final image. The tone supports closure and reweights prior material. Gates: missing early setup; development and payoff strong. Deduction: late first signal and some reliance on stock soothing phrases ("quiet certainty," "let the twilight hold her") in the ending.</comment>
