<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to trace "honest origins" and "lies woven into margins" is established and drives his choice to pursue the stamp's coordinates. His tranquil perception is embodied through deliberate movements and "steady pulse," though it occasionally trends toward label ("tranquilly perceptive"). The discovery scene shows internal contradiction—his claim that curiosity isn't his motivation rings false given his immediate pursuit—but the final choice to leave the chamber and return to work carries visible cost in foreclosed knowledge. Minor deduction: the character's professional competence faces no genuine blind spot or mistake that compounds before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (Elias, sunken library, blackout). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: stillness → discovery → book with his name → choice to leave and continue work. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias returns to indexing with knowledge of surveillance/predestination but chooses not to share, foreclosing the path of revelation. The cost is legible in "some stillness wasn't meant to be shared" and his continued solitary work. One meaningful deepening occurs when he finds his own name recorded, reweighting his quest for honest origins into a confrontation with being observed or predetermined.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly rendered through "dappled silence of filtered seawater," water "lapping at his knees," and the pressure lock mechanism. The blackout functions as both atmosphere and constraint—it gives Elias time before "surface teams would restore power." The stamp (object-as-setting) drives his movement through space: adjusting lamp angle reveals coordinates, leading him to the sealed chamber. The final image of him at his worktable with "the stamp's impression still fresh in his memory" charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is established early: Elias seeks to trace honest origins and expose historical erasures. The stamp's coordinates create one meaningful tightening—he must act during the blackout window before noise returns. The discovery of his own name in the ledger is a reversal that narrows options: continue the quest or accept surveillance and return to work. He chooses the latter, a renunciation with visible cost (leaves the book, keeps working in silence). The blackout clock provides pressure but the three-day jump dilutes immediacy. Agency is present but the resolution leans more toward acceptance than a high-cost trade-off that redefines his situation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of control, surveillance, and chosen stillness emerges through concrete particulars: the stamp as "trail," the book containing his future decisions, his choice to leave it undisturbed. "Reclaimed stillness—not as an absence, but as a choice" is stated but earned by his return to indexing with new knowledge. The final image—"Some stillness wasn't meant to be shared. Some origins were honest only in the dark"—reweights the opening's "preferred it that way" without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution; Elias accepts being watched and continues his work, a complex stance. Minor penalty: "tranquilly perceptive enough to listen" in the penultimate beat trends toward theme statement rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: "his fingers brushing over the parchment like a blind man reading braille," the lamp's glow "pooling" and "raking." Voice is distinct and controlled, with purposeful elevated diction ("dappled," "tranquilly") that fits an indexer's sensibility. Distance modulates appropriately during discovery beats. Deductions: phrases like "tranquilly perceptive as always" and "methodical...precise" trend toward summary labels rather than embodied demonstration. The phrase "the truth wasn't lost. It had only been waiting" in the resolution section slips into abstract declaration. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; opening lines establish voice and stakes. Information density is high in the discovery sequence. However, several loops and scaffolds reduce momentum: "The blackout had" opens two paragraphs; "His motivation wasn't curiosity; it was deeper" is a hedge that the next line contradicts; "exhaled, the sound lost in the vast quiet" is functionally repeated by "leaving the chamber as he'd found it—undisturbed, but no longer silent." The phrase "His hands didn't tremble" is unnecessary self-commentary. Stock metaphor: "like a talisman." Template cadence in the final third: multiple "They called him" / "And he never told them" / "Some stillness" constructions create a mechanical rhythm. These artifacts appear in the closure section, lowering the score and disqualifying 9+ globally per the rubric.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—pre-recorded ledger of one's future decisions in a submerged archive—offers a fresh angle on determinism and surveillance. The combination of underwater setting, blackout timeframe, and indexer profession is specific. Transformation test concern: the emotional arc (discovering one is watched/predetermined, choosing quiet endurance) could transfer to different particulars without major rework. The stamp-to-coordinates-to-hidden-chamber sequence follows a familiar treasure-hunt structure. The story commits to its premise and follows through, but the closure choice (return to work, keep the secret) opts for the safety middle rather than a bold, high-cost stance that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias, the logical page indexer, is present throughout and his profession enables key beats: recognizing the Old Archives insignia, cross-referencing numbers with the map, working the pressure lock. His indexing skill drives the discovery sequence. The final choice to return to indexing and "never tell them" is shaped by his character. Present in closure (indexing with new knowledge). Costs: appeared early (setup ✓), shapes middle investigation (development ✓), and returns at closure with reweighted meaning (payoff ✓). Deduction: his logical, methodical approach faces no visible constraint or cost—it only enables. The trait could be swapped for "archivist" or "researcher" with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp appears in beat 1 (discovery on tome), beat 2 (lamp readjustment reveals coordinates), pocket carry during the journey, and beat 3 (slipped into the volume's final page as "promise or warning"). It enables the plot: coordinates lead to the chamber. The final placement charges closure—he leaves evidence of his visit. The stamp is handled and reweighted across three functional beats. Costs: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor deduction: the stamp itself has no unique irreplaceable property; any marked object with hidden coordinates would serve the same function, limiting specificity credit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is named early and repeated: "finally found the stillness he'd been chasing," "possibility of reclaimed stillness—not as an absence, but as a choice," and "Some stillness wasn't meant to be shared." It shapes his final decision to keep the secret and continue solitary work. However, the concept functions more as theme than as a constraint that narrows options under pressure. The blackout provides stillness, but Elias's choice is to preserve secrecy, not stillness per se. Present in setup and payoff, weak in middle development. The lyric reprise reweights the stake but the concept remains abstract rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears as label in beat 1 ("tranquilly perceptive as always") and is demonstrated through careful observation (lamp angle adjustment, cross-referencing). It enables discovery but does not constrain—there is no moment where his tranquility costs him urgency or causes him to miss a time-sensitive window. The trait is present and logically consistent but does not create visible friction or trade-off. Setup ✓, weak development (enables without cost), absent from closure action. Swappable with "observant" or "meticulous." Ornamental beyond functional enabling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Readjust" occurs in beat 1 (lamp adjustment reveals coordinates) and implicitly in his final return to work ("readjusting" to routine with new knowledge). The lamp readjustment is the inciting discovery that triggers the journey. The action is specific and causal. However, it could be replaced with "examined closely" or "tilted the page" without major structural change. Setup ✓, development (triggers quest) ✓, payoff (thematic echo in returning to methodical work) ✓. The three-gate test is satisfied and the action drives one major turn, but it is not indispensable—other scrutiny actions would yield the same coordinates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is signaled in beat 2: "what if the Old Archives weren't destroyed in the flood, but hidden?" This hypothesis motivates his search and is confirmed when he finds the intact chamber. The method is specific to his indexer mindset and shapes his tactics (cross-reference, test the hypothesis by seeking the unmarked chamber). Setup ✓, development ✓, payoff (hypothesis confirmed) ✓. Deduction: the method is present and functional but the mechanics of hypothesis-testing are not stressed under pressure—he simply follows the coordinates without testing alternate explanations or facing a wrong turn. The concept is more plot device than method that shapes multiple attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The "forgotten library inside a sunken city" is established in the opening and pressures every choice: water lapping at his knees, ocean pressing the dome, the sealed pressure lock, rusted shelves, and the time limit before surface teams restore power. The setting provides the discovery (hidden chamber), creates physical obstacle (water, sealed door), and supplies the "dappled silence" tone. The blackout's effect on the sunken library (cutting power, granting time) is integral. Present in setup, middle obstacles, and closure image (returning through water to his worktable). The setting is causally indispensable—remove it and the story collapses. High irreplaceability and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blackout timeframe is signaled early ("blackout had swallowed the city") and creates urgency: "given him time, but not forever. Surface teams would restore power soon." It motivates his immediate pursuit of the chamber. The ending notes "The blackout ended three days later," confirming the window closed. However, the three-day span is vague—no live clock tracks hours or creates escalating pressure within scenes. Setup ✓, development (enables quiet and urgency) ✓, payoff (lights return, noise resumes) ✓. The timeframe shapes the quest but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat. It functions more as setup condition than active constraint during peak moments.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is Elias's stated motivation in beat 1 ("spent years tracing honest origins, not of books, but of the lies woven into their margins"). This desire drives his pursuit of the stamp's clue and his choice to open the sealed chamber. The discovery of his own name in the ledger creates friction—his quest for truth confronts the fact that he himself is recorded, possibly predetermined. He chooses to return to indexing rather than expose or flee, a renunciation with visible cost. Setup ✓, development (drives middle quest) ✓, payoff (tested and redefined at closure) ✓. Strong causal linkage and closure charge. The motivation is dramatized through choices, not merely told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is embodied through "dappled silence of filtered seawater," Elias's steady breath and deliberate movements, and his calm choice to leave the chamber and return to work. The tone modulates appropriately: calm observation → curiosity → discovery shock → resolve. The final image ("his mind clear, the stamp's impression still fresh") reinforces quiet determination. However, "dappled" leans decorative—its meaning (mottled light through water) does not clearly charge the emotional tenor of his resolve. The tone is coherent and purposeful but the specific diction "dappled resolve" is more ornamental than indispensable. Present in setup and payoff, weak mechanical linkage at peak beats. Lyric reprise without full conceptual reweighting.</comment>
