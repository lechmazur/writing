<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's resourcefulness is demonstrated through concrete actions (key in boot, decoding puddles, stolen ledger), and her renunciation of direct heroism feels character-consistent. Internal experience diverges credibly from external presentation ("harmless archivist"). However, the final-act choices feel somewhat inevitable rather than forced by contradictory impulses; the stakes crystallize but don't truly compel a difficult trade-off with visible psychological cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lena walks away from the booth, the fight repositioned to "the cracks," with the stolen ledger representing visible cost and the final image ("She didn't answer this time. / But she listened") reconfiguring her stance from reactive to patient architect. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (key, booth, puddles, names) that converge at closure. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (Lena, lagoon, tonight). One meaningful deepening occurs when the booth reveals the archive location, narrowing her options and raising cost. The mosaic structure (lagoon night → morning broadcast → diner → years later) teaches its pattern early and maintains coherent pressure to the final static-listening beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The auric lagoon constrains the inciting encounter (booth appears only there, only at dusk), and the booth itself—glass panes, dangling receiver, flickering walls—becomes a charged micro-setting that houses the key turning point. The puddle-reflection method anchors setting to choice. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("ozone," "liquid memory," "silt"). Spatial choreography remains clear across four time shards. The key in Lena's pocket at closure and the booth reappearing under stars charge the final image with prior environmental particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve erased histories against Council revision) is signaled early and tightens when Rook's voice announces the archive will burn tomorrow, narrowing Lena's window and forcing the match-and-ledger infiltration. That tightening is protagonist-driven and forecloses her safer archivist identity with on-page cost (quits, becomes fugitive). The resolution avoids convenience; her theft seeds the Quiet Rebellion. However, the escalation path is straightforward—one major turn rather than compounding reversals—and the felt price, while present, could be sharper in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme ("the fight isn't in the streets. / It was in the cracks") emerges from concrete particulars: key, puddles, static, the ledger's absence from ashes. The final image (phone ringing, Lena listening but not answering) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the tyranny-of-indifference question without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence (the booth's "broken promise" receiver, the stars winking). The closing meta-commentary ("historians would call it the Quiet Rebellion") risks telling what the prior images have shown, and "indifference was the real tyrant, and she was done kneeling" edges toward direct statement, but the surrounding concreteness and the CR-type closure sustain thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable across four time shards with clean section breaks and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific (archivist's eye for scraps, receipts, "the puddles' language"). Diction remains consistent—elevated but not academic, lyric but grounded. Rook's dialogue via water-static carries distinct cadence. However, some late-story lines ("The fight wasn't in the streets. / It was in the cracks") inch toward thesis-voice rather than Lena's embodied thought, and the final shard's reflective summary ("historians would call it") shifts to a more omniscient register, creating minor distance drift at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic texture. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., "key warm in her pocket" = prop continuity + emotional charge). Clarity and concision are strong in the lagoon and archive beats. Minor scaffold appears in the reflective codas: "No one mentioned… No one ever looked… No one saw" is a template-cadence run, and "Somewhere, a phone was ringing. / She answered. […] Somewhere, a phone was ringing. / She didn't answer this time" is a purposeful loop that charges the ending but risks proximity to paraphrase. The final shard's summary-like quality ("Years later, historians would call it") lowers immediacy slightly, though it serves thematic closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The phone-booth-as-archive and puddle-map premise offers a fresh synthesis of memory-resistance tropes. The underestimated-archivist angle and the quiet, distributed rebellion avoid stock hero templates. Emotional specificity (Lena's patience, her refusal to answer the second call) personalizes the arc. However, the Council-erasing-histories and lone-rebel-preserves-truth frame is widely familiar, and the story does not deeply transform it through unexpected moral calculus or lived contradiction; Lena's rightness is never in doubt, and the resolution (stolen ledger, started rebellion) follows a predictable activist template. The lyric four-shard structure and the booth's mechanics add ingenuity but not sufficient risk to elevate into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena (underestimated rebel) drives three key beats: waiting for the booth to reappear (setup), turning the key to receive Rook's message and the archive location (middle choice that narrows options), and infiltrating the archive with match and ledger (closure action that seeds the Quiet Rebellion). Her decisions alter tactics and outcome. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, and closure linkage present. The "harmless archivist" label is dramatized through action rather than stated only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears in boot (setup), is inserted to activate the booth and reveal names/location (middle beat), is turned again to vanish the booth (post-climax), and is left in the door in the final shard (charged closure reprise). Four distinct beats with evolving function. Causal pressure: without the key, Lena cannot access the booth's archive intel. Closure linkage: "She'd left it in the door" reweights the object from personal tool to legacy for the next rebel. Irreplaceable—no generic key would carry the defunct-company specificity or the seed-for-succession resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Revised histories (Core Concept) frames the dominant stake: the Council rewrites archives, scrubbing names, which motivates Lena's decade of collection and the climactic archive infiltration. It shapes tactics (she must act before the final burning) and closure (the stolen ledger preserves what the Council tried to erase, seeding the Quiet Rebellion). However, the concept is more backdrop than live constraint on the page—Lena's methods (booth, puddles, key) are magical-realist, not directly wrestling with historiographic process. The concept is signaled early, involved in escalation, and present at closure, but its mechanics don't narrow options in a beat-by-beat way; it's a thematic anchor rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Carefully resourceful (Attribute) is demonstrated through visible actions: Lena kept the key in her boot for three years, spent a decade collecting scraps (receipts, confessions), decoded the puddles' language, and stole the ledger. These choices enable her success and cost her safety (quits job, becomes fugitive). The trait is not label-only; it's embodied in patient preparation and opportunistic theft. Early signal via "decade collecting scraps," middle beat (decoding puddles, timing the booth's appearance), and closure (stolen ledger, left key for next rebel). One small friction: the trait could be slightly more specific—what trade-off did resourcefulness force her to make that another approach would have avoided?</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reappear (Action) is the story's hinge: the booth reappears at the lagoon, enabling Lena to access Rook's message and the archive's location. Without this event, Lena has no actionable intel and the climax cannot occur. The action recurs with reweighted meaning: the booth reappears after Lena turns the key again (vanishing it), and in the final shard it reappears "under the stars, waiting for the next person," charging the closure with continuity and legacy. Early signal ("waiting for the night the phone booth would reappear"), middle causal beat (booth materializes, Rook speaks, date/location revealed), and closure reprise. The action is not easily swappable—"arrive" or "activate" would not carry the same sense of cyclical, patient resistance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Puddle reflections at dusk (Method) are signaled early ("The puddles at dusk had shown her the way: a map of fractured reflections, revealing the booth's location only when the sky bled violet and the air smelled of ozone") and enable Lena's timing and positioning. Middle involvement: "I had to wait for the reflections to align." Closure: "The reflections had shown her the way once. / They'd show her again." However, the method is more atmospheric setup than live tactical constraint—we never see Lena actively reading or decoding a puddle on the page in real time; it's recounted. The mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized, and the method doesn't visibly narrow or enable a choice in a beat. Present across three moments but largely ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Auric lagoon under starlight (Setting) is the location where the booth can appear, thus constraining when and where Lena can act (setup and middle beat). The lagoon's water carries Rook's voice, and the final image ("the booth would still be there, under the stars") charges closure with continuity. Sensory detail ("water shimmered with trapped starlight," "surface rippling like liquid memory") is vivid and voice-filtered. However, the lagoon is more stage than active pressure—it doesn't supply resources or impose tactical limits beyond "booth appears here." It shapes mood and frames the encounter but doesn't alter Lena's moves within the scene. Early signal, middle use, closure reprise; functional but not indispensable to the story's internal logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>When plans unravel (Timeframe) is signaled in the opening ("Tonight, her plans had unraveled—again") and tightened when Rook announces "They're moving the last archive tomorrow," creating a live deadline that forces Lena to act immediately (infiltrate by dawn). The timeframe compresses her options and charges the resolution. However, "unraveled" is vague—what specific plan failed tonight is not shown on the page, and the element reads more as mood-setter than a tracked clock. The "tomorrow" deadline does create urgency in the middle beat and pushes Lena into the archive raid, so it has causal weight. Present in setup, middle escalation, and implied at closure (dawn arrives, fire announced). Functional but not maximally specific.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hold the line against the tyranny of indifference (Motivation) is dramatized through Lena's decade of scrap-collection, her waiting with the key, and her final refusal to answer the ringing phone ("But she listened"). The desire is in tension with safety (she quits, becomes fugitive) and with heroic identity (she's "not a fighter," "not a hero"). The motivation shapes the climactic choice (infiltrate archive, steal ledger) and the closure stance (patient, distributed resistance rather than spectacle). Early signal via "holding the line" and "indifference was the real tyrant," middle pressure (Rook's message, archive burning), closure (listening without answering, leaving the key). One friction: "indifference was the real tyrant, and she was done kneeling" is told rather than fully embodied in a conflicted beat, and the motivation is never truly tested by a choice that would force her to abandon it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Coded freedom (Tone) coheres through imagery of hidden channels (puddles, phone booth, static) and patient, oblique resistance. The tone modulates: lyric and mysterious at the lagoon, terse and urgent with Rook's message, wry and quiet in the diner, elegiac in the final shard. It charges the closure—Lena's listening without answering and the booth waiting for the next rebel evoke freedom as distributed, encoded, patient rather than declarative. However, some late lines ("The fight wasn't in the streets. / It was in the cracks") edge toward overt rather than coded, and the historians' shard shifts into a more distant, summarizing register that loosens the coded texture. The tone is purposeful and mostly consistent, but the final third's reflective mode dilutes the oblique charge slightly.</comment>
