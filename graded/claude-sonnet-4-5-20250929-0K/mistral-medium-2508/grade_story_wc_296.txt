<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eldrin's motivation is clear and grounded in personal loss, driving his choice to plant the seed. The interiority carries a consistent dark/searching quality ("wasn't mercy...to see what the lake's mirror refused to show"), and his final choice to pocket the key and walk away is earned by the revealed truth. However, the brother's transformation from boy to beast and the confession that he "jumped" arrive without enough embodied emotional cost on Eldrin's part—his reaction is too controlled, too philosophically distanced ("the weight of knowing pressing him flatter") rather than contradictory or viscerally raw.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered images (wound-lake, orchard-remembering, vines-digesting-truth) that culminate in a resonant reconfiguration when Eldrin pockets the key and walks away, a Charged Poise moment where silence wins with felt cost. The before/after is legible: he sought his brother and found a truth too heavy to pursue further. One meaningful deepening occurs when the plant devours the confession and rewrites Eldrin's understanding. Minor cost-proof issue: the "weight of knowing" is asserted more than shown in a concrete on-page consequence that alters his next move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The swirling lake, orchard with whispering fruit, and the seed's thorned husk are vivid and purposeful. The orchard "remembering" and the plant's maw opening with needle-teeth constrain Eldrin's tactics and charge the final image of him walking into the trees while the lake hums behind. Spatial choreography is coherent (shore→soil→vortex→ridge). The key, warm and rusted, is a strong tactile anchor that charges his departure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering what took his brother—is signaled early and tightens when the plant reveals the brother jumped rather than being taken. That reversal forecloses Eldrin's prior narrative and forces the choice to walk away, a visible renunciation with cost ("some confessions were better left frozen"). The lake's answer and the plant's digestion of truth drive escalation under the accumulative lens. Cost is felt in his refusal to look back and his acceptance of silence, though the physical price (pocketing the key, walking) could be heavier.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the lake keeps choices, not just souls; some truths are better frozen; finding isn't always healing. The final image—Eldrin walking with the warm key, the lake humming behind him—resonates without stating a moral. The orchard's whispers, the plant's hunger, and the key's warmth recur with shifted meaning. Minor slip: "(Even if silence, like the lake, was just another kind of hunger.)" edges toward abstract philosophizing rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Eldrin; perceptual signature is consistent (dark, tactical, weary). Distance control is strong, and the prose rhythm modulates under pressure (short beats when the plant strikes, longer reflective turns at the end). The italicized lake voice (*"You found me"*) and the brother-beast's dialogue feel distinct. However, the parenthetical asides in the final third—"(And if the water began to swirl...)" and "(He pretended not to hear.)"—read as authorial commentary rather than Eldrin's interior voice, creating brief distance slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and figurative language is vivid ("its vines lashing like whips, splitting the air with a sound like tearing silk"). However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops and template cadence: "Some things, once found, couldn't be lost again. / Others shouldn't be." and "Some things didn't need to be found to be known. / Some things were better lost forever." are conceptual redundancies that dull momentum. The repeated "The [X] [verb]" openings ("The key burned...The first snowflake landed...The next missing thing...") create a drumbeat pattern without payoff. These artifacts touch the closure zone, warranting deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of finder-protagonist, flesh-eating truth-plant, and lake-as-keeper-of-choices is fresh and coherent. The reversal that the brother jumped rather than being taken transforms the familiar "rescue the lost" premise into a meditation on agency and the cost of knowing. The warlock's failed trick reframed as an attempt to break the curse adds a non-obvious layer. The final image—key warm, snow falling, lake humming—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Eldrin is present throughout and makes key choices: planting the seed, confronting the brother-figure, pocketing the key, walking away. His guardedness is shown in his controlled reactions and the lie ("I didn't come for you"). However, "guarded" as a trait is more asserted through narrative summary ("he never spoke of how the things he found often wished to stay hidden") than dramatized through visible cost or a moment where his guardedness nearly breaks.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seed appears in beat one (pulsing in his palm), is planted in beat two (where water's pull is strongest), and erupts in beat three (vines striking, maw digesting the confession). Its hunger and thorned husk are specific, and its function—devouring the truth—drives the reversal and reweights Eldrin's understanding. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor swappability: another truth-extraction device could serve with edits, preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Frozen confession" is seeded early ("to turn its howling into glass," "some truths were better left frozen") and returns at the end ("some confessions were better left frozen"). The lake holding confessions shapes the premise and the plant's digestion of that frozen truth drives the reversal. However, "frozen" reads more as metaphor than a constraint that alters tactics on the page—Eldrin doesn't navigate literal ice or cold-locked information; the concept operates at thematic level rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Finds lost things" is stated early and frames Eldrin's role, but it functions more as backstory label than on-page constraint. He plants the seed and the truth emerges, but the finding itself—pulling the key from the water—is a single brief beat without visible cost or tradeoff tied to the skill. The trait could be swapped for "seeks answers" with minor edits. Present and functional, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unbend" appears late (final third: "he had long since mastered the art of not bending—until now" and "finally unbent, the weight of knowing pressing him flatter"). It is named rather than enacted through a physical or tactical shift. The action does not drive a key turn; Eldrin's choice to walk away is the decisive move, and "unbend" reads as retrospective metaphor rather than a plot-driving act. Mid-band at best due to late arrival and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Expanding circles" is seeded once ("where the swirls formed perfect, expanding circles like ripples from a stone no one had thrown") and implied in the vortex imagery, but the method does not shape Eldrin's tactics or attempts. The plant's vines lash outward in one beat, but "circles" as a mechanic is static description rather than a repeated, evolving means. Functional mention, but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The swirling lake vortex and orchard are present from the opening, apply immediate pressure (villagers vanish, orchard remembers, vines lash), and the lake's answer rising from the depths drives the central reversal. Eldrin plants the seed "where the water's pull was strongest," using the setting's mechanics. The lake's hum at the end charges his departure. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" is the temporal anchor and frames the entire story—Eldrin acts in response to the warlock's failure, which caused the vortex to laugh instead of freezing. The realization that the trick was meant to break the curse, not freeze it, reweights the premise. However, the timeframe is a static past condition rather than a ticking clock that tightens decisions on the page. Strong setup and thematic payoff, but not a live escalator.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Eldrin's desire "to see what the lake's mirror refused to show—the face of the thing that had taken his brother" is dramatized through his choice to plant the seed and confront the brother-figure. The friction between wanting the truth and the cost of knowing drives the final renunciation. The motivation is contested by the reveal that the brother jumped, forcing Eldrin to walk away. Strong causal role and closure participation, though the friction could be more embodied in contradictory impulses during the confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is evoked through Eldrin's controlled, tactical interiority ("War demanded stillness...he had long since mastered the art of not bending") and the juxtaposition of violent imagery (vines like whips, needle-teeth) with his calm execution and quiet departure. Tone modulates under pressure—short beats during the plant's strike, longer reflective turns at the end—and charges the final image of silent walking. However, the oxymoron is more asserted than felt throughout; the prose leans more toward dark musing than martial stillness.</comment>
