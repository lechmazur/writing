<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The child's motivation ("to collect the flavors of different silences") is vivid and consistently embodied through tactile, synesthetic detail. Interior contradiction shows in the pull between safety and expansion, father's fear versus the child's hunger. The final choice—sprouting into the trellis and collapsing the bunker—is earned by prior causality with visible cost (abandoning the father). The doll's voice and the gilded palm register as slightly convenient conduits rather than fully integrated internal struggle, keeping this out of the high 8s.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone. The piece teaches its pattern (inversion episodes, collected silences) early and returns with escalating density. Closure lands on the page with visible cost: the child climbs, the bunker collapses, the father is left behind. The three-inversion structure tightens options cleanly. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The doll's sudden urgency ("Now you choose") and the gilded palm's unexplained mechanics introduce minor causal convenience, preventing full high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bunker's "curved ribs," "rust" taste, and "coppery" silence anchor setting through POV-filtered detail. The xenial trellis—bone-white vines, warm lattice, hushed bloom—constrains the child's sprouting attempts and charges the final ascent. Spatial choreography (ceiling becomes pit, trellis above clouds) remains coherent across inversions. The trellis's changing texture (thickened, gilded) tracks causally. The bloom's core and the child's gilded palm directly enable the bunker's collapse, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: escape the bunker's "coffin" to sprout. Pressure escalates across three inversions: observation, climb, harvest. The third inversion introduces the bloom and gilded palm, which immediately unlock the bunker's collapse—effective tightening but slightly telescoped. The father's "They're coming" arrives too late to create friction; it declares urgency without on-page consequence. The child's final choice (pressing palm to wall, sprouting) is protagonist-driven with visible cost (father abandoned, bunker destroyed), but the rapid endgame keeps this shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the metaphor of silence as substance: collected, tasted, held, swallowed. The doll's voice ("You were never the lock. You were the door") reframes the child's role without stating a moral. The final act—biting the vine to taste "beginning"—answers the central question (confinement vs. expansion) through image and synesthetic charge. The bloom's "perfect, throbbing quiet" and the child's gilded palm integrate concept and consequence. Minor therapy-adjacent phrasing ("You are the hinge") slightly dilutes specificity but does not undercut the resonant close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited, anchored to the child's synesthetic perception ("cool, expanding, the way frost tastes before it burns"). Distance is stable; the doll's voice is clearly marked and external. Perceptual signature is strong: silence as flavor, gravity as "held breath," the trellis as underwater lattice. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the father's "stay down" and "They're coming" advance pressure. Some sentences lean on elevated register ("intangibly tangible," "throbbing quiet") that edges past the child's twelve-year voice under stress, preventing 8.5+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; figurative density is high ("silence...the flavor of a held note, the moment before a scream") but occasionally stacks without payoff. "Sprout" and "hush" recur purposefully. Clarity holds through complex action (inversion, sprouting, bloom harvest). Minor loops: "The child didn't know...but they learned" echoes template phrasing; "silence" reappears in adjacent beats without added pressure. The final image ("The silence that bloomed in their mouth was the taste of beginning") charges closure, but mid-story density and some filter verbs ("feeling the world tilt," "hearing the doll's voice") keep this in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The synesthetic collection of silences is fresh and consistently developed across escalating inversions. The xenial trellis and gravity-inversion frame are vivid rather than stock. The doll as key and voice, the gilded palm as literal door-opener—these feel organic to the premise. The "lock/door" reversal earns its place. The bunker-as-coffin and child-as-hinge metaphors risk familiar territory but are executed with specificity (rust taste, vine tendrils, bloom harvest). Risk-taking in structure (three inversion episodes, accumulative design) heightens without obscuring; this merits within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The child's choices drive all three inversion episodes: pressing fingertips to the grate, climbing the trellis, harvesting the bloom, collapsing the bunker. Early setup (twelve years buried), middle development (vine in hair, father's fear), and closure (palm to wall, final ascent) all hinge on the child's agency. Causal pressure and cost are clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The doll appears in the opening third, hums to enable sprouting (middle beat), speaks urgently at the third inversion, and delivers the final whisper at the trellis peak. It enables the method and charges closure. However, its mechanics (how holding it "just so" produces the hum, why it voices at specific moments) remain unexplained, reducing irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gilded hush appears as the bloom's "sheen that muted sound into texture" and the child's gilded palm that unfolds the bunker. It shapes the third-inversion turn and enables closure. Setup is implicit (collected silences), development is mid-story (bloom), and payoff is direct (palm action). The concept charges the final image but does not constrain earlier choices, limiting band entry.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" describes the tendrils that unfurl and anchor to the trellis during sprouting. It appears in two beats (second and third inversions) and enables the child's movement. The phrase itself is abstract; the tendrils' function (anchoring, lifting) matters more than the oxymoron. Causal work is present but the trait could be rephrased without loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sprouting is signaled at the first inversion ("if they dared—sprout"), enacted at the second (tendrils unfurl, child climbs), and drives closure (final ascent, trellis embrace). The method (doll hum, limited exposure) makes it specific. Removing sprouting would break the story's logic and final image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method—"three breaths in, two out," holding the doll "just so"—is introduced at the first inversion and used again at the second. It shapes the child's attempts and constrains exposure risk. However, by the third inversion the mechanics are not revisited; the bloom and gilded palm supersede the breath count. Middle development is clear but closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The xenial trellis is introduced at the first inversion, walked and touched at the second, and serves as the site of the bloom harvest and final ascent. Its warmth, pulse, and changing texture (vines thicken, edges gilded) constrain the child's moves. The trellis is indispensable to closure: the child climbs higher, bites a vine, and the final taste occurs there. Setup, development, and payoff all present with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gravity inversions occur three times, each lasting "an hour." The timeframe structures the story's beats and creates windows of opportunity. However, the hour is not tracked or dramatized within episodes; no on-page clock tightens decisions. The constraint is conceptual (limited access) rather than tactical (time running out mid-climb). Setup and development are clear; closure linkage is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Collecting silences is established early (bunker's coppery silence, doll's cool silence) and drives the child's repeated climbs. The third inversion's bloom contains "the shape of their mother's name," and the final vine-bite delivers "the taste of beginning." The motivation is embodied and conflicted (safety vs. expansion, father's fear vs. child's hunger). Visible cost at closure (bunker collapse, father abandoned) ties directly to this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone begins contracted (bunker as coffin, rust taste, shrank lungs) and stretches through each inversion (expansive frost-taste silence, underwater lattice, sky as "bruised, inverted dome"). The modulation is coherent and purposeful, heightening pressure. The final image—"the taste of beginning"—fully stretches the initial contraction. Rhythm and diction shift with each beat, charging closure without jarring.</comment>
