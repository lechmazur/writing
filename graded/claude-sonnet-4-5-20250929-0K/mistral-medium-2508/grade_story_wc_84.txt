<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's interior is specific and embodied—"perpetually surprised by how little others saw," "chest tightened," the drone as extension of agency—and her final turn (taking the pilgrim's hand) is earned by the shared constellation reveal. The pilgrim remains functional but thin; his "hunger" is told more than shown, and his lunge feels pro forma. Internal contradiction is present (Lena's need to decode belonging versus her solitary methods) but not stressed enough to elevate the choice at closure into high-band territory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through the drone descent, chip placement, constellation reveal, and final hand-clasp, with the "missing piece" motif threading throughout. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes shared witness and the cost of no longer being alone, reweighting Lena's solitary surveillance mode. One meaningful deepening occurs when the chip slots into the seam, transforming the observatory from puzzle to answer. Cost is felt (Lena stops being surprised, lets the pilgrim take her hand) but remains more emotional than tactical, preventing entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory at dusk is concretely rendered: "stone domes into silhouettes," "carved celestial maps," "brilliant dimness," and the oculus pierced by starlight. The drone's descent and the seam's revelation are spatially clear and constrain Lena's choices. The chip's placement in the newly exposed slot directly charges the closure image (constellation projection, shadows on ceiling). Micro-setting (chip, drone, carved maps) functions as setting and drives the final turn, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decoding the frequency of belonging through the chip and observatory. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lena's drone seizes the chip, forcing the pilgrim's lunge and the observatory's response. The resolution—chip placement, constellation reveal, hand-clasp—narrows options (Lena "stops being surprised," accepts connection). Cost is legible but soft: the emotional price of "no longer being alone in the dark" is felt, yet no tactical trade-off or forfeited path is visible on the page. Escalation under Accumulative lens is present but single-beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: missing pieces, the gap between solitary observation and shared witness, the shape of two people "finally seeing the same sky." The chip/constellation progression embodies the question without stating it. The ending offers a resonant answer—"the frequency wasn't a sound. It was a shape"—through image rather than moral. Minor deduction for "dazzling, terrible relief" leaning slightly toward label-speak, and "the stars did the talking" borders on theme summary, though both are anchored in the scene and do not flatten pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited on Lena is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (sharp-eyed, attuned to gaps). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("brilliant dimness," "indigo bruise of the sky"). Minor slips: "someone's uncle, maybe, or a scholar" reads as narrator commentary rather than Lena's speculation, blurring distance briefly. The pilgrim's dialogue ("That's not yours") and his "surprised laughter" are functional but generic; no distinct idiom separates his voice from Lena's interior texture. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and clean, but the brief omniscient aside about the pilgrim costs precision.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; imagery is vivid ("last sliver of sun bled," "indigo bruise of the sky"). However, paraphrase loops appear: "missing pieces weren't screaming" / "the missing piece" / "Some missing pieces weren't meant to be kept" cycles the motif without adding pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "She didn't tell him her name. / She didn't need to. / The stars did the talking. / And for the first time…" stacks parallel refusals that dull momentum. Figurative density is high without muddle, but the loops and template runs in the closure zone trigger artifact penalties and disallow 9+ globally per the rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drone-as-agent and the type foundry matrix chip as puzzle key are specific, and the "frequency as shape" turn is a non-obvious synthesis. However, the lonely-searchers-find-connection arc and the ancient-place-reveals-secret premise lean on familiar templates. The transformation is present—chip mechanics, star trails scratched into stone—but the emotional resolution (hand-clasp, shared sky) follows expected beats. The piece takes few structural risks and the thematic answer arrives without surprise, limiting originality to mid-band despite vivid execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena (sharp-eyed drone pilot) drives two key beats: descending to seize the chip and pulling the feed back to let the drone circle. Her observation shapes the entire arc (following star trails, identifying the chip, recognizing the pilgrim's hunger). Her final choice—taking the pilgrim's hand—alters her stance and forecloses solitary surveillance. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage; specific cost (stops being surprised, accepts connection).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The type foundry matrix chip appears early (in the pilgrim's satchel), drives the theft beat, and is placed in the newly exposed slot to trigger the constellation reveal. It is handled on-page in three distinct beats (sensor lock, claw extraction, deposition) and its symbolic surface ("etched with symbols that weren't quite language") recharges at closure when the projection unfolds. High irreplaceability; its specific form (foundry matrix) and the slot's fit make it indispensable. Visible cost: the chip's relinquishment by the pilgrim.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Missing pieces (core concept) frames Lena's perception early ("gaps in the world," "missing pieces weren't screaming"), shapes the chip's role as key, and returns in the closure reflection ("Some missing pieces weren't meant to be kept"). It alters tactics (Lena's search for the seam, the drone's extraction) and charges the final image. However, mid-story it functions more as thematic echo than tactical constraint. Two-of-three gates (setup, payoff) plus lyric reprise, but weaker middle development limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" is introduced early and returns at closure ("for the first time in a long time, Lena stopped being surprised"). However, it constrains no on-page action and incurs no visible cost; it is a perceptual label rather than a trait that alters tactics. The ending shift (from surprised to listening) is thematic reprise without dramatized friction. Setup and payoff present, but no middle choice driven by this attribute; ornamental use caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Pull" (action) appears in the key beat: "Her drone's claw extended, pulling the chip from the pilgrim's satchel before he could react" and "Lena pulled the feed back, letting the drone drift upward." The theft redefines options (opens the seam, triggers the constellation) and the feed-back pull marks her acceptance of connection. Two distinct beats, both causally necessary; the exact action (pull via drone) is irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage and cost (she relinquishes control, lets the pilgrim in).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Following star trails" (method) is signaled early: "She'd followed the star trails here… lines of light someone had scratched into the stone centuries ago, a path only visible when the angle of dusk aligned with the solstice." It shapes Lena's arrival and frames her expertise. However, the method does not constrain mid-scene tactics or alter the drone's extraction beat; it is setup and atmospheric payoff (the drone "following the star trails home") without middle causal work. Two-of-three gates (setup, lyric payoff) but replaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The ancient observatory at dusk (setting) pressures every beat: the solstice alignment enables the star-trail visibility, the carved celestial maps guide the drone, the seam's exposure depends on the chip's placement, and the oculus pierced by starlight charges the closure image. The "brilliant dimness" tone is inseparable from the setting. Early signal, three beats (arrival, seam reveal, constellation projection), and closure linkage with visible transformation (sealed door opens, ceiling becomes screen). Indispensable; no other setting would deliver this exact logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the pilgrim arrives" (timeframe) anchors the entire scene and creates urgency: the last sliver of sun, the solstice alignment, and the first star piercing the oculus. The dusk window tightens the star-trail visibility and the observatory's response. However, elapsed time within the scene is not tracked beat-by-beat, and no mid-action clock forces a tactical choice. Setup and closure participation (evening star marks resolution) without middle pressure; two-of-three gates with modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To decode the frequency of belonging" (motivation) drives Lena's pursuit, her recognition of the pilgrim's parallel hunger, and her final acceptance of connection. It shapes the chip theft ("to decode the frequency of belonging, to press your palm against something and feel it thrum") and the hand-clasp closure ("the dazzling, terrible relief of no longer being alone"). Friction is present: her solitary methods conflict with the desire they serve. Two beats (theft, hand-clasp) with visible cost (she stops being surprised, lets the pilgrim take her hand). Strong thematic and causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" (tone) is established early ("fogging in the brilliant dimness") and sustained throughout: twilight silhouettes, faint tremors, the solstice dusk, and the indigo bruise of sky. It modulates under pressure (the chip "flared," the constellation "pierced") and charges the final image ("the space between their shadows"). The tone is inseparable from the setting and reweights the closure—light and dark, seen and unseen—without stating a moral. Coherent across turns, purposeful intensification, and closure linkage; specific enough that a different tone would break the logic.</comment>
