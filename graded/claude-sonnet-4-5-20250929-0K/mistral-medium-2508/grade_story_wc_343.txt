<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's curiosity drives her investigation and the final choice to lead the crew through the hopscotch sequence, though the captain's immediate willingness to follow feels underprepared—Veyra shifts from "snapped" dismissal to cooperation without visible internal struggle. The crew functions as chorus rather than individuals with competing pressures. Embodied emotion is present (pulse jumped, grinned) but the pivotal moment lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; Liora moves through discovery to solution without significant doubt or cost to her standing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered clues (phrasebook, hopscotch board, light pattern) that converge at the moment Liora traces the sequence and the ship breaks free. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the loop snaps, engines roar, horizon opens) with visible cost in the form of weeks adrift and the crew's grumbling doubt now resolved. Orientation anchors (airship, starlings, captain's study) arrive promptly. One friction: the phrasebook's map overlay feels convenient—it arrives exactly when needed without prior setup that it contained navigational data.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The antique airship, brass portholes, and hopscotch board are vivid and constraining; the board's glow guides the final choice, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography (study, deck below, window) tracks cleanly. The "dusty hopscotch board" and "stranded luminance" pooling in cracks tie setting detail directly to the puzzle and resolution. Starling murmurations recur as both atmospheric anchor and symbolic cage-then-guide, deepening the textural pressure without forcing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: escape the loop and restore the ship's course. The discovery sequence tightens options (engines failing, crew grumbling) and Liora's tracing the hopscotch grid is the protagonist-driven act that snaps the loop. One meaningful deepening occurs when the phrasebook map overlays the grid, reweighting prior clues. Cost is visible in the weeks adrift and the crew's skepticism melting only after proof. Minor slip: the crew's collective shift from doubt to wonder happens in summary rather than through individual resistance that Liora must overcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—"stranded isn't an ending, but a beginning; a pause to see what others rushed past"—emerges organically from the loop, the hopscotch patience, and the phrase "where light lingers, the lost find home." The final line "Here, the sky remembers" and the shift from cage to guide (starlings) offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The phrasebook's "dog-eared wisdom" and Liora's closing reflection on luminous future risk slight overstatement, but the core integrates event and image without thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora notices patterns (warped charts, faint glow, cloud curls "like ink on old parchment"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("You're supposed to be plotting our descent, not playing in the dust"). One friction: the captain's tag "snapped" followed by immediate capitulation to Liora's theory compresses what should be a longer negotiation, flattening Veyra's voice under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; diction stays within Liora's observant, curious register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the discovery sequence. Three frictions lower the score: (1) Paraphrase loop in the final section—"Next time, ask… Liora tucked… pressed her palm… already noting" recycles the beat of Liora continuing her work without new pressure. (2) Stock metaphor: "horizon was golden" and "vast. Not empty. Not lost. But luminous" edge toward abstraction rather than concrete image. (3) Filter-verb stack in "she thought of the phrasebook's words, of how light lingered" when the thought could be more immediate. No causality break, so penalties remain in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The antique-airship-plus-mysterious-loop premise is familiar (trapped-crew, clever-apprentice-solves-puzzle), but the hopscotch-board-as-navigational-key and "stranded luminance" phrase add specificity. The polyglot phrasebook overlay feels more convenient than inevitable—it arrives to solve rather than complicate. Emotional complexity is present in Liora's defiance and Veyra's grudging respect, but the crew's collective shift and the tidy engine-restart risk template satisfaction. The final image (starlings as guide, "sky remembers") synthesizes prior elements without a bold risk that heightens stakes beyond expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora (curious map apprentice) is present throughout; her choices to investigate the study, sketch the board, and lead the crew through the sequence drive all key turns. Observation feeds decision, and the final act (tracing the hopscotch path) breaks the loop—story logic hinges on her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The polyglot phrasebook appears in three beats: initial discovery with the dog-eared corner and inscription, the second opening to the map overlay, and Liora tucking it into her belt at the end. The dog-eared corner signals "secret" but the map overlay feels convenient—it was not set up as containing ship routes. Reprise at closure (tucked against hip) reweights it as a guide, but the middle beat's mechanics are unclear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Stranded luminance" shapes the puzzle: the faint glow in the hopscotch cracks is the literal manifestation, and Liora's recognition that light pools in a pattern enables the solution. The phrase "Where light lingers, the lost find home" ties concept to tactic. It constrains one key turn (the tracing act) and charges the ending image ("luminous"), but the concept is more thematic echo than ongoing pressure across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is visible in Liora's persistent mapping, rule-breaking entry to the study, and careful sketching. The trait enables the investigation but does not visibly constrain—there's no moment where diligence costs her speed or where curiosity leads her into danger that patience must then solve. Label-adjacent in the opening ("diligently curious") but enacted through consistent noticing and recording.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Note" (as verb) drives the structure: Liora notes the glow's pooling, sketches the layout in her journal, notes each step's shift, and opens the new logbook with "Here, the sky remembers." The act of recording is the means by which she deciphers the loop and guides the crew. Two beats depend on it (sketch, step sequence), and the final line repurposes it as thematic closure. Swapping "note" for "observe" would weaken specificity but not break logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By noting secret patterns in a dusty hopscotch board" is the exact method: Liora brushes grit away, sketches the board's layout, marks where light pools, and traces the sequence with her finger. The mechanics are shown on the page (glow pulses in response, crew gathers, alignment snaps). Setup is clear; middle use (charcoal sketch) and closure payoff (tracing flares the luminance) are causally linked. The board could be another symbol, but the hopscotch grid's worn sequence and squares are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The antique airship *Aurora's Folly* frames the story: creaking hull, brass portholes, captain's study, deck below, engines. The ship's loop is the central problem, and the physical space (study → deck transition) stages Liora's discovery. The engines' failure pressures the timeline. Closure payoff: the ship surges forward, breaking free. Setting enables the puzzle but is not maximally constraining—deck and study are backdrops more than tactical resources with unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Amid starling murmurations" recurs as atmospheric marker (opening, mid-scene stilling, final scatter and reform) but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. Weeks adrift is mentioned, but no urgent countdown pressures Liora's investigation. The starlings shift from cage to guide metaphorically, but their timing does not alter tactics. Present in setup and closure, absent as escalation mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To chart the next great discovery" motivates Liora's rule-breaking and her excitement at the fresh logbook ("fingers itching to fill its pages"). The final lines ("the next great discovery waited… she would chart it") restate it, and her opening disobedience ("lure of uncharted skies… stronger than rules") dramatizes the desire. Friction with safety or caution is implied but not tested on the page—Liora faces no choice where discovery costs her standing or relationship.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is legible in Liora's solitary investigation (alone in the study, noticing what others miss) paired with her final collaboration (leading the crew, joining Veyra at the window). The tone shifts from lone curiosity to collective wonder without modulating under pressure—no moment where isolation costs her or where sociability complicates her method. Present as framing but not charged at closure beyond the image of Liora by the window "already noting."</comment>
