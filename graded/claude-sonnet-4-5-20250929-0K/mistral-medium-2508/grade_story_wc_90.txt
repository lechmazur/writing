<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lien's interiority remains consistent—her three-hundred-year persistence and acceptance of failure read as earned. The "shadow work" and stitching manifest as physical micro-choices (picking up the needle, exhaling slowly). However, the interior remains largely contemplative; contradictory impulses do not act simultaneously in high-pressure beats, and the final step-through feels more conceptual than a choice with visible personal cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: Lien crosses the threshold, the dimension breathes, and the sealed world opens—a Decisive Change with visible cost (her stitches unravel, the Eulogy is gone). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through recurring images (needle, thread, tear, photograph) that culminate in the final breach. Orientation anchors quickly (Lien, Eulogy observation deck, post-last-birth era). One meaningful tightening occurs when the tear widens and hands reach through, altering her options and enabling the push.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Eulogy's bone construction and recycled hull provide tactile atmosphere. The photograph, needle, and thread function as micro-setting that constrains her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (observation deck, floating, gravity flickers) remains coherent. The "other side" is sketched lightly—warm halls, voices, green grass, closer stars—sufficient for closure contrast without catalog depth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (open the locked dimension) is signaled early and pursued across multiple beats. Pressure tightens when the thread snaps, then escalates when the tear widens and hands reach through, forcing Lien to push despite fear. Agency is clear: she picks up the needle again, stitches, and crosses. The final act forecloses her old existence (the Eulogy is gone) with visible cost, and the child's presence reweights her isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (mending the irreparably broken, compassion encoded in the act of trying) emerges from the stitching action, the "Try again" note, and Kwan Yin's whisper without explicit moralizing. The final image—green grass, closer singing stars, a child's hand—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether hope persists after extinction. The photograph burning bright and the stitches unraveling into "a ladder of light" reweight sorrow into passage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and close to Lien. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices tears, threads, shimmer, shadow. Diction stays controlled ("sliver of black glass," "spun thin," "silvered weight") with purposeful elevation that fits the lyric-SF register. No head-hopping. The AI's brief lines read as external voice. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at closure ("she feared she might unravel").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language ("ship of bones," "thread was her own breath") charges atmosphere. However, minor loops appear: "the tear" is named repeatedly without variation, and several beats recycle "Lien + verb" stems. The final third accelerates cleanly. Information density is high in the stitching sequence, but some scaffold phrasing ("for the first time in three hundred years," "for the first time in forever") dulls momentum slightly. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination—post-extinction protagonist stitching dimensions via compassion-encoded AI and dried tears on photographs—feels specific and non-obvious. The "shadow work" metaphor and gravitational lightness when happy are integrated rather than ornamental. However, the broad arc (last survivor opening a sealed world to find new life) follows a familiar template. The execution elevates through lyric specificity and the Kwan Yin thread, but the emotional contour (isolation → breakthrough → wonder) is well-trodden.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lien is presented as the last human who "remembered what it meant," but no on-page choice dramatizes pacifism as a constraint or cost. Her persistence in stitching could imply refusal of violence, yet no antagonist or violent option appears to test that stance. The element reads as a thematic label rather than a driver of key turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear is signaled early ("the faint shimmer of long-dried tears"), appears in the stitching attempt ("the tear resisted"), and is present at closure when "the tear split open" and later "sealed shut." It shapes Lien's method (stitching through the absence of weight where sorrow should be) and the final breach. The mechanics—pushing through the invisible edge—matter across at least three beats and the ending depends on opening it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shadow work" is named explicitly ("they'd called it...the act of mending what was already broken beyond use") and Lien works "in the dark, where the shadows were softest." It frames her method, but the concept does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics under pressure. It reads more as thematic gloss than a mechanical stake; removing the term would not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The attribute appears early ("her body hummed, lighter than it should have been, the way it always did when the grief lifted") and recurs at key moments: "her body surged, weightless with something like joy" when the screen splits, and "Lien's body became light—so light she feared she might unravel" at the threshold. It signals her emotional state and charges the crossing, but does not constrain a tactical choice or impose a visible cost. It enriches atmosphere and marks emotional peaks without driving a turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stitching is introduced early, sustained through multiple beats (needle insertion, thread snapping, second attempt, final push), and the act of stitching literally opens the dimension at closure. The "stitches unraveling behind her like a ladder of light" transforms the prior work into passage. Removing "stitch" would require fundamental rewrites; the entire narrative hinges on this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method—"via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs"—is signaled early (photograph with Kwan Yin's tears), shapes Lien's approach ("she had spent decades learning how to push there"), and the photograph burns bright at closure. The mechanics matter: she pushes at the gap "between the woman's fingers and the child's cheek" and the tear widens. The method is present across setup, middle attempts, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Eulogy's recycled, bone-constructed hull is established early and its "failing" state adds urgency. Gravity flickers during the stitching attempt, altering Lien's physical state. The ship's bones "sang" and "the Eulogy...remembered how to fly" before vanishing. The setting provides atmosphere and one constraint (failing systems), but does not supply a resource or block that Lien must work around to achieve her goal. It charges the ending image but does not pressure middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored early: "after the last human is born" and "the final birth log still glowed: Subject 47-X. Terminated at 3 minutes." Lien has spent "three hundred years" on this work. The frame situates the stakes (extinction, sealed dimension) but does not impose a ticking clock that alters her tactics. The scale provides thematic weight without tactical urgency; she could work another century without immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lien's desire to open the locked dimension is established in the setup (the logs say it was sealed, she pushes at the tear) and drives every beat: picking up the needle again after failure, pushing through the tear, stepping through. The motivation is tested when "she had never been afraid of the dark, only of what waited in the light," a moment of friction that she overcomes. The entire plot traces this want with visible cost (her unraveling, the Eulogy's loss).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone—"ghostly resolve"—is coherent from the opening ("ship of bones," "forgotten how to die") through the stitching beats ("She didn't curse. She exhaled, slow") to the ending ("the locked dimension breathed," "something new began to grow"). The tone modulates: determination persists, but wonder and warmth enter at closure ("green," "stars were singing," "she laughed"). The final image charges the established mood without breaking it.</comment>
