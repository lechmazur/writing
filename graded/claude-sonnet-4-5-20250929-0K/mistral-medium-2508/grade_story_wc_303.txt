<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are coherent—the contract versus preservation conflict—and embodied through her hesitation over the violin, her gift's burden shown via the wisteria exchange. Her decision to shatter the instrument feels earned by the accumulating plant voices and Silas's embedded message. However, the final kneeling tableau edges toward performative closure; the internal contradiction between freedom-purchase and propagation could have been sharpened in one additional micro-choice earlier to deepen the renunciation's cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives on the page: Elara destroys the violin, scattering fragments that root and sing—a Decisive Change with visible cost (contract breach, "thief, fraud, madwoman" labels). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: plant whispers, coffee-stain futures, and the violin's embedded voice layer until the smashing reweights empire versus dream. Orientation is swift (who, where, violin case by paragraph two). One friction: the "perforated destiny" language in the opening feels more decorative than mechanic until late; earlier constraint-signal would tighten causal confidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is anchored early with dual moons, wisteria trellis, brass telescope, and lead-lined case. The gardens supply the final constraint: shards take root in soil, enabling the sung crystallization. Micro-setting (chipped cup, brass counterweight) charges key beats. One weakness: "midsummer" and the dual-moon sky remain atmospheric rather than pressing choices—seasonal heat or lunar phase never narrows Elara's options—holding the score shy of 7.5+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (contract payment versus letting the symphony propagate) is signaled by paragraph four and tightens when Elara lifts the violin and hears Silas's voice, which reframes the empire-dream calculus. The smashing forecloses her contract and freedom with visible cost ("thief, fraud, madwoman" report, dawn auction missed). Agency is decision under pressure. One beat-level gap: the coffee-stain vision offers three paths but the "third option" introduction feels slightly late; earlier plant-urgency cues could have seeded the propagation logic more causally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—dreams/art resisting imperial commodification—emerges through Silas's frozen symphony, the wisteria's memory, and Elara's final scattering without overt thesis. The closing image (garden singing, ice-vine breaking velvet roof by dawn) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: propagation over ownership. "Perforated destiny" as metaphor for letting light through is elegant but announced rather than discovered. Minor slip: "some destinies were meant to be perforated—so the light could get in" tilts toward authorial gloss in a high-pressure beat; the image alone would carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature (accidental telepathy, coffee-stain futures) colors her noticing. Diction stays within an educated, lyric register. Two frictions: the wisteria's italicized *"They will take it. They always take"* and Silas's embedded *"You're the one who hears them, aren't you?"* read cleanly, but the final *"Thank you"* from the wisteria feels slightly over-articulated for plant "thought" after earlier compression. Purposeful lyricism (e.g., "mulberry ache") is voice-consistent, though "mulberry ache" itself appears only once and feels more prompt-echo than integrated idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short crisis lines, longer reflective passages) and information density is high. Several figurative clusters in high-pressure beats border on overwriting: "liquid silver," "prismatic needles," "delicate, humming crystals" in the smashing sequence; metaphor density slightly dulls propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs three and four both establish Elara's gift origin and plant-memory theme with overlapping phrasing ("accidentally, unwanted" / "knew the weight of a dream"). No pronoun drift or grammar breaks. Tightening the metaphor load in the climax would lift clarity and momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ice-violin premise and plant-telepathy pairing offer a fresh synthesis; the propagation-versus-commodification choice avoids template moral binaries. The smashing and rooting outcome feels earned in hindsight by the wisteria's prior urgings. Risk: non-standard sensory layering (scent of "crushed violets," song "vibrating in sap") heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One limiter: the "perforated destiny" frame and "mulberry ache" tone arrive as prompt-adjacent labels rather than emergent discoveries, reducing full inevitability. Still, the ending's ice-vine breaking through velvet roof is specific and memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara ("provenance researcher") is introduced early and her authentication role frames the contract stakes. Her choice to shatter the violin (paragraph twelve) is the story's key turn. She appears in nearly every beat, handling the violin, reading coffee stains, and enacting the climax. Cost is visible (contract breach, "thief" label). However, the "researcher" trait itself (vs. musician, collector, etc.) remains functional rather than irreplaceable—her telepathy and moral stance drive the choice more than provenance expertise, so score settles mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ice violin appears in the lead-lined case (paragraph three), Elara touches it (paragraph eight), lifts and "plays" it to hear Silas's voice (paragraph ten), and shatters it (paragraph twelve), with fragments rooting in the garden (paragraph thirteen). Four distinct beats, causal pressure (its song reframes her choice), and closure linkage (shards become singing crystals, ice-vine by dawn). The violin's ice-crystal origin and embedded symphony are specific and irreplaceable. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is named in paragraph one and reprised in paragraph thirteen ("some destinies were meant to be perforated—so the light could get in"). It shapes Elara's stake thematically (choices already "perforated" by the future she glimpses) and the final act (scattering shards = puncturing empire's claim). However, the concept remains more lyric-thematic than tactical—Elara never dramatizes a moment where perforation mechanics constrain a choice step-by-step. The reprise charges the image but doesn't alter scene options, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's plant telepathy appears early (paragraph two: "second pulse," paragraph five: incident in Orrery, paragraph six: wisteria thoughts as "silk"). It constrains her choice: the vines' urgings (*"Propagate. Let it grow"*) directly inform her decision to scatter the shards so plants can "remember how to make it sing." Cost is visible—she acts on non-human counsel, risking her contract and reputation. The trait enables the propagation tactic and charges the ending (garden sings, ice-vine sprouts). Three beats, causal pressure, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Propagate" is seeded by paragraph six (wisteria: *"Propagate. Let it grow"*), Silas's embedded song of "roots splitting stone, of seeds carried on illegal winds" (paragraph ten), and Elara's internal choice (paragraph eleven: "she would call it propagation"). The smashing and scattering (paragraph twelve) enacts it, and the closing image (shards rooting, ice-vine breaking roof by dawn) completes it. The action redefines the violin's fate from vault to living garden, transforming the stake. Four beats, high causal necessity, irreplaceable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coffee-stain reading appears in paragraph four ("dregs… swirled into a pattern—a ship's mast snapping, a field of poppies bleeding into ink") and paragraph eleven ("The coffee stains had shown her two paths… had already darkened into a third option"). The method signals the future-vision gift and frames Elara's tactical awareness of her choices. However, mechanics remain abstract—how stains parse into ship/poppy/mulberry images is unexplained—and the method doesn't constrain her final choice (the wisteria and Silas's voice do). Present in setup and middle, but soft causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "velvet observatory" is named in the opening line and anchored with brass telescope, domed ceiling, glass wall, iron trellis, gardens, central table, dual moons. The observatory's gardens provide the soil where shards root (paragraph twelve), the wisteria bloom signals thanks (paragraph thirteen), and the velvet roof is broken by the ice-vine (paragraph fourteen)—micro-setting supplies the final constraint and image. The space pressures Elara's choice (midnight deadline, collector's men arriving). Strong setup, middle use (glass wall/vines), and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Before the promise loses its glow" is restated as "before the auction at dawn" (paragraph four) and "The collector's men would arrive at midnight" (paragraph eleven). The clock tightens Elara's window ("She had until then to decide") and is paid off when the men kick the door at midnight (paragraph fourteen). The timeframe shapes her urgency and the ending image ("By dawn, the first ice-vine…"). However, elapsed scene-time within the observatory remains vague—no minute-by-minute tracking—so pressure is felt but not granular. Setup, middle signal, closure mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Weigh a dream against an empire" is stated in paragraph four ("weigh the violin against her contract, or weigh her contract against the world") and tested on-page in paragraph eleven (money/freedom versus letting the symphony propagate). Elara's choice to shatter the violin dramatizes the friction: she forfeits contract payment and accepts "thief, fraud, madwoman" labels to prevent imperial commodification. The desire is conflicted (freedom versus artistic/ecological fidelity) with visible cost. Motivation drives the key turn and closure. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" appears once (paragraph eleven: "tasted like mulberry ache") as a descriptor for the third option (smashing and scattering). Tone overall reads wistful, layered with grief and defiance—coherent through Elara's hesitation, the violin's "spectrum of grief and something sharper: defiance," and the closing bittersweet victory. However, "mulberry" as a specific flavor/color remains ornamental rather than functional—no prior mulberry image seeds it, and it doesn't modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Present, purposeful, but not indispensable.</comment>
