<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias and Liora are tracked across two distinct actions (mapping silence, confronting the faceless stranger), but interiority remains abstract and label-driven. "Hunger," "quiet kind that made people lean in," and "charisma sharpening into something dangerous" are told without embodied micro-choices. The ending gesture (*we remembered them back*) is asserted rather than earned through prior contradiction or renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (harbor, moon, two characters), and the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the harbor's glow dims, then the waves rise in luminous color. Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the camera "heavier now, like a heart full of names"—but the cost is metaphorical rather than felt in a forfeited path or altered tactic. The faceless stranger appears and dissolves without prior setup, weakening causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The harbor (moonlight, salt, old wood) anchors early and returns in the ending "silence no longer empty but *alive*." The vintage camera's brass body and the water's luminous peaks provide tactile detail that shapes two beats. However, spatial choreography during the confrontation is vague—"standing on the water" and "lunged…toward" lack clear distances or positions—and the camera's transition from "no film" to "heavier" relies on metaphor rather than constrained choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring forgotten songs—is signaled early and pressure tightens when the faceless stranger appears and "the harbor itself had flinched." The climax (waves rising, camera drinking the stranger) narrows options under the Accumulative lens, but agency is split between Elias's signing and Liora's camera with no clear protagonist choice that forecloses a path. The resolution ("we remembered them back") is told, not dramatized as a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme (recovering the forgotten through gesture and disruption) emerges from the camera's empty shutter and sign language without moralizing. The ending image—camera heavier, harbor humming beneath hearing—reweights prior material with quiet resonance. However, "Light doesn't need film to be real" edges toward thesis statement, and the faceless stranger's "hunger" is abstract rather than a specific embodiment of the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with tight focalization on Elias and Liora. "Her charisma the quiet kind that made people lean in" and "a blade wrapped in velvet" are register-drift metaphors unsuited to the urgency of the moment. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("You're mapping silence again," "Someone remembers"), carrying subtext, but Liora's snarl ("You don't get to keep them") lacks grounding in prior personal stake. No head-hopping; distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "thread of smoke," "ghost of a flash," "blade wrapped in velvet," "storm," "breaking glass and wind chimes" in quick succession without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Paraphrase loops appear: "the harbor seemed to breathe with them" and "the harbor sighed" restate without added pressure. Template cadence in the climax ("The harbor answered. / Waves rose… / The faceless thing wailed…") flattens propulsion. "Sign language" and "mapping silence" are told concepts without shown mechanics.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sign language for forgotten songs and a camera with no film offer a fresh synthesis of sensory translation and memorial retrieval. The faceless stranger and luminous waves in color rather than sound are non-obvious turns. However, the "thieves…stealing back what time had erased" and "harbor kept their secret, as harbors do" lean on familiar narrative templates. The ending's "world felt wide enough to hold them" is a stock closure phrase that reduces specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Liora (whispering advisor) adjusts the camera strap, lifts and clicks the camera, lunges toward the stranger, and speaks three lines that frame the stakes ("You're mapping silence again," "Someone remembers," "You don't get to keep them"). She appears in the opening third, shapes two middle beats (framing and the true flash), and is present at closure ("smiled, her quiet charisma wrapping around them"). Her agency is secondary to Elias's signing, and her decision to lunge is reactive rather than a turn that narrows options. Early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.3, swappability (could be another observer) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vintage camera with no film is handled in three beats: Liora adjusts the strap (opening), frames Elias and clicks without film (middle), and the camera flashes truly to drink the faceless stranger's form (climax). It returns heavier at closure, "like a heart full of names." Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (reweighted) +1.0, causal pressure (the flash resolves the stranger) +0.8, specificity (no-film property matters) +0.5. Minor friction: the transition from empty to "truly" flashing is asserted rather than mechanically grounded −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sign language (core concept) is described as "signs for sounds that had no voice" and "translating the silence into something like music," and Elias signs *no*, *yes*, *now*, and *we remembered them back*. It appears in four beats but functions decoratively—no vocabulary is shown, and the signing does not constrain tactics or enable a turn the characters could not achieve by speaking. Late setup (signing is named but not demonstrated until midpoint) −0.3, ornamental (description without mechanical pressure) −0.8, swappability (gesture or voice could replace it) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Quietly charismatic (attribute) is told twice: "her charisma the quiet kind that made people lean in" and "her quiet charisma wrapping around them like a cloak." It does not enable or constrain an on-page choice—Liora's lunge and dialogue read identically if the attribute were absent. Label-only mention −0.6, no cost tied to the trait −0.6, swappable (confidence or presence would serve) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Disrupt (action) is named once—"to split the dark with the ghost of a flash that never came"—and enacted when the camera flashes "truly" to drink the faceless stranger. The action drives the climactic reversal (the stranger unravels) and charges the ending (the camera heavier). Early mention +0.3, two beats (ghost flash and true flash) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.9. Friction: the mechanics of disruption (why the flash works, what changed) are asserted rather than shown −0.6, and "disrupt" as a verb is generic −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Mapping silence (method) is named in the opening ("You're mapping silence again") and described as "weaving the story of the harbor's forgotten songs" and "translating the silence into something like music." Elias signs faster during the confrontation, but the method does not shape an attempt or alter tactics—the signing and the camera's flash operate in parallel without interaction. Early signal +0.5, middle beat (signing faster) +0.4, closure participation (the harbor hums) +0.3. Frictions: summary-only (mechanics never shown) −0.6, swappability (observation or gesture could replace mapping) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Luminous harbor by moonlight (setting) is anchored in the opening and returns in three beats: the moon's reflection fractures, the harbor's glow dims when the stranger appears, and waves rise in luminous color (sapphire, emerald, gold) during the climax. The final image—"harbor's silence no longer empty but *alive*"—reweights the opening. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0. Frictions: the harbor's luminous properties do not constrain a choice (characters could act identically on a dark shore) −0.7, and spatial choreography (where the stranger stands, how the waves affect the characters) is vague −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>When no one remembers you (timeframe) is implied in "the war stole their names" and "the forgotten began to sing," but time does not tighten decisions or tactics. No clock operates—the characters stay "until the first hint of dawn" without urgency, and the faceless stranger appears without temporal trigger. Thematic presence (forgetting as condition) +0.4, closure participation (the forgotten sing) +0.3. Frictions: no tactical pressure from the timeframe −0.9, late explicit signal (implied early but named only at closure) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To translate silence into music (motivation) is shown when Elias signs the harbor's forgotten songs ("the creak of a mast, the sigh of a net") and signs faster during the confrontation, pulling "threads of silence into a net." The harbor answers with luminous waves "each crest a chord." Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (harbor humming) +0.7, causal pressure +0.6. Frictions: the motivation is not tested by an opposing want (no moment where Elias must choose between translating and another goal) −0.6, and the resolution ("we remembered them back") is told rather than shown as friction between cost and desire −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Joyful sorrow (tone) is present in "lullaby no one remembered how to sing," "laugh…like breaking glass and wind chimes," and the ending paradox (silence "no longer empty but *alive*"). The tone modulates subtly—elegiac in the opening, tense when the stranger appears, bittersweet at closure. Three beats +1.4, closure charge +0.9. Frictions: the tone at the climax (Liora snarling, the faceless thing wailing) shifts to horror without acknowledging the tonal break or integrating it with the joyful-sorrow frame −0.7, and the final line ("the world felt wide enough") leans toward uncomplicated joy −0.4.</comment>
