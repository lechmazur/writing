<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation ("patch the holes in her soul") is dramatized through concrete action—stitching the card into bark, trading her hidden guilt. Her final choice to take something back (accepting scars rather than filling holes) emerges from the orchard's pull and her willingness to barter everything. Internal contradiction appears when she claims recklessness yet executes precision; the text shows her fiercely gentle touch but doesn't dramatize competing impulses acting simultaneously in a single beat. The embodied pain ("sweet and bright as the first light of dawn") and the quiet eyes at closure earn the renunciation, though the epiphany risks arriving fully formed rather than accumulating through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (catacomb orchard, Liora kneeling, tarot card) arrive within the opening lines. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered imagery (roots/bones/blossoms, repeated bartering motif) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—Liora walks away lighter, her scars now hers to carry, a renunciation with visible cost (the white flower wilting, the past "in the earth now"). The tightening occurs when the roots coil and pull her deepest guilt, narrowing her to one choice: give it everything or resist. Cost is legible in the line "her hands empty but her eyes, for the first time, quiet" and the acceptance that holes remain "patchwork and uneven." The lens holds; closure lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard constrains choice: roots that "shivered," bark that receives the stitched card, and bones underfoot anchor the bartering ritual spatially. The half-lit glow recurs and charges the final image ("corridors behind her glowed half-lit and endless"). Sensory detail is selective—damp sighs, fogged breath, scent of rain on dry earth—and filtered through Liora's priorities (the card's edges, the needle's flash). The white flower and wilting petals function as micro-setting objects that carry the closure's conceptual weight. Spatial choreography remains clear across kneeling, stitching, root-coiling, and walking away.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora wants to "trammel fate itself" and mend herself by bartering her guilt. Pressure tightens when the roots pull "the name of the child she'd failed to save"—a live cost that narrows her to one path: resist or surrender. The orchard's agency (pulling, weaving, releasing) creates situational pressure; Liora's decision to "not resist" and her active stitching demonstrate protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens. The trade forecloses the option to carry guilt forward, and the price is visible: empty hands, a wilting flower, and the acknowledgment that scars remain. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the orchard's mechanics—bartered destinies, roots fed by regrets—without meta-commentary. The burned Tower card (falling figures screaming) seeds the premise; its replacement by a white flower reweights loss into acceptance. The final insight ("not gaps to fill, but scars to carry") arises from Liora's on-page trade and avoids platitude by grounding it in the child's name and the orchard's weaving. Subtext operates in Veyra's "tired affection," the orchard's satisfied exhalation, and the ambiguous new trade beginning elsewhere. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the living learn to walk with scars, the past is in the earth, the future is in the walking.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with psychic distance modulating purposefully (close at the stitching beat, wider at Veyra's discovery). Dialogue is minimal but functional: Veyra's warnings and Liora's responses carry goal and subtext ("I would mend *me*"). Voice is lyric and consistent—"dusky resolve," "roots twisting like veins through the ribs of the forgotten"—though elevated diction risks distancing at peak emotional beats. The orchard's voice ("*You would mend what should stay broken?*") reads as external pressure rather than head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Liora notices the card's charred edges, the needle's flash, the flower's softness. No POV leakage or unmotivated filter verbs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "roots twisting like veins," "voice like dry leaves," "pain lanced up her arm, sweet and bright as the first light of dawn." In peak beats (the stitching, the roots pulling), metaphor stacks without consistent pattern-teaching, risking opacity ("dusky resolve of the corridor's glow" mixes light/emotion/place). Paraphrase loops appear: "the holes in her soul didn't ache. They were still there—patchwork and uneven—but they were *hers* now, not gaps to fill, but scars to carry" restates across three clauses. Template cadence emerges in the closing: "She took another step. Then another." Sentence openings vary elsewhere, and information density is generally strong. Apply −0.6 for density in pressure beats and −0.3 for paraphrase loop, total −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard premise (tree roots through bones, fed by bartered memories) offers a specific synthesis of necropolis and transactional magic. The Tower card and stitching ritual feel purposeful rather than ornamental. However, the core emotional arc—trading guilt for acceptance, learning scars are not gaps—echoes common self-acceptance templates without a non-obvious moral calculus. The closing imagery (raindrop in palm, walking lighter) is evocative but familiar. Transformation is present in the orchard's mechanics and Veyra's role, lifting the piece above derivative, but the final insight remains within well-worn territory. No proximity echoes or template plot detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liora's reckless idealism drives the inciting action (stitching the card despite Veyra's warning) and the climactic choice (not resisting the roots' pull). Her decision to "take something back" by surrendering guilt shapes the closure. Present in setup, middle choice (the stitching), and ending. Two beats plus closure linkage. Causal pressure moderate; the trait enables but does not deeply constrain with visible tradeoff cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The burned tarot card (the Tower) appears in the opening beat (half-buried, edges charred), is handled and stitched into bark in the ritual beat, and is replaced by the white flower at closure—a reweighted return. Three beats, early signal, closure transformation. The card's specific imagery (falling figures screaming) seeds the bartering premise. Causal pressure strong; its disappearance and replacement articulate cost. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Bartered destinies shapes the orchard's mechanics (roots fed by memories, names, regrets), frames Liora's trade (guilt for future unshackled), and governs the closure (her sorrow woven into the tapestry). Present in setup exposition, middle ritual, and ending. The concept narrows options: to mend, she must barter. Cost is visible (empty hands, wilting flower). Specificity high; swapping for "magical trade" would weaken thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" is labeled in the opening ("her touch fiercely gentle as she pressed the card deeper") but not dramatized as a constraining tradeoff. The trait does not visibly enable or block an action with cost; it colors narration without altering tactics. Single mention, no middle beat involvement, no closure participation. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Trammel" (to trammel fate itself) is stated as intention and enacted through the stitching ritual. The needle work and root-coiling form the central turn. Present in setup declaration, middle action, and the closure reconfiguration (fate trammeled into acceptance). Two beats plus closure linkage. Causal pressure strong; the action enables the trade. Moderate irreplaceability—"bind" or "trap" would be near-synonyms.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is signaled ("The method required precision: inlaying meaning everywhere, into the curve of a root, the whisper of a draft...") and demonstrated in the stitching beat. The method shapes the ritual's mechanics but does not constrain attempts or create visible cost tied specifically to this technique. Present in setup and middle; absent from closure. Two beats, moderate causal role, swappable with "imbuing" or "weaving meaning."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard (roots through bones, half-lit corridors) supplies the ritual's literal foundation, constrains Liora's kneeling position and tool use (pressing card into soil, stitching bark), and recurs in the closure image ("corridors behind her glowed half-lit and endless"). Present in setup, middle choreography, and ending. Three beats, high causal pressure (the orchard pulls, weaves, releases), strong irreplaceability. The orchard's bones/blossoms duality charges the final thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Half-lit corridors" recurs as atmospheric detail but does not function as a tightening clock. Time is vague: "Tonight, she would trammel fate," then "dawn" arrives. No urgency tied to the glow's duration. Present in setup and closure image but does not alter tactics. Lyric reprise without causal pressure or cost linkage. Swappable with "dim light" or "twilight."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To patch holes in her soul" is stated early, dramatized through the stitching and bartering beats, and reconfigured at closure ("the holes in her soul didn't ache...not gaps to fill, but scars to carry"). Present in setup, middle trade, and ending. The desire drives the ritual and the final renunciation. Friction appears when the orchard demands more than she expected (the child's name), forcing cost. Three beats, high causal pressure, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" coheres across the piece: opening gravity ("slow, damp sighs"), stitching determination ("the needle flashed in the dusky resolve of the corridor's glow"), and quiet closure ("her eyes, for the first time, quiet"). Modulates under pressure—pain "sweet and bright"—without breaking. The tone charges the final image of walking into light "lighter than she'd been in years." Present throughout, coherent through turns, strong closure linkage.</comment>
