<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias moves through sleepwalking with a stated motive ("carve a path from ruin to reverence") but the interiority remains abstract—phrases like "eyes held a light that didn't belong to this world" and "haunting optimism" function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (stepping toward dawn) lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; he simply walks forward without dramatized cost. Micro-choices during the sleepwalking are absent; he moves by "older knowing" rather than making decisions under pressure that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure—Elias stepping toward dawn with winged shadow—reads as Charged Poise, crystallizing his shift from passive weaver to active builder, but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized on the page (the illustration plate is "cool," the carvings are done, no visible price paid or path foreclosed). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural with pattern-taught imagery (winged figure, tide, labyrinth-as-loom), yet the final reconfiguration lacks the undeniable pressure or felt cost required for high-band entry. The sleepwalking sequence loops similar beats (press plate, veins rise) without meaningful tightening until the Heart Chamber.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (brine scent, copper air, red dust veins), and spatial choreography remains clear. The Heart Chamber's "stone pulsed like a second heartbeat" charges the ending image, and the labyrinth's shifting paths directly enable the closure moment. However, no environmental constraint narrows a mid-scene choice; setting functions more as backdrop and final-image device than as a pressure that alters tactics during escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming ruin into reverence—is signaled early but remains abstract. The sleepwalking sequence presents repetitive actions (press plate, veins rise) without a reversal or tightening that narrows options until the Heart Chamber, where the labyrinth shifts in response to his touch. That moment reconfigures the physical space but lacks a visible trade-off or price paid by Elias; he simply wakes to find the work done. No secondary constraint (time, resource, social cost) shapes tactics, and the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—mending what others call lost, ruin as a loom—emerges through concrete imagery (frayed ropes, bleeding ink, unraveling stitches) and the labyrinth-as-loom metaphor is purposeful. The final whispered verse ("What was lost was never gone—only waiting to be named") edges toward thematic statement but is brief and anchored in his mother's teaching. The winged shadow and dawn walk offer a resonant image, yet the closure does not fully reweight prior material with new cost; instead it declares transformation ("the labyrinth had been a cradle / Now it was a door") without dramatizing the price of that shift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and controlled with a consistent metaphorical register (weaver/loom/stitch/thread) and purposeful compression ("a man of frayed edges"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, elevated diction ("haunting optimism," "orchid solace" tone) occasionally drifts above the POV's embodied experience, and the final-third prose leans toward authorial assertion ("He understood then: the labyrinth wasn't a maze. It was a loom.") rather than allowing the realization to emerge through image alone. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density (ink bleeding, paths unraveling, stone humming) is high throughout. Paraphrase loops appear: "He didn't know why he did it. / Or perhaps he did" restates without added pressure; "The labyrinth had been a cradle. / Now it was a door." repeats the structural metaphor within two lines. Template cadence in the final third ("The tide would return... Neither would he... The wharf was waiting...") flattens propulsion. Mixed metaphor: paths "unraveled like loose stitches" while stairs "spiraled upward"—stitches don't spiral. Filter-verb stacks ("could feel," "understood then") dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering disqualification from 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth-as-loom conceit and sleepwalking-as-sewing offer a specific synthesis, and the winged illustration plate returning as shadow is purposeful. However, the emotional arc—passive mourner to active builder—follows a familiar template (hero's descent, transformation, return), and the metaphorical frame (weaver/loom/thread) is deployed consistently but without a non-obvious moral calculus or fresh inflection that resists hindsight. The final image (winged shadow) is evocative yet predictable given the early setup. Risk-taking in the lyric structure is present but does not heighten stakes beyond the template's baseline.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his sleepwalking action drives the labyrinth's transformation, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, his choices are passive—sleep claims him, his body moves "by some older knowing," and the illustration plate glows without his agency. The final decision to walk toward dawn is descriptive rather than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but passivity and lack of cost −1.2. Swappability moderate −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The illustration plate appears early (setup), is pressed to stone during sleepwalking (development), glows in the Heart Chamber, and its winged figure becomes his shadow at closure (payoff). Three-gate presence and beat involvement across three scenes +1.4, early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (bleeding ink, warped edges) +0.5. However, the plate's final state—"ink now dry, the winged figure gone from the page"—is told rather than dramatized with visible cost tied to Elias's trade-off. Swappability moderate −0.4, summary-only final beat −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" is mentioned early ("a place of broken rules," "poetic weaver of broken precedents") and the labyrinth's dead ends blooming into arches enacts the concept at closure. Setup and payoff gates present, but mid-scene development is absent—the concept does not constrain a choice or narrow options during the sleepwalking sequence. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, but no causal pressure that alters tactics −0.8, ornamental use in middle −0.6, late thematic payoff −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is applied as a label ("the haunting optimism of a man who had spent his life mending what others called lost") without dramatizing a specific choice where optimism enables action at a cost or conflicts with another trait. Setup present, but no development beat where the attribute constrains or complicates a decision. Closure shows him smiling and walking forward, consistent with optimism but not dramatizing a trade-off. Label-only −0.7, no causal pressure −0.8, ornamental −0.5, late mention −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sewing/stitching is the central metaphor: "He sewed as he walked... each step a stitch pulling the past into the present," the illustration plate as needle, and the labyrinth as loom. Setup early, development through repeated sleepwalking presses, payoff when paths unravel "like loose stitches" and new carvings bridge ruin. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.3, causal pressure (sewing enables the transformation) +0.9. However, the action is metaphorical rather than literal physical sewing, reducing irreplaceability −0.6, and the mechanics are abstract ("not with thread, but with memory") −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Overlapping sleepwalking paths" is signaled early ("Elias didn't walk these paths awake... his feet finding the overlaps where the labyrinth's original carvers had hesitated") and structures the middle sequence where he presses the plate at forks. Setup and development gates present. The Heart Chamber moment implies overlaps coalesce, and the final carvings are "his carvings" from the sleepwalking. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (overlaps as hesitation sites) +0.4. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what "overlap" means physically is unclear, and the method does not constrain a choice with cost. Ornamental clarity −0.7, swappability moderate −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth is present throughout: tide-pool canyon mouth, grooves with carved prayers, Heart Chamber with pulsing stone, paths that shift at the climax. Setup, development (sleepwalking along specific paths), and payoff (labyrinth reconfigures, becomes "a door") all present. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.7, closure linkage (shifting walls) +1.3, causal pressure (the labyrinth's structure enables the sleepwalking and transformation) +1.1, specificity (red canyon, carved prayers, Heart Chamber) +0.6. The setting directly shapes the protagonist's method and the ending's physical transformation, though no mid-scene choice is constrained by spatial layout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the tide pools empty" anchors the opening and "The tide would return at dawn" frames the ending, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Elias sleepwalks "as the last light bled" and wakes at dawn with no intermediate clock pressure or trade-offs forced by time scarcity. Setup and payoff present, no development. Early signal +0.4, closure callback +0.5, but no causal pressure from time −0.9, ornamental bookend −0.6, swappable with any diurnal cycle −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Carve a path from ruin to reverence" is Elias's stated motivation, echoed in his history with the rotting wharf and his belief in mending the lost. Setup early, development implied through sleepwalking that inscribes new carvings, payoff when he declares "the wharf would answer" and steps forward. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no on-page moment where ruin/reverence tension forces a trade-off. Summary-only −0.6, no friction between want and cost −0.7, swappable with generic "restore/transform" motivation −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" tone—lyric, elegiac, quietly hopeful—is established early ("half-remembered hymn," "his eyes held a light") and sustained through metaphorical density and the final image of dawn and winged shadow. Setup, development (consistent register through sleepwalking), and payoff (the ending modulates toward hope without abandoning the elegiac texture). Three-gate presence, coherent modulation through turns +1.2, charges final image +0.9. However, the tone does not constrain a choice or create friction; it remains atmospheric rather than exerting causal pressure. Ornamental −0.8, no cost tied to tone −0.6, label-only descriptor ("orchid solace" never enacted on page) −0.4.</comment>
