<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is character-specific with concrete embodied detail: "her fingers tracing the grooves" and "her breath hitched, not from fear but from the burden of knowing." The mentor relationship establishes prior causality for her skill and the buckle's significance. The final renunciation—walking away without answering the radio—demonstrates earned endurance with visible cost (isolation, perpetual burden). Minor deduction: the "midnight pattern seeker" label feels ornamental rather than constraining on-page choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a single-scene window and a coherent pressure arc toward Charged Poise at closure. The ending crystallizes options—secure the device, refuse communication—with felt cost (perpetual solitude, unseen heroism). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. The radio message and descent sequence demonstrate motivated progression. One escalation tightening when she "stepped into the dark" forecloses retreat. Cost is legible in "some burdens weren't meant to be shared" and the final image of her walking alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arbor setting constrains choice by height and isolation, forcing the parachute descent. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "bioluminescent spores," "scent of ozone," "skeletal glow of the city." The buckle as micro-setting charges the final moment when she "tucked it into her pocket." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from arbor limb to descent to landing. Minor slip: the "prototype that could rewrite atmospheric pressure" reads vague when specificity would sharpen stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—secure the payload, preserve trust—is signaled early and tightens through the descent sequence. One meaningful deepening when she steps into darkness forecloses hesitation with visible cost (exposure, solitary burden). The choice not to answer the radio at the end demonstrates agency through renunciation. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via rising dread and physical descent. Minor issue: the opposition remains abstract (unnamed "hands that would weaponize silence") rather than embodied, reducing friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: trust as "a parachute you packed yourself," the burden of holding truth, the choice between communication and solitude. The buckle's recurrence reweights meaning from inheritance to active talisman. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "The pattern held. / For now." No thematic echo or explicit statement mars the final third. Subtext operates in silence (the unanswered radio) and the whispered revision of the mentor's lesson. The city waking "to the absence of a disaster" completes the conceptual arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Elara notices grooves, patterns, pressure points. Diction remains character-specific with controlled elevation: "lattice of pressure points," "ghost of a choice well-made." Psychic distance tightens during the descent without head-hopping. The whispered lesson and radio silence carry subtext. Minor deduction: "midnight pattern seeker" and "the watcher's burden" edge toward label-speak rather than fully embodied idiom. Rhythm modulates purposefully from reflective pacing in the arbor to compressed action during descent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully with strong propulsion: "Then she stepped into the dark. / The parachute deployed with a soundless snap." Information density is high; most lines advance character and stakes. Clean grammar and spatial choreography. Deductions: "a man who had taught her to listen to the spaces between sounds, to see the weight of absence" stacks abstractions without concrete grounding; "the burden of knowing" and "the watcher's burden" loop conceptually across paragraphs two and six. Filter-verb reliance ("she had chosen," "she had spent") slightly dulls immediacy in places. No loops touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arbor-above-clouds setting and parachute-as-trust metaphor offer fresh synthesis. The "midnight pattern seeker" role and atmospheric-pressure payload gesture toward originality but remain under-specified. Emotional specificity—"afraid and still move forward"—avoids generic templates. The ending image (bootprints, spores, silence) feels earned rather than convenient. Transformation test: the core choice (secure device, refuse contact) would work in many frames, suggesting mid-range freshness. Risk-taking in the soundless descent and the refusal to explain elevates within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara as "midnight pattern seeker" appears in the opening and her pattern-reading skill drives the buckle mechanism and map recall. Her choices—to descend, secure the device, refuse radio contact—create key turns. The trait shapes two beats (buckle opening, descent navigation) and the ending. Setup early, development in the buckle and descent, payoff in the final renunciation. Causal pressure moderate; the "pattern seeker" label remains somewhat ornamental. Specificity could be sharper. Estimated positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.9. Frictions: swappability −0.4, label-only moments −0.3. Band guidance suggests ~6.5–7.0 neighborhood. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The buckle appears in paragraph two (early signal), is manipulated to open the compartment (beat one), worn during descent as a trust reminder (beat two), and tucked away at the end (payoff). Handling is on-page across three beats. The "trust was a parachute you packed yourself" line charges the buckle's meaning. Its mechanism and inherited weight constrain Elara's emotional state and tactics. Estimated positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5. Frictions: minor swappability −0.3 (could be another inherited tool). Band guidance: strong integration, closure present. Final: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"The watcher's burden" is named explicitly in paragraph six and frames her solitary endurance. It shapes stakes (holding truth, preserving trust) and the ending choice (refusing to share the burden). Present early via "burden of knowing" in paragraph five. Development: informs her silence and the final walk. Payoff: "some burdens weren't meant to be shared." Estimated positives: early signal +0.5, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0. Frictions: label-only treatment −0.5, could be swapped for "duty" or "responsibility" with minor edits −0.5. Band guidance: functional, integral to theme but not irreplaceable in mechanics. Final: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" surfaces in "attentively stitching redundancy into every plan" (paragraph thirteen). The buckle mechanism and fail-safe planning demonstrate the trait on-page. Mentioned once explicitly, embodied in the buckle action and planning reflection. Development: shapes her preparedness. Payoff: implicit in successful landing and device security. Estimated positives: beat involvement +0.4, causal pressure +0.5. Frictions: late explicit mention (second half) −0.4, ornamental phrasing −0.4, swappability −0.5. Band guidance: functional but replaceable. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Revise" appears explicitly when Elara "revising the sequence her mentor had drilled into her" (paragraph seven) to open the buckle, and again when she whispers "the final revision of her mentor's last lesson" (paragraph fifteen). The buckle revision unlocks the schematic; the lesson revision reframes her understanding before the descent. Two distinct beats, both causally linked to major turns. Estimated positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.8. Frictions: could be "adjust" or "refine" −0.4. Band guidance: strong causal role. Final: 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Muscle memory" is signaled in paragraph seven: "her fingers working the buckle's mechanism by muscle memory." It enables the buckle opening (beat one) and the descent choreography: "her body remembered the descent even as her mind raced ahead" (paragraph twenty-one, beat two). Mechanics matter in both beats. Estimated positives: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.5. Frictions: swappability with "habit" or "training" −0.5. Band guidance: shapes tactics, integral to two beats. Final: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "nocturnal arbor above the clouds" is established in the opening line and paragraph nine: "she had chosen this place for its isolation, its height." It constrains choice by forcing the parachute descent (beat one, paragraph sixteen onward). The arbor's height and the cloud layer structure the entire action window. The bioluminescent spores return in the final image as "the faintest shimmer of spores on the wind" (beat two/payoff). Estimated positives: early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6. Frictions: minor—could be another high isolated place −0.3. Band guidance: essential across beats and ending. Final: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Time anchors in "after the radio static clears" (title cue, paragraph four: "the static dissolving"), "the drop is tonight" (paragraph four), "before dawn" (paragraph twelve), and "by the time the first light touched the arbor's highest branches" (paragraph twenty-nine). The nocturnal window tightens urgency across the descent and landing. Three time markers across setup, development, and payoff. Estimated positives: early signal +0.5, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.5. Frictions: time is tracked but not a live countdown that alters moves beat-by-beat −0.6. Band guidance: functional, shapes stakes moderately. Final: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To preserve trust under pressure" is dramatized early: "the faith of those who had no choice but to rely on her" (paragraph thirteen), her securing the device (paragraph twenty-seven), and the final refusal to answer the radio (paragraph twenty-eight): "some burdens weren't meant to be shared." Desire drives three key choices with visible cost (isolation, perpetual burden). Estimated positives: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.5. Frictions: minor abstraction −0.3. Band guidance: essential, high integration. Final: 7.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" coheres in "the parachute deployed with a soundless snap" (paragraph seventeen), "only the echo of her own heartbeat" (paragraph twenty-two), "the city would wake to static, to the absence of a disaster" (paragraph thirty), and "its leaves whispering to no one at all" (paragraph thirty-one). Tone modulates from reflective to action-compressed to solitary without breaking the soundless motif. The final image charges silence with cost. Estimated positives: early signal +0.6, three+ beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6. Frictions: tone is atmospheric rather than forcing a tactical choice −0.4. Band guidance: strong thematic charge, shapes ending image. Final: 7.4.</comment>
