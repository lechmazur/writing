<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reed's motivation to graft onto community is legible and drives the search choice, but her interior life remains abstract—we see her trace paint and organize searchers without embodied contradiction or struggle. The turn from solitary sculptor to community organizer happens cleanly but lacks on-page friction between her want for belonging and the cost of vulnerability. Syl remains a cipher whose scars and violet hands gesture toward depth without dramatized choice, functioning more as symbolic fulfillment than pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (sculptor, orchard, crater rim). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (reeds → arbor → tags → constellation of handprints) and a cadence shift at the ending when Reed presses her palm to the obsidian and feels recognition rather than completion. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Reed stops chasing and accepts kinship as process, with the conceptual cost visible in "some kin arrived in their own time." The final image—lost languages as invitation—reweights prior material with undeniable pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater supply vivid, purposeful detail—trees that refract stories, air humming with lost languages—and the crater's glow literally lights Reed's path during the search. The obsidian arbor constrains touch ("too sharp to touch") and becomes the surface for the collective dedication, charging the closure when Reed feels its hum answer back. Spatial choreography remains clear across crater lip, orchard edge, and village, with the crater functioning as both physical boundary and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grafting onto community—is signaled early and tightens when Reed decides to organize the collective search rather than work alone. The escalation is modest: she finds Syl, they paint together, the village joins, and the arbor is completed with collective touch. One meaningful deepening occurs when Syl's tag shifts from "I was here, and so were you" to "We are here," reweighting the premise from individual trace to collective presence. Agency is Reed's choice to search and to let Syl leave, but the cost—her vulnerability, the uncertainty of Syl's return—is conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the arbor's construction and the search structure: kinship as collaborative making rather than discovery. The final image—lost languages as invitation, not ending—offers a non-literal answer to the belonging question without moralizing. The recurring motif of reeds (bend but never break) and the shift from "I/you" to "we" constrain Reed's choices and reweight the closure, avoiding token symbolic clutter. One slip: "belonging was not a place, but a current" edges toward abstraction in the penultimate paragraph, though the subsequent sensory moment (palm on obsidian, crater's hum) recovers specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric-literary register with purposeful compression ("a wound in the earth where the air hummed") and Reed's perceptual signature (sculptor's attention to material, hollow stems, starlight). Distance is stable third-limited. Two dialogue exchanges are spare and functional, though Syl's lines lack distinct idiom beyond brevity. Minor register drift: "grafted herself onto the village" and "current, something that moved through you when you reached out" read slightly elevated for the tactile sculptor's established texture, and the final reflection flirts with thematic summary rather than image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong in imagery ("branches heavy with fruit that refracts light into stories no one alive could read") and sensory anchoring, with sentence rhythm varying purposefully. Two distinct loops dull momentum: "the arbor" is named eight times across the piece without functional variation, and the phrase "Reed didn't chase" / "Reed went alone" / "Reed traced" creates template cadence in transitions. Figurative density occasionally stacks without payoff—"constellation of touches," "webs woven slowly," "current that moved through you"—blurring clarity in the final third. No major grammatical slips; propulsion is steady but not urgent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, Shimmer Crater, and street-artist-as-ghost premise combine into a cohesive speculative frame, but the emotional arc—solitary artist seeks belonging, finds it through collaborative ritual—follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The shift from individual tags to collective handprints on obsidian is purposeful but anticipated. Syl's elusiveness and the "lost languages" motif gesture toward mystery without delivering a non-obvious payoff; the ending's invitation image is resonant but does not surprise. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode and executes competently within genre expectations, yet offers limited fresh inflection beyond the specific setting details.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Reed is present throughout and her decision to organize the search and to not chase Syl are key turns. Setup clear, development constrains middle choice (search alone vs. collectively), and closure participation solid (presses palm, feels recognition). However, the sculpting itself does not cause turns—she organizes and witnesses more than she carves under pressure—so causal linkage is moderate. Beat involvement: search decision, painting with Syl, final touch = three distinct beats. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, modest causal pressure +0.6 = base ~6.8; swappability −0.4 (could be any artist seeking community) = 6.4, round down 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor appears in opening third, is described as "too sharp to touch but too beautiful to ignore," becomes the surface Syl paints on, and receives the village's handprints at closure. Setup clear, development (Syl tags it), payoff (collective touches complete it, Reed feels its hum). Three beats: Reed builds it, Syl tags it, villagers complete it. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability (sharpness, starlight surface) +0.5, cost connection (completion requires collective risk) +0.4 = ~7.1 base; no major frictions, round to 7.8 for strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Kinship is the thematic spine and the dominant stake: Reed wants to graft onto community, organizes collective search, and the ending reconfigures kinship as process. Setup via Reed's arrival with reeds and carving kin from discards; development through the shared search; payoff in collective handprints and "some kin arrived in their own time." Shapes Reed's choice to search collectively and to stop chasing. Early signal +0.6, two beats (search organization, final realization) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (drives search structure) +0.8 = ~6.3 base; slight abstraction (concept echoed more than mechanics shown) −0.4 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is cited once in narration ("her sympathy bold as the arbor's edges") but does not constrain action or create visible cost. Reed's choice to search is bold, but the text does not link that boldness to sympathetic understanding as a tradeoff. Label-only mention; no beat involvement beyond assertion. Late first appearance (second third) −0.3, ornamental use −0.8, no causal pressure −0.5, no closure linkage −0.6 = cap at ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dedication is the arbor's stated gap and the search's goal. Reed decides the arbor needs a dedication, finds Syl's tag, co-creates the final dedication with Syl and the village, and the completed dedication enables the festival. Setup clear, development (finding tag, painting together), payoff (collective handprints complete it). Two beats: finding tag prompts search, collective painting completes arbor. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure (drives search, enables festival) +0.9 = ~6.2 base; slight swappability (any collaborative act could complete the arbor) −0.3, but specificity of handprint constellation recovers some; round to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The shared search for Syl's tags is signaled when Reed organizes pairs at dusk, shapes the middle sequence (villagers follow tags into the crater), and Reed finds Syl at the arbor. Setup second third, development clear (pairs search, Reed searches alone), payoff indirect (finding Syl, not tag itself). One strong beat (search organization and execution). Late signal −0.3, one beat +0.4, modest causal pressure (search structure drives middle) +0.6, closure linkage weak (Syl found, not tag mystery resolved) +0.3, swappability moderate (any communal quest) −0.4 = ~5.6 base; method's mechanics (following tags) are told, not shown in detail −0.5 = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater are established in opening, supply vivid sensory grounding (humming air, violet glow, refracted light), and the crater's edge is where Reed finds Syl's tag and later Syl herself. The crater's glow lights Reed's path during the search. Setup immediate, development (crater as search space, orchard's crystals hum at dusk), payoff (crater's hum answers Reed's touch). Two beats: crater edge tag, crater's answer at closure. Early signal +0.8, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure moderate (setting enables search but does not force choices) +0.5 = ~6.0 base; specificity (luminous crater, crystalline trees) +0.4 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" functions as tonal/atmospheric frame rather than a tracked timeframe. The lost languages recur at closure ("didn't sound like an ending... sounded like an invitation") but do not tighten decisions or create urgency. No clock pressure; events unfold at dusk and dawn but time does not constrain Reed's choices. Setup as atmosphere, no development as constraint, payoff as metaphor. One beat (final realization). Ornamental timeframe −0.8, no causal pressure −0.7, closure linkage weak (thematic echo, not temporal cost) +0.3 = cap ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Reed's desire to graft onto community is stated early ("she had grafted herself onto the village") and drives her choice to organize the search rather than work alone. The ending dramatizes her acceptance that kinship arrives slowly, with visible cost in not chasing Syl. Setup clear, development (collective search as enactment of belonging), payoff (Reed accepts process, presses palm, feels recognition). Two beats: search choice, final acceptance. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8 = ~6.3 base; slight abstraction (want told more than shown in friction) −0.3, but final embodied moment (palm on obsidian) recovers; round to 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone is consistently luminescent (violet paint, glimmering arbor, crater's glow, starlight) and aching (longing for kin, lost languages, Syl's departure). The tone modulates with pressure: restraint during the search, warmth at collective painting, melancholy when Syl leaves, resonant ache at closure ("not with words, but with the ache of recognition"). Setup immediate, development steady, payoff charges final image. Coherent across all beats and the tone's lyric texture supports the ending's emotional reconfiguration. Strong tone integration with closure; no static mood. High coherence and closure charge trend 7.3.</comment>
