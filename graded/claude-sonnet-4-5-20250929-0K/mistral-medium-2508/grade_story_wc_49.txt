<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior state is legible through embodied action (trembling fingers, kneeling to feel the pulse), and her conflict between safe storytelling and risky truth-singing drives the core choice. The shift from tinkerer to song-keeper is earned by on-page action with visible cost (throat burning, chest tight). However, the interiority occasionally tilts toward label-speak ("the weight of what she'd almost let die") and the emotional progression feels somewhat tidy—fear to action to resolution—without sufficient complication or contradictory impulse acting simultaneously in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently in the opening paragraph and follows an accumulative lens: the vines' decay → song attempt → revival → closure commitment. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis morphing into Charged Poise): Mira commits to teaching the songs, foreclosing her safer tinkerer-only path, and the final image ("stepped into the light") reweights prior material with visible cost (her voice "cracked and uncertain," throat burned). Cost is legible in the song's physical toll and the social commitment she now accepts. One persistent constraint—loss of the songs—shapes tactics throughout and reappears at closure ("Next year, we'll sing louder").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The verdant arbor is sensory and purposeful: brittle tendrils, vines that sag and later unfurl, gourds that wrinkle and plump. The setting constrains Mira's choice (she must kneel, press her palm, feel the pulse) and charges the final image (the arbor "stood tall," leaves "trembling with new stories"). Spatial choreography is clear, and the dawn light bookends the piece. The arbor functions as micro-setting that alters tactics, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Minor deduction: some phrases ("liquid gold," "rivers that ran with starlight") lean decorative without sharpening urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the arbor or lose the village's luck—is signaled early and remains coherent under the accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira's first note cracks yet the arbor responds, raising the cost of continuing. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (her decision to sing despite trembling) and the price is legible (throat burned, chest tight). However, the resistance is largely internal; no external complication or second reversal tests her commitment mid-song, and the vines' cooperation feels immediate rather than grudging, reducing tension in the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—preservation of intangible heritage versus the safety of substitutes—emerges from Mira's shift from "golden stories" to "songs, which demanded truth." The final image (humming the next song, vines swaying) offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between tinkering (control, safety) and singing (vulnerability, tradition). Minor weaknesses: "some things are too precious to lose" edges toward platitude, and the hummingbird automaton's symbolic role (copper wings catching dawn) feels ornamental rather than thematically integrated through prior constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices gears, tendrils, and soil pulse in tactile, specific ways. Diction matches her whimsical tinkerer background ("spun copper," "rusted music boxes") and modulates under pressure (shorter syntax during the song). The whispered exchange with the arbor and the hummingbird's chirp function as mild dialogue substitutes, goal-driven and voice-consistent. Elision of the grandmother's actual teaching moment is purposeful and does not obscure causality. One slip: "the thread connecting all things—the turning gears of her automatons, the pulse of the soil, the slow, sure spin of the cosmos" registers slightly elevated for someone mid-crisis, though it remains borderline acceptable as epiphany diction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies (short bursts during the song, longer sweeps in setup), and no paraphrase loops appear. Figurative language is controlled except in two spots: "liquid gold" (opening) and "rivers that ran with starlight" (backstory example) read as stock metaphors without fresh vehicle logic. The closure image is clean and propulsive. Grammar, tense, and pronoun reference remain consistent throughout. Minor deduction for mild overwriting in the cosmological epiphany line ("the slow, sure spin of the cosmos"), which slightly inflates texture without sharpening the beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tinkerer-turned-song-keeper synthesis is engaging and the harvest arbor premise feels specific. The contrast between mechanical craft and oral tradition offers a fresh angle on preservation-of-heritage tropes. However, the emotional arc (loss → song → restoration → teaching commitment) follows a familiar template, and the vines' immediate positive response reduces risk. The hummingbird automaton, while vivid, does not transform expectation—it decorates rather than complicates. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids the safety middle, but the final image ("stepped into the light") and the promise to teach songs feel narratively inevitable without a bold twist or cost that surprises in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (whimsical tinkerer) is present from the opening line, drives the inciting realization (tools won't save the arbor), makes the key decision to sing despite fear, and appears in the closure commitment to teach. Her tinkerer identity creates the friction (stories are safer than songs) that must be overcome. The character shapes at least three beats (realization, first note, final verse) and the ending choice is causally tied to her arc. Strong integration; her choices create the turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The vine tendril is handled across multiple beats: it twitches near her ankle after the first note, tendrils brush her wrists "as if in thanks," they weave into a living arch at closure, and sway listening in the final line. The object's state evolves (brittle → stirring → woven) with reweighted meaning (dying → responding → alive with stories). The tendril constrains her tactic (she must kneel, press palm to soil) and charges the final image. High integration; removal would break the arbor's agency and the tactile proof of restoration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The harvest moon is signaled early ("swollen overnight, heavy with promise") and sets the temporal urgency (the night when everything aligned). It appears again in the final paragraphs ("The harvest moon's blessing lingered"). However, the moon itself does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics on the page; Mira's decision to sing is driven by the arbor's pulse and her grandmother's warning, not by moon-specific mechanics. The concept frames stakes but does not actively shape the turning points, landing it in the "purposeful reprise" range without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" is established early as Mira's habit ("tales of clockwork foxes and rivers that ran with starlight—because stories were safer than songs") and explains her avoidance of song. However, the attribute itself does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it contextualizes her fear but does not materially alter a beat. The trait is told and remains a backstory label rather than a live friction that she must navigate mid-scene. Functional but largely replaceable with "avoids songs" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The remedy action (singing to restore the arbor) is signaled early ("The remedy wasn't in her tools…but in the thing she'd spent a lifetime avoiding"), drives the middle escalation (first note → louder singing → final verse), and produces the closure outcome (vines plump, gourds gleam, commitment to teach). The action is irreplaceable; swapping it for mechanical repair or external intervention would break the thematic arc and causality. The remedy shapes at least three beats and the ending, with visible cost (throat burned, chest tight). Strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The forgotten songs are signaled in paragraph five ("no one remembered the songs anymore"), Mira reaches for her mother's voice and sings in the middle beats, and the method produces the climactic turn (vines stir, gourds plump). The songs' mechanics matter: the "moon's cradle" final verse flares the harvest light, and the melody is described as "a key, and the lock was time itself." The method is seeded early, tested mid-scene with embodied cost, and shapes closure (she promises to teach the songs). Removal would collapse both causality and theme. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn is introduced in the opening line, its state (brittle tendrils, sagging vines) motivates Mira's kneeling and soil-pressing, and it transforms visibly across beats (twitching tendril, unfurling vines, living arch). The setting pressures her choice (she must act now, at dawn, when alignment occurs) and charges the final image ("arbor stood tall, leaves trembling"). The dawn light bookends the piece. The arbor functions as both macro-setting and active participant, constraining her tactic and enabling the resolution. Strong spatial and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("when everything aligned") is signaled early via the harvest moon and the sacred gourds' ripening window, and it creates implicit urgency (act now or lose the blessing). However, the clock itself is not tracked on the page—no tightening countdown or narrowing window dramatized mid-scene. The alignment concept frames stakes and explains why Mira acts today, but it does not alter her tactics beat-to-beat or force a time-driven choice. Lyric reprise with moderate pressure; useful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (restore sacred practices) is dramatized through her trembling, her memory of her grandmother's warning, and her internal conflict ("stories were safer than songs, which demanded truth"). The desire creates friction (she's avoided the songs) and drives the key choice to sing despite fear. Cost is visible (throat burns, chest tight, "the weight of what she'd almost let die"). The motivation shapes the middle escalation and the closure commitment to teach. Strong integration, though the friction could be sharper if a competing want (e.g., preserving her tinkerer reputation) were tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The "gathering hush" tone is established early ("the leaves rustling like a gathering hush") and modulates with pressure: quiet trembling → cracked first note → louder singing → the arbor's exhale → the final hum. The tone charges the closure image (vines "swayed, listening") and remains coherent through the turns, supporting the accumulative lens. The hush motif recurs with reweighted meaning (from dying silence to attentive listening). The tone is purposeful and integral, shaping the emotional texture of the ending without static repetition.</comment>
