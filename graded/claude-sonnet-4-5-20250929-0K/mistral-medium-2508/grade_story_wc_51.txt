<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elira's motivation to collect burdens is signaled early, but her internal contradiction—coming to release yet becoming trapped—lacks embodied micro-choices that show her wrestling with the cost in real time. The realization "She was not the weaver. She was the loom" arrives as epiphany rather than earned through prior dramatized friction. The final vanishing reads as conceptual surrender, but the path from resistance to acceptance is told via metaphor rather than shown through on-page decisions with visible stakes. The child's fear lingering and the grotto's counter-pressure offer moments of tension, but Elira's agency in those beats remains largely passive observation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: who, where, and action by the opening lines. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (fisherman's grief, blacksmith's rage, child's fear) and the grotto's reciprocal weight, culminating in Elira's conceptual repricing as loom rather than weaver. Closure lands with felt cost: she vanishes, forecloses her prior life, and becomes part of the hush. The epilogue move ("By the next snowmelt...") extends the window but the final image of her absorbed by the grotto charges the premise. One deduction: the turn from "collect" to "be collected" hinges on the grotto's sudden counter-offer, which feels underprepared—no prior cue that the grotto could reverse the transaction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vivid and purposeful: its shingled plates, fissures admitting starlight, and humming resonance constrain Elira's ritual and charge the final absorption. The lamp burner's flame orientation and the grotto's exhalation are tactile, micro-setting details that shape her method. Sensory selection is strong—"kelp" thickness, "rust" flaking, "whalebone harp" vibration—and filtered through her weaver's perception. The timeframe "first snowmelt" softens the earth and sets the grotto humming, a seasonal anchor that ties physicality to the opening beat and the epilogue's cyclical return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing collected burdens to avoid dissolution—is clear and tested on the page. The sequence tightens: fisherman's grief crumbles, blacksmith's rage flakes, child's fear clings, then the grotto reverses pressure by offering back all prior weights. This reversal narrows Elira's options and forces the conceptual trade: she can no longer collect without being claimed. The cost is legible in her vanishing and the villagers' loss of her presence. One friction: the grotto's counter-move arrives without prior setup, so the escalation reads more as reveal than consequence of her prior choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—burden as reciprocal claim, weaver as loom—emerges through the grotto's architecture, the lamp burner's calcifying flame, and Elira's final absorption without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she becomes the medium rather than the agent, and the villagers' relief is sustained by her erasure. The recurring hush and starlight reweight prior images of collection into permanence. No moralizing; the whalebone reverie and shingled silence accumulate conceptual pressure. The thematic question of who bears cost is embodied in Elira's disappearance and the lamp that never goes out.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds throughout with a consistent lyric register: "fractal weaver," "shingled hush," "whalebone reverie" establish voice and tone early. Perceptual signature is strong—Elira notices spiral grooves, flame orientation, bronze exhalations—but under peak stress (grotto's reversal) the prose maintains elevated diction without modulating to sharper urgency. The epilogue shift to village perspective is clean and purposeful. One deduction: repeated constructions like "The grotto [verb]" and "She [verb]" create template cadence in several beats, flattening sentence rhythm during high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"bronze throat blackened by soot and whispered secrets," "weights she'd gathered...thick as kelp...sharp as a misplaced chisel...light as a moth's wing"—and while vivid, the accumulation risks overwriting in peak beats where simpler syntax would sharpen propulsion. Several paraphrase loops: "She was not the weaver. She was the loom" is thematically apt but the prior paragraph already enacts that realization through "They had never truly left." Template cadence appears in repeated "The grotto [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. No major clarity breaks, but the line-level embellishment dulls momentum at the climax. Information density is strong; no scaffolding or filler. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of fractal patterns, calcification ritual, and the weaver-as-loom inversion offers a specific angle on burden-bearing that avoids generic therapy-speak. The bronze grotto as resonant instrument and the lamp burner's orienting flame are particular, world-integrated choices. The turn from agent to medium is earned in hindsight by the grotto's layered memory and Elira's recursive function. One reservation: the "weaver becomes loom" metaphor, while executed with care, echoes familiar self-sacrifice tropes in fantasy; the piece elevates it through tactile detail and the epilogue's cyclical return, but the core premise remains recognizable. Risk-taking in tone and structure (lyric accumulation, quiet vanishing) supports the theme without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elira is present throughout and makes key moves—kneeling, tracing the burner, striking the match, singing, tilting the flame, leaning closer to release the child's fear—but most beats read as enactment of a known ritual rather than improvisation under pressure. Her decision to return at the end and press her forehead to the grotto is a clear choice with consequence (vanishing), satisfying all three gates and tying to closure. Score reflects solid integration with one reservation: her agency in the reversal beat (grotto's counter-offer) is largely passive reception.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lamp burner appears early (paragraph 2), is handled in multiple beats (striking match, tilting to align flame with fissures, final setting down), and its cold state at dawn signals cost. The flame's orientation mechanics and the burner's calcifying function drive the middle ritual and charge the final image ("The lamp burner never went out"). All three gates met; causal and closure linkage strong. Specificity high—brass throat, blackened soot, flame alignment—and irreplaceable to the method. One friction: it could be any ritual object with flame; the kerosene detail itself doesn't constrain choice beyond generic fire-source.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "shingled hush" is introduced in paragraph 5 and recurs throughout as atmospheric texture layering silence. It anchors the grotto's recursive memory and informs Elira's boundary-less trapping, shaping her final absorption when "the hush settle[s] *inside* her...as a cradle." Present in closure and developmentally tied to her passivity. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is implicit in the hush's constraining her motion. Score reflects solid thematic resonance but limited causal work—it frames the trap rather than forcing tactical choice. Lyric-resonance allowance applies.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is introduced in paragraph 5, describes Elira's state throughout, and motivates her need to calcify burdens before dissolution. It constrains her by making escape impossible and informs her final acceptance. Present in setup and closure (she becomes part of the hush rather than escaping it), but the trait itself doesn't force a discrete tactical pivot—it's more atmospheric condition than active friction. Middle gate is implicit. Lyric use charges the theme; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Calcification is the dominant action: fisherman's grief "calcified with a sound like ice fracturing," blacksmith's rage "flaking away like rust," and the method anchors the middle ritual. Elira's final realization that "the thousands of weights she had calcified...had become part of the hush" reweights the act and drives closure. All three gates met; causal role in multiple beats. One friction: the verb "calcify" could be replaced with "crystallize" or "harden" without major structural change—specificity is thematic rather than mechanically unique. Still, the action shapes stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is signaled in paragraph 7 ("This was the method: by orienting properly, the fire would pull the weights") and executed when Elira tilts the lamp burner to align flame with fissures. The method is attempted, tested on three burdens, and implicitly succeeded in the epilogue when the lamp never goes out. Setup and middle gates met; closure linkage is indirect (the method's success sustains her vanishing). The mechanics matter—alignment with starlight through cracks—but the orientation could be abstracted to "ritual precision" with minor edits. Solid integration; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is introduced in paragraph 1 ("beneath it, the bronze grotto hummed"), anchors every beat (walls that "shingle the silence," fissures admitting starlight, plates groaning with memory), and drives the reversal when "the grotto itself" presses its own weight onto Elira. Its shingled architecture and resonant properties constrain her ritual and enable the final absorption. All three gates strongly met; causal pressure high. The grotto is indispensable—remove it and the story's physics, stakes, and closure collapse. Specificity (bronze, shingled, humming) and closure charge are exemplary.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" opens the story, softens the earth, and sets the grotto humming. The epilogue returns to "the next snowmelt" for cyclical framing. Setup and closure gates met; middle development absent—time doesn't tighten decisions or track causally within the ritual. The timeframe is more seasonal anchor than live clock. Functional but replaceable with another transitional marker. Lyric reprise reweights the opening slightly; causal pressure low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To collect" is stated in paragraph 4 ("Tonight, she had come to collect"), enacted across the ritual (gathering fisherman's grief, blacksmith's rage, child's fear), and inverted at closure when the grotto collects her. All three gates met; motivation drives multiple beats and the final reversal reweights it decisively. Friction between her desire to release and the grotto's reciprocal claim generates the story's core cost. One reservation: the motivation is more role-based duty than conflicted personal want, which limits interiority. Still, it shapes stakes and ending strongly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" is introduced in paragraph 14 and recurs at the end ("a wordless tune, vibrating like a whalebone harp"). The tone—slow, resonant, elegiac—holds through turns and modulates subtly from urgency (striking the match) to surrender (pressing forehead to bronze). Setup is late but purposeful; development and closure gates met. The tone charges the final image of Elira's absorption and the villagers' distant hearing. Coherence is strong; the whalebone metaphor is specific and tied to her singing. One friction: "reverie" implies dreaminess that slightly tensions the ritual's concrete stakes, though the effect reads intentional.</comment>
