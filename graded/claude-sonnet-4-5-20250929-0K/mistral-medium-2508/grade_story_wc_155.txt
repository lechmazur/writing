<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to rediscover lost joy is established early and her choices to map the district, capture the fragment, and create the projection all flow from this desire. The piece keeps her interior focused on the work rather than therapeutic self-diagnosis; emotions are tied to the task ("her breath catch," "hands trembled"). However, the final transformation feels convenient—the fog parts, the scent of peaches materializes, the woman reaches into the projection—without on-page friction or cost to Liora herself. The ending promises future work but doesn't foreclose a path or exact a felt price scaled to the length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Liora, ruined orchard, fog-bound district, "first time") arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Liora finds the fragment, develops the film by pressing it against the fresco, then strings the film in the orchard to project the lost festival onto the fog. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the orchard "no longer felt like a ruin" but "a promise," reweighting the space's meaning and Liora's stance. Cost is conceptual (the film will fade by morning) but not viscerally felt or paid by Liora; the transformation is witnessed by others without her forfeiting anything on the page, which keeps the ending just shy of high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fog-shrouded orchard is vivid and selective: skeletal trees, moss-softened earth, the greenhouse patched with waxed canvas, light slanting "in strange, liquid ways." Spatial choreography is clean (orchard → studio → orchard), and the environment directly charges the closure—stringing film between dead trees turns the fog itself into a canvas. The micro-setting (the fresco fragment, the film, the vials of light-paint) shapes Liora's method and the final projection. However, the sensory catalog leans visual throughout; scent of peaches and the buzz of laughter appear only in the climactic projection, not earlier to ground Liora's lived experience of the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy and stitching time's torn edges—is signaled in the opening third and pursued through each beat. The piece tightens once when Liora realizes she must display the film publicly ("She knew what she had to do"), but this beat lacks visible hesitation or cost; no one objects, no resource is scarce, no danger emerges. The climactic projection brings others to witness the transformation, yet Liora's agency is curatorial rather than under pressure; coincidence (the fog parts, the last light cooperates) completes the effect. The stakes remain abstract ("a promise") rather than testing a concrete trade-off or foreclosing a path for Liora with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory, loss, artistic retrieval of joy, collective vs. solitary experience—emerges organically from the fragment, the film, and the projection without overt moralizing. The ending image ("The fog rolled back in… but the orchard no longer felt like a ruin. It felt like a promise") offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the space and Liora's work. However, the knowledge network is invoked twice in summary fashion ("a web of whispers," "would carry the memory forward") without showing how it constrains or complicates Liora's choices; it functions as theme decoration rather than lived friction. The piece avoids platitudes but leans on abstract diction ("the weight of what had been," "the ghost of moments") in reflective blocks that float above concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"soft with moss like a memory half-forgotten," "the air itself had been thick with the scent of ripening peaches and the buzz of shared laughter." Liora's perceptual signature (artist's eye, focus on light and pigment) is consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight on her hands and breath when she finds the fragment, then pulling back to witness the crowd's reaction at the climax. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not engaged. A few filter verbs cluster without harm ("made her breath catch," "felt like grief"), and one phrase—"exposed film she'd been developing, the emulsion still wet and sensitive, hungry for impressions"—anthropomorphizes the film in a way that briefly slips register but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats and information density is high in the opening (fragment, pigments, district history) without dragging. However, paraphrase loops appear: "captured light, bottled in glass vials" is immediately followed by "mixed not from crushed minerals but from captured light"; "the orchard had once been a place of festivals, where people danced" echoes "where the air itself had been thick with… shared laughter" two lines later. Template cadence: "She knew the stories: that… where… where…" and "It was… if…" structures recur. The reflective blocks (knowledge network exposition, "why she painted with light") summarize rather than advance pressure. Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. The closing line "began to mix new paints" is concrete and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—artist uses light-painting and exposed film to resurrect a lost festival from a fresco fragment—offers a fresh synthesis of archival recovery and ephemeral projection. The orchard-as-palimpsest and the fog-as-canvas are specific to this world. However, the emotional arc (solitary artist rekindles communal joy through her work, onlookers are moved, the space is redeemed) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or complication. The "knowledge network" and "paints mixed from captured light" are intriguing but underused; neither constrains Liora's choices with visible cost. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but retreats from risk at closure by granting the projection effortless success and unanimous resonance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Liora is established early (fresco discovery, her pigments, years of mapping). Her choices drive all key beats: brushing away earth, carrying the fragment to her studio, pressing it to film, stringing the film in the orchard. These decisions alter tactics (finding → developing → displaying) and culminate in the public projection that transforms the orchard's meaning. However, her choices are not tested by friction or cost on the page; each step succeeds without obstacle, reducing causal pressure. She is present at closure but does not make a final decision that forecloses a path—she observes the transformation, then plans to "mix new paints." Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears in the opening beat (discovery), is handled in the studio (pressed against film, "warm to the touch"), and is tucked into Liora's pocket at closure with "its secret shared," completing a before/after arc. It enables the film image to emerge and is described with evolving stakes ("edges soft with moss," "edges now smooth with handling"). Present in setup, middle development, and ending, it drives two beats (discovery and film exposure) and shapes the final transformation. Strong integration, but it could be replaced by another artifact (painting, scroll) with minor edits; the fragment's specific properties (fresco technique, child's joy) are mentioned but not mechanically essential to Liora's method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Exposed film is introduced in the studio scene (~40% mark), where Liora places the fragment against it and waits for the image to emerge. It appears again when she strings the film in the orchard, turning it into the projection surface. The film's mechanics—"emulsion still wet and sensitive, hungry for impressions"—are described but not constrained by cost (no failed exposure, no scarcity). It participates in two beats (development and display) and is present at closure ("The film would fade by morning"), providing the mechanism for the climactic transformation. However, it is introduced late and its properties are convenient rather than tactically limiting; a photograph or painting could serve a similar role with minor rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is mentioned in the opening paragraph ("pigments she carried—her own strange paints, mixed… from captured light, bottled in glass vials") and recurs in the studio reflection ("painted with light because it was the only medium that didn't lie"). It informs Liora's method (using film to capture and project the fragment's image) and reappears at closure when she "began to mix new paints." Present in setup, middle rationale, and ending gesture, it frames her artistic identity and the story's core conceit. However, the vials themselves are never handled or constrained on the page; the attribute remains conceptual rather than tactically limiting. The specificity (light vs. mineral pigments) is unique but not mechanically indispensable—other archival/projection methods could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The display—stringing exposed film between dead trees, letting it catch light and project onto the fog—is the story's climax. It draws the crowd, materializes the lost festival, and reweights the orchard from ruin to promise. Present in the ending sequence with clear before/after stakes, it drives the major turn and directly shapes the closure effect (transformation witnessed by onlookers, Liora's renewed commitment). The action is specific and irreplaceable in its method (film-as-banner, fog-as-canvas). However, the display succeeds without friction or cost; no one interrupts, the weather cooperates, and the outcome is unambiguously positive, which reduces the felt price and keeps it from indispensability in the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The knowledge network is mentioned twice: in the opening third as "a web of whispers left by other artists, scholars, and drifters" through which Liora "spent years mapping the district's secrets," and at closure when it "hummed to life" as others sensed the shift and "would carry the memory forward." It is described but never shown in use—Liora does not consult it on the page, and it does not constrain or enable a specific choice. Its presence at closure is ornamental (a thematic echo of collective memory) rather than causal. Setup and ending mentions touch two gates, but the lack of middle development and the summary-only treatment keep it replaceable; the story's logic would hold if Liora worked alone.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district is established in the opening paragraph ("abandoned long before she was born, swallowed by the fog that never lifted, its trees skeletal and silvered") and recurs throughout: loam where the fragment is found, the greenhouse studio, and the orchard where film is strung between trees at closure. The fog functions as both constraint (isolating the district, obscuring the past) and resource (canvas for the projection). The setting directly shapes the climactic action (dead trees as posts, fog as screen) and is reweighted at closure ("no longer felt like a ruin. It felt like a promise"). Present in setup, middle, and ending with specific causal contributions. Strong integration, though the fog's mechanics are convenient (it parts at the right moment) rather than tactically limiting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" appears once in the film-development beat: "It was a daydream made solid, a fold in time she could almost step into." The phrase describes the emergent image's quality but does not function as a tracked timeframe or constraint. Liora's work unfolds across an unspecified duration (years of mapping, then a single day or evening from discovery to dusk projection), but the daydream metaphor does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. Present in the middle third but ornamental; it could be replaced with "vision," "memory," or "illusion" without altering causality. No setup, weak development, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to rediscover lost joy is stated in the studio reflection ("This was why she painted with light—to rediscover lost joy, to stitch the torn edges of time back together") and dramatized through her choices: seeking the fragment, developing the image, and staging the public projection. It drives the dominant stake and is present at closure when the orchard transforms and she plans to continue her work. However, the motivation is more told than shown-in-conflict; Liora does not face a competing desire or a cost that tests her commitment. The piece centers the motivation across all beats but does not friction it with doubt, scarcity, or trade-off, which keeps it from indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Pensive mirth threads through the prose: Liora's quiet focus and trembling hands (pensive) paired with the child's vivid laughter in the fragment and the festival's "buzz of shared laughter" (mirth). The tone modulates—reflective and somber in the opening ("grief"), cautiously hopeful in the studio, then opening to communal wonder at the projection ("a woman reached out, her face alight"). The closing line ("She smiled, her breath curling into the dark, and began to mix new paints") lands on restrained optimism. Tone is coherent and purposeful, charging the final image with earned warmth. However, the mirth element is largely projected onto the fresco and the crowd rather than embodied in Liora's own interiority, which keeps it from full integration.</comment>
