<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to restore laughter is clear and embodied through his tunnel ritual, with the pull cord handle worn smooth from use grounding his obsession. Internal conflict appears ("mournfully eager," the contradiction of coaxing false laughter) but lacks simultaneous pressure in scene—he never wrestles with the futility mid-act until the blower dies. The final shift when he climbs to join the household feels under-earned; no prior micro-choice dramatizes his readiness to stop conducting, making the turn more declared than discovered. The hourglass functions as motif but doesn't constrain a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elias), where (tunnel beneath household), and the ritual clearly. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the tunnel symphony accumulates meaning through lyric repetition until real laughter breaks the pattern, reweighting Elias's project. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias hears real laughter, lowers the blower, and climbs to the surface, with the hourglass "finally full" repricing his prior effort. Cost is legible but soft: he abandons the ritual, yet no visible forfeiture or trade-off sharpens the moment—he simply joins a scene already resolved above him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is vivid and functional: acoustics twist sound into "something almost holy," the wind curls back on itself, and the space constrains Elias's ritual. The pull cord handle, blower, and hourglass recur with purpose. The tunnel's stillness at the end ("holding its breath") charges the closure image when Elias sets the blower down, its handle "pointing toward the surface like an accusation." Spatial choreography is clean (tunnel, ladder, threshold, household interior) and the autumn leaves at the end tie setting to theme without forced symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restoring laughter to the household—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the blower dies and real laughter erupts, forcing Elias to confront his ritual's irrelevance. Agency is present (he climbs to join them) but the pressure does not escalate through his choices; the household's laughter breaks out independently, making the turn situational rather than driven by protagonist decision. Cost is implied (abandoning the tunnel, relinquishing control) but never felt as a trade-off—the household welcomes him without friction, softening the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief, proxy gestures, and the need to be heard rather than conducted—emerges through image and ritual without overt statement. The hourglass, tunnel acoustics, and leaf blower synthesize into a coherent inquiry: can manufactured joy heal, or must authentic connection replace control? The final image of the blower's handle "pointing toward the surface like an accusation" and the decision that "some things didn't need conducting" reweight the premise without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution, leaving Elias's prior efforts both futile and somehow necessary—a credible ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during tunnel ritual, slight withdrawal at the end). Diction is controlled: "macerated the silence," "mournfully eager," "pull cord handle glinting in the dim light" create a distinct texture. Filter verbs ("wondered," "decided") appear but feel voice-motivated. Elias's perceptual signature (the acoustics, the hourglass's fingerprints, the wind's half-sung lullabies) is consistent. Minor voice convergence: the child's joke and the family's laughter are told rather than shown, flattening their distinctness, but the effect serves economy at this length.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("ghost of a thousand leaf blowers," "brittle things, shattering"). Clarity is strong in most beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Maybe the unspoken didn't need tending. Maybe it just needed to be heard" restates the same insight across two sentences without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the dream sequence: "That night, Elias dreamed… He woke… Outside, the first leaves…" (three consecutive transit beats with identical stem structure, −0.4). The metaphor "hourglass…finally full" contradicts its earlier "last grain slipped" imagery (−0.3 for mixed metaphor). Information density is high elsewhere, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief ritual, acoustics, and domestic distance feels specific and non-obvious. The leaf blower as instrument and the tunnel as echo chamber transform the familiar "healing grief" premise through grounded, sensory detail. The turn—Elias realizing his proxy gestures are obsolete when real laughter emerges—is earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is present (the lyric repetition of lullabies and wind, the sustained metaphor of conductor) without obscuring clarity. The hourglass and pull cord handle recur with purpose, but the final line "wherever it had gone, was finally full" leans slightly abstract, softening the particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias as "leaf blower symphony conductor" frames the ritual early and appears in multiple beats: macerating silence, sending lullabies, freezing when real laughter erupts, and abandoning the blower. His decision to climb the ladder alters tactics (stops conducting, joins the household). However, the climactic choice is reactive—real laughter appears without his agency—so his role in the key turn is passive. Present in setup, middle, and ending; shapes one major choice but does not drive the decisive reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The pull cord handle appears in at least three beats: worn smooth from use (establishing obsession), yanked harder than usual when the blower dies (triggering the turn), glinting as Elias leaves it behind, and recurring in his dream ("over and over"). It anchors his ritual and charges the ending image ("pointing toward the surface like an accusation"). However, the handle does not constrain a tactical choice—its presence is symbolic rather than causal. Strong reprise and thematic weight, but shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tending to the unspoken" shapes Elias's entire ritual: coaxing echoes of joy into the household's cracks, addressing grief he cannot speak aloud. It drives his nightly tunnel work and frames the realization that "maybe the unspoken didn't need tending. Maybe it just needed to be heard." This insight reweights the premise at closure. However, the concept is more thematic than tactical—it does not narrow options or create visible friction in a beat. Present across setup, middle, and ending; essential to meaning but not to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" appears twice: opening line and final paragraph ("mournfully eager no longer"). It colors Elias's voice but does not constrain or enable an on-page action—no choice hinges on this duality. The ending reprises it to signal change, but the shift is asserted rather than earned through a beat where the trait created visible cost. Label-only use without causal pressure; lyric reprise alone cannot lift above mid-band without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Macerate" (shredding silence with controlled bursts) appears once, anchoring the ritual's sensory texture. It does not drive a turn or reappear at closure—easily replaceable with "disrupt" or "fragment" without structural loss. Single functional beat; no closure linkage or causal pressure. Specificity adds texture but the action itself is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" establishes the method early and recurs: Elias pushes his father's tunes through the blower's roar, the notes bend in the tunnel, and lullabies later vanish from the dream wind. The method defines his ritual and its failure, but it does not constrain a tactical choice or meaningfully shift at closure—the real laughter emerges independently. Present in setup and middle; thematic but not mechanically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel shapes Elias's entire ritual: acoustics twist sound into "something almost holy," the wind curls back, and the space hides him from the household. It pressures his choices (he returns nightly, listens in silence at the end) and charges the closure image when he leaves the blower there, handle pointing up. The tunnel's stillness ("holding its breath") reweights the final moment. Present in setup, middle, and ending; constrains action and charges the final image with undeniable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" anchors the story's temporal premise and recurs (Elias listens "night after night," the glass runs empty again, the closing image "finally full"). However, the hourglass does not tighten a decision—no clock forces a choice or alters tactics. Its function is symbolic (marking time, then repricing it) rather than causal. Present in setup and ending but lacks middle development or urgency that would pressure a beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's desire to restore laughter drives his tunnel ritual from the opening and is tested when real laughter breaks out, forcing him to confront his project's futility. The motivation is dramatized through action (pulling the cord, listening, climbing the ladder) and carries friction: he cannot bring his father back, only coax echoes. Cost is legible (abandoning the ritual, joining the household) but the final beat softens the trade-off—he is welcomed easily, reducing conflict. Present across setup, middle, and ending; drives two major beats but closure could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"True haunting" is coherent and purposeful: the tunnel hums with "the ghost of a thousand leaf blowers," the household has "forgotten how to laugh," and Elias's ritual conjures "false laughter" via acoustics. Tone modulates under pressure (the blower's dying gasp, real laughter breaking through, the dream of endless pull cords). The final image of the blower left behind and the household "vibrating" with laughter charges the ending without melodrama. However, the tone does not shift decisively—it sustains a single elegiac register rather than reweighting itself at closure.</comment>
