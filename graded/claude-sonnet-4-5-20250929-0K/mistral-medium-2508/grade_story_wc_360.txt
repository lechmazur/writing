<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—to understand "the mathematics of emotion"—remains abstract throughout. The borrowed personalities are described rather than embodied in distinct micro-choices; the widow's voice "clings" but doesn't visibly alter his syntax or decision-making on the page. The final turn ("You were never the printer. You were the page.") arrives as revelation rather than earned contradiction worked through prior impulses. The cost of letting go borrowed emotions is asserted in the ending rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who and where early, satisfying the orientation test. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: halo fragment usage, star-vanishing pattern, and shifting ink accumulate toward a conceptual repricing in the final image. However, the closure unit—"You were never the printer. You were the page."—reconfigures the premise through direct statement rather than image or action, and the cost remains oblique. The because/therefore linkage is weak; the halo fragment "dissolves" and the stars "speak back" without clear causal grounding in prior action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The workshop is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ink, crushed topaz, lead type whispers, topaz dust raining). The halo fragment functions as a micro-setting element that constrains Elias's choices—he presses it into the platen, and it pulses, moves the ink, and rises suspended. The vanishing stars create atmospheric pressure and return transformed at the end, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the mathematics of emotion—is signaled early but remains conceptual. The halo fragment's pulse and the moving ink constitute a tightening, and Elias's decision to "let the borrowed emotions dissolve" marks a turn, but the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff. The stars' return feels like a gift rather than a consequence of protagonist agency. Coincidence (the fragment's arrival, its autonomous activation) complicates but does not resolve, yet the resolution itself—stars speaking in feelings—lacks on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of borrowed empathy versus authentic self-expression—emerges through image (printer/page, halo as mirror) and the recurring motif of borrowed voices. The final line "You were never the printer. You were the page." offers a conceptual answer but edges toward direct statement rather than non-literal resonance. The crossing-out of his name and the choice to "give" rather than "capture" gesture toward earned wisdom, but the particulars of transposed empathy are never dramatized in a micro-choice with visible friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "stars vanished like breath on glass," "wet silk," "topaz dust rained." The prose modulates effectively under pressure—short declaratives accelerate in the final third. However, at the climax, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("lucid turbulence," "transposed empathy, raw and unfiltered") that reads more thematic than character-specific. No dialogue to evaluate; internal voice remains coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly controlled. Minor density issues: "The halo fragment burned cold against his skin. The stars outside winked out in a final, deliberate pattern—a sequence, a proof." restates the same content (stars vanishing deliberately) without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "He let the widow's voice dissolve... let the blacksmith's anger unknot... let the child's hope flood..." reads as list rather than accumulation of cost. No major loops or artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress craft, halo fragments, and borrowed empathy is specific and non-obvious. The vanishing-stars timeframe and the final reconfiguration (printer→page) offer fresh angles. However, the core emotional arc—artist learns to give rather than take—follows a familiar trajectory. The transposed-empathy mechanism is asserted rather than shown through grounded detail of how a borrowed voice alters perception or speech. Risk-taking in structure and image is present but does not fully transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the final choice to print his own hand, but most prior action is observation or reflection. The decision to "let the borrowed emotions dissolve" is described rather than enacted through a choice that alters tactics. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, but causal pressure is weak—his choices don't narrow options or impose visible cost until the very end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in setup (caught in apron), is pressed as a die in the middle beats, pulses and causes ink to move, rises suspended, and dissolves into ink at closure. It drives at least three beats and its transformation charges the final image. High irreplaceability—the story's mechanics depend on this exact object. Cost connection is present but oblique (it "burns cold," then dissolves).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named and thematically present ("He borrowed personalities the way others borrowed books"), but it does not constrain or enable a key on-page action with visible friction. The widow's grief, blacksmith's anger, and child's hope are listed in the climax but not dramatized in earlier micro-choices. The concept shapes theme more than tactics. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The trait is established early ("He borrowed personalities the way others borrowed books") and returns at closure when Elias lets the borrowed voices dissolve. However, the borrowing itself is never shown constraining a choice or imposing a visible tradeoff in the middle beats. The widow's cadence "clings" but doesn't alter his speech or perception in a dramatized way. Label-only in development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Disorient" is named as method ("Deliberate ambiguity was his method. If he could disorient the viewer...") but the action itself—creating disorienting sigils—does not drive a major turn or escalate pressure. The moving ink and face that appears are results, not acts of disorientation by Elias. The element is swappable; he could have used any artistic method without altering the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Deliberate ambiguity is declared as Elias's method in the first third, but the mechanics never matter to escalation or closure. The sigils he prints are described as ambiguous, yet the story does not show how that ambiguity tests a choice or alters an outcome. The method could be replaced with "precision" or "layering" without structural impact. Mentioned, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop under stars is established early with vivid sensory detail and returns charged at closure when "the stars, at last, began to speak back." The workshop's walls tremble and topaz dust rains during the climax, creating atmospheric pressure. The setting supplies the halo fragment and the press mechanism, both of which alter tactics. Two gates plus closure linkage, with some causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in the opening ("three nights prior," "the hour when the stars vanished") and recurs at key beats ("Outside, the stars were vanishing again," "The stars outside winked out in a final, deliberate pattern"). The vanishing pattern tightens urgency and the stars' return marks closure. However, elapsed time within the workshop scene is not tracked, and the timeframe does not constrain a tactical choice. Setup, development, and closure participation present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elias's desire to understand the mathematics of emotion is signaled early and named repeatedly, but it remains abstract. The motivation does not generate friction or force a tradeoff in the middle beats—he presses the halo fragment, observes the result, and the revelation arrives without a contested choice. The final shift to "give" rather than "capture" gestures toward growth, but the want versus cost is told rather than dramatized. Setup and closure participation present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates effectively: the opening is atmospheric and deliberate, the middle builds tension ("A sound like a thousand needles dropping"), and the ending shifts to lyric expansion ("the stars, at last, began to speak back"). The phrase "lucid turbulence" appears once in the text, labeling rather than embodying the tone. Tone charges the final image and supports the accumulative lens. Two gates plus closure linkage.</comment>
