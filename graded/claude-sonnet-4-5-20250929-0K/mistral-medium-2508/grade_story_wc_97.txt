<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lena's internal state is consistently rendered through embodied action—winding a stopped clock, reading compasses, splicing film—and her longing is steely rather than maudlin. The reunion scene shows restraint ("You're late" / "So are you") with subtext carried in gesture and the clock's chime rather than exposition. Minor slip: the lover's "lifetimes learning how to apologize" edges toward告 sentiment without full dramatization of his prior absence as choice or renunciation. The final cost—sitting at a new piano, suspended above endings—reads as Earned Stasis with visible opportunity cost (the old arbor, the old waiting) rather than unearned wish fulfillment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (tidal arbor, station piano, Lena) land cleanly in the opening lines. The story accumulates pressure through compasses flickering, film spliced with hidden path, projector stuttering to life, door manifesting, and the clock chiming—each beat reweights the stake (reunion vs. endless waiting) until the final image reconfigures longing into presence with felt cost (the arbor "suspended above the rules of endings"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the compasses still, the clock swings true, and Lena plays "not for the past, but for the encore," crystallizing her shift from retrospective grief to forward motion. Cost is legible in the line "She didn't look back when the projector sputtered out"—she forfeits the recorded past to enter the manifested refuge. One minor seam: the lover's sudden appearance risks convenience, but the story mitigates this by framing the reunion as Lena's construction (film, compasses, her willful act) rather than luck.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arbor itself—gnarled branches above clouds, groaning, sighing—functions as both setting and constraint, its tidal shifts tracked by the compasses and its liminal position (above/below, bark/door) enabling the final passage. The piano, clock, film projector, and compasses are all micro-settings that pressure Lena's choices: she must thread the reel, play to unfold the path, carry the clock to make it chime. Sensory detail is purposeful (salt-yellowed ivories, ozone and old paper, wind humming through leaves) and filtered through Lena's practical focus. Spatial choreography is clean: piano → projector → door → new room → new piano. The setting charges the final image: "suspended above the clouds, above the rules of endings."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reunion with the lost lover vs. endless solitary vigil. Lena's agency drives escalation: she studies compasses (desperation into plan), splices hidden frames into the film (strategically creative), threads the projector, plays piano to unfold the path, and walks through the manifested door. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when the compasses lock in unison and the film's path becomes real, narrowing her options to "walk or remain." Cost is visible: she abandons the old piano and station, the projector burns out, and she crosses a threshold that forecloses return. Minor limitation: the lover's arrival in the refuge risks feeling like reward without parallel cost on his side, though the dialogue ("You're late" / "So are you") implies mutual culpability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—longing as labor, refusal of passive grief, creativity as agency against fate—emerges through concrete particulars: daily clock-winding, compass mapping, film splicing. The anniversary clock and compasses recur with shifting weight: static relics → tools → omens → fulfilled markers. Subtext operates in silence and image (the clock chiming for the first time, compasses pointing inward). The final image resists moralizing: Lena plays "not for the past, but for the encore," reweighting retrospection into generative presence without explaining the lesson. The arbor holding them "above the rules of endings" offers Conceptual Repricing (the story questions whether closure requires loss) with undeniable emotional cost (they are suspended, not landed). No thematic echo or prompt-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, no head-hopping. Lena's perceptual signature is consistent: practical, strategic, tinged with quiet defiance ("her longing steely as the blade of a knife"). Psychic distance tightens slightly under pressure ("She exhaled, her breath visible") without over-explaining. The lover's brief dialogue carries distinct subtext (apologetic smile, mirrored retort). Diction is elevated but stays within a voice that maps invisible currents and splices film with hidden notation. Minor issue: "strategically creative" and "surprise fate with an unplanned encore" edge toward authorial framing rather than Lena's idiom, though they remain borderline acceptable as free indirect summary of her internal stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high (most lines advance setting, character, or pressure). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "compasses flickered like dying fireflies," "music stretched behind her like a wake," "horizon was swallowing the sun." Two issues lower the score: (1) mild overwriting in the middle ("The footage was old—grainy images… But Lena had spliced in something new: frames of a path, revealed only when the light hit the celluloid just right") stacks modifiers without clear propulsion, and (2) near-paraphrase loop in "The compasses in her pocket shuddered, their needles locking in unison" followed two lines later by "The compasses in her pocket stilled, their needles pointing inward"—synonym churn without added pressure. Sentence openings vary; no grammar errors. The Loop/Scaffold penalty (−0.4) and mild density slip keep this below 7.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—longing materialized through film-as-map, compasses reading desire instead of north, music as conjuration—feels specific and non-obvious. The story avoids stock reunion tropes by making Lena the architect of her own closure rather than a passive recipient. The arbor setting and the film-splicing method offer fresh angles. Minor limitation: the "lover who promised to return" frame is familiar, and the story does not fully dramatize what kept him away or whether his absence was chosen or imposed, leaving one edge of the premise under-transformed. Risk-taking (lyric-accumulative structure, sustained metaphor, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena (wistful station pianist) is present throughout, makes all key choices (studying compasses, splicing film, threading projector, walking the path), and her decisions create every major turn. She appears in the opening line and drives the closure (sitting at the new piano, playing for the encore). Her choices shape tactics (mapping currents, using film as guide) and the final reconfiguration (choosing to play forward instead of backward). Cost is visible: she abandons the old station and projector. High causal pressure, early signal, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (the story is hers).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken anniversary clock appears in paragraph two (setup), Lena winds it daily (ongoing interaction), she carries it through the door (middle beat), and it chimes at the reunion (closure participation), finally swinging true on the table. The clock's state evolution—stopped → carried warm with swinging pendulum → chiming → "swinging true for the first time in years"—drives emotional beats and charges the final image. High beat involvement (three distinct moments), closure linkage, and causal pressure (the chime marks the threshold crossing). Its brokenness and repair are irreplaceable markers of Lena's arc from grief to presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Flickering compasses (core concept) appear early (paragraph five), Lena studies their erratic dances and uses them to map invisible currents (setup and middle development). They shudder and lock in unison when the film reveals the path (middle beat), then still with needles pointing inward at closure (payoff). The concept shapes her tactics (mapping, waiting for alignment) and charges the final image (inward-pointing = reunion achieved). Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage; the compasses enable rather than constrain. Two-beat involvement and specificity lift the score, but they do not introduce visible cost on their own.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" (attribute) is introduced in paragraph five ("turning superstition into science, desperation into a plan") and demonstrated when Lena splices hidden frames into the film (middle beat). The trait enables the key tactic (film-as-map) but does not constrain or impose a felt tradeoff; it reads as a strength without friction. It does not recur at closure or carry visible cost. Setup and middle development present, but no closure participation and no price tied to the trait. Moderate causal enablement, but swappable with "resourceful" or "ingenious."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Refuge" (action/goal) is seeded early ("A refuge, hidden in the flicker between what was and what could be," paragraph seven) and drives the entire second half: Lena threads the reel to reveal the path, walks through the manifested door, and enters the room that smells of ozone and old paper (closure space). The refuge is where the reunion occurs and the new piano waits. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure (the whole climax hinges on reaching it). Setup and payoff clear; middle development is the construction/revelation of the path. Specificity moderate (refuge as hidden room vs. abstract safety).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The black-and-white film reel with hidden sections (method) is introduced in paragraph six (setup), Lena threads it into the projector (paragraph eight), the footage reveals the door and staircase (middle beat), and she walks the unfolding path as the projector sputters out (closure sequence). The method's mechanics matter: "frames of a path, revealed only when the light hit the celluloid just right," and the film's images "bleeding into one another" guide her steps. High beat involvement (three moments), closure participation, and irreplaceability (no other tool would produce the same effect). The projector burning out adds cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tidal arbor above the clouds (setting) is named in the opening line, provides the spatial anchor throughout, and its branches and mist define the liminal geography. The arbor "groaned" and "sighed" (paragraph ten and final), and Lena navigates its bark/door threshold. The setting enables the plot (waypoint, liminal space, place where rules bend) and charges the final image ("suspended above the clouds, above the rules of endings"). Moderate constraint (the arbor's tides and invisible currents shape Lena's compass study) and strong closure linkage. Setup, middle presence, and payoff all clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "until the horizon invites night" is introduced in paragraph two ("before the horizon invited night") as the lover's original promise, echoed in paragraph nine ("the horizon was swallowing the sun, and the night was coming"), and implicitly reached in the final line ("the night rolled in, but the arbor held them"). The time constraint is present but does not visibly tighten tactics or force a decision under pressure; Lena proceeds at her own pace. Lyric setup and final reprise reweight the phrase (broken promise → fulfilled threshold), earning modest credit, but no middle beat where the clock forces a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To surprise fate with an unplanned encore" (motivation) is stated in paragraph five and drives Lena's actions: splicing the film, threading the projector, playing piano to unfold the path, and ultimately sitting at the new piano to play "for the encore neither of them had dared to imagine." The motivation is dramatized through on-page choices and charges the final image. Friction is present (desperation vs. hope, past vs. future) but not fully conflicted with visible cost; the encore succeeds without trade-off. Setup, middle demonstration (film splicing as surprise tactic), and closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Steely longing" (tone) is coherent throughout: Lena's grief is unsentimental ("her longing steely as the blade of a knife unsheathed after a long war"), her actions are disciplined and strategic, and the reunion is restrained rather than effusive ("You're late" / "So are you"). The tone modulates subtly under pressure (exhaled breath, pendulum swinging, music rising) and charges the final image (playing "not for the past, but for the encore"). The tone is specific, sustained across turns, and integral to voice and closure. High coherence, purposeful modulation, and irreplaceability (swap "steely" for "tender" and the story collapses).</comment>
