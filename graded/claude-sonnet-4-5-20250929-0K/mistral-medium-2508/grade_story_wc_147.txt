<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's motivation to harness the hush is established early and drives her into the temple, but her internal contradiction—guilt over abandoning the team versus self-preservation—remains largely told rather than acted in simultaneous conflict. The perfume uncorking and letting "the hush take her" shows a decisive choice, yet the mechanism of transformation feels abstract; we see Elias's ghost-invitation but not the embodied cost of acceptance. The ending renunciation ("done answering") and inland move suggest earned change, though the final paragraphs summarize emotional states ("learned to live with its quiet") rather than dramatizing the weight of what she carries forward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening beats (Liora, temple, rebreather countdown) and establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the hush "gathers" through layered images—signal, perfume, memory—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when she refuses future calls and moves inland. Cost is visible: she sells her gear, abandons the dive life, and carries the scent-memory forward. However, the three-day surface-team rescue introduces a convenience that undercuts the rebreather's stated one-hour limit and the temple immersion's causal stakes; this retroactive patch weakens escalation without breaking closure outright.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly rendered—corroded plates, split dome, bioluminescent jellyfish, mosaic star-maps—and the rebreather countdown anchors time pressure. The perfume vial recurs across beats, shifting from warm keepsake to mist-threaded light to empty vessel, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (chamber, dome, water above), though the transition from entombment to three-day drift and half-full rebreather blurs physical plausibility and distances the setting's constraint from the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—harnessing the hush to rewrite guilt—is signaled early and tested when Liora uncorks the vial despite knowing "it rewrites you." The signal's death and Elias's appearance deepen the beat, and her final refusal to answer future calls narrows options with visible cost (gear sold, inland move). Yet the escalation is more textural than causal: the rebreather's one-hour limit should force urgency, but the three-day rescue and half-full tank erase that tightening, replacing embodied countdown with summary convenience.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the weight of memory, guilt, and what we choose to hold versus release—emerges organically through the hush, perfume, and Elias's presence rather than statement. The final image ("hold, gently, like a vial of light—then let go") reweights prior material without moralizing, and the scent-recurrence at closure ties emotional particulars to conceptual release. The penultimate line "she was done answering" provides a resonant non-literal answer to whether one can escape the past, though the closing paragraphs risk slight over-articulation ("And that, she thought, was enough").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature—sensory detail filtered through diver's attention (corroded metal, salt-violet scent, silt-stirred mosaics)—grounds Liora's focus. Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional elevated flourishes ("unspooling," "veins of light") risk register drift during peak pressure. The prose modulates well under stress (short beats at the vial-uncorking), and interiority stays character-bound. No dialogue is present to evaluate, and the POV does not withhold known facts for false suspense.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is dense, but line-level slips accumulate: "unsnarled" appears twice in different senses (chain and knots), "the the marrow" is a typo, and several sentences in the reflection blocks employ near-identical participial openings ("She unsnarled," "She saw," "She said," "She learned"). The final third contains paraphrase loops—"learned to live with its quiet" is restated as "someone who could live with the weight of what she'd lost"—and the closing beats summarize rather than propel. These artifacts do not obscure closure but dull momentum in the denouement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The underwater-temple setting and sensory hush concept offer a fresh synthesis, and the perfume-as-conduit for memory is specific rather than generic. Yet the core arc—survivor guilt, underwater isolation, mystical release—follows a familiar template, and the three-day miraculous rescue with half-full rebreather reads as convenience rather than earned consequence. The risk in pursuing the hush and the cost of living inland with scent-memory provide some freshness, but the emotional beats (guilt, ghost-vision, acceptance) do not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The signal is mentioned as "her signal, the one she'd sent weeks ago when the cave-in trapped her team," but no character actively sending it appears on the page. Liora receives and later ignores it; the sender role is purely backstory without a decision node that alters present tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in beat one (warm, scent of salt/violets), is unsnarled and uncorked in the temple climax (mist threading through water), and returns empty at rescue and as scent-memory in the ending. Its state changes (full → mist → clear water) and its recurrence charges the final image ("pressed her wrist to her nose"), linking memory and release. Scored high for multi-beat involvement and closure linkage, though the vial's mechanism (how perfume becomes hush-conduit) remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is framed early ("the silence between echoes where time itself thinned"), tested when Liora lets it take her (pressing against skin/lungs), and shapes her final choice to stop answering. It narrows options by rewriting her guilt-memory and costs her the dive life. Present across setup, peak beat, and closure, though its mechanics are more thematic than tactically specific.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Touches memories" is embodied when the temple walls exhale and memories "unspooled" (Elias laughing, iron taste, clawing rubble), directly enabling her to see Elias whole rather than hear screams. This shift alters her willingness to uncork the vial and accept the hush. Present in setup (remembering grooves) and peak beat, with visible cost (losing accusatory memory but gaining haunting scent). Slightly abstract in execution but causally active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears twice: freeing the vial's chain ("unsnarled the vial's silver chain") and later as internal metaphor ("unsnarl the knots in her chest"). The first is a concrete preparation beat before the climax; the second charges the ending by linking physical act to emotional release. Swappable with "unfasten" or "untangle" in the first use, but the reprise at closure elevates integration. Two-beat presence with thematic payoff, though not mechanically unique.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Overriding the instinct to flee" is explicitly named once ("overriding the instinct to flee, to surface") as Liora prepares to uncork the vial. This framing signals internal conflict but does not recur as a method across beats; the act of uncorking follows immediately without further dramatization of override mechanics. Present at the key turn but not developed as a persistent tactic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple provides corroded plates Liora traces (triggering memory), a split dome admitting jellyfish light, a mosaic floor of unnamed constellations, and a central chamber where the hush gathers. These details pressure her choice: the temple "exhaled" and "seemed to be tiring of waiting," and its sensory particulars (silt, grooves, blue glow) anchor her decision to uncork the vial. The setting recurs in dream and final image (pillars standing tall, jellyfish drifting), charging closure. Strong causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Time pressure is stated early ("oxygen in her rebreather would last another hour, maybe less") and the signal grows "erratic, as if the temple itself were tiring of waiting." However, the three-day rescue with rebreather "still half-full" erases this constraint retroactively, rendering the countdown ornamental rather than tactically binding. Present in setup but not honored at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is named explicitly ("she had come here to harness the ephemeral: not gold or relics, but the gathered hush") and dramatized when she uncorks the vial, accepts the hush's rewriting, and later refuses to answer future signals. The friction between guilt and the desire for release drives her peak choice. Cost is visible: selling gear, moving inland, living with scent-memory. Strong setup and closure linkage, though the middle beats lean on summary ("she needed it to rewrite her") rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" coheres throughout: bioluminescent jellyfish as "slow, indifferent stars," corroded beauty, Elias's ghost-light invitation, and the violet-scent memory that follows her inland. Tone modulates from pressured exploration to quiet acceptance without breaking key. The final image—jellyfish drifting, signal waiting—sustains splendor tinged with solitude, charging the closure effect. Consistent and purposeful.</comment>
