<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's skepticism-to-belief arc is signaled early and earned through on-page choices (archiving memories, refusing to run), but her interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("tragically radiant," "the stubborn love that had kept her digging") that reads more poetic than embodied. The patrol confrontation shows agency, yet the cost of her choice is narrated rather than dramatized through bodily response or tactical friction. Her transformation from skeptic to "library" feels thematically announced rather than discovered through contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains spatial coherence. The closure—Liora's archival act that creates resonance beyond her capture—lands on the page with conceptual cost (her body taken, her archive spreading). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the garden's resonance structures, the shell's pulse, and the final image of blooming petals build density toward a final reweighting. One meaningful pressure point (the lattice activation) deepens stakes, though the authorities' arrival feels convenient rather than causally seeded earlier.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden is richly textured with specific sensory detail (silver-throated lilies, ozone and old roses, petals veined with gold) and the resonance lattice constrains Liora's archival method. The garden's transformation—petals blackening then silvering, the low thrumming harmony—charges the closure image and reflects internal stakes. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (kneeling between lilies, digging at the lattice heart, the patrol on the garden path). The twilight-to-morning timeframe is tracked and the final star's fade ties to the moment of completion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and drives all major choices. Liora's decision to bury the shell at the lattice heart narrows options (she cannot retrieve it) and the patrol's arrival forces her final stance. The cost is legible: her body dragged away, yet her archive persists. However, escalation relies on a single tightening (the archival act) rather than multiple reversals, and the patrol's hesitation when touching the light reads as externally imposed resistance rather than a choice-driven complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: memory as resistance, isolation transformed into distributed independence. The shell, garden, and resonance structures recur with shifting weight, and the final image (petals spelling her name, the world "remembering back") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The "library" metaphor in the penultimate section borders on thematic echo but is grounded in prior action. The conceptual repricing—stolen memories become unkillable roots—lands cleanly without overt thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The voice maintains elevated, lyric diction throughout ("tragically radiant," "the ghost of the shell's whisper still curled against her ribs") that coheres as a singular stance but occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction under pressure ("her chest was empty. Not gone. *Archived.*"). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the italicized internal asides (*"You don't believe in ghosts,"* it seemed to say) blur the boundary between shell-voice and Liora's thought without clear motivation. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (the shell "pulsed," the garden "shuddered") but register stays uniformly literary rather than modulating with stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("the exact shade of light through the library window," "trapped like fireflies in amber," "petals unfolding in shapes that spelled her name") without pattern-teaching or payoff escalation; multiple adjacent lines stack metaphor in the archival beat, reducing clarity. Minor paraphrase loop: "Not gone. *Archived.*" echoes "her chest was empty" within two lines without added pressure. Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports mood, but the elevated register persists uniformly across calm and crisis beats. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or continuity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—quarantined memory archived through resonance structures—offers a fresh synthesis of dystopian control and speculative preservation. The shell as memory-keeper and the garden lattice as amplifier feel specific to this logic. However, the emotional arc (defiant individual versus oppressive authority, sacrificing body to preserve legacy) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or twist. The final image of distributed memory blooming is evocative but anticipated once the resonance structures are introduced. Risk-taking in lyric density is present but does not fundamentally alter stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora begins as a skeptic ("scoffed at the idea") and the shell converts her; her choice to archive and her refusal to run are key turns. Present in opening, middle archival beat, and closure (refusing the patrol). However, the "charmed" quality—her belief earned by the shell's whisper—reads more as premise acceptance than on-page contradiction or tactical friction. Two distinct beats (archival decision, confrontation) with closure linkage, but the skepticism dissolves early without recurring friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shell appears in the opening (gift, memory keeper), the archival beat (fed to the lattice, "pulsed against her palm"), and the closure ("the ghost of the shell's whisper still curled against her ribs"). Its properties evolve: from skeptic's dismissal to active archive vessel to lingering presence. Three beats with clear causal pressure (her rebellion, the garden's transformation) and closure linkage. Specificity is high ("spiral," "tragically radiant"), though its mechanics remain metaphorical rather than rules-bound.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Quarantined memory frames the entire conflict: the erasure steals names/faces, Liora rebels by preserving hers, and the lattice spreads them beyond quarantine. Present in setup (the authorities' mercy/theft), middle (archival act), and payoff (distributed blooming). It shapes stakes and tactics (she must archive before erasure claims her) and the closure hinges on memory escaping containment. Causal pressure is strong, though the concept is more thematic backdrop than rule-system with visible constraints.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" appears once as a descriptor for the shell's light ("tragically radiant, its light not warm but *insistent*"). The trait connotes dual cost (beauty and doom) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action; Liora proceeds with the archival regardless of the shell's radiance. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff. Late signal (mid-story) and no reprise at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Archival drives the central turn: Liora buries the shell, feeds memories to the lattice, and the garden transforms. This action redefines options (her memories cannot be personally retrieved but spread as roots). Present in the middle third and directly shapes the closure (the world "remembering back"). Removing it collapses the plot. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong, with visible cost (her chest "empty," her body taken). Could score higher with earlier tactical friction around the method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Resonance structures are introduced early ("a lattice of iron and sunglass, humming faintly beneath the soil") and the archival method depends on them: burying the shell "at the heart of the lattice" amplifies memories outward. They enable the transformation (garden shuddering, thrumming harmony) and persist at closure (never stop humming). Two beats (setup, activation) with closure participation. Mechanics are asserted rather than tested through failed attempts, limiting score ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The velvet garden supplies the resonance lattice, pressures the timeline (twilight to morning), and transforms visibly (petals blackening/silvering, veined with gold). It appears in opening, middle archival beat, and closure (petals spelling her name, blooming behind the cart). Spatial micro-setting (kneeling between lilies, soil) alters tactics (where to dig). Without the garden's amplification, the archive fails. Three beats, strong causal role, closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("last star fades into morning light") anchors the opening and closure, creating a single-night window. It tightens urgency (she must finish before dawn) but is not tracked beat-by-beat or tested through time pressure that alters her moves. The patrol arrives "as the morning swallowed the last star," fulfilling the frame, but the clock does not constrain mid-story choices. Lyric early-to-final reprise with thematic weight but minimal tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Liora's desire to "translate isolation into independence" is stated explicitly midway and dramatized through the archival act: her memories, quarantined in the shell, become distributed roots no authority can hold. The motivation drives her refusal to run and her final declaration. However, the phrasing appears as narrated insight rather than earned through prior friction between wants and costs. Two beats (archival decision, confrontation) with closure linkage, but the dramatic conflict centers on preservation versus erasure more than isolation versus independence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone blends sorrow (father's dissolution, theft of memory) with defiance (rebellion, refusal to forget) and a spectral persistence (ghost of the shell's whisper, the garden's afterlife). It modulates with pressure: elegiac in reflection, urgent during archival, resolute at confrontation. The final image (smiling in the cart, petals blooming) charges the ending with quiet triumph. Coherent and purposeful, though the lyric elevation is uniform rather than rhythmically varied under peak stress.</comment>
