<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is richly textured with embodied contradictions—her palm on cold glass, breath fogging it, fingers tracing paths—yet her arc relies heavily on psychometric readings rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final shift ("some love wasn't unused. / It was just waiting") arrives as a stated insight rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The body and gesture work is strong, but the closure renunciation lacks the concrete forfeiture the rubric demands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors POV, location, and goal by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered psychometry readings that reweight the stake from "find goodbye letters" to "recognize stored love within herself." The final image—turning off the projector and letting "the dark have its say"—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she renounces the search), though the conceptual cost (accepting absence as presence) is more implied than concretely paid on the page. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost legibility at closure remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth is concretely rendered with rusted reels, cold glass, ozone smell, and storm vibrations. The crystal ball and film strip function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elara's perception and method across multiple beats. The booth's spatial labyrinth ("every rusted bolt and cracked lens a doorway to some other when") charges the final act when she threads the film "her fingers sure now," linking environment to the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding goodbye letters stored in film—is signaled early and undergoes one meaningful deepening when Elara realizes the letters exist "as absence—as the shape of a song waiting to be remembered." Her agency is primarily perceptual (psychometry, crystal gazing) rather than decisional; the final act of threading the film and turning off the projector renounces the search with felt cost, but the escalation relies on revelation rather than choice-driven tightening. One clear turn is present but the cost at closure is more atmospheric than transactional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—unused love as stored potential, silence as tenderness—emerges organically from the film-strip conceit and Elara's psychometric journey. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "some love wasn't unused. / It was just waiting for the right hands to turn the reel," which reweights prior material without moralizing. The whispered "Goodbye" and the deliberate dark are resonant, though the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo ("incubate the truth") before recovering in the final beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "the psychometry reading struck her like a bolt," "the celluloid warming as if alive." Diction is lyric and controlled, though occasional register drift into elevated metaphor ("coil into shapes only she could decipher," "ozone and old paper") feels slightly external to a crystal gazer's working idiom. The prose maintains consistent voice under pressure, and the final beats modulate tone without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is vivid but overwritten in stretches: "thief of echoes," "spatially imaginative by necessity," "hushed thunder" all front-load figurative density without pattern-teaching. Paraphrase loops appear ("the letters weren't in envelopes. / They were here, in the flicker and the grain" followed by "not as ink, but as absence"), and the mid-section recycles "stored" across multiple lines without causal pressure. Read-aloud rhythm is strong in the final third, but the opening and middle carry scaffolding that slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—psychometry + film preservation + unused love—is specific and emotionally grounded. The twist that goodbye letters exist as absence in the film's negative space is earned in hindsight by the "where the light can't reach" setup. The piece commits to its lyric-accumulative design and avoids template plotting, though the "crystal gazer hunting lost love in a projection booth" frame leans on familiar aesthetic tropes (vintage ephemera, melancholic archivist) without fully transforming them into a bold structural or moral calculus risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Crystal gazer is setup early (first paragraph) and drives multiple beats: touching the crystal ball, psychometry readings on film strip and canister, and the final realization. Development: she uses the gift to pursue the stake across the middle. Payoff: the final shift ("she finally heard his voice...in the space between her ribs where she'd stored him all along") hinges on her perceptual method. The trait enables rather than constrains with cost, and the final choice (turning off the projector) is more renunciation than decision driven by her gift's limits. Two gates clear; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Film strip is introduced early (workbench, first paragraph), returns in beat two (psychometry reading), and is threaded into the projector in the final sequence. Development: touching it triggers the key vision of his voice and unfinished lyrics. Payoff: threading the strip "one last time" frames the closure act. The object is handled across three distinct beats and its properties (celluloid warming, edges frayed) matter to the mood, though it could be replaced with another recording medium (tape, notebook) with minor edits. Two strong positives (early signal, closure linkage) but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Goodbye letters shape the inciting goal and are named explicitly in the opening third ("the goodbye letters he'd never sent"). Development: the middle revelation ("The letters weren't in envelopes. / They were here, in the flicker and the grain") reframes the stake. Payoff: the final image acknowledges the letters "as absence" and Elara's acceptance of that form. The concept constrains her search method and charges the ending, though the shift from "find letters" to "accept stored love" blurs whether the core concept is letters or love. Two gates clear; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Spatially imaginative appears as a label in paragraph seven ("She was spatially imaginative by necessity; the booth was a labyrinth of time") and again late ("her mind stretching through the spatial gaps"). Development: the trait is asserted but not dramatized through a specific choice or constraint; the booth's spatial labyrinth is described rather than navigated with visible tradeoffs. Payoff: does not participate in the closure image. Label-only use; no middle beat with cost; no closure linkage. Late signal (after 40% mark) and ornamental deployment cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Incubate appears twice: mid-story ("let the strip incubate in her grip") and late ("let herself incubate the truth"). Development: the first use is concrete (holding the strip as it warms) and triggers a psychometric vision. The second is metaphorical and frames the thematic turn. Payoff: the verb does not appear in the closure beat but the warming/waiting semantic charge carries into the final image of stored love. The action is signaled and used in one concrete beat and one abstract beat; moderate causal pressure; no direct closure participation. Two touches but swappable with "hold" or "absorb" in both instances.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is named in the first paragraph and demonstrated in beat two ("when she touched it, the psychometry reading struck her like a bolt") and beat five (touching the mislabeled canister triggers the vision of him splicing film). Development: the method shapes her investigative tactics and provides key knowledge. Payoff: the final threading of the film is informed by psychometric insight, though the method is not explicitly invoked in the closure lines. Early signal, two distinct uses, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage indirect. The mechanics are shown rather than merely asserted.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Projection booth is anchored in the opening line and supplies concrete constraints: rusted reels, cold glass, workbench, film canisters, projector. Development: the booth's spatial labyrinth and the projector's mechanics shape Elara's search and the psychometric readings. Payoff: "she threaded the film strip into the projector one last time" and "turned off the projector" are the closure actions. The setting provides tools (projector, reels) that drive beats and the final image. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage strong, high irreplaceability (the projector is the vehicle for stored love).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is obliquely present: "that last night," "the night he'd decided silence was kinder," and the storm outside provide temporal texture. Development: no live clock or countdown tightens decisions; the search unfolds at contemplative pace without time pressure. Payoff: the timeframe does not constrain or charge the closure. The element reads as mood (night, storm) rather than a ticking constraint that alters tactics. Functional but replaceable; no escalation tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early ("hunting for the place where unused love went to die") and dramatized through her tactile investigation of the crystal ball, film strip, and canisters. Development: the goal shifts when she realizes unused love is "not a place...a when" and later "in the space between her ribs." Payoff: her final act (turning off the projector, letting the dark speak) enacts acceptance of stored love as interior rather than recoverable artifact. The desire is shown in action and reweighted at closure, though the shift from external search to internal recognition is more epiphanic than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hushed thunder is invoked explicitly ("the hushed thunder of the storm outside") and sustained through sensory detail: "the air smelled of ozone," "rain lashing the windows as the booth trembled," and the final silence when she turns off the projector. Development: tone modulates from urgent investigation to quiet renunciation. Payoff: "the silence" and "let the dark have its say" deliver the hushed-thunder duality in the closure image. The tone is coherent, charges the ending, and matches the stake's emotional register. Early signal, consistent modulation, closure linkage clear.</comment>
