<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tutor's interior life is thick with metaphor but light on contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. His fidgeting is described but never constrains a choice with visible cost—it remains label-level. The final laugh and steady hands feel asserted rather than earned by prior micro-choices that test his flaws under pressure. The girl and villagers remain functional props without status dynamics or pressure that forces the tutor's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of images and pattern recurrence reweights the dominant stake. The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis plus thematic repricing via the board and tapestry)—cost is felt in his renunciation of winning and acceptance of the scars. Orientation anchors arrive late (village, labyrinth, tapestry all float without spatial grounding until mid-story); apply −0.4 once here and cap Q3 at 7.0. The tapestry-mending and board-reset feel like parallel gestures rather than a single causal turn, diluting closure sharpness. One tightening (kneeling at the labyrinth core) narrows options, but the mechanics of how decoding threads unfreezes the village remain abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are vivid recurring objects, but spatial choreography is vague—where he stands relative to the village square, labyrinth, and inn is never made concrete. The final board game constrains the closure choice (he plays to stay, not win), lifting the score within the cap. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and metaphorical; body, tool, and micro-setting are underused.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when he kneels and the metal absorbs his regret, narrowing options. However, the tutor's agency is passive—the village thaws because he weaves threads, but no live choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms tests his commitment. The girl's checkmate feels like coincidence rather than a consequence of his prior decisions. Cost is felt (he laughs, breaking the ice around his heart) but not legible as a tactical forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (forgiveness as mending, not erasing) emerges organically from the tapestry's frayed threads and the board reset. The final image—steady hands, the board remaining—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, "the quiet alchemy of forgiveness" in the penultimate section verges on thematic echo (−0.3). The labyrinth-as-mirror and platinum scars are purposeful recurring images that reweight prior material. Subtext operates cleanly in the girl's invitation and his shift from looking ahead to looking at her.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (chess idiom, metaphors of moves and boards). The girl's dialogue carries subtext and distinction ("You left before the end" reads as invitation, not accusation). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats: "the fierce repose of a board reset after checkmate," "the quiet alchemy of forgiveness." Under the tutor's stress, syntax remains ornate rather than compressing. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Dialogue mechanics are conventional and clear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the labyrinth sequence deploys figurative language without pattern-teaching ("veins humming with the lull of distant thunder, a sound that wasn't sound at all"). Mixed metaphors: thunder as lull, silence as held breath, ice around his heart. Register drift: "the fierce repose of a board reset" and "the quiet alchemy of forgiveness" clash with chess-tutor idiom. Paraphrase loops: the tapestry's frayed threads are described, then re-described as "lies from truth," then "confession stitched in silver." Template cadence: "The tutor knelt... The metal warmed... With a breath, he wove..." Apply −1.2 for density, coherence, and register drift across the closure third; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The exiled-mentor-returns frame is familiar, but the platinum labyrinth and tapestry-decoding add specificity. The time-frozen village and metaphor-thick idiom risk derivative fantasy-parable territory without grounding in lived detail or occupational verisimilitude (how does a chess tutor decode threads?). The turn—playing to stay rather than win—feels earnest but not surprising. Emotional truth is present but abstracted by the prose style. No close echo of famous lines detected, but the alchemy-of-forgiveness phrasing and labyrinth-as-mirror read generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor is present throughout and his choices (kneeling, weaving threads, accepting the game) drive beats. However, his decisions feel passive—he responds to the labyrinth's glow and the tapestry's resistance rather than making a high-cost choice between competing goods. Early signal (first line), three beats (edge arrival, thread-winnowing, board game), closure linkage (steady hands, plays to stay). Swappability moderate; any mentor could fill the role with minor edits. Cost is felt emotionally but not as a tactical forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears early (paragraph 4), pulses during the thread-decoding sequence, and its core absorbs his regret at the climax. Three beats: initial hum, walls shifting in memory, floor warming. Closure linkage strong—it stands empty in the penultimate section, its purpose fulfilled. However, its mechanics remain abstract (how does it freeze time? why platinum?). Specificity moderate; a silver maze or crystal prison could substitute with minor tonal edits. Cost connection present: he kneels and the metal absorbs weight, altering his stance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Woven hush appears as "the tapestry draped over his shoulder" and recurs in the closing line ("its woven hush now a lullaby"). It shapes his tactic (he plucks and separates threads), but the concept itself—what is hush woven into fabric?—remains metaphorical rather than a rule that constrains options. Early signal, two beats (edge arrival, final image), no middle development as a distinct pressure. Swappable with "woven silence" or "fabric of memory." Lyric reprise reweights tone but not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Fidgets productively is mentioned twice: "His hands, never still, winnowed through the threads" and "His fingers still fidgeted, but now they moved with intent." The trait is described but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost—if his hands were still, the plot would proceed identically. Label-only use without tradeoff. No setup gate (first mention midway), no middle gate, cameo in closure (steady hands) but not causally active there. Cap 4.6 for late intro; apply −0.5 for ornamental use; settle at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Winnowing (separating, plucking threads) drives the central sequence: he winnows lies from truth, and the threads yield a confession. Two beats: midpoint unraveling and final weaving. Closure linkage indirect—the tapestry is mended, but the final focus shifts to the board. Swappability moderate; "decode" or "untangle" could replace with minor edits. The action is specific enough to shape his tactic under pressure, but its mechanics are abstract (what does it mean to winnow hush?).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border is signaled early ("tracing the frayed threads") and executed in the middle (separating lies from truth, reading the silver confession). Two beats, no closure participation—the final board game replaces the tapestry. The method shapes his attempt but remains metaphorically opaque (how does pulling threads unfreeze a village?). Swappable with any symbolic unraveling. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is present from the first line and supplies the central pressure: he must act while figures are suspended. Three beats: edge arrival, frozen laughter, figures stirring. Closure linkage strong—the village is "no longer frozen, but alive" in the final third, and the inn hearth hosts the game. Spatial choreography weak (see Q3 penalty), but the frozen-state constraint shapes his urgency and the thaw marks the turn. Specificity moderate; a cursed town or enchanted forest could substitute with tonal edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The lull of distant thunder appears in paragraph 4 ("humming with the lull of distant thunder"), recurs twice mid-story, and closes with "the thunder rolled, no longer distant, but part of the village's pulse." The timeframe is atmospheric rather than a live clock—no deadlines tighten decisions. No middle gate; the thunder does not constrain his attempts. Lyric reprise reweights tone but not tactics. Cap 4.6 for late signal; apply −0.5 for ornamental use; settle at 3.6 for reprise lift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To forgive oneself for past mistakes is signaled early ("the fourth move he'd missed... cost him everything") and pursued throughout: unraveling guilt, kneeling at the platinum scar, laughing when checkmated. Three beats, closure linkage strong (steady hands, plays not to win). Friction visible: he must face the merchant's daughter and absorb the labyrinth's weight. Cost is felt (ice cracking around his heart) but conceptual rather than tactical. The motivation drives all major turns. Swappability low; self-forgiveness is specific to his exile and the chess failure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Fierce repose is named once mid-story ("the fierce repose of a board reset after checkmate") and echoed in the closing image (steady hands, quiet breathing). Tone reads contemplative and metaphor-laden throughout, modulating slightly at the laugh. However, "fierce" is asserted more than dramatized—the tutor's choices are introspective and patient rather than combative. One beat (labyrinth core glow), closure linkage via final stillness. The phrase feels ornamental rather than a tonal constraint that shapes pressure. Swappable with "quiet resolve" or "earned calm."</comment>
