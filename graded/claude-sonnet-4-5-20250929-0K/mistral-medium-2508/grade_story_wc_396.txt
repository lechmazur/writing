<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivations are established—his shadow-laced peacekeeper nature, his intuitive reading of conflict—but his interiority remains more atmospheric than contradictory. The decision to step onto the ice with the girl is signaled early and unfolds without meaningful internal resistance or cost that forecloses another path. Embodied emotion is present in gestures (exhaling, touching the fragment) but lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate the characterization. The final choice feels predetermined by his nature rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "peacekeeper of the Hollow Coast" and "lighthouse" early, but the specific present stakes—what Elias must choose now, what he risks—remain vague until late. The closure unit is a Charged Poise: Elias steps forward as the mirrors shatter, reconfiguring his role from observer to participant. However, the cost is more asserted ("the space between seeing and doing") than demonstrated; no specific option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, relying on atmosphere and image density, but the escalation reads as a gradual intensification rather than a decisive tightening that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard-ice setting is vivid and specific, with strong sensory detail (frost-rimmed doorframe, clicking branches, groaning ice). The setting shapes the final choice: Elias angles mirrors toward the cliff's edge, and the ice's proximity pressures the decision to step forward. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the exact geography of orchard-to-cliff-to-ice remains slightly abstract. The vintage mirrors and fragment constrain Elias's method of seeing the future, charging the closure when they shatter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the girl from standing alone on the ice—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is thin: Elias decides to wait and step forward, but no on-page reversal or complication narrows his options. The child never appears in scene, so the confrontation with the ice is anticipated rather than dramatized. The cost of his choice (stepping onto dangerous ice, shattering his tools) is legible but not tested; coincidence does not resolve, but agency is limited to a single decision without visible friction or trade-off that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: courage, solitude, and the transition from passive observation to active intervention. The fragment and mirrors function as motifs that shift meaning at the end, and the final image ("the space between seeing and doing") resonates without overt moralizing. However, the thematic question—whether empathy requires action—is more stated than tested; Elias's arc is a confirmation of his nature rather than a struggle that transforms it. The piece avoids sentimentality and invites reflection, but the ending feels more atmospheric than a non-literal answer forged from concrete cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The voice is distinctive and controlled: lyric, compressed, with a perceptual signature that filters through Elias's intuitive lens ("his shadow stretching long and unnaturally still," "the weighted breath before reply"). Psychic distance remains stable, and the diction is purposeful, avoiding filter-verb stacks or unmotivated register shifts. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, tightening as Elias approaches his decision. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. Minor elision (the girl's identity, the exact mechanics of the mirrors) is taught early and serves the accumulative design, remaining legible at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively, and the prose is imagistic with high information density in many lines. However, overwriting appears in clusters: "its gnarled apple trees clinging to the cliffside like old men gripping walking sticks, their roots tangled in the salt-cracked earth" stacks metaphor and detail without advancing pressure. Stock phrases recur ("the space where doubt lived," "a knife's edge") and some lines paraphrase earlier content ("not as a peacekeeper, not as a shadow, but as the one foolish enough…" restates the prior decision). Figurative density in non-peak beats slows momentum slightly, and a few template cadences ("He would be waiting. […] He would reconstitute…") flatten propulsion. No major causality breaks, but the prose could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of peacekeeper-as-interventionist and the use of mirrors to glimpse the future offers a specific angle, and the lighthouse-orchard-ice setting is memorable. However, the core arc—reluctant guardian steps forward to save a doomed child—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The "shadow-laced" trait and fragment mechanics add texture but do not transform the emotional calculus in an unexpected way. The ending image (mirrors shattering as Elias steps forward) is resonant but predictable given the setup. Risk-taking in voice and structure elevates the piece within its band, but the premise does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his peacekeeper nature is invoked multiple times, but his choices are limited: he collects mirrors, examines the fragment, and decides to wait and step forward. The "shadow-laced" trait is more label than constraint; it does not visibly alter tactics or create a trade-off. The final decision to step onto the ice is consistent with his character but does not create a key turn—it is the culmination of a single, linear decision path. Functional but replaceable; a "guardian" or "protector" would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fragment appears in three beats: discovery in the wreckage, handling on the worktable, and tucked in Elias's coat as he descends. Its fractures "caught the light like trapped screams" and it hums and pulses, charging the atmosphere. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a specific tactic; Elias does not use it to act, only to observe. The fragment's role in "reconstituting the moment" is asserted in interiority but not dramatized. It shapes one key turn (Elias's decision to intervene) and is present at the ending, but its mechanics remain vague. Scores in the mid-band for setup, development, and closure presence without strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "courageous anomaly" is embodied in the unnamed girl, described as "a spark in the dark" whose hands are "outstretched not in fear but in offering." This concept shapes the stake—Elias wants to ensure she does not stand alone—but the girl never appears on the page, so her courage is told rather than tested. The concept is invoked thematically but does not alter tactics or create a visible choice-point. It frames the ending but remains abstract, functioning more as a premise than a live element that changes options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is mentioned directly ("his quiet voice unraveling knots of anger like loose thread") and shown in Elias's handling of the fragment and his decision to wait. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. It colors his perceptual filter but does not create friction or a trade-off; Elias does not struggle against his intuition or pay a price for relying on it. The trait is functional but could be replaced with "patient" or "observant" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is invoked explicitly in two beats: the middle reflection ("To reconstitute it—to make it whole again—would require more than skill") and the climactic assertion ("He would reconstitute more than the crystal. He would reconstitute the moment itself"). However, the action is prospective and metaphorical; Elias does not physically reassemble the fragment on the page. The concept shapes his motivation and the ending's thematic charge, but the mechanics are elided. It drives the final stance but is not dramatized as a concrete act with visible cost. Scores in the mid-band for thematic centrality without on-page execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mirrors are introduced early, described as "vintage store mirrors" hung at odd angles in the tower. They provide glimpses of the girl in three beats and are adjusted by Elias before the ending. At closure, "the mirrors shattered behind him, their glimpses finally whole," a charged reprise that reweights their function. However, the mechanics of how the mirrors enable the glimpses are vague, and their use does not constrain a specific tactic. They shape one key turn (Elias's decision based on what he sees) and return at the ending with reweighted meaning, qualifying for mid-band integration without strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard-ice setting is established early and mentioned in every major beat. The ice groans and threatens throughout, providing ambient pressure, and the cliff's edge is the site of the anticipated confrontation. Elias angles the mirrors "toward the cliff's edge," a micro-choice shaped by geography. The setting charges the final image ("He stepped forward") and the ice's danger is a persistent constraint. However, the orchard's apples and trees do not affect tactics beyond atmosphere. The setting shapes two beats and the ending, qualifying for mid-to-upper integration without being indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" is invoked once as a metaphor for Elias's hesitation and the story's temporal frame. However, the timeframe is loose: the piece spans Elias entering the lighthouse, examining the fragment, descending, and waiting for dusk—a sequence of hours without urgency. The phrase does not tighten decisions; time pressure is absent until the vague "dusk" deadline. The element is ornamental, a lyric touch that does not constrain action. It appears in setup but not in development or closure, capping it below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is stated explicitly in the middle beat and drives Elias's decision to step onto the ice. The motivation is dramatized through his handling of the fragment, his adjustment of the mirrors, and his final choice. However, the friction between empathy and risk is minimal; Elias does not struggle against competing desires or pay a visible cost for acting. The motivation shapes the arc and the ending but lacks the internal conflict that would elevate it. It qualifies for mid-band integration: essential to the arc, functional without strong dramatic cost.</comment>
