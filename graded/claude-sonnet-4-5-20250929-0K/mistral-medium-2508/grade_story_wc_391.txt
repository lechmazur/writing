<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lior's interiority is coherent and distinct—his patience is embodied through ear-to-stone listening and moon-path tracking. However, the sister's dismissal ("like a man waiting for permission to live") is told, not dramatized, and the final choice to walk onto the rising viaduct feels more declarative than earned by on-page contradiction or visible cost. Micro-choices exist (kneeling, listening, stepping onto ice) but they don't meaningfully foreclose options or reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than scene-driven tension that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (lake, basalt sanctuary, Lior), and the closure lands with a clear image: Lior stepping onto the rising viaduct. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—patience, moon paths, and wildness accrue through imagery and cadence shift toward the final act. However, the viaduct's literal rise feels symbolic rather than causally grounded; no prior beat shows why *this* dawn triggers the ascent, weakening the "because" linkage even under an accumulative lens. Cost is oblique: Lior turns his back on the sanctuary, but what he forfeits (community? warmth? argument?) remains abstract rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vivid and purposeful. The viaduct's humming iron, moon-aligned arches, and warm metal under Lior's palm create a micro-setting that constrains his final choice to step onto the rising bridge. Sensory detail is selective (frost cracking on cheeks, electric tang, ice groaning) and filtered through Lior's patient attention. The lake's freeze and the viaduct's ascent both charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test for setting as active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving that patience can enact revolution—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is minimal: Lior listens, hears a tremor, and the viaduct rises without his active intervention. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows his options; the sister's accusation is background, and the "others" remain offstage. The final act (stepping onto the viaduct) is a gesture of validation rather than a decision under competing pressures. Cost is implied (leaving the sanctuary) but not viscerally felt or shown to foreclose a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—patience as revolutionary praxis, wildness restrained—emerges organically from moon-path tracking, the viaduct's slow unyoking, and Lior's embodied stillness. The final image (stepping onto the rising bridge, moon pulling steady) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, lines like "waiting, Lior had learned, was its own kind of fire" and "patience sculpted from the raw, restless stone of impatience" tilt toward thesis statement rather than pure dramatization. The piece narrowly avoids Thematic Echo penalties because the articulation is woven through action, but the abundance of reflective summary reduces the discovery effect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with Lior's perceptual signature (horizon mapper, moon-path reader) distinct. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the slow unraveling of the world's temper," "celestial unyoking") that strains the focalizer's plausible lexicon during reflective beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation (ear to strut) and lyric remove ("a bridge to nowhere and everywhere"). No head-hopping, and the reflection-heavy mode remains anchored to present stimuli (lake freeze, viaduct hum), but the density of reflective blocks (~30%) tests the upper limit even under the BRR exception, as some passages paraphrase rather than advance present stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is often vivid ("surface a single breath of glass," "a thousand drawn bows") and rhythm varies purposefully. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The revolution would not come in the clamor..." is restated as "The real work had never been in the breaking. It had been in the waiting," and again as "The revolution had no need for haste. It was already here." Template stems recur ("He had spent...," "The others would...," "Lior knew...") across multiple paragraphs. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; "unyoking of weight from burden" and "patience sculpted from...stone of impatience" both work. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, preventing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of patience-as-revolution, moon-path engineering, and a literal rising viaduct is imaginative and specific. However, the patient-revolutionary trope has wide genre precedent, and the piece does not transform it with non-obvious moral calculus or embodied friction—Lior's stance is validated rather than tested. The viaduct's mechanics (celestial alignment unyokes weight) are asserted more than explored, and the sister's contrary view remains offstage. The final image is striking but feels more inevitable by authorial design than by hindsight surprise earned through character contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lior is present throughout, and his horizon-mapping informs his patient observation. His choices (kneel, listen, step onto ice) advance the closure, but they are confirmatory rather than turn-creating—he validates a process already underway. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is thin because his vigilance does not constrain or redirect any tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears early (first third), is handled in multiple beats (post-rain hum, moon-aligned arches, warm metal under palm, rising ascent), and charges the final image as Lior steps onto it. Setup, development (listening for the shift in its song), and payoff all present. Specific properties (iron bones, celestial alignment) matter causally. Narrowly misses 8.5+ because the viaduct's rise is triggered by external conditions (moon, time) rather than by Lior's action, reducing irreplaceability of his interaction with it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Patient revolution shapes Lior's tactics (tracking moon paths over thirteen winters, refusing the "fire and fury" approach) and is named in the dominant stake. It appears in setup, development (sister's accusation, his choice to listen rather than act), and payoff (viaduct rises without haste). However, the concept is more thematic echo than on-page friction—no competing urgency forces a trade-off, and the sister's impatience remains offstage. The revolution's patience is asserted rather than tested under live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears as a descriptor for the viaduct's rise ("softly purposeful, it began to rise") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action by Lior with visible cost. The trait is more atmospheric than functional. Setup gate marginal (first mention ~60% through); development absent; payoff present as image quality. Replaceable with "slow" or "steady" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears in concept (viaduct's "celestial unyoking of weight from burden") and is implied at closure when the viaduct rises. However, Lior does not perform an unyoking action—the viaduct unyokes itself via moon-alignment. Setup present, but middle development and direct protagonist action absent. The term is more metaphor than plot driver. Swappable with "lift" or "release" with minor edits, capping mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Moon-path tracking is signaled early ("thirteen winters tracking those paths") and establishes Lior's method. It shapes his understanding and patience, priming the closure. However, the mechanics are summarized in backstory rather than demonstrated in a present choice that alters tactics. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development thin because the tracking does not actively enable the viaduct's rise—time and celestial mechanics do. Lyric reprise (moon pulling steady at end) reweights but does not drive a turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary (carved maps, crumbling hearths) and frozen lake appear early, frame Lior's stance, and supply the spatial stage for the closure image (stepping onto ice toward the viaduct). The cliff's edge, ice that holds, and proximity to the viaduct all pressure or enable his final move. Setup, development (ice groans, Lior's boots leave no mark), and payoff all present. Narrowly misses 8.5+ because the setting's constraint (ice must hold) is asserted rather than dramatized as a cost or risk.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the lake freezes over") is established in the opening line and frames the closure moment as "the first true light of winter." The freeze marks a pause that ends when the viaduct rises, creating a before/after. However, the duration of the frozen state and the trigger for its ending are vague—no ticking clock tightens Lior's decision. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development present as mood but not as tactical pressure. Time constrains atmosphere more than choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Lior's desire to "sculpt patience from impatience" is named explicitly and drives his thirteen-winter commitment to moon-path tracking. The sister's accusation dramatizes the friction between patience and urgency, though only in reported speech. Setup, development (choosing to listen rather than join the fire-and-fury faction), and payoff (stepping onto the rising viaduct as proof) all present. However, the motivation is more thematic declaration than on-page struggle—Lior never wavers or doubts, so the sculpting lacks visible cost or internal conflict in the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone is coherent: restrained yet charged imagery ("a single breath of glass," "wildness restrained, a song held just below the threshold"). Modulates with pressure (ice groaning, viaduct shivering) and charges the final image (stepping onto the rising bridge, "patient, wild unknown"). Setup present in opening paragraphs, development sustained through sensory control, payoff strong as tone crystallizes at closure. Narrowly misses higher bands because the restraint occasionally tips into abstraction ("slow, deliberate arc of the moon") that mutes visceral impact.</comment>
