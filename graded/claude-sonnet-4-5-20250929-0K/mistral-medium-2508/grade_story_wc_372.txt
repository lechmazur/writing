<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("extraction: to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") drives his task-oriented measuring throughout, but his internal contradiction emerges only late when the woman's face appears and he "trembles." The ending choice—stepping onto the bridge—arrives without visible friction between his orderly role and the personal longing that suddenly surfaces. The final paragraphs skip the cost of abandoning his ledger and his lifetime of measurement; the transition from records chief to vow-keeper feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story follows an accumulative/textural lens: luminous vows accumulate until the door marked "Remember" opens and the bridge appears, reweighting Elias's extraction task into an invitation. Closure lands on the page (he steps onto the bridge, the library dissolves, he reaches for her hand) with the conceptual cost that his life's work is released as "stardust" and his purpose fulfilled. The causality of why this particular slide and this woman trigger the bridge is thin—dream-scribbles in his ledger are mentioned but never dramatized—so the invitation feels convenient. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (frozen library, orderly records chief, measuring luminous vows by ~line 3).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen library's physicality is vivid (ice shelves, ozone and old paper, "quartz hush"), and the collapsing shelf ("another shelf collapsed into the abyss below") adds urgency. The lantern slide is handled across multiple beats (held up, adjusted, flared, pocketed, guides him on the bridge) and its warmth "strange against his thigh" is a nice embodied detail. However, the bridge itself—"of light, of ice, of something in between"—lacks spatial grounding; we never learn how long it is, whether it sways, or what physical cost stepping onto it entails, so it reads more as symbolic than as a tactile constraint on Elias's final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (extract meaning before vows fade) is signaled early and the collapsing shelf provides escalation. The door marked "Remember" and the bridge are tightening moves that narrow Elias's options. However, the woman's appearance as an invitation rather than a complication flattens the pressure; she offers resolution without requiring a trade-off. The final step onto the bridge costs Elias his ledger and his life's work, but the text tells us "The bridge held" and "the air smelled of spring" without showing what he relinquishes or fears losing, so the cost is conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—promises as both records and invitations, memory as a living obligation—emerges cleanly from the vows, the slide, and the bridge without overt moralizing. The final image ("The light bent. / And the world remade itself in the quiet") reweights the entire extraction premise into a beginning. The recurrence of "vow" gains meaning: first measured, then heard, then kept. Minor slip: "He had spent his life measuring what could not be held, but this—this was something else entirely" is a near-explicit theme statement that the prior images already conveyed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, with a poetic compression ("forgotten breath," "quartz hush," "stardust") that remains legible and consistent. Psychic distance is stable throughout; Elias's perceptual signature (meticulous, records-focused, then trembling when personal longing surfaces) is clear. Free indirect style is clean. One slip: "Find me where the light bends" is delivered as the woman's voice but carries no vocal texture or embodiment—just a disembodied directive—so the moment lacks naturalism despite its thematic importance. No dialogue mechanics issues otherwise.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and the prose is dense with specificity ("frostbitten leather," "ozone and old paper," "breath misting the page"). However, several lines loop: "The library groaned, ice shifting" restates the collapsing shelf beat; "The slide flickered" and "The lantern slide flared" echo without advancing new information. The phrase "something else entirely" in the penultimate paragraph is generic filler. "A beginning" as a one-sentence paragraph is a scaffold assertion. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, so deductions remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds and the luminous-vows-as-light concept offer fresh sensory texture, and the inversion of "vows were not just records—they were invitations" is a clean thematic turn. However, the core arc—archivist discovers personal connection to the material he catalogs and crosses a threshold to reunion—is a familiar template. The woman's identity and the dream-ledger setup are asserted rather than earned through specific lived detail, so the emotional particularity that would distinguish this execution is missing. The bridge and dissolution are vivid images but function as set pieces rather than character-specific choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout as the POV and his meticulous measuring drives the opening beats. His choice to push open the door marked "Remember" and step onto the bridge are key turns. However, his orderly records-chief trait is more label than constraint; the story does not show him resisting the invitation or struggling between duty and desire, so his role feels decorative rather than essential to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lantern slide is handled in multiple beats: held up to the tome, adjusted to coalesce words, pressed harder to reveal the woman's voice, pocketed (its warmth noted), flared to reveal the bridge, and finally darkened after its purpose is fulfilled. Its function evolves from tool to guide to fulfilled artifact, and its warmth is a nice embodied recurrence. It shapes two major beats (revealing the vow and lighting the bridge) and appears in the closure paragraph ("the slide now dark in his pocket, its purpose fulfilled"), earning solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Luminous vows are introduced early, measured throughout, and the story's premise hinges on them. The vows shift from abstract frequencies to the woman's spoken promise ("Find me where the light bends") and finally dissolve as "stardust" when Elias keeps one. However, the mechanics of how vows become invitations or why this vow opens a bridge are told rather than dramatized, so the concept remains more thematic than tactical. It is present at closure but its causal role is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is shown in Elias's "gloved fingers tracing the spines" and his ledger entries, but it does not constrain or enable a key choice. When the woman appears, he trembles and abandons his measuring without friction, so the trait does not create a visible tradeoff. It colors his opening movements but becomes ornamental once the invitation arrives.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Measuring drives the opening half: Elias measures the frequencies of luminous vows, records them in his ledger, and works faster as the library collapses. The act of pressing the slide harder to reveal the woman's voice is a key beat. However, after the door opens, measuring ceases and the ending hinges on stepping onto the bridge, not on any final act of measurement. The action is essential to setup and middle development but does not shape the closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Sampling frequencies is mentioned early ("by sampling frequencies of the fading light") and Elias records numbers in his ledger. The slide's sigils and the prism of blue and silver suggest the method matters. However, the text never shows the mechanics of frequency sampling or how it differs from simply reading; the method is labeled rather than dramatized. It does not constrain Elias's final choice or shape the bridge scene, so it functions as world texture rather than tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen library is anchored early and its collapsing shelves create urgency ("another shelf collapsed into the abyss below, taking untold vows with it"). The door marked "Remember" and the bridge are spatial extensions of the library. The setting's instability drives Elias to work faster and shapes the stakes (vows will be lost). The bridge and clouds are present in the closure image. However, the library does not impose a physical constraint on Elias's final step—he simply walks onto the bridge without negotiating distance, cold, or disorientation—so its role is more atmospheric than tactical at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("while illusions fade to memory") is present as a background pressure: the library is "running out" of time, illusions are "dissolving," and Elias works "faster." The collapsing shelf signals the clock. However, the text never quantifies how much time remains or tracks elapsed time across beats, so urgency is asserted rather than felt. The ending does not hinge on a last-second deadline; Elias steps onto the bridge at his own pace and "the library's time finally spent" reads more like thematic closure than a live ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") is stated early and drives his measuring task. The woman's appearance and her voice ("Find me where the light bends") shift his motivation from extraction to personal longing. The final step onto the bridge is framed as fulfilling that desire. However, the text does not dramatize the friction between his professional duty and his personal yearning; he trembles once but then simply proceeds. The motivation is present and shapes the arc, but it lacks on-page conflict or visible cost, so it reads more thematic than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone is established early ("quartz hush of the place pressing against his ears") and sustained through poetic compression and restrained diction. The prose modulates subtly: meticulous and measured in the opening beats, more urgent when the shelf collapses, then hushed and lyric at the bridge ("The clouds sealed shut behind them, the last illusion fading to memory"). The final image ("And the world remade itself in the quiet") returns to the hush and charges it with renewal. The tone supports the ending cleanly and is consistent through pressure shifts.</comment>
