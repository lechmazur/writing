<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's profession anchors her watchful stance, and the choice to reach through the threshold is motivated by her mortician's attunement to stillness. However, interiority leans toward abstract poeticism ("the parts of her that still remembered how to listen") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final decision feels contemplative rather than agonistic, with no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path that charges the moment with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established by ~120 words (grotto, aurora, Liora's profession). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Liora receives the dead woman's message and commits to carrying it forward, reweighting her mortician practice. However, the cost remains oblique—no on-page sentence proves what she sacrifices or forecloses by this choice. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere and motif-laden), but the ending's reconfiguration is asserted more than demonstrated through a visible constraint or price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora generate vivid, purposeful atmosphere ("walls woven from petrified mist and the bones of forgotten winds"). The emerald chip functions as a micro-setting object that Liora presses to her temple, triggering the threshold vision. The setting charges the final image with its radiant hush and rippling aurora, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor deduction: spatial choreography of the "doorway" remains abstract; we never see Liora's hand position or body anchor as she "reaches through."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing one last spark before oblivion for the dead—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the emerald chip reveals the threshold and the woman's message, reweighting Liora's understanding. However, no on-page reversal narrows options or imposes a felt trade-off; the grotto "holds its breath," then the chip dulls, but Liora's agency reads as receptive witnessing rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, this is functional but lacks the tightening or visible cost that would elevate escalation into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: thresholds as "breaths held between two notes of a song," stillness as transformation rather than end. The dead woman's whispered message ("it was beautiful") and Liora's final resolve to carry the spark forward offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy closure and honors complexity. Minor slip: "the knowledge that thresholds were not walls, but breaths" edges toward direct thematic articulation rather than pure dramatization, but it remains tied to the woman's whispered offering and does not flatten the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the tone. Perceptual signature is consistent: "the way only those who tended the dead could be, attuned to the thresholds where stillness became something else." The woman's single line of dialogue ("Tell them, it was beautiful") carries subtext and goal. Minor deduction: some filter-verb reliance ("felt the weight of her own pulse") and slightly abstract constructions ("not as illumination but as a bridge") dull immediacy in peak beats, keeping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("walls woven from petrified mist," "light that wasn't light but something older"). However, the piece shows mild overwriting: most sentences in the grotto sequence carry metaphor or simile without respite, creating a lyric saturation that slows momentum. One paraphrase loop: "the threshold of stillness wasn't the end. / It was the space between what was said and what was heard" restates without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("She had come... She had found... She pressed... She infused") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "understood," "knew") cluster in high-pressure beats, triggering −0.5 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician duality and the emerald-chip-as-memory-key offer specificity. The grotto and aurora setting is vivid. However, the "threshold between life and death" premise and the "message from the departed" arc are familiar in lyric fantasy; the piece does not transform them through a non-obvious moral calculus or lived complication that would surprise in hindsight. The closure—Liora vows to carry the spark—reads as an affirmation rather than a turn that reweights prior assumptions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout. Her choice to press the chip to her temple and reach through the threshold are on-page actions that enable the vision and message-receipt. However, these choices are contemplative rather than agonistic; no visible tradeoff or competing option is dramatized. The profession (beautician mortician) anchors her watchfulness but does not constrain a peak choice with cost. Meets two gates (setup, middle development, payoff) but causal pressure and cost connection are modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The emerald chip appears early (found in corpse's pocket), is handled twice (pressed to temple, later "dull in her palm"), and its light "spent" state signals a change. It enables the threshold vision and thus shapes the central turn. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—Liora uses it without friction, and its depletion is noted rather than dramatized as a sacrifice. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but irreplaceability and cost connection are weaker.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Threshold of stillness" is named explicitly ("The threshold of stillness wasn't the end") and frames the grotto encounter. It shapes Liora's understanding and the final stance. However, it functions more as thematic echo than an on-page constraint that alters tactics or options. The concept is present in setup, middle reflection, and closure, satisfying all three gates, but causal pressure remains low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is labeled directly ("Liora was lucidly watchful") and linked to her mortician training. It explains her ability to "read" the static and aurora patterns. However, the trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a constrained choice or visible tradeoff. No on-page cost or friction arises from this watchfulness. Present in setup and referenced at closure, but functional rather than causally charged.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Infuse" appears once: "She infused the chip with her focus." This action triggers the threshold vision, making it causally significant. However, it could be replaced with "channeled," "poured into," or "focused on" with minor edits, indicating modest irreplaceability. Appears in the middle third, drives one key beat, but lacks the repeated or closure-specific role that would push it into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is signaled early ("the static... was a language") and Liora's years of learning to read it are summarized. The method is used when she infuses the chip and perceives the doorway shape. However, the mechanics are abstract; we do not see her distinguish signal from noise or make a choice based on pattern-recognition. Present in setup, middle development, and closure framing, but causal specificity is low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is established immediately and provides vivid atmosphere. The ledge edge where Liora kneels and the "walls [that] shivered" when she presses the chip show environmental response. The aurora's "slow pulse" and final ripple frame the ending. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Liora's options; it functions as charged backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Strong setup, development, and payoff presence; moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture one last spark before oblivion" is stated in the third paragraph and drives Liora's journey to the grotto and her use of the chip. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or a visible trade-off. At closure, she resolves to "make sure it didn't go out," which aligns with the motivation but does not test it against a competing need. Present in all three gates; functional causal role; modest friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is established early ("her breath misted in the radiant hush") and the tone remains consistent: lyric, contemplative, atmospheric. The piece modulates subtly—quiet at the start, shivering tension when the walls react, warm resolution when the woman speaks—without breaking the hush. The aurora's "slow and endless exhale" and Liora's smile in the final beats charge the ending image with tonal coherence. Strong presence across all three gates and meaningful closure contribution.</comment>
