<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's face-blindness and sensory compensations are well-established, and his methodical approach shows through concrete actions (lance, texture-tracing). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between buried empathy and his role as witness, though the final choice—walking toward the child's cough—feels somewhat gestural rather than earned by on-page struggle. The backstory with Liora is substantial but anchored to present stimuli (ribbon, quarry space) and tilts his current stance. Embodied emotion is present ("his methodical heart a little less still") but some moments drift toward abstract label-speak ("the weight of what he couldn't see").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered sensory detail, ritual action, and the echo's appearance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elias speaks Liora's name aloud and accepts witness as his role. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure unit lands with conceptual cost (he carries the sketch, the ribbon, the knowledge that justice won't reopen), and the final turn toward the child's cough reweights his earlier isolation. Causality is clean under the accumulative lens; the lance ritual and ribbon fragment drive the vision sequence, though the echo's mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The quarry is vivid and multi-sensory: slick stone, damp walls, mist that coils and thickens, the drain where the mask was found. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's face-blindness (texture, sound, resonance over visual detail). The setting constrains action—he kneels where evidence had been, uses the crack between stones for the lance—and the historical overlay (ballroom/flood) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The micro-setting (lance-in-crack, ribbon-in-pocket) actively shapes the ritual and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: bearing witness to Liora's erasure and reclaiming her name from silence. Pressure accumulates through the ritual, the echo's appearance, and the vision of her murder, tightening when Elias realizes "she'd been *erased*" and that the case won't reopen. The final choice—walking toward the child's cough—forecloses his isolation with visible cost (he carries the unsolved weight forward). Agency is present in his deliberate ritual and decision to speak her name; the mayor's son's untouchability raises the cost. One meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, though the final move toward the cough feels slightly understated for the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: the unseen (face-blindness, the dead, systemic erasure) versus witness and presence. The lance as "a question," the ribbon's softness "as a promise," and the final act of walking toward sound rather than sight all avoid thesis statements. Liora's theft-for-medicine and the mayor's son's trophy-collecting create moral complexity without false balance. The ending's quiet reconfiguration—Elias as "a portraitist of the invisible"—reweights prior material without moralizing. Some abstraction creeps in ("wounds remembered," "the weight of what he couldn't see"), but the quarry-as-ballroom and the child's cough ground the theme in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elias's perceptual signature: texture, sound, resonance, emotional weight rather than visual detail. Narrative distance is stable; interiority is filtered through sensory compensation and professional ritual. Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional elevated phrasing ("furrowing hush," "coax the past into the present") drifts from the established voice. The single line of dialogue—"You were looking for something"—feels purposeful and subdued. Some filter verbs ("knew," "wondered") are acceptable given the contemplative mode, but a few moments ("his methodical heart a little less still") edge toward poetic abstraction that doesn't fully align with the established sensory concreteness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well and sensory detail is dense, with strong images like "the mist curled like a held breath" and "the ribbon's twin fluttering from her fingers." However, several passages exhibit overwriting: "The quarry's jagged mouth yawned open" (mixed metaphor—mouths don't have jagged edges), "swallowing sound" immediately followed by "his boots leaving no prints" (sound/sight incongruity), and stacked elevated constructions in quick succession ("wounds remembered," "furrowing hush," "portraitist of the invisible"). Template cadence appears in the opening: "not for balance, but to memorize," "not with sound, but with resonance," "not a question but an offering." Paraphrase loop: "the dead don't return, they *echo*" is restated in various forms across the piece. Some filter-verb stacks ("he'd always known," "he didn't need," "he knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying −0.8 for overwriting density and template stems, plus −0.3 for filter stacks in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The face-blind detective premise is a fresh angle, and pairing it with cold-case work and a supernatural ritual adds specificity. However, the "troubled investigator revisits unsolved case" frame is familiar, and the story doesn't fully transform it—the echo mechanics remain abstract, the mayor's son as villain is stock, and the emotional turn (dormant empathy awakening) is signaled more than dramatized. The lance ritual and sensory-compensation details provide texture, but the piece stays safely within the bounds of literary-supernatural mystery. The final image (walking toward a cough) is quiet and earned, yet the synthesis feels more competent than revelatory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's face-blindness is present throughout and informs his sensory compensations (texture-tracing, sound-focus), but it doesn't constrain a key turn. His inability to recall Liora's face is mentioned but doesn't alter tactics or create visible cost at closure. The character is well-integrated thematically but remains more observational than decisional; the final choice to walk toward the cough is quiet and doesn't hinge on his face-blindness. Present in setup and payoff, but middle development is weak—no on-page moment where the trait forces a trade-off or narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in three beats: arrival in the envelope (setup), held up to the echo (middle), and tucked in his pocket at closure where it's described as "soft as a promise." It reweights from evidence → offering → carried witness. The echo's "twin" fluttering is a strong visual link. However, its function is largely symbolic; it doesn't constrain a choice or mechanically enable the ritual. Swappable with another keepsake (locket, scarf) without major structural change. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental middle use −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Cold cases frame the premise and stakes (Liora's three-year-old disappearance, the untouchable mayor's son, the filed-under-unsolvable status). The concept shapes Elias's tactics (returning to the quarry, using the lance ritual to recover memory) and the ending's cost (the case won't reopen, but witness is achieved). Present in setup and drives the middle action; closure participation is thematic rather than causal—the "cold case" status is accepted, not resolved. One distinct beat of causal pressure (ritual to recover the echo), but the concept itself is more premise than active constraint at the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is shown through concrete actions: descending deliberately, tracing walls "to memorize," kneeling "methodical as a surgeon," the lance ritual's precision. The trait enables the ritual and reflects his coping mechanism (sensory compensation), but it doesn't create visible cost or a trade-off. No on-page moment where methodical slowness costs him time or where his rigidity must be abandoned under pressure. Setup +0.6, one beat involvement +0.4, but label-only at closure −0.5 and no visible cost −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lance is introduced early, handled in the ritual (pressed into the crack, hums with resonance, grows warm/hot as the vision unfolds), and "seals the memory into the metal like a brand" at closure. It's the tool that enables the echo-vision and thus the witness act. Removing it would break the ritual's mechanics. However, the lance's supernatural function is asserted rather than earned through prior rules—it could be replaced by another ritual object (staff, bell, talisman) with moderate edits. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, but swappability −0.6 and summary-only mechanics (the "hummed," "trembled," "grew warm" sequence is told) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unify the opposites" is stated once in the middle as a mentor's teaching: "the seen and the unseen, the said and the silenced." Elias then whispers Liora's name, and the echo appears. The method is signaled but its mechanics are vague—does speaking her name enact the unification, or is it the lance's resonance, or both? It doesn't visibly shape attempts or choices; the phrase functions more as thematic gloss than active constraint. Present in one beat but ornamental and swappable (the ritual could succeed via "focus" or "intention" with minor wording changes). Setup weak (appears mid-story), no development constraint, closure participation is thematic only. Ornamental −0.8, late setup −0.4, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry is introduced immediately and sustained throughout: slick stone steps, jagged mouth, damp walls, mist that coils and thickens, the crack where he inserts the lance, the drain where the mask was found. It supplies the ritual space, pressures Elias through cold and damp, and its history (flooded ballroom) charges the final image. The mist's behavior (curling, tightening) signals the echo's approach. Removing this exact setting would break the story's logic (the quarry is the murder site and the ritual anchor). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" is established (three years since the case, police tapes "long since rotted"), but the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or create a live clock. Elias works at his own pace; no external deadline forces urgency. The phrase "first light bled through the clouds" at the end suggests a night-long ritual, but elapsed time isn't tracked or leveraged for pressure. Present in setup, but no middle or closure participation. Functional but swappable with "years later" or "at dawn" without impact. Setup +0.4, but missing development cap at 3.4, missing closure participation cap at 2.8; lowest cap wins → 2.8, adjust upward slightly for thematic coherence → 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elias's dormant empathy is stated twice: "the empathy he'd buried" and "his methodical heart a little less still." The desire is present but not dramatized through conflicted choices. The final act—walking toward the child's cough—implies a shift, but the on-page friction is minimal; he simply "adjusted his scarf" and walked. No visible trade-off where empathy costs him safety, time, or detachment. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, but told-only with no friction −0.7 and summary-only realization (the heart "a little less still" is metaphor, not dramatized cost) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone is established early ("furrowing hush," "weight of silence," "mist swallowing sound") and sustained through quiet, deliberate pacing. Diction remains subdued and somber; no tonal breaks. The tone modulates slightly as the echo appears (mist coils tighter, vision intensifies) and returns to quiet at closure (first light, the soft ribbon, walking toward sound). The final image's hush charges the ending with restrained grief and resolve. Coherent through turns, modulates with pressure, and charges the final image without static repetition. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, modulation under pressure +0.8.</comment>
