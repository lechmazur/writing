<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's grief-driven craft work is embodied through wire-twisting and needle-pricking, with contradictory impulses (holding vs. releasing) acting simultaneously. The mentor's voice and the artificial flower lesson earn her shift from burial to illumination. However, the winter coda's teaching role arrives via summary rather than a dramatized final choice with visible cost. The paraphrase loop ("Grief, she realized, was not a thing to be buried in metal. It was a stencil, a coordinate, a folded promise") flattens what should be the peak realization into label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through repeated crane-folding, coordinate-placing, and vein-tattooing until the winter coda reweights the dominant stake (solitary mourning → communal teaching). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): Lena's new practice forecloses solitary grieving with visible cost (the tattooed arm, the open curtains, the stranger's trembling smile). One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from making lilies to cranes, then to teaching others. The cost is legible: she has opened herself and her space to strangers, embodying vulnerability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's brass telescopes, cracked dome, and stone steps constrain Lena's movements and charge the closure: she pulls open curtains, lights candles inside cranes, and uses alcoves for discovery. The workbench and tools (wire, vellum, needle) are tactile anchors that shape her craft choices. The winter snow and lined steps in the coda show environmental evolution that mirrors her transformation. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the micro-setting (bench, telescope, steps) functions as active setting at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transforming solitary grief into communal teaching) is signaled early and tightens when Lena moves from making reliquary jewelry to making cranes with coordinates, then to tattooing herself, and finally to teaching a stranger. One meaningful tightening: the discovery of the copper flower shifts her from burial to bloom. The winter coda narrows options by committing her to a public practice. Agency is clear (renunciation of isolation, endurance of vulnerability) with visible cost (open curtains, tattooed arm, stranger's trembling reliance). The escalation is Accumulative, but the final beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the teaching moment, slightly lowering pressure legibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (grief as a transformable medium rather than a burden to bury) emerges through the progression from wilted lilies to hollow cranes to tattooed vines. The artificial flower, the mentor's ironic wisdom, and the act of leaving cranes all resist tidy morals and invite reflection. However, the final-third thematic echo—"Grief, she realized, was not a thing to be buried in metal. It was a stencil, a coordinate, a folded promise"—is prompt-like articulation that replaces scene pressure with stated thesis (−0.6 in Q5 per the anti-pattern). The winter teaching coda offers a resonant, non-literal answer through image (stranger learning the creases), but the earlier label weakens the thematic subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady with Lena's perceptual signature: she notices wire tension, petal trembling, ink bleeding like roots. Diction remains consistent (craft-focused, tactile). The italicized mentor's voice is purposeful compression that charges memory without head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean ("She would make a pendant of it, hollow and waiting, like all the things that had yet to bloom"). No dialogue is present, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during tattooing, wider during the winter summary).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective ("copper so thin they trembled like real ones"). However, a paraphrase loop appears in the grief-realization passage: "Grief, she realized, was not a thing to be buried in metal. It was a stencil, a coordinate, a folded promise. And like the artificial flower, it could be shaped to hold the light." The second and third sentences restate the first without added pressure (−0.2 for paraphrase loop). Template cadence in the crane-placement sequence ("The first on the observatory steps... The second, she placed... The third, she wedged...") spans three sentences but serves a deliberate cataloging effect, so no deduction. Information density is high until the winter coda, which summarizes rather than dramatizes. No figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of grief-craft, observatory setting, and origami-as-teaching offers a specific synthesis. The mentor's paradoxical wisdom ("genuinely artificial," "curtains of intention") and the tattooing choice avoid stock templates. However, the core arc—artist transforms grief into communal healing practice—is a familiar template; the transformation hinges on the particularities (copper petals, vellum stencil, tattooed vines) rather than a non-obvious moral calculus. The black feather with gilded edge is a late ornament that does not alter the established pattern. Within-band adjustment for mild risk (tattooing, teaching strangers) but no major structural boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's choices create every key turn: she decides to shape a crane instead of a lily, tattoos the vines, places cranes at specific sites, opens the curtains, and teaches the stranger. All three gates are met (setup by paragraph two, development through the copper flower discovery and tattooing, payoff in the winter teaching). Her agency drives escalation and closure under the Accumulative lens. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the character is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The vellum stencil is introduced early (paragraph four), used in the tattooing beat (paragraph sixteen), and present in the final paragraph ("a new sheet of vellum waited"). It shapes one key choice (the tattooing that embodies her commitment) and recurs at closure. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) plus one middle beat reaches mid-6s. The stencil's meaning is reweighted (from relic to map), but it does not constrain other choices or carry the same cost as the cranes or flower.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" is named early via the mentor's dialogue and returns in Lena's realization that "Each prick was a choice: to remember, to release, to let the curtains part just enough." It shapes the tattooing beat (a choice to reveal/conceal) and the literal curtain-opening at closure. Three gates are met (setup, development, payoff). However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; swapping it for a near-synonym like "veils of choice" would not break the story's causal spine. Mid-5s for purposeful presence without tight causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is voiced by the mentor and applied to the copper flower, which becomes the lesson that shifts Lena's practice. The attribute enables one key action (the shift from burial to bloom) and charges the closure theme. Two gates (setup via mentor's voice, payoff via the copper flower's lesson). The paradox is specific and irreplaceable in tone. However, it does not constrain a second beat or force a visible tradeoff beyond the single realization. Mid-6s for strong thematic charge with limited causal spread.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives multiple beats: lighting the candle inside the largest crane casts vine shadows, opening the curtains lets in light, and leaving cranes "where the light will find it" becomes the teaching instruction. Three gates are met (setup in early craft work, development in the candle-lighting beat, payoff in the stranger's instruction). The action is causally central and shapes both tactics and closure. Strong irreplaceability; swapping for "reveal" or "brighten" would lose the specific shadow/vine image and the final teaching mantra.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The origami cranes with coordinates appear first as a found object (paragraph seven), then Lena makes twelve with "a scrap of paper tucked inside—a coordinate, a memory, a question" (paragraph eighteen), places them strategically, and by winter teaches a stranger to fold grief into cranes. Three gates are met (setup via discovery, development via making and placing, payoff in the winter teaching and stranger's learning). The method is mechanically and thematically central; it shapes escalation and closure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage make it nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The observatory provides the workbench, telescope, dome crack, alcove, and steps—all of which constrain or enable Lena's choices. The dome's creak signals the found crane, the alcove hides the copper flower, the telescope hollow receives a crane, and the steps become the public teaching site. Three gates (setup in opening paragraphs, development through spatial discovery and placement, payoff as the winter steps lined with cranes). The setting is integral to tactics and closure. High causal involvement; the story's logic depends on this exact place.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" is signaled via "hadn't slept since the funeral" and "the weight of her own intentions felt like a shroud." The timeframe anchors the present crisis and tightens decisions (the mentor's recent death, the fresh grief). The winter coda shows elapsed time that validates the transformation. Two gates (setup via funeral reference, payoff in the winter teaching). However, the middle beats do not show a live clock or urgency tied to time passing; the transformation could occur over days or months without altering the causal spine. Mid-6s for framing presence without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To teach withering to bloom again" is dramatized through Lena's shift from making wilted lilies to hollow cranes, from solitary mourning to communal teaching. The motivation is conflicted (grief coiled vs. desire to release) and tested on-page through the tattooing choice and the stranger interaction. Three gates (setup via the mentor's final words, development through the flower lesson and self-tattooing, payoff in teaching the stranger). The desire is irreplaceable and charges closure. Strong causal linkage; visible cost (vulnerability, open curtains, tattooed skin).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" holds throughout: restrained intensity in "her breath hitched," "smiled, just slightly," "whispered," and the quiet candle-lighting. The tone modulates with pressure (tight grief early, cautious opening mid-story, gentle teaching at closure) without breaking into melodrama or flatness. It charges the final image (the trembling stranger, the new vellum sheet) and coheres across all turns. Three gates (setup in the opening stillness, development through the measured craft work, payoff in the subdued teaching moment). The tone is indispensable to the story's emotional register and closure effect.</comment>
