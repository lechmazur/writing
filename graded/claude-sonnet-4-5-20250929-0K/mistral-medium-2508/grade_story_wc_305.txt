<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—grief scallops joy, forgiveness carved a hollow—and her final choice (giving the silver fruit) flows from prior causality. The man's dove-release and shaking hands embody his state without label-speak. Minor slip: the grotto's voice asking "What do you seek?" feels slightly convenient, though Maren's answer ("Not peace") reveals contradiction. Internal conflict and embodied emotion sustain pressure through the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Sister Maren, grotto above clouds, post-forgiveness) land by ~120 words. The hairpin → shoot → silver fruit sequence accumulates symbolic charge and the final gift to the arsonist enacts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she converts grief into a future-facing cycle) with felt cost—she surrenders the heirloom and her own claim to closure. One meaningful deepening (plucking the shoot, dissolving into veins) reweights the stake. Closure is on-page and coherent under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto's moss with bioluminescent veins, the ancient fig tree, and the scalloped hairpin constrain choices and charge the final image (silver fruit). Sensory details—damp earth, twilight-colored shoot—are vivid and selective. The hairpin's scallop pattern recurs meaningfully (shoot edges, bandage edge) and the fruit's weight literalizes "choices not yet made." Spatial choreography (grotto threshold, kneeling, climbing down) remains clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Maren seeks the source of contentment, "the well before the drawing." Pressure coheres and tightens when she plucks the twilight shoot, triggering the grotto's recoil and her vision of the spiral thread. The gift to the arsonist is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (hairpin gone, burden transferred). One clear deepening—seeing the thread, absorbing the shoot—narrows options and forecloses her solitary path. Cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: grief feeds roots of what comes next, forgiveness differs from forgetting the hollow. The scalloped motif (waves, scars, bandage edge) recurs without token mentions and the final image—scalloping a bandage, children's laughter blooming in dark—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the contentment question. No overt moralizing. The shoot dissolving "like wine into water" and the spiral thread earn thematic weight through concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady with Maren's perceptual signature (rough hands, fig tree wisdom, scalloped grief). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the grotto exchange, slightly wider when framing the cycle. Diction stays character-particular—"umbral," "relentless waves," "kind hand of a clockmaker"—without register drift. The grotto's voice ("neither inside nor out") is intentional and legible. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and key images (scalloped edges, twilight shoot) do multiple jobs. Minor overwriting: "a thousand unspoken names" and "sky bled into violet" edge toward stock lyricism. A brief paraphrase loop: "forgiveness wasn't the same as forgetting the hollow it carved" near-echoes earlier grief-scalloping language. Figurative density in the grotto beat is purposeful and pattern-taught. Propulsion remains strong through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scalloped-edge motif as visual/tactile connective tissue across hairpin, shoot, scars, and bandage is a fresh synthesis. The grotto sequence avoids mystical-mentor clichés by making the voice a test rather than a guide. The arsonist releasing doves and Maren's silent gift sidestep confrontation tropes. Transformation test passes: the story's emotional arc depends on these particulars. Risk-taking (accumulative design, quiet gift as climax) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's caretaker role—decades tending the sick, burying children, scalloping a bandage at the end—drives her search for contentment's source and shapes the final gift. Present in setup (infirmary ashes, rough hands), middle (grotto choice), and payoff (waiting for children at dawn). Two beats: seeking the source, transferring the fruit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hairpin anchors setup (mother's, grandmother's, scalloped filigree), middle (pressed into soil, catches light "like a blade"), and payoff (gone, transmuted into silver fruit). Its scallop pattern recurs across the shoot's edges and Maren's scars, charging the final bandage-scalloping action. Three beats with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cycle of rebirth frames the grotto as "where the cycle…began—not with fire or flood, but with a quiet unraveling" and Maren's vision of the spiral thread. The shoot → fruit → children blooming at dawn enacts rebirth on the page. Present in setup (elders' teaching), middle (spiral vision), and payoff (children coming, cycle turning). Shapes stakes but does not alter tactics under pressure as strongly as required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Kindly decisive" constrains the final gift (silent, no speech, pressing fruit into the arsonist's palm) and her steady scalloping of the bandage. The trait is enacted rather than labeled. Present in middle (plucking the shoot without hesitation) and payoff (decisive gift, waiting for children). One clear cost: she transfers burden without negotiation. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Scallop" drives multiple turns: the hairpin's scalloped waves seed the pattern, the shoot's scalloped edges mirror it, Maren's scalloped scars embody past cost, and the final scalloped bandage enacts continuity. The verb form (scalloping the bandage) charges the ending image. Present in setup, middle (shoot edges), and payoff with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Climbing the fig tree at dawn is established in setup ("as she always did when the weight of forgiveness settled too heavy") and frames her ritual thinking. The tree bears the silver fruit at payoff and she sits beneath it at closure. Two beats: dawn climb (signaled), evening return (enacted). The method shapes her approach to seeking contentment but does not alter middle tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The umbral grotto above the clouds supplies the mystical geography where Maren finds the source. Its moss with bioluminescent veins, exhaling air, and vine recoil constrain her action (kneeling, pressing hairpin, plucking shoot). Present in setup (threshold description), middle (grotto exchange, trembling), and payoff (silver fruit on the tree outside). The grotto's rules—surrender becomes creation—alter options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after forgiving the unforgivable" anchors Maren's search and the man's dove-release marks his parallel journey. The past forgiveness is established in setup, and the post-forgiveness present drives the grotto visit and gift. Dawn and evening frame the day. Present in setup and payoff, but does not create live urgency or tighten middle tactics. Functional reprise but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maren's stated goal—"I want the source…the well before the drawing"—drives the grotto sequence and her plucking of the shoot. The motivation is dramatized through her rejection of "peace" and her vision of the spiral. Present in setup (fig tree reflection), middle (grotto exchange), and payoff (understanding grief's shape, waiting for children). Conflicted want (not peace, but the source) with visible cost (hairpin dissolved).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Vineyard hush"—quiet, patient, contemplative—holds through the grotto's "damp earth and something older" and Maren's steady scalloping at the end. The tone modulates slightly (grotto trembles, vines recoil) under pressure but returns to restful closure ("leaves rustling…unspoken names"). Coherent and intentional, supporting the accumulative design. Does not charge the final image as strongly as required for higher bands.</comment>
