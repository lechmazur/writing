<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (penance for a past translation that split a kingdom) is clear and ties to the present crisis. Her "carefully reckless" trait is labeled but only modestly demonstrated in her leap to restore the archive. Internal contradiction is present (trust vs. mistrust of her voice) but the final shift feels declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under sustained pressure. The embodied emotion is uneven: "breath that tasted of iron and old paper" works, but "fingers still vibrating with the language's pulse" leans decorative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara restores the archive, the emissaries' torches gutter out, and she walks forward with the shard, trusting her voice—options are reconfigured and the cost (decade of mistrust, risk of burning) is felt. One meaningful deepening occurs when the inkwell shatters and the mist seals the scrolls, reweighting the stakes from destruction to restoration. The lens holds, though the final third drifts into summary and thematic declaration rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive setting is vivid (crushed violets, slow decay, brittle scrolls) and constrains Elara's choices: the emissaries' arrival at dawn creates a ticking clock, and the archive's acoustics matter when she sings into the harmonic gaps. The inkwell and parchment function as micro-setting, charged at closure when the shard "never stopped singing." Spatial choreography is clean (courtyard below, doors swing open). The setting shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but some details (sylph-touched indigo, Twin Moons) remain ornamental without pressing tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore the archive before it burns at dawn. The ticking clock (emissaries arrive at dawn, "she had minutes") applies clear pressure. One meaningful tightening: the inkwell shatters, indigo mist seals the scrolls, and the torches gutter out—Elara's action (singing in the harmonic gaps) forecloses the path of passive scholarship and forces her to trust her voice. The cost is visible: a decade of mistrust, the shattered inkwell, and the risk of repeating her past mistake. Agency is present, though the emissaries' passive retreat (torches guttering) undercuts the felt resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of trust, silence, and restoration emerges through the archive's "loom" metaphor and Elara's refusal to let the past remain buried. The final image (shard that never stopped singing, walking toward dawn) offers a non-literal answer to "can broken promises be reknotted?" without a stated moral. However, the final third over-declares: "The point was the thread, unbroken. The point was the trust" and "some things were never truly extinct" read as authorial thesis rather than earned resonance. The meta-commentary ("some stories were meant to be believed") deflates thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV (third-limited on Elara) is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "breath that tasted of iron and old paper," the archive "smelled of crushed violets." Psychic distance shifts purposefully (close during the singing, distant in the final parenthetical aside). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("gestation," "exuberant," "reclaim") that feels more authorial than Elara's voice under crisis pressure. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("And if, years later...") breaks voice consistency. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood") are used but not excessive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do double duty ("The parchment drank her voice. The inkwell shattered."). However, the final third collapses into paraphrase loops: "The point was the thread... The point was the trust... The point was the truth" is a template cadence run. "She didn't look back" after "walked on" is redundant. Stock metaphors ("light split the sky like a promise") and near-duplicates ("smiled, soft and sure" / "laughed, soft and sure") reduce density. The closure beat is touched by these artifacts, triggering the −1.7 penalty guideline and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise (restoring an extinct language to undo broken promises) is imaginative and the archive-as-loom metaphor is specific. The "sylph-touched indigo" pigment that reveals truth on deceitful parchment is a fresh detail. However, the emotional arc (scholar learns to trust her voice after a decade of guilt) is familiar, and the emissaries' passive retreat (torches guttering without resistance) feels convenient. The final meta-commentary ("some stories were meant to be believed") and thematic summary undercut boldness. The core idea is promising but the execution hedges with safety-net declarations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara (arcane linguist) is present throughout and her decision to sing in the harmonic gaps (rather than simply translate) drives the climax. Her choice to keep the inkwell shard and walk into dawn alters her stance. She appears early, shapes two beats (discovering the obligations, singing the restoration), and participates in closure. The role is specific enough that a generic scholar would not generate the same tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass inkwell appears early (first paragraph), is used in two beats (dipping the quill, shattering to release indigo mist), and the shard returns at closure ("never stopped singing") with reweighted meaning. Elara pockets the shard, linking it to her future ("some truths were too sharp to leave unguarded"). Removing it would flatten the tactile anchor for the restoration and the final image's charge. The object is irreplaceable and tied to cost (shattering as sacrifice).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" (the Chorus of Unbroken Vows) is named early and shapes Elara's goal: unsnarl the Chorus, not just translate. The act of singing in harmonic gaps operationalizes the concept. However, the mechanics remain vague—"syllable a thread binding speaker to listener" is told, not shown in tactical detail. The concept participates in closure (the archive "resonates with the symphony") but its properties do not visibly constrain Elara's method. It charges theme more than it narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is labeled in the opening ("that rare scholar who leapt before looking, but only after calculating the fall") but the trait's friction is not dramatized in a choice with visible cost. Elara's decision to restore the archive fits the label, yet the text does not show her weighing recklessness against caution in a beat where the trait forces a tradeoff. The attribute is ornamental rather than mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is the stated action (unsnarl the Chorus of Unbroken Vows) and Elara's singing in harmonic gaps enacts it. The act drives the climax: the mist seals the scrolls, the archive breathes, the torches gutter. However, "unsnarl" could be replaced with "restore" or "reweave" with minimal edits—the specificity of knotwork is not leveraged in the mechanics. The action is present and causal but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Via interconnected promises" (each syllable a thread binding speaker to listener) is signaled early and the singing in harmonic gaps enacts the method. The parchment reveals obligations, and the mist "weaves through the shelves, sealing cracks... with threads of light." The method shapes the attempt and is present at closure, but its mechanics remain abstract—how promises constrain or enable is told, not shown in tactical friction. It reaches two gates (setup, payoff) but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is present throughout, supplies the scrolls and spatial layout (shelves, courtyard, doors), and constrains Elara's choices: the emissaries' approach creates urgency, the archive's acoustics matter when she sings. The setting is indispensable—removing it would collapse the premise. It appears early, pressures middle beats (the clock tightens), and participates in closure (doors swing open, archive breathes). The archive is irreplaceable and tied to cost (risk of burning).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" is signaled late (penultimate paragraph: "The paths had not yet diverged") but aligns with the emissaries' dawn arrival. The timeframe creates urgency ("she had minutes") and tightens tactics (no time for alternate plans). However, the phrase "before paths diverge" is more thematic than mechanical—it does not visibly constrain a choice differently than a simple deadline would. It charges the final image but is not causally irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (restore trust after her translation split a kingdom; regain trust in her own voice) is present early, dramatized in her hesitation ("the nib trembling") and her final shift ("she trusted the sound of her own voice"). The desire is conflicted: penance vs. fear of repeating the mistake. It drives two beats (dipping the quill, singing despite risk) and participates in closure (walking forward, trusting her voice). The cost is felt: a decade of mistrust, risk of burning the archive. The motivation is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named in the final paragraph ("the world followed, one cautious, exuberant step at a time") but the tone across the piece is more solemn and gothic (decay, penance, risk) than exuberant. The opening is heavy (crushed violets, slow decay, guilt), and the climax is tense (torches, minutes left). Exuberance emerges only at the very end ("laughed, soft and sure"), too late to cohere across turns. The tone is static through the middle, limiting its charge of the final image.</comment>
