<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is vivid and embodied—the trembling hands, the flinch at ice-shearing—but her final choice to walk into the storm feels unmotivated by prior micro-choices; the pivot from oracle to self-annihilation lacks a clear causal trigger. Internal contradiction (certainty vs. margins) is articulated but not dramatized in simultaneous competing impulses within a single beat. The cost of her departure is visible in the abandoned station and silenced warning, but the decision itself reads more as thematic gesture than earned character arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~60 words (mountain station, post-fever, storm imminent). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through sensory density (ozone, copper taste, barometer dip) and the smudged illustration motif, culminating in Liora's walk into the storm as Charged Poise—options crystallize (warn or vanish) with undeniable cost (station's destruction, her silence). One meaningful deepening occurs when the storm shifts from "dawn" to "now," reweighting her oracle role. Cost is legible in the final image (footprints vanishing, radio humming unanswered), though the causal link between fever-clarity and self-erasure remains slightly elided.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The weather station's physicality—frost-laced window, groaning iron ribs, barometer needle, hygrometer—constrains Liora's choices and charges the closure; she handles the window, the illustration, the radio, each tool reflecting her paralysis. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, wet stone, copper taste) filters through her post-fever hyperawareness. The ravens and auroral glow add atmospheric specificity without ornament. The station itself functions as micro-setting, its pressure (falling barometer, shearing ice) driving her final exit into the storm.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (warn or withhold truth) is signaled early and tightens when Liora realizes the storm breaks "now," not dawn—a reversal that narrows her window and forecloses inaction. The cost is visible: station destruction, unanswered radio, her erasure from the ledgers. Agency operates as renunciation (she chooses silence over warning), and the final walk embodies Earned Stasis with undeniable price. One slip: the storm's arrival feels coincidentally timed to her epiphany rather than caused by her delay, slightly weakening escalation under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The smudged illustration (certainty bleeding into question) and the recurring "margins" motif charge the thematic question: what is the cost of swallowed truth? The ending offers a non-literal answer—Liora's footprints vanish, the ledgers omit her, and the storm proves oracles can choose erasure—without moralizing. The aurora's "sorrowful glow" and the illustration's wings-like smudges deepen resonance organically. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the closure image reweights prior material (oracle as witness/confessor) with conceptual cost (certainty dissolved, truth unspoken).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; distance narrows during peak reflection ("truths were heavy things to swallow") and widens for the closing image without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—Liora notices barometric pressure, raven behavior, needle stutters—calibrated to her oracle role. Diction occasionally drifts high ("perilously so," "capsize the world") but remains voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue to judge. One minor slip: "The wind carried her name away before she could hear it. Or perhaps she had never said it at all" leans slightly meta without clear POV anchor, though the effect supports thematic ambiguity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; high information density in peak beats ("the air smelled like ozone and old blood"). Minor template cadence in the middle third: "She could tell them... or she could tell them...," "She could warn them... Or she could let..." echoes the same stem across adjacent lines, lowering propulsion slightly (−0.4). One paraphrase loop: "the margins were where things breathed" and "occupying those margins" restate the concept without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative density is high but controlled; "wings" and "question mark" in the smudged illustration cohere. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The oracle-as-fallible premise is familiar, but the fusion of weather-station setting, post-fever clarity, and smudged botanical illustration (monk's hood/wolf's bane) creates a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The final choice—walking into the storm rather than issuing a warning—inverts expectation (oracles speak; she silences) with earned risk. One proximity echo: "Some truths were only visible from the margins" and the "margins" motif verge on thematic statement rather than pure image. Transformation test passes: plot and emotional arc depend on this exact station, fever, and illustration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora (fault-tolerant oracle) is present throughout; her trembling hands and flinching establish the "fault-tolerant" trait early. She makes two key choices: deciding the storm breaks now (not dawn) and walking into it rather than warning the observatory. Both choices alter tactics and foreclose options (the station's destruction, her erasure). Cost is visible in the unanswered radio and vanished footprints. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Specificity is strong (barometer reading, hygrometer stutter). Minor swappability: "meteorologist" could replace "oracle" with edits, though the oracular framing charges the thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The botanical illustration (Aconitum napellus, smudged) appears in three beats: created during fever, traced mid-scene ("smudges looked like wings"), and left on the table at closure where "the lantern's glow could find it." It reweights across beats—from defaced study to question mark to wings—and its wolf's-bane toxicity mirrors the poisonous truth Liora withholds. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle beat is brief but functional. Causal pressure is moderate: it symbolizes her uncertainty but does not mechanically constrain her exit choice. Closure linkage is strong (the final image of the smudge on the table charges her absence).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" frames the story early ("certainties were absolute, when in fact they swayed like grass") and shapes Liora's stake: her barometer reading wavers, her forecast shifts from dawn to now. The concept pressures her mid-scene realization ("certainties were just things you held until they slipped") and charges the closure (her footprints vanish, the ledgers record "sudden, inevitable"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is moderate; the concept deepens theme but does not mechanically narrow her exit options. Cost connection is visible (dissolved certainty = unanswered warning).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" (occupying margins, noticing what logs don't record—ravens before death, hygrometer stutter when she lies) is established early and cited twice. It enables her final choice: stepping into the margins where "some truths were only visible." The trait constrains her oracle role (she withholds rather than declares) with visible cost (the observatory waits, the station falls). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle beat is thematic rather than tactical. Swappability is moderate: "observant" or "unorthodox" could substitute with rewrites. Cost connection is clear (margin-dwelling = silence).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "smudge" action (defacing the botanical illustration during fever) occurs early and drives two key turns: Liora traces the smudge mid-scene ("looked like wings"), which primes her realization that certainties blur, and she leaves the smudged page on the table at closure, a visual marker of her choice to let ambiguity stand. The smudge's transformation (defacement → question mark → wings) is irreplaceable; swapping it for "tear" or "fold" would lose the visual/thematic charge. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is strong: the smudge embodies her shift from precision to acceptance of uncertainty, enabling her final exit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Occupying margins" is signaled early ("she had learned to live in the margins") and cited twice more: "the margins were where things breathed" and "some truths were only visible from the margins." It shapes her tactic of withholding the storm warning (staying marginal = not declaring) and charges the closure (her footprints vanish into the margins of the ledgers). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle beat is reflective rather than dramatized. Mechanics matter thematically but do not constrain her physical exit. Swappability is moderate: "working in silence" could replace with edits. Cost is visible (margin = erasure).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is present throughout and pressures Liora's choices mechanically: the barometer's falling needle triggers her realization, the radio crackles with the observatory's request (forcing a decision), the groaning iron ribs and shearing ice signal imminent collapse, and the station's destruction is the cost of her silence. It supplies resources (cot, ledgers, lantern) and micro-setting (frost-laced window she presses, door she exits). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is high: without the station's instruments and isolation, her oracle role and final choice collapse. Irreplaceability is strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" is established in the opening ("now the heat had broken, leaving her hollowed out—clear-eyed") and cited once more ("The fever had scoured her clean"). It tightens her decision window: post-fever clarity enables her to recognize the storm breaks now, not dawn, collapsing her timeline. The timeframe constrains her mental state (hyperawareness vs. prior static) and charges the closure (clarity = capacity to choose erasure). Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is implicit. Swappability is moderate: "after waking" could replace with rewrites. Cost is visible (clarity = no excuse to delay or misread).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" drives Liora's arc: she has withheld truths ("the weight of what she didn't say"), wrestles with whether to warn the observatory ("truths were heavy things to swallow"), and at closure discovers the truth's weight by dissolving it ("The weight in her ribs dissolved like salt"). The desire is dramatized in conflicted choices (speak vs. vanish) with visible cost (unanswered radio, station destruction). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Friction arises from competing wants (oracle duty vs. self-erasure) and the final cost (swallowing = silence = erasure). One slip: the motivation is slightly tell-heavy ("swallowed truth" appears as label) rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is coherent throughout: the aurora's "sorrowful glow" appears at closure, and the tone pervades—post-fever hollowness, ozone and old blood, the wind carrying her name away. Tone modulates with pressure: reflective melancholy in the opening, tightening urgency when the barometer dips, quiet dissolution at the end. The final image (aurora, vanishing footprints, humming radio) charges sorrow with beauty and cost. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle beats sustain the tone without static repetition. Specificity is high (auroral + sorrow, not generic sadness). One minor slip: "sorrowful" in the final paragraph risks labeling the effect rather than embodying it fully.</comment>
