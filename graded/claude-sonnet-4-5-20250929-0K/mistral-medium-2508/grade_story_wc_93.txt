<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's curse of knowing "the moment before something shifted" is established but remains more atmospheric than action-driving until late. Her micro-choices—placing rocks, reaching for dust, pressing palms to sand—accumulate pressure, though internal contradiction is limited; she moves through the sequence with ritual certainty rather than competing impulses. The final stance ("just the one cursed to keep it") registers as acceptance with cost, but the protagonist's agency reads more as conduit than author of change. Embodied emotion is present ("fingers bleeding where the grains bit too deep") yet the therapeutic frame ("cursed to keep it") edges toward label-speak at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through density increase and pattern recognition, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "the patterns held...the promise did not linger, but slept"). Orientation anchors who/where/aurora early; the "after friction disappears" premise is signaled but remains abstract until the mirror-water and eel return materialize it. One meaningful deepening occurs when the dust "snaps" the aurora into a ring and the eels coil around her wrists, reweighting her role from seeker to keeper. Cost is legible in "the dust settled into her bones" and the永續 cycle ("place more tomorrow"), though the promise's exact stakes remain oblique. Closure lands on the page with felt cost under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and dust function as micro-setting that charges the final image: the bluff's "slick as a breath held too long" establishes friction loss, the aurora's pulsing threads mirror Liora's ritual, and the dust's warmth/weight constrain her final act. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("paint flaking like dead skin," "grains bit too deep"), filtered through urgency. Spatial choreography is clean—tideline, sand, rocks, rising water—and the environment's frictionless property directly enables the eels' return. The "borrowed dawn" tone integrates setting and atmosphere, meeting the gate for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding and keeping the sacred patterns to prevent "something that wanted the promises broken." Pressure accumulates through her curse's repeated confirmations (eel flick, aurora flare, mother's voice crack) and tightens when the dust shivers, the aurora snaps into a ring, and the mirror-water reflects her unraveling. One meaningful deepening: realizing "the promise had never been to her. She was just the one cursed to keep it." Agency is present in her final push ("pressed her palms to the sand...and pushed"), though the eels' return and the patterns' mechanics feel partly automated. Cost is legible in bleeding fingers, dust in bones, and the永續 obligation ("place more tomorrow"), foreclosing escape.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of inherited obligation and cyclical burden emerges through the grandmother's whispered promise, Liora's ritual placement, and the final acceptance that "she was just the one cursed to keep it." The dust/stars/eels motif accretes meaning: dust as memory anchor, eels as proof of pattern efficacy, the promise as cosmic contract. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing—Liora walks the bluff as "the only friction left," her footsteps both cost and anchor. Subtext operates in "the promise wasn't about the eels" reversal and the aurora dimming to embers. The sacred patterns shift from map to anchor, constraining her future with conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited with tight focalization through Liora's perceptual signature: she notices patterns, sequences, the "moment before something shifted." Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and voice-particular ("slick as a breath held too long," "fine as regret," "warm as a pulse"). Purposeful compression in "It was why she placed the painted rocks now" trusts the reader to infer ritual continuity. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during the dust contact, wider during the eels' return. No dialogue to judge. One minor slip: "the dawn broke, stolen and fragile" edges toward poetic assertion outside her immediate perception, but the effect supports closure tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("tide had stolen the friction," "aurora pulsed like a dying heartbeat," "eels...slipping through her nets like smoke"). Two issues lower the score: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent beats ("The dust at her feet shivered. / Liora exhaled, slow and deliberate, and reached for it" → "grains were heavier than they should've been, warm as a pulse" restates tactile discovery without advancing), and mixed metaphor in "paint flaking like dead skin" clashes with the cosmic/elemental register. Template cadence: "She pressed...She didn't know...She would place" creates stem repetition across closure beats. Clarity remains high; no scaffold obscures causality, but density occasionally tips toward overwriting in non-peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Premise—eel herder placing mathematical rock sequences to anchor collapsing reality after friction vanishes—offers a fresh synthesis of cosmological stakes and manual ritual. The precognitive curse, dust mechanics, and aurora-as-circuit feel specific to this world. Emotional arc (seeker → keeper) and the "anchors not maps" reversal avoid template plotting. Risk-taking in the frictionless premise and borrowed-dawn tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One derivative element: the "cursed guardian of ancient patterns" echoes widely used templates; transformation through the friction-loss mechanic and dust-as-anchor specificity restores freshness. The ending's quiet永續 obligation ("place more tomorrow...until the patterns held") commits fully to cyclical burden without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora drives all major beats: tracing sand (setup), placing rocks (sequences glow), reaching for dust (aurora snaps), pressing palms to sand (push that shatters mirror-water and returns eels), accepting her role (closure stance). Her choices create the key turns—no passive observation. Present throughout and causally active at closure. Cost visible in bleeding fingers and永續 obligation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Collapsed star dust appears in grandmother's whisper (setup), collected in crevices (description), shivers when pattern recognized (beat one), "heavier than they should've been, warm as a pulse" (beat two), woven into gaps between rocks with bleeding cost (beat three), "settled into her bones" (closure payoff). Handled across four distinct beats; irreplaceable—its cosmic/memory properties anchor the promise mechanic. Reweighted from forgotten substance to living anchor. Cost tied directly to it (bleeding, embodiment).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The promise shapes Liora's motivation (understand patterns to keep it) and reappears at closure ("the promise did not linger, but slept"). Grandmother's whisper seeds it early; the reversal "the promise had never been to her" alters her stance from seeker to keeper. It changes options (she must continue placing rocks) and charges the final image. However, the promise's exact content and stakes remain abstract; we see its effect (eels return, patterns hold) but not what breaking it would unleash beyond "something that wanted the promises broken." Functional but could be more concrete.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Precognitive curse is present (she knows "the moment before something shifted," examples given: eel flick, aurora flare, mother's voice crack) and enables her recognition when the dust shivers and the world tilts. It constrains her life (she's the last eel herder, isolated with knowledge no one else can read). However, the trait is mostly descriptive; it doesn't visibly limit a choice or impose a tradeoff at a peak beat—she uses it to recognize the right moment but doesn't sacrifice or struggle against it. Label-heavy without dramatic cost tied directly to the curse itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Harness it, or it will unmake you" is voiced by the older presence and Liora responds by weaving dust into rock gaps, then pressing palms to sand to push. The harnessing act causes the aurora to fracture into lines, the mirror to shatter, and the eels to return—major turns trace directly to this action. Present in closure (dust in bones, patterns holding). Could arguably be swapped for "anchor" or "bind" with minor edits, but the dust-weaving and palm-push sequence feel specific to harnessing metaphor. Strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Placing painted rocks in sequences is signaled early ("she placed the painted rocks now, arranging them in spirals and fractals"), demonstrated in beat ("pressed a blue-streaked stone into the sand"), causes the world to tilt and dust to shiver (mechanics matter), sequences glow when dust is woven in (escalation), and at closure "the rocks remained, their sequences perfect" with the永續 cycle ("place more tomorrow"). Mechanics shape her attempts and the ending's stakes. Irreplaceable—no other method would produce the pattern-as-anchor effect. Present across setup, middle, and closure with visible cost (bleeding fingers, endless repetition).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tidal bluff supplies the frictionless surface ("slick as a breath held too long"), the tideline where rocks can be placed, the crevices where dust collects (resources), and the rising water that forms the mirror (complication). Aurora overhead provides the circuit for the patterns. The bluff's edge and frictionless property enable the eels' return and constrain her final stance ("her footsteps the only friction left"). Setting is causally active, not postcard description, and charges the closure image. Micro-setting via dust crevices and tideline alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After friction disappears" sets the premise and explains the eels' vanishing and the world's slickness. It's present as background condition (frictionless deep, tide's theft) and implied in the eels' smoke-like slipping. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—there's no live clock or urgency beyond Liora's自我-imposed ritual. "That night" and "the hundredth time" suggest duration but don't pressure tactics. The friction-loss is more setting attribute than temporal constraint. Functional premise but replaceable with "after the eels vanished" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Liora's desire to understand sacred patterns drives her repeated tracing, rock placement, and dust-weaving. Friction appears when she realizes the patterns aren't maps but anchors, and that the promise wasn't hers to fulfill but to keep—this reweights her want (understand → keep) with永續 cost. However, the motivation is somewhat told ("because she had to see it") rather than shown through competing desires. The final acceptance ("just the one cursed to keep it") reads as renunciation of understanding in favor of eternal guardianship, a credible shift with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" appears in the opening as paint color ("leached pale by the borrowed dawn") and closes the piece ("the dawn broke, stolen and fragile, painting the tide in colors that didn't exist before"). Tone is elegiac, liminal, and charged with cosmic unease throughout—coherent across beats. The "stolen and fragile" quality modulates with pressure, intensifying during the dust contact and softening into resigned vigilance at closure. The tone charges the final image of invented colors and Liora as sole friction. Lyric reprise reweights the opening's "borrowed" into closure's "stolen," adding conceptual cost. Strong but not indispensable—removing "borrowed" would not break story logic.</comment>
