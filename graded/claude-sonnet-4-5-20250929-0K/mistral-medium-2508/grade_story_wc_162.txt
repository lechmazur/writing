<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows clear motivation (finding Liora) and the grain-following moment reveals problem-solving under pressure. Liora's interiority at closure carries weight ("some thresholds need to be crossed alone"), but her arc remains thin—we see determination more than contradiction. The climactic choice (Elias climbing down rather than pulling her up) is motivated but the emotional cost feels muted; his acceptance arrives too smoothly without visible struggle in the sinkhole beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (farmhouse porch, missing child, maze architect). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: clues accrete (logbook code, corn husk note, terrace grain) toward the sinkhole reveal, then the firefly-lit chamber reweights "center" and "threshold." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias's descent and "teach me the codes" crystallize a shared crossing with palpable cost (he abandons rescue for initiation). One friction: the logbook's BFE-7 code is underlined but never explicates how it led him to act; the leap from "butterfly effect" to sinkhole relies on intuition more than shown linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace's wood grain constrains Elias's search (he follows the curl to find the husk), and the sinkhole's lashed-chair ladder is tactile and specific. Sensory details—kerosene/salt smell, cornstalks whispering, fireflies pulsing—are filtered through urgency. The maze's spatial logic (designed confusion vs. the "real center") directly shapes the plot. Minor slip: the "drifting prism" shimmer on the terrace is noted but never returns or alters a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (find the missing child) and tightens when Elias intuits she's beyond the maze. The corn-husk note ("center isn't the middle") forces a tactical pivot to the sinkhole, and his descent is an agency-driven choice that forecloses simple rescue. Cost is present but muted—Elias's internal resistance to joining her "threshold" world dissolves quickly in the firefly beat without visible struggle, softening the escalation's bite.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (thresholds, sacred crossings, necessary distances) emerges through image and action—the maze as deliberate confusion, the sinkhole as hidden center, the fireflies' spiral door-pattern. Liora's "some thresholds need to be crossed alone" and Elias's reciprocal "teach me the codes" land without moralizing, and the final image (ladder holds, cornstalks sway in new wind) charges prior material. One friction: "necessary distances" is named in the maze description but not causally tested—Elias designs the maze to confuse, yet his own distance from Liora is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; perceptual signature is consistent (Elias notices structural details, Liora speaks in gnomic fragments). Dialogue is spare and purposeful ("Took you long enough," "Then teach me the codes"). Two frictions lower the grade: "featherly determined" appears twice as a descriptor but never roots in Elias's or Liora's idiolect (it reads authorial); and the firefly-chamber beat shifts into elevated diction ("the sacred shake of the world when you stand exactly where you're meant to be") that exceeds both characters' established registers under the stated pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high (logbook, terrace grain, husk note, sinkhole ladder all advance plot), and the opening line hooks cleanly. Three patterns accumulate to penalty: (1) "featherly determined" recurs identically without variation; (2) "the way X, the way Y—it wasn't absence, it was a threshold" is lyric but borders paraphrase loop; (3) the phrase "like a held breath / like a held sigh" echoes within ~200 words. Scaffold phrases ("he intuited," "he understood, suddenly") lean on filter verbs in peak beats. Closure image is vivid, but density wobbles mid-piece with decorative metaphor (corn as "poorly aimed scissors").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—maze architect, pilot's logbook weather code, sinkhole as "real center"—is specific and non-obvious, and the firefly-door imagery feels fresh. The emotional truth (parent's controlled design vs. child's liminal intuition) is earned. One derivative note: the "chosen one finds hidden sanctuary" frame is widely used; transformation comes through the wood-grain method and the reciprocal "teach me" closure, which elevate but do not fully escape the template's gravity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora (the lost child) is present early and her choices at closure (remaining in the sinkhole, offering the firefly lesson) force Elias's descent decision. She appears in setup, drives the middle via the husk note, and speaks at closure. Swappability friction: another hidden child with cryptic knowledge could function similarly with minor edits; Liora's specific traits (featherly determination, threshold vocabulary) color the scene but are not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The pilot's logbook appears early (porch floorboard) and its BFE-7 code ("butterfly effect") is underlined, cueing thematic stakes. It returns at closure when Elias hands it to Liora ("teach me the codes"). Two beats, purposeful bookend. Cap at 4.6 for lack of middle development: between discovery and handoff, the logbook is carried but not consulted or used to alter tactics. The code's mechanics (why BFE-7 pointed to the sinkhole) remain opaque, weakening causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is named early (maze description: "labyrinth of necessary distances, each turn calculated to make losers question…"). It shapes the premise—Elias built isolation into the design—and the closure image reweights it: his descent collapses the distance he engineered. The concept operates thematically and causally (the maze's design is the obstacle Liora circumvents). Friction: the phrase itself is abstract; on-page we see "designed to confuse" more than a specific constraint that alters Elias's later choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears twice as a descriptor (Liora at maze entrance, Liora's smile at closure) but is never embodied in action or tested under pressure. It reads as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. Present in setup and closure (lyric reprise), but swappable with "stubbornly certain" or "fiercely resolved" without altering plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Intuit" is the named action (Elias intuits Liora isn't in the maze anymore; "The way the wind carried no trace…it wasn't absence. It was a threshold"). This perception drives his pivot from searching the rows to investigating the terrace and following the grain. Setup and middle development present; it enables the tactical shift. Friction: the intuition itself is asserted more than earned by prior sensory cues—crows going quiet and wind-silence are mentioned but not built into a causal chain that makes the leap undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Analyzing the grain in wooden furniture" is signaled on the terrace ("analyzing the way the fibers curled toward the house's oldest beam—like a question mark, like an arrow") and causally drives the discovery of the corn-husk note in the beam's split. One distinct beat with clear mechanics; the method matters. Missing closure participation: at the sinkhole and in the final image, grain-reading does not return or shape the ending. Cap neighborhood ~6.0 for setup + middle but no payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "drifting prism terrace" is named and described early (air shimmers, light bends into wrong colors; Liora loved it, wood hums). It supplies the location where Elias finds the grain clue, so it enables one beat. The "drifting prism" shimmer itself is noted but never used—no optical effect alters his perception or choice. Present in setup, functional in middle (terrace → beam → husk), absent from closure. Swappability moderate: another liminal outdoor spot could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" as timeframe is oblique. The logbook's BFE-7 code is glossed as "butterfly effect…not a storm, a shift," and the story opens "three days" after Liora went missing. The three-day clock is mentioned once and does not tighten decisions; no sense of search urgency or time running out shapes Elias's moves on the page. The "after" framing is thematic (a shift has occurred) but does not function as a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To discover why some thresholds feel sacred" is voiced by Liora at the terrace (she whispers about "the sacred way the wood hummed") and fulfilled at closure (sinkhole as "real center," fireflies casting door-patterns, "some thresholds need to be crossed alone"). The motivation is dramatized in Liora's actions and the final exchange. Friction: Elias's own desire to understand sacredness is implied but not shown in conflict—he accepts the threshold without visible internal friction, so the motivation reads more as Liora's than jointly pursued with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is established early (wind carries no trace, crows go quiet, stalks whisper "in a fractured hush") and modulates under pressure (stalks "whispering as if the maze itself was deciding," sinkhole air "thicker, sweeter, like the moment before a storm breaks"). Tone charges the final image: the new wind, the ladder holding, the fireflies burning brighter. Coherent through turns, purposefully hushed and liminal, and the closing beat amplifies rather than breaking the established mood.</comment>
