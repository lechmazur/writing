<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("the space between the strands, where the idea of freedom had been trapped"), and the reflective block on her mother/locket anchors a present micro-choice to open the ribbon. However, the man remains functionally flat—his "moth-eaten coat" and snarled demand are gestural shorthand without contradictory impulses. The final choice (pressing the map's center, telling him to "Go") feels more conceptual than embodied with visible cost; the locksmith smiles "unassumingly bold" in summary rather than through a dramatized tradeoff that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (locksmith, shop, evening stars). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ribbon unravels, the map blooms, the shop dissolves and reassembles—each beat reweights the dominant stake (freeing the trapped idea). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the locksmith's realization that "the boldest act wasn't opening, but *letting the locked thing decide*" reconfigures the premise with felt cost (she tucks the now-ordinary hair beside her unopened locket, accepting perpetual irresolution). One meaningful deepening is present and cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nexus setting is vivid and voice-filtered: "alleys bled into silence," "lamplight beneath the first stars," "the scent of ozone and old parchment." The crookedest pick (forged from meteorite splinter) and the locket constrain choices—she uses the pick to open the ribbon, and the unopened locket charges the final image by paralleling the hair. Micro-setting (shop dissolving into starlight, counter as stage) pressures the protagonist's stance and tilts the closure moment when she pockets both tokens of unfinished work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: free the idea/girl trapped by fear. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the locksmith exhales and "listened—not to the metal, but to the space between the strands," which narrows method and raises conceptual cost. The man's snarl ("You were supposed to free *her*") and the locksmith's correction ("Not her. The *idea*") constitute a micro-turn that reweights the stakes. Cost is legible: she accepts permanent ambiguity (unopened locket, ordinary hair) and the city's held breath implies consequences still unfolding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: freedom as permission rather than force, the choice to "let the locked thing decide." The locksmith's rule ("Never open what you cannot close") is tested and refined through the ribbon scene, not stated as moral. The final image—tucking the now-limp hair beside her unopened locket—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: some secrets "enveloped you, soft as hair, heavy as ribbons" and demand restraint, not revelation. The piece resists tidy closure; the girl waking and the door creaking open are atmospheric consequences, not resolutions, preserving productive ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable focal distance; the locksmith's perceptual signature ("her fingers already knew the weight of it") is distinct and embodied. The man's dialogue ("It's a prison," "You were supposed to free *her*") carries goal-driven subtext and forces the protagonist's clarification. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate at peak pressure ("She followed the hint, not with her hands but with her memory"), wider for cosmic possibility. Diction remains voice-consistent ("moth-eaten coat," "rough as unplaned wood") with no head-hopping or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory specificity is strong ("the ribbon's knot resisted every tool but her smallest, crookedest pick"). However, minor pattern artifacts appear: "The locksmith had a rule," "The locksmith had spent," "The locksmith's own mother"—three consecutive paragraph stems anchor to the protagonist's title rather than varied syntax. The final third sustains momentum without loops, and figurative language ("map blooming," "wound pooling") remains coherent. Information density is high and the closure image is clear, but the stem repetition merits a small deduction within Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—locksmith who opens metaphysical constraints—transforms a familiar urban-fantasy trope through specific choices: the meteorite pick, the braided-fear backstory, the inversion that "the lock was never meant to keep me in, but to keep the world out." The turn (freeing the *idea* rather than the person) feels earned in hindsight and avoids template resolution. However, the nexus/alleys/stars setting and the enigmatic artisan archetype remain proximate to widely published examples. Emotional specificity (mother's locket, unopened) and the conceptual repricing elevate originality into the solid 7-range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The locksmith appears early, drives the middle choice (using the crookedest pick, listening to the space between strands), and her final action (pressing the map's center, pocketing the hair) shapes closure. Her decision to "let the locked thing decide" reweights the premise with visible cost (accepting perpetual ambiguity). Meets setup, development, and payoff gates with causal pressure and closure linkage; scores in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lock of hair and ribbon are handled in multiple beats: slid across the counter, pulsing warm, unraveled by the pick, expanding into a map, then tucked limp into the apron beside the locket. The ribbon's transformation (from taut constraint to frayed ordinary) reweights the closure image. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending with evolving meaning and cost connection; strong causal pressure and irreplaceability push into the high 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core concept "enveloped secrets" shapes stakes explicitly: the girl's fear braided into hair, the ribbon tied too tight, the locksmith's realization that "the greatest secrets weren't hidden behind locks. They were the ones that *enveloped* you." This understanding drives her final choice to pocket the hair rather than fully resolve it. Present in setup (hair pulsing), development (map as question), and payoff (final image), with moderate causal pressure and closure linkage; mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The attribute "unassumingly bold" is named once in the final paragraph ("The locksmith smiled, unassumingly bold") as summary rather than demonstrated through prior action. The trait's tension (modest presentation, audacious method) is implied by her choice to use the meteorite pick and accept cosmic disorientation, but no visible cost or tradeoff is tied to this specific duality on the page. Ornamental labeling without beat-by-beat constraint; scores in the low functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "disorient" drives the major turn: when the locksmith opens the ribbon, "the shop tilting like a ship in a storm," "walls dissolved into starlight," forcing her to recognize "the hush of cosmic possibility." This disorientation redefines her understanding (not freeing *her*, but the *idea*) and charges the closure choice. Present in setup (hint of cosmic possibility), peaks at the middle beat, and its consequence (accepting ambiguity) shapes the ending. Strong causal role with closure linkage; high 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method "a hint given by first star seen at twilight" is signaled early ("the first star of evening winked through the skylight, sharp as a needle's eye. *There,* it seemed to say") and guides the locksmith's approach: she follows "the hint, not with her hands but with her memory." The star blinks again at closure ("slower this time, as if nodding"), reweighting the method's role. Meets setup, development, and payoff with moderate causal pressure; scores at the lower edge of the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" is present from the opening line ("the nexus where the city's alleys bled into silence") and becomes the stage for transformation: the shop dissolves into starlight, reassembles, and the nexus hums at closure. The setting's liminal quality enables the cosmic disorientation and charges the final beat ("In the dark, the nexus hummed"). Meets all three gates with closure participation and moderate causal pressure; mid-7 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the hush of cosmic possibility" is named once during the disorientation beat ("the hush of cosmic possibility, the moment before a door chooses") and again implied at closure ("the city held its breath"). It provides tonal framing but does not tighten decisions or tactics; no live clock pressures the locksmith's choices. Present in setup and ending with lyric resonance but minimal causal constraint; low-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to free an idea trapped behind fear" is dramatized through the man's demand, the locksmith's memory of the girl who "braided her fears into her hair," and the pivot: "Not her. The *idea*." This desire drives the ribbon-opening and the final choice to let the locked thing decide, with visible cost (pocketing the ordinary hair, accepting irresolution). Present across setup, middle choice, and closure with friction between want (to free) and cost (perpetual ambiguity); solid 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone "improbable longing" modulates across turns: the locksmith's quiet yearning to open what others can't, the man's rough desperation, the wistful closure ("Somewhere, a girl was waking with a name on her lips she'd never dared speak"). Tone remains coherent and charges the final image (blowing out the lamp, the nexus humming), though the longing is more atmospheric than viscerally embodied at peak pressure. Meets setup and closure participation with moderate tonal control; mid-6 band.</comment>
