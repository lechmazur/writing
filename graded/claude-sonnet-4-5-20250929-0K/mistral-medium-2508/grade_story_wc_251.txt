<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's core motivation is clear—saving the library through creative rebellion—and his chess-coach discipline shapes his tactical approach. The interior is concrete ("iron filings in his palm," "cracked spectacles") and the micro-choices (slipping notes, coordinating displays) feel character-specific. However, his internal conflict is underdeveloped; he moves smoothly through his plan without visible hesitation or competing impulses, and the final micro-choice ("smiled") carries minimal cost or contradiction. The embodied tension at closure ("listened," "smiled") lacks the layered ambiguity that would lift this into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric fragments, synchronized displays as mounting pressure) and the closure lands as Charged Poise—the library is saved, but the grotto's pulse and "something hungry" in the windows signal an ongoing, unresolved force. Cost is legible: the council's capitulation is haunted by the grotto's autonomy ("the game was far from over"). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (cobalt library, mist, Elias). One meaningful tightening occurs when the workers lower their tools, narrowing the council's options. The lens holds through the ending without contradiction, and the final image reweights earlier motifs (pawn, grotto pulse, unspoken chorus) with felt unease.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt library and magnetic grotto constrain tactics: the grotto's pull intensifies, the filings hum and seal doors, the windows reflect chess patterns that stop the demolition crew. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("ozone and old parchment," "veins of blue," "low, resonant note"). Spatial choreography is clear (library steps, beneath the library, town displays). The ending image charges the grotto as a persistent force ("its magnetic heart beating"), fulfilling the micro-setting requirement. Minor slip: "twilight hour when the library's ghosts leaned closest" is a stock phrase that dilutes specificity at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: saving the library. The piece accumulates pressure through coordinated displays, escalating to the council's noon arrival with hammers—a clear, irreversible threat. The foreman swinging his hammer is the peak tightening; when the filings sing and the workers lower their tools, options narrow with visible cost (the council's authority is undercut, the grotto's autonomy grows). Agency is distributed across Elias and his students but driven by Elias's plan. The cost at closure is legible: the library remains, but the grotto's "hungry" pulse suggests an uncontrolled consequence. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the synchronized displays and magnetic chains are causally earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: rebellion as patient, silent coordination rather than noise; the cost of saving what refuses to be forgotten. The recurring pawn and chess metaphors ground the theme without stating it ("every move is a conversation"). The grotto's autonomy at the end complicates triumph—the library is saved, but at what price?—offering a non-literal answer to the central question. The final image ("the game was far from over") reweights prior material with resonance. Minor slip: "the quiet things that refuse to be forgotten" edges toward abstraction, though it's anchored in prior images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is consistent (chess terms, tactical framing, attention to filings and symmetry). The prose modulates appropriately, tightening at the hammer-strike beat and breathing during reflective moments. However, several lines slip into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Elias-specific: "the hush where past meets prophecy," "a swarm of restless bees," "the rebellion had never been about noise." Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Did we win?" / "The game isn't over"). Free indirect style is clean. The voice is distinct but occasionally drifts toward lyric abstraction that doesn't fully belong to the chess coach's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images ("cobalt library stood like a bruise," "filings dance and align"). Information density is high and momentum steady through the escalation. However, several loops and near-duplicates appear: "unspoken words" recurs three times without reweighting; "the game was far from over" echoes "the game isn't over" within two paragraphs; "mist" and "cobalt" are recycled decoratively. Template cadence: "He [verb], then [verb]" structures repeat ("He nodded, then gathered"). Stock metaphors: "like a bruise," "like a held breath," "like question marks." These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull the closure beats slightly. Apply −0.8 for moderate loop/scaffold spread, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats, total −1.1 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The magnetic-grotto mechanism and synchronized-display tactic offer a fresh angle on library-defense stories, and the chess-as-rebellion frame is purposefully integrated. The ending resists tidy closure with the grotto's unresolved autonomy, a risk that pays off thematically. However, the core premise (humble creative resistance saves beloved institution) is a widely used template, and the piece doesn't fully transform it through unexpected moral calculus or subversive character choice—Elias succeeds cleanly, the council folds, and the cost (grotto autonomy) is atmospheric rather than personal. The "quiet rebel" archetype and chess-coach casting feel familiar. Apply −0.7 for derivative premise, mitigated by the grotto's specificity and the charged ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, drives the key decisions (slipping notes, gathering students, sealing the doors), and his chess-coach discipline shapes tactics. His choice to "listen" at closure participates in the ending image but lacks a visible cost that differentiates him from his role. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is functional but not decisively transformative. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4, minus swappability −0.5, minus summary-only use in the "forests of second thoughts" line −0.4. Total adjustments net to +2.6 above 3.0 base.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto is handled across multiple beats: Elias visits it, presses his palm to the stone, feels its pull grow stronger, hears the library speak through it, and the filings from the grotto seal the doors and sing at the climax. It shapes the ending image ("its magnetic heart beating"). Three gates met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4, minus ornamental description in the first grotto visit −0.3. Total adjustments net to +5.1 above 3.0 base, but the grotto's autonomy is atmospheric rather than a direct constraint on Elias's tactics, capping upside at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "humble rebellion" is signaled early ("silent infection of meaning," "planting forests of second thoughts") and manifests in the synchronized displays and the students' coordinated action. It shapes the dominant stake and the tactic of quiet, collective resistance. However, the concept is more thematic than tactical—it doesn't impose a specific cost or constraint that differentiates this rebellion from other creative-resistance plots. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is present but indirect. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, minus swappability (the "humble" frame could be replaced with "clever" or "patient" without major edits) −0.6. Total adjustments net to +2.2 above 3.0 base.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Hears unspoken words" appears twice: the opening ("whispering between the shelves") and when the grotto speaks ("the library itself speak"). The trait enables the grotto dialogue but doesn't constrain Elias's choices or impose a visible cost—he hears, then acts smoothly. Missing middle development gate; two gates met (setup, payoff). Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (weak; it informs but doesn't narrow options) +0.3, closure linkage +0.5, minus label-only in the opening −0.3, minus no visible tradeoff −0.5. Total adjustments net to +0.8 above 3.0 base.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cradle" recurs purposefully: Elias cradles iron filings, then cradles the pawn at closure. The action frames his tactical gentleness and reappears in the ending image, reweighting the pawn motif. However, the action itself is not a major turn—it's contemplative rather than transformative. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is absent (the cradling doesn't alter tactics mid-story). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.5, minus swappability (he could "hold" or "grip" with minor edits) −0.5, minus missing middle gate per cap at 3.4 abandoned in favor of lyric-resonance allowance which permits 5.5–6.3 for seed-and-reprise. Total adjustments net to +2.8 above 3.0 base, plus lyric bonus +0.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synchronized window displays are signaled early ("slipping notes… each one a coordinate"), developed through multiple examples (dressmaker, bakery, every pane in town), and culminate in the council's paralysis when the displays become undeniable. The method shapes the middle escalation and the climax. Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6, cost connection (the displays expose Elias and his students to council retaliation, though the cost is not paid on the page) +0.3. Total adjustments net to +5.3 above 3.0 base, but the mechanics are summary-level (we don't see Elias coordinate logistics), apply −0.4 for summary-only use, final +4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt library is the spatial anchor and the object of the conflict; the mist surrounds and obscures. The library's doors, windows, and grotto beneath it are handled across multiple beats and constrain the council's demolition attempt. The setting charges the final image ("the library stood, patient as a held breath"). Three gates met. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the building itself becomes a defensive tool via the grotto and windows) +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4. Total adjustments net to +6.3 above 3.0 base, minus stock phrase "patient as a held breath" touching closure −0.4, final +5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "hush where past meets prophecy" is named once and signals the twilight when Elias returns to the grotto. The timeframe is atmospheric but doesn't tighten decisions—events unfold over "seven days" and "by midday" without a live clock that alters tactics. Missing middle development and closure participation gates; setup gate met weakly. Late first appearance (second third) −0.4, ornamental use (label without pressure) −0.7, swappability (any twilight or threshold moment would work) −0.6, minus missing gates per cap at 2.8 abandoned in favor of atmospheric contribution +1.5. Total adjustments net to −0.2 above 3.0 base, but the phrase charges the grotto visit slightly, lift to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Planting forests of second thoughts" is dramatized through the window displays and Elias's teaching ("every move is a conversation"). The motivation shapes the dominant stake and the tactic of gradual, collective persuasion. However, it's more thematic than conflicted—Elias pursues it without visible friction between his want and competing costs. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is indirect. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability (the phrasing is vivid, but the underlying desire—change minds to save the library—is standard) −0.5, minus no visible friction between wants and costs −0.6. Total adjustments net to +2.0 above 3.0 base.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is coherent throughout: whispered words, silent displays, the grotto's hum, the workers' aching teeth, the final "unspoken chorus." Tone modulates with pressure (the hammer strike, the filings' song) and charges the ending image (the library "patient as a held breath," the grotto pulsing). Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the quiet itself becomes a tactical weapon—the singing filings stop the workers) +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6. Total adjustments net to +5.4 above 3.0 base.</comment>
