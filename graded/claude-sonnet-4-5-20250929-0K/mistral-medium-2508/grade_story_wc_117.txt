<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is given clear motivational continuity (the childhood memory, the tuning fork metaphor) and his therapeutic approach is embodied through concrete actions. However, his interior contradictions remain muted—his choices feel competent and adaptive without visible cost or foreclosed paths until the very end. The vial transfer and song at the eclipse read more as facilitation than a decision that alters his own stance with friction. Mira's arc from silence to humming is earned on the page, but her interiority is absent, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors who/where/when early and builds through accretive callbacks (ridge, song, vial, eclipse) to a Resonant Reconfiguration at totality when Mira hums and "the ridge sang back." The closure crystallizes prior material with felt cost (Lila's relinquishment of the vial, Mira's breakthrough). One escalation beat—canceling appointments to drive to the ridge—narrows options and raises stakes. The piece coheres under its lens, though the final cost could be more visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is established early with sensory particulars (gnarled roots, sagebrush, iron-tasting air) and returns at the climax where the eclipse light and "stones hummed" charge the closure image. The vial as micro-object constrains Elias's choice to press it into Mira's palm. Spatial choreography is clean. The ridge's "ordinary magic" remains somewhat abstract—its mechanics never materially constrain a tactic—but the eclipse setting does tighten the window and amplify pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: helping Mira find her voice. The eclipse road trip is a clear tightening choice that forecloses normal session work and raises exposure. The climax—Elias singing, Mira humming, Lila sobbing—delivers a turn with embodied emotion and visible cost (the vial relinquished, Lila's fear unclenching). One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length. Agency is present but feels facilitative rather than forged under competing pressures; Elias's own want versus need remains implicit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" emerges through concrete particulars (the ridge hum, the vial glow, Mira's fractured phrase) rather than assertion. The final image—"It just needed to be *heard*"—reweights prior material without overt moralizing, though it flirts with thematic echo. The stroke survivor coda offers a resonant answer to the central question (music as reminder, not fix) and avoids tidy resolution. Theme resists false equivalence and invites reflection; minor deduction for the near-platitude in the closing line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression ("tuning fork in his pocket," "metronome stuck on *allegro*") supports character and pressure. POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Trust me," "Listen," "For the next one who needs to hear the ridge sing"). Free indirect style is clean. Minor slips: "ordinary magic, his mother would've called it" leans expository, and the final reflection ("he decided") tells where showing would sharpen. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in peak beats. The opening anchor is vivid. However, paraphrase loops appear: "Mira's fingers twisted… like a metronome" then "her other hand found her mother's, their fingers linking" recycles the finger motif without added pressure. Template cadence in the coda: "He nodded… That night… The next morning…" reads scaffolded. Filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("he noticed," "he knew," "he understood"). Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; "thread of spun gold" for the curl is serviceable. Line-level clarity is intact at closure, so artifact penalties remain in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The music-therapist-plus-eclipse frame is familiar (therapeutic breakthrough via celestial event), but the piece specifies through the vial, the ridge song, and Elias's childhood memory. The "ordinary magic" phrase and the explain-everything coda ("his job wasn't to fix… but to remind") edge toward template rhetoric. Transformation test: swapping names and setting would leave the emotional arc largely intact. The stroke survivor beat at the end adds a fresh inflection but also feels like an engineered symmetry. Risk-taking is modest; no bold structural or perspectival deviation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's "mellow" temperament is present throughout: he plays "wandering, wordless melody," waits for Mira's feet, cancels appointments, and sings at the eclipse. His adaptive patience enables the breakthrough and his choice to give Mira the vial is a key turn. However, his mellowness is more label and facilitator trait than a source of internal friction or visible cost; he never struggles against impatience or doubt on the page. The character is functional and shapes two beats (the initial sessions, the eclipse), but swappable with a similarly gentle archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vial appears in beat one (Lila's neck), returns glowing in the eclipse light (beat two), is pressed into Mira's palm (beat three), and reappears in the coda when Lila offers it to Elias for "the next one." Four touches across the arc. The glow under eclipse light is the charged reprise that enables closure. Cost: Lila relinquishes it, foreclosing her private hold on Mira's infancy. The object is nearly indispensable—removing it would collapse the tactile transfer that sparks Mira's hum. Minor deduction: the vial's mechanics (why it glows, why Mira responds) remain unexplained, slightly lowering specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named twice and embodied in the ridge hum, the vial glow, and Mira's breakthrough. It frames the thematic question and the closure answer. However, it operates more as atmosphere and theme than as a constraint on tactics—Elias never chooses between magical and mundane methods, and the magic does not impose a felt cost or rule. The concept is present and shapes the final image but remains abstract; it could be removed and the plot (therapeutic breakthrough via eclipse) would hold. Mid-band for thematic resonance without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is established early ("mellow," "quiet, adaptive patience," waiting for Mira's feet) and enables Elias's strategy across three sessions and the eclipse. It constrains his method—he does not push Mira verbally. However, it never costs him: no scene shows him struggling against urgency or institutional pressure. The trait is functional and consistent but lacks visible trade-off. Removing "soft" and keeping "adaptive" would not break the story. Mid-band for enabling without cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Link" appears literally when Mira and Lila's fingers link at totality, the moment of breakthrough. It also echoes in Elias linking past (childhood ridge song) to present. The finger-link is the physical beat that seals the emotional turn and is featured in the closure unit. Removing it would weaken the embodied connection but the core turn (Mira humming) would survive. The action is signaled, drives one key beat, and charges the ending. Strong integration, not quite indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The eclipse is announced midway ("Then came the eclipse"), drives Elias's decision to cancel appointments and travel to the ridge, creates the ticking clock (totality), and supplies the eerie half-light that makes the vial glow—the proximate cause of Mira's gasp and hum. The method is signaled, its mechanics (shadow, timing, light) matter, and it is indispensable to the closure beat. Cost: Elias risks professional disruption and Lila's trust. Three-gate: setup (announced), development (travel choice), payoff (totality as the breakthrough moment). Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is introduced in the opening (childhood memory), returns as the chosen eclipse site (middle choice), and "sang back" at the climax—stones hum, sagebrush shivers. The ridge supplies the song Elias learned and the acoustic "magic" that validates Mira's hum. However, the ridge could be replaced with any remote, meaningful location; its unique properties (why *this* ridge sings) are asserted, not mechanically constrained. The setting charges the final image and shapes two beats but is not irreplaceable. Solid integration, mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears only in the coda as the setting for Elias writing the new song. It is poetic but ornamental—no choice hinges on it, no pressure arises from it, and it arrives after closure. The phrase evokes the ridge but does not function as a timeframe constraint. Swappable with "that night" without loss. Present but decorative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To nurture lifelong wonder" is implicit in Elias's vocation and explicit in the coda reflection: "remind them they'd always known how to sing." It aligns with his choice to take Mira to the eclipse and frames the thematic answer. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted—Elias does not weigh wonder against safety, cost, or professional protocol on the page. The motivation is told and consistent but lacks friction. Mid-band for coherence without embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" fits the opening lyricism ("tuning fork in his pocket"), the measured buildup ("Trust me"), and the controlled release at totality ("Lila made a sound—half laugh, half sob"). Tone modulates cleanly under pressure and charges the final image. However, "cautious" and "exuberant" do not tension each other in a single charged beat—caution dominates early, exuberance arrives at the eclipse. The tone is coherent and purposeful but not dynamically braided within one moment. Solid fit, not indispensable.</comment>
