<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias is rendered with specificity—his method, his memory of field trips, his 70-year practice—and his final choice to seal and bury the shaving carries cost (renunciation of recording the prophecy). The internal texture is vivid: "the way his pulse had jumped like a startled bird." However, the protagonist's engagement is largely reactive observation until the very end; he listens, receives the prophecy, and sketches his fear, but no competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. The closure renunciation feels consistent but lacks the contradictory pressure that would push into higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the wax shaving ritual accumulates meaning through memory, voice, prophecy, and final burial. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias chooses *not* to record the prophecy but to bury it, forecloses hubris, and commits to listening—a renunciation with conceptual cost legible in "the garden would remember. And Elias? He would listen." One meaningful deepening tightens the stake when the voice names him "the hinge," reweighting his role. The piece does not require causal reversals under this lens, and the ending image ("the garden would remember") recharges prior material with cost felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is anchored early and purposefully: "a liminal space for archiving emotional patterns too fragile for ink," and the ancient pear trees constrain and charge the closure (Elias will bury the shaving "beneath the oldest tree, where the roots could decide"). Sensory details—salt-thick air, orchid petals, wind carrying blossoms and subway hum—are filtered through Elias's priorities. Spatial choreography is coherent (basin, trees, ledger, sky). The body and tool (wax shaving, basin, his temple) participate in micro-setting terms. The environment shapes the final choice (burial beneath the tree), meeting the 9+ gate for Q3, but the garden's function feels more thematic than tactically constraining across beats, holding the score in the high 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to record or renounce the prophecy—is signaled when the Akkadian voice emerges and Elias recognizes it as prophecy ("Prophecy was never intentional"). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, so escalation reads as density increase: the voice returns closer ("You are the hinge"), Elias's hands shake (70 years of steadiness broken), and he chooses to sketch his fear rather than the prophecy itself, then commits to burial. One meaningful tightening narrows options with felt cost. Agency is renunciation (he will not record it, "that would be hubris"), and the cost is legible in the repeated phrase "But the garden would remember." No reversals are required under this lens; the deepening suffices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of memory, preservation, and the tension between recording and forgetting. The garden, trees, and wax shaving are concrete vehicles; the prophecy ("the tower will weep before it speaks, but the garden will remember what the stone forgets") recurs and reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: Elias renounces hubris and commits to listening, embodying the hinge between choice and consequence. The final triad—"The city would forget…The children…would grow up…But the garden would remember. And Elias? He would listen."—lands as earned wisdom from specific experience. The piece resists summary and integrates theme through action (immersion, burial) and image (roots deciding, wind scattering petals).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is tightly held to Elias throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature: "thin as a whisper, brittle as old bone," "the way his class had pressed ears to the phonograph's horn, giggling." Distance modulates purposefully (close in the prophecy beat, wider in the memory of field trips). Diction remains within an elevated, archival register consistent with an oath scribe's idiom ("hinges held doors neither open nor shut"). Under peak stress (hands shaking, voice pressing to temple), the syntax tightens without obscuring clarity. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. One minor slip: "curious and insistent" in paragraph one leans slightly generic for this otherwise textured voice, but does not materially harm the overall control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: "thin as a whisper, brittle as old bone," "the ink smudged like a child's forgotten sigh." Rhythm varies (short climactic sentence "The water darkened" followed by longer expansions). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs are present. However, the piece carries some overwriting in non-peak beats: "the scent of blossoms and the distant hum of subway tunnels" is serviceable but slightly generic, and "the way a dying man's breath hitched on the syllable of a name" in paragraph two leans toward figurative stacking without strict necessity. The closure beat is clean. Applying the artifact guidance (density without pattern-teaching in some descriptive runs, −0.4 to −0.6 in Q7) and the non-closure cap, the score lands in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of oath scribe + wax phonograph shaving + rooftop orchard + accidental prophecy feels specific and non-obvious. The choice to sketch fear rather than record prophecy, then bury the shaving for the roots to decide, transforms familiar preservation/prophecy tropes through grounded ritual and renunciation. The field-trip memory seed and the Akkadian voice add verifiable texture. The piece takes a modest structural risk (accumulative, reflection-heavy) and executes it cleanly. However, the "liminal space" and "emotional patterns too fragile for ink" phrasing trends toward abstraction in places. The ending image ("the garden would remember. And Elias? He would listen.") is earned and resonant, avoiding platitude. No close echoes of famous material are evident.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias (oath scribe) is introduced immediately and his role frames the entire piece. He performs the ritual (immersion, listening, sketching, burial decision), and his choice to *not* record the prophecy but to sketch his fear and bury the shaving drives the closure. His decisions alter tactics (renunciation over hubris) and foreclose a path. Early signal +0.6, three beats (immersion, prophecy reception, burial decision) +1.4, causal pressure (renunciation narrows options) +0.8, closure linkage (the burial and listening stance close the story) +1.2, cost (visible in shaking hands, "hubris" reflection) +0.4. Total positives ~4.4 from base 3.0 → 7.4 raw. Minor friction: much of the piece is observation/reception rather than active decision until the final third (−0.3 for late peak agency). Swappability is low (the scribe role is irreplaceable given the premise). Final: 7.4 − 0.3 late peak = 7.1, round down to 7.0. However, the burial decision is foreshadowed earlier ("Later, he would immerse…then bury"), so the late-peak penalty is mitigated slightly. Adjusting: 7.1 − 0.2 (mild late agency friction) = 6.9, round down to 6.8 per the instruction to use 0.1 increments and dominant limiter posture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wax shaving is introduced in paragraph one, handled in the immersion ritual (paragraph five: "The wax shaving unspooled soundless ripples"), pressed to Elias's temple (paragraph eight: "now translucent, veined with something like blood"), and referenced in the burial decision (paragraph nine: "immerse the shaving in beeswax to seal it, then bury it beneath the oldest tree"). Early signal +0.6, three distinct beats (discovery/description, immersion/voice, temple-pressing/burial prep) +1.4, causal pressure (the shaving enables the prophecy and forces the ethical choice) +1.0, closure linkage (burial decision shapes the ending) +1.0, irreplaceability (its phonographic origin and wax medium are unique) +0.6. Total ~5.6 from base 3.0 → 8.6 raw. Minor friction: the shaving's transformation ("translucent, veined with something like blood") is vivid but slightly ornamental in the middle beat (−0.3 for decorative moment). The shaving is causally active in immersion and burial, not merely present. Final: 8.6 − 0.3 = 8.3, round down to 8.3. No further deductions; all three gates (setup, development, closure) are met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The accidental prophecy is signaled in paragraph six ("Prophecy was never intentional; it slipped through cracks in ritual") immediately after the Akkadian voice emerges, framing the ethical stakes. It drives the middle and ending beats: Elias must decide whether recording it would be "hubris," and the prophecy's content ("You are the hinge") reweights his role and forces the burial choice. Early signal (by ~30% of text) +0.5, two beats (recognition/ethical framing, burial renunciation) +0.9, causal pressure (the accidental nature raises the stakes of recording vs. renouncing) +0.8, closure linkage (the choice not to record is the closure act) +1.0, cost (felt in his shaking hands and the explicit "hubris" reflection) +0.4. Total ~4.6 from base 3.0 → 7.6 raw. Friction: the concept is more thematic constraint than on-page tactical obstacle—Elias never attempts to record it, so the "accident" shapes stakes more than tactics (−0.6 for limited tactical variance). The prophecy itself ("the tower will weep…") does not alter his methods, only his ethical stance. Swappability is moderate (any unintended revelation could substitute with minor edits, −0.4). Final: 7.6 − 0.6 − 0.4 = 6.6, round down to 6.6. However, the prophecy's Akkadian form and hinge metaphor are specific to Elias's expertise, reducing swappability slightly. Adjusting: 6.6 − 0.2 (partial swap ease) = 6.4, round down to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute (speaks dead languages, specifically Akkadian) is introduced via the prophecy voice in paragraph six: "a language Elias hadn't heard since his apprenticeship, when he'd spent three years translating clay tablets." It enables him to understand the prophecy, a causal necessity. Early signal (concurrent with prophecy, ~35% mark) +0.4, one beat (comprehension of Akkadian voice) +0.4, causal pressure (without this skill, no prophecy content is legible) +0.7, specificity (Akkadian is named, apprenticeship detailed) +0.5. Total ~3.0 from base → 5.0 raw. Friction: the trait is told in backstory summary rather than dramatized (−0.3), and it does not constrain or cost him—it simply unlocks the prophecy passively (−0.4 for enabling without tradeoff). The trait does not appear at closure or shape the burial decision. Final: 5.0 + 2.0 − 0.3 − 0.4 = 4.3… wait, recalculating from base 3.0: +0.4 +0.4 +0.7 +0.5 = 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0; then −0.3 (summary-only backstory) −0.4 (no cost/tradeoff) = 4.3. However, the Akkadian skill is irreplaceable and specific, and the apprenticeship memory is on the page. The trait does enable a key turn (prophecy reception). Adjusting with specificity and the fact that without this exact trait the plot fails: 5.0 + 0.9 (irreplaceability bonus per guidance) = 5.9, then −0.3 (summary) = 5.6, round down to 5.6. But the guidance says "visible tradeoffs trend high," and here there is none—he simply knows it. The score should reflect functional enabling without cost or constraint. Final: 5.9 raw (base + enabling + specificity) − 0.0 (no additional penalty beyond the built-in low causality score for passive enabling) = 5.9, round down to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The action "immerse" is introduced in paragraph four ("as he immersed the shaving into a basin of rainwater tinted with crushed orchid petals") and drives the prophecy's emergence in paragraph five ("The water darkened. The wax shaving unspooled soundless ripples, then a voice"). The immersion is both the ritual method and the causal trigger for the central conflict. Early signal +0.6, two beats (immersion/voice emergence, later sealing in beeswax and burial prep) +0.9, causal pressure (the immersion is the hinge event that unlocks the prophecy and forces the ethical choice) +1.2, closure linkage (the decision to "immerse the shaving in beeswax to seal it, then bury it" echoes and completes the action at closure) +1.0, irreplaceability (the specific ritual of rainwater + orchid petals + immersion is unique to his practice) +0.7. Total ~5.4 from base 3.0 → 8.4 raw. Minor friction: the second immersion (in beeswax) is future-tense intention, not on-page action (−0.3 for partial summary). The action is irreplaceable and shapes two distinct beats. Final: 8.4 − 0.3 = 8.1, round down to 8.1. However, the beeswax immersion is a decision with cost (sealing/burial), not merely intention—it forecloses recording. The cost is visible in the ledger moment and the burial choice. Adjusting for closure participation strength: 8.1 − 0.3 (future-tense second immersion) + 0.0 (cost already credited in causal pressure) = 7.8, round down to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The field trip memory is introduced in paragraph three ("He remembered field trips then: the way his class had pressed ears to the phonograph's horn, giggling as a dead president's voice scratched through time") and recurs in the coda ("The children of St. Marrow's would grow up, their memories of that field trip fading like chalk dust"). Early signal +0.5, two beats (initial memory, coda echo) +0.9, lyric reprise that reweights the theme of forgetting vs. preservation +0.6. Total ~3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0 raw. Friction: the memory does not shape Elias's ritual method or tactics—it is thematic coloring, not causal pressure (−0.5 for ornamental use). The phrase "listening to ghosts" seeds the theme but does not constrain his choices. Swappability is moderate (any formative memory could serve a similar function, −0.3). The memory does not participate in the middle conflict or closure decision. Missing middle development gate → cap 3.4 per the gate model. However, the lyric-resonance allowance permits 5.5–6.3 for a purposeful seed-to-final reprise that reweights the stake. Here, the reprise is present but does not decisively reweight the burial choice—it adds thematic texture. Applying the cap: max 3.4 for missing middle, but lyric allowance can lift slightly if the reprise charges the ending. The coda echo does reweight the preservation theme (city/children forget, garden/Elias remember). Adjusting: 3.4 (gate cap) + 1.4 (lyric reprise bonus per allowance, capped at +1.4 for strong thematic charge) = 4.8, round down to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is introduced in paragraph two ("ancient pear trees, grafted from saplings smuggled centuries ago…stretched gnarled branches over the glass and steel abyss below") and anchors the entire piece. It is characterized as "a liminal space for archiving emotional patterns too fragile for ink," and the burial decision ("bury it beneath the oldest tree, where the roots could decide") makes the setting causally active at closure. Early signal +0.7, three beats (description/function, prophecy reception in the garden, burial beneath the tree) +1.4, causal pressure (the garden's history and the tree roots constrain and enable the burial choice) +1.0, closure linkage (the burial beneath the tree is the closure act) +1.3, irreplaceability (the ancient orchard's continuity and root system are specific to the preservation logic) +0.7. Total ~6.1 from base 3.0 → 9.1 raw. Minor friction: much of the garden description in paragraph two is atmospheric setup rather than immediate tactical constraint (−0.4 for decorative initial description). The garden does constrain the final choice (roots as arbiter). The setting is indispensable. Final: 9.1 − 0.4 = 8.7, round down to 8.7. However, the garden's function as "liminal space" is more thematic than physically constraining—Elias could perform the ritual elsewhere. The tree roots at closure elevate it. Adjusting for moderate tactical constraint (the tree is chosen, not forced): 8.7 − 1.6 (the garden enables rather than constrains tactics across most beats) = 7.1, round down to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the foghorn falls silent" is introduced in the opening sentence and recurs in the coda ("The city would forget the foghorn's silence by morning"). Early signal +0.6, two touches (opening, coda) +0.9, lyric reprise +0.4. Total ~3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9 raw. Friction: the foghorn's silence does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no clock tracks elapsed time, and Elias's actions are not time-pressured (−0.7 for lack of tactical constraint). The timeframe is more atmospheric marker than functional pressure. Swappability is high (any ambient sound cessation could serve the same function, −0.5). Missing middle development (the foghorn is not referenced between opening and coda) → gate cap 3.4. The lyric-resonance allowance permits up to ~6.0 for a seed-to-final reprise, but here the reprise does not reweight the stake—it simply closes thematic framing. Applying: 3.4 (gate cap) − 0.2 (high swappability confirmed in coda, where "foghorn's silence" is generic forgetting metaphor) = 3.2, round down to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to archive emotional patterns" is introduced in paragraph two ("His oath was to preserve them—not the words themselves, but the *shape* of what they carried: the tremor in a bride's voice…") and shapes the ledger decision in paragraph nine ("Not to record the prophecy—that would be hubris—but to sketch the *pattern* of his own fear"). Early signal +0.6, two beats (oath statement, ledger sketch) +0.9, causal pressure (the archival mission creates the ethical dilemma: recording prophecy vs. sketching fear) +0.9, closure linkage (the burial and listening stance fulfill the archival oath in a transformed way) +0.8, cost (the choice to *not* record the prophecy is a visible sacrifice of his usual method) +0.4. Total ~4.6 from base 3.0 → 7.6 raw. Friction: the motivation is stated rather than dramatized in competing choices—Elias does not waver or face a counter-desire (−0.5 for lack of friction/conflict in the want itself). The archival mission is consistent but not tested by a trade-off until the very end. The motivation is specific and irreplaceable. Final: 7.6 − 0.5 (single-track desire without internal friction) − 0.4 (told-only in paragraph two, though dramatized later) = 6.7, round down to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone "velvet disquiet" is present throughout: "salt-thick air," "thin as a whisper, brittle as old bone," "curious and insistent," "his hands, steady for seventy years, shook," "the weight of the wax between his fingers." The tone modulates from reflective (field trip memory) to tense (prophecy emergence, shaking hands) to resolute (burial decision and listening stance). The final image ("And Elias? He would listen.") sustains quiet unease without resolving it, charging the closure. Early establishment +0.7, coherent across three movements (setup, prophecy, closure) +1.4, modulation under pressure (shaking hands, cold fingers) +0.8, charges the final image (the listening stance leaves the future open and disquieting) +1.2, irreplaceability (the specific texture of velvet—soft yet heavy—matches the prose) +0.6. Total ~5.7 from base 3.0 → 8.7 raw. Minor friction: some phrasing ("curious and insistent," "unnaturally still") leans slightly generic for the otherwise textured tone (−0.3 for minor tonal flatness in opening). The tone is consistent and supports the accumulative design. Final: 8.7 − 0.3 − 1.0 (the tone is more sustained mood than dynamic modulation that alters tactics—it does not force a choice, only colors the experience) = 7.4, round down to 7.4.</comment>
