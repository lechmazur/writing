<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman's motivation is embodied through his decade of listening and the physical anchor of the parchment, and his final understanding of the needle as key demonstrates earned interiority. The girl's micro-choices—stilling her needle, speaking "Wait," pressing the object into his palm—reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost (leaving her mother). Minor slip: the merchant remains functional pressure only, without distinct interior contradiction, and the girl's silent watchfulness could be more actively contradictory earlier to fully earn the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (the coachman recognizes the needle as inherited duty and turns toward the next traveler) with visible cost (the girl dissolves upstream, the merchant's call ignored). The accumulative/textural lens holds: fog lifts twice, gutters slow then silence, pressure tightens through sensory density and the parchment's palimpsest logic. Orientation anchors (coachman, river crossing, fog) arrive within the first ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the second fog-lift triggers his decision, and the cost—generational obligation, solitary repetition—charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fog, river, bridge planks, and gutters constrain the crossing choice through the two-lift rule and the ticking countdown. The yarn needle's brass eye catches light twice, charging the handoff. The coachman's pocket (parchment) and the girl's lap (needle) function as micro-settings that hold the key objects. Spatial choreography remains clean across the crossing. The "spindrift serenity" at closure integrates atmosphere into the girl's dissolution, and the far bank / upstream direction guide the final moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—when to cross—is signaled early and tightens through two escalations: first fog-lift (heartbeats counted), second lift plus gutter-slowing, then the decision and silent gutters at mid-crossing. Agency belongs to the coachman's attentive reading and his "Now," but the girl's "Wait" and needle-gift apply secondary pressure that reweights the ending. Cost is visible: the girl forgoes her mother and prior life, the coachman accepts another decade of solitary duty. The ticking timeframe and fog-rule create persistent constraint that narrows the window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—legacy as passed burden, attention as inherited skill—emerges through the parchment's palimpsest structure, the coachman's decade of learning to listen, and the girl's recognition that the needle is "for the next one." The final image (girl dissolving, coachman turning toward hills, gutters to tick again) offers a non-literal answer: duty is cyclical, recognition is the cost, and the promise isn't kept but recognized and handed on. No overt thesis statement. The "ambient awareness" and closely attentive gaze root theme in embodied practice rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady on the coachman; psychic distance tightens during the fog-lifts and at the needle handoff. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "percolated," "palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity" all fit a measured, slightly archaic register. The girl's single line of dialogue—"Wait" and "For the next one"—carries goal and subtext without exposition. Minor slip: "his *closely attentive* gaze" and "*ambient awareness*" read as imposed prompt language rather than fully naturalized perception, creating a small register bump in two peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences layer action, atmosphere, and thematic charge. Rhythm modulates (short counts "One. … Two." against longer descriptive waves). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Deductions: "percolated upward in slow, spiraling sighs" mixes liquid/gas/breath vehicles without full coherence (−0.3). The phrase "the girl slipped free, pressing the yarn needle into the coachman's palm as she passed" compresses two actions (slip, press, pass) whose sequence and simultaneity blur slightly under high magnification (−0.2). Stock opener "Somewhere ahead, another traveler waited. Somewhere, the gutters would begin to tick again" uses template parallelism that, while thematically apt, edges toward predictable cadence (−0.2). No artifacts touch the closure beat itself, so accumulation cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The palimpsest-promise + sensory-clock (gutters ticking, fog lifting twice) combination is specific and non-obvious. The coachman-as-learned-interpreter and the girl's recognition-without-exposition avoid template mentor-passing. Risk: the lyric register and the reliance on symbolic objects (needle, parchment, fog) without overt causal mechanics. Partial friction: the "wait for the sign" plot is a familiar fairy-tale structure, and the needle-as-key metaphor, while integrated, leans on archetypal resonance. Transformation is present but not radical; the ending's inevitability feels earned in hindsight without full surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coachman is present throughout, his attention and decade of learning frame the stakes, his reading of the fog and gutters drives the crossing decision ("Now"), and his acceptance of the needle at closure articulates the inherited duty. All three gates present; causal pressure in at least two beats (the two fog-lifts, the final handoff); closure linkage strong. Cost: he turns toward another cycle, solitary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The yarn needle appears in beat one (girl worries it against her thumb, scolded habit), returns when her needle stills during the first fog-lift, its brass eye warms at mid-crossing, and is pressed into the coachman's palm as the key for the next crossing. Four touches across setup, middle, crossing, and closure. Specificity: brass eye, warmth, "for the next one." Causal role: it becomes the passed token that articulates theme. Cost: the girl's departure is tied to relinquishing it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The palimpsest promise—layered ink, erased vows, "When the fog lifts twice before the gutters fall silent, cross"—is named and its rule drives the coachman's wait and the crossing timing. Setup early (parchment in pocket), development (he reads fog against the text), payoff (parchment "burned as if lit from within" at the second lift). Lyric reprise and thematic charge present. Friction: the mechanics are told in exposition rather than dramatized through a prior failed/successful crossing, so causal pressure is moderate. Scores in the solid middle band for setup + payoff + thematic resonance without full beat-to-beat constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Closely attentive" is named twice and demonstrated: the coachman's gaze threads through haze, his pulse quickens at the fog's shiver, his hands close on reins at the precise second lift. The trait enables the correct crossing timing (middle development) and charges his recognition of the needle's meaning (closure). Setup and payoff present; causal enable in one key beat. Cost: a decade spent learning to listen, and another cycle accepted. The label feels slightly imposed (register bump noted in Q6), but the behavior is enacted.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Percolate" appears once in beat one ("the way the mist *percolated* upward in slow, spiraling sighs") as the coachman reads the fog. It signals his method of attention and sets the atmospheric logic. Setup present; it primes the fog-lift observations that drive the crossing. No further distinct beats where "percolate" recurs or alters tactics. Payoff indirect: the rising fog is the mechanic he reads, but the verb itself does not return or charge closure. Scores for setup + atmospheric coherence, but swappable with "rose" or "spiraled" without breaking the crossing logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" is named once ("the *ambient awareness* of a man who'd long since stopped trusting the obvious") in the backstory block. It describes the coachman's learned skill and frames his decade of practice. The method is demonstrated: he listens not with ears but with perception of weight, shimmer, rhythm. Setup and thematic coherence strong. Development: his reading of fog and gutters enacts it. Payoff: the final recognition of the needle as key arises from this awareness. Friction: the phrase itself is abstract/label-like (noted in Q6), and the method is more told than shown through a failed contrast or correction on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The fog-bound river crossing supplies the core constraint: visibility governs when to cross, the bridge groans under the carriage, the water's reflection is absent (adding menace), and the far bank / upstream direction guide the girl's departure. Setup immediate, development (fog-lifts tighten decision), payoff (mid-crossing silence, far-bank arrival, girl walks upstream into mist). Spatial choreography clean. The setting is indispensable: remove the fog-rule or the crossing and the story's logic collapses. Cost: crossing at the wrong moment is implied lethal (the woman's warning, the reflection's absence).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain gutters' ticking is introduced early ("*tick-tick-tick* of rain gutters overhead, their rhythm marking time like a metronome"), slows after the first fog-lift, and falls silent at mid-crossing, completing the rule. Three beats: setup, slowing (signals second condition), silence (marks crossing point and withdrawal of safety). The timeframe tightens the decision and charges the moment. Cost: crossing after silence or before two lifts would violate the rule. Specificity: the ticking is concrete and audible. Friction: the gutters' mechanism (why they stop) is unexplained, leaning on fairy-tale logic rather than causal world-building.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To distill complexity into essence" is not named on the page. Inferred desire: the coachman learns to parse fog, gutters, and parchment into a crossing rule; the girl recognizes the needle's singular meaning and strips away her prior life. The motivation is enacted through their attention and choices. Setup indirect (decade of learning, girl's watchful silence), development (reading signs, stilling needle), payoff (coachman's understanding, girl's gift and departure). Friction: the desire is thematic and abstract rather than a named, conflicted want. No on-page moment where simplification costs them a nuance or forces a trade-off between depth and clarity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Spindrift serenity" appears once in the final paragraph ("her silhouette dissolving into the spindrift serenity of the lifting mist"). Tone throughout is measured, misty, archaic-lyric; the coachman's calm contrasts the merchant's huff. The tone charges the closure image: the girl's dissolution reads as acceptance rather than loss, aligning with the quiet handoff and cyclical duty. Setup in voice and pacing, payoff in the named phrase at closure. Friction: tone does not modulate sharply under the gutters' ticking or the bridge's groan; pressure remains contemplative rather than urgent, fitting the accumulative lens but limiting tonal range.</comment>
