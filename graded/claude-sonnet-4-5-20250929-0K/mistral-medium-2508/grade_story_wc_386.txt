<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation to salvage purity from wreckage is embodied through concrete actions—carving the shrine, handling the locket, interpreting the widow's grief. Her internal contradiction (claiming she "let go" while keeping fragments) operates on the page through simultaneous holding and releasing. The widow's arc from misidentified grief to redirected hope shows clear transformation with visible cost. Minor slip: the mother's accusation feels slightly under-earned given limited prior setup of that specific relationship tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening: Lena in her ice shrine after the *SS Marrow* wreck. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) closure—Lena's pattern of salvaging fragments continues with visible cost (the mother's reproach, the waiting dead). The widow's departure and Lena's return to candlelight enact a meaningful deepening: the ritual's cost becomes undeniable. One causal gap: the mechanics of how Lena "sees" the cameo appearances remain asserted rather than demonstrated in a choice moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine as micro-setting constrains multiple choices: the carved hollow frames the ritual, the melted snow globe serves as divination tool, the ice altar holds inscribed names that guide Lena's interpretation. Sensory detail is purposeful—candle flame stretch, salt-and-diesel scent, ice groans—and filtered through Lena's practitioner perspective. The setting charges the final image: kneeling in candlelight as the glacier sighs, the dead quiet. The shrine's physicality (chisel marks, altar, hollow) alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Lena helping the widow see the true ghost—is signaled early and tightens through the globe ritual. The widow's misidentification becomes a revelation with cost: she must redirect grief from husband to son's survival. Lena's own closure moment (salvaging her mother's fragments) deepens the theme with visible constraint. The escalation reads clearly under the Accumulative lens through ritual intensification. Minor issue: the fisherman's toy backstory arrives late and could have seeded earlier to maximize earned reversal weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of salvaging purity from wreckage emerges organically through Lena's shrine work, the widow's reframed loss, and the recurring image of things rising from wrecks. The final line—"the light, no matter how borrowed, was always worth the salvaging"—reweights prior material without didacticism, offering a resonant answer to the central question through the image of borrowed starlight and quiet dead. The snow globe's shifting meaning (husband → son, melted → alive) and Lena's locket fragment embody rather than state the theme. No thematic echo in peak beats; subtext operates cleanly in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays tightly bound to Lena's perceptual signature: she notices ice groans, candle pooling, the "color of old silver" in ghost voices—details filtered through practitioner expertise. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("oilskin coat," "kelp net," "timbers straining"). The widow's italicized speech distinguishes her register from narration. One slip: "the wrong ghost" and "weaves truth carefully" edge toward tell-label phrasing in a mid-beat where showing through the globe handling would tighten. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: rhythm varies naturally, information density high ("its hull splitting like a wishbone"), figurative language purposeful ("breath fogging the air between candles, their flames stretched thin"). Opening and closing images anchor effectively. Minor loop detected: "The widow's breath hitched" followed shortly by "the widow, still trembling"—near-synonym emotional restating. One template stem run: "Lena [verb]" structure repeats four times in the closure third without lyric payoff. No filter-verb stacks or major opacity; propulsion clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The combination of wreck-diver ghost whisperer + melted snow globe divination + glacier shrine offers a fresh synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The choice to make the widow's ghost the *wrong* ghost—mistaking husband for son—transforms a familiar séance premise through specific emotional logic. Risk-taking in structure (Lena's turn with her own locket mid-scene) and tone (borrowed starlight melancholy) heightens stakes. The "cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" method adds conceptual originality. Slightly held back by the late fisherman's toy detail, which could seed earlier for maximum earned surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena (wreck-diver ghost whisperer) drives every key turn: she interprets the widow's dream, handles the snow globe to reveal the child, exposes the misidentified ghost, then performs her own locket ritual. Her choices alter tactics (redirecting the widow's grief) and the ending (choosing to carve another name, staying in candlelight as the dead quiet). Present throughout, causally active in at least three distinct beats, and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in setup (altar description), development (widow presses palms to it, Lena uses it for vision, widow's tears fall onto it), and closure (the widow carries it away, its light dims as visions retreat). It constrains the ritual method, its "ruined curve" and "distorted heart" enable the revelation, and its melted-yet-alive state charges the salvage theme. Removing it breaks the divination logic and thematic resonance. Strong irreplaceability and cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" operates as theme (cracks, light, seeing through) and appears in the closure paragraph ("windows... see through the cracks"). It shapes one key turn—the widow seeing the child through the globe's distorted glass—but remains more metaphorical than a tactical constraint. Present early in subtext (candle flames "reaching"), developed through the globe vision, and reprised at the end. Functional but slightly abstract; stronger causal pressure would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is demonstrated on the page: Lena "wove the truth carefully" when reframing the fisherman's ghost, choosing what to reveal and when. It enables the widow's transformation with visible cost (tears, breath quickening). The trait constrains one major beat and aligns with the salvage motive. Present in development, but introduced as a label mid-scene rather than signaled through prior action. Functional causal role, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Expose" drives the central turn: Lena exposes the true ghost (the child, not the husband) and exposes the widow to the realization that changes her grief. The widow's departure with lighter steps is the direct result. The action also applies to Lena's own moment (exposing her mother's face in the locket). Present in development and closure; removing it collapses the widow's arc. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" is mentioned in exposition ("the way the fisherman's silhouette always lingered at the edges of the boy's dreams") but not demonstrated on the page as a method Lena actively performs. It frames the backstory explanation but does not constrain a choice or shape a tactic in real time. Functional as premise but ornamental in execution; swappable with "reads emotional imprints" or similar. Present but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice pressures every choice: the hollow frames the ritual, the altar holds names that guide interpretation, the ice groans provide atmospheric pressure, and the setting's isolation makes Lena's work possible. It supplies the resources (candles, carved space, inscribed names) and charges the final image (kneeling in candlelight as the glacier sighs). Present throughout, indispensable to ritual logic and closure atmosphere. Removing the shrine breaks spatial coherence and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is dramatized through Lena's actions: carving the shrine from wreck debris, guiding the widow to salvage her son's survival, keeping locket fragments. It drives the widow's arc (salvaging hope from misidentified grief) and Lena's closure (salvaging "parts worth saving"). The motive is tested against cost (the mother's reproach, the waiting dead) in at least two beats. Present early in context (post-*Marrow* wreck), developed through ritual, and charged at closure. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" as tone operates consistently: melancholic beauty, things shining with reflected light (candle flames, silver ghost voices, liquid gold in glass, starlight threads). It modulates with pressure—dimming at the widow's tears, flaring at the locket vision, quieting at closure. The final image ("borrowed starlight," "the light... was always worth the salvaging") charges the ending and reweights the opening's "slow rhythm of buried time." Coherent and purposeful; strong closure linkage.</comment>
