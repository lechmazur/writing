<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interior trait as a "dusk noticer" is established through concrete perception ("exact moment day surrendered to night") and drives her recognition of the shadow phenomenon. Her decision to trade her shadow shows character-driven agency with visible cost ("her shadow thin but present"). However, the curator's motivations remain sketchy, and Liora's shift from observer to participant feels somewhat abrupt; the internal contradiction between her "half-empty" state and her ability to make such a decisive trade lacks embodied tension in the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the stone, footage, and shadow material layer toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Liora's shadow-trade crystallizes the library's purpose with felt cost. Orientation anchors (floating library, Liora, stone on desk) land within the first 120 words. The closure—Liora becoming "part of the library now—a keeper of shadows"—reconfigures her role with visible cost (thinned shadow, forfeited autonomy) and the final image ("stone glowed once, like a heartbeat, then stilled") charges prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when the unbound shadow seeks a vessel and Liora offers hers, narrowing options with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating library and its blooming books constrain Liora's choice by offering a repository that "never died," making the shadow-trade spatially and thematically coherent. The stone functions as micro-setting: handled in multiple beats (found, examined, pressed to chest, placed on sill, glows at closure), its warmth and pulsing charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful ("air hummed with the weight of unread words"), though the clouds and curator's "yellowed parchment" hands veer toward stock imagery without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the poet's hope-shadow—is signaled early and tightens when Liora realizes "some shadows, once freed, sought vessels" and she is "already half-empty." The reversal (her recognition that the curator lied to protect her) forces the trade-off: offer her own shadow or leave the hope restless. The cost is legible on-page ("her shadow thin but present") and forecloses a path (she becomes bound to the library). Escalation is smooth under the Accumulative lens, though the curator's passive role and lack of on-page resistance slightly diffuse tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—hope as enduring burden—emerges through the poet's stone, the unbound shadow, and Liora's trade rather than assertion. The final image ("stone glowed once, like a heartbeat, then stilled") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: hope finds rest through shared carriage. "Some hopes were too heavy to carry alone" risks overt statement but is grounded in prior action. The concept of shareable dreams underpins the world logic cleanly, and the closing reframe ("a woman traded her shadow to preserve the shape of hope") recasts the arc without moralizing. However, "luminous regret" as tone is more asserted than embodied in the ending's glow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Liora's perceptual signature—tracking "slow unraveling of shadows as if they were living things"—is specific and consistent. Diction ("softly deliberate," "metamorphose," "unbound") carries a deliberate lyricism that fits the library setting and concept-driven design. The curator's single line of dialogue ("You gave it shape") feels functional rather than character-distinct, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("petals of light unfolding") that risks decorative flourish over immediacy. Psychic distance holds, though the reflection on shareable dreams reads slightly expository.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high ("blooming library," "shadows bleeding at the edges," "library sighed, its shelves shifting") and mostly coherent, though "bloomed under her fingers, petals of light unfolding" stacks visual metaphors in a way that slightly blurs sense. Some paraphrase appears: "Some hopes were too heavy to carry alone" and "Some stories don't need words" function as thematic restates. The phrase "softly deliberate" recurs three times, twice in identical construction, creating minor template cadence. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the closing ("The library hummed back") lands cleanly. Information density is generally high, though a few scaffold beats ("She understood now why the curator had lied. / He'd been trying to protect her.") could compress further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The concept—shadows as detached emotions in a world of shareable dreams—offers a fresh synthesis, and the library-as-archive device grounds the metaphysics concretely. The footage comparison (1983 sharp shadow → 1995 bleeding edges → 2001 independent movement) provides verifiable, non-ornamental texture. The turn (Liora trading her shadow to bind the poet's hope) feels inevitable in hindsight and arises from established character logic. Risk-taking is evident in the lyric, concept-forward design; the piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. However, the floating library and "blooming books" lean toward familiar fantastical tropes, mitigated by the specificity of the shadow mechanics and the resonant closure image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Liora's identity as a "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" is signaled in paragraph two and enables her recognition of the shadow phenomenon via footage comparison. Her decision to trade her shadow—the story's key turn—arises from this observational skill. Present in setup, middle (footage analysis), and closure (offering shadow), with visible cost (thinned shadow, bound to library). The trait constrains her choice by making her "already half-empty," vulnerable to the shadow's need for a vessel.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in beat one (found on desk), is handled and examined (pressed to chest, "feeling its pulse"), placed on the windowsill at the trade moment, and glows in the final beat ("stone glowed once, like a heartbeat, then stilled"). Present in setup, middle, and closure; its warmth and pulse evolve as the shadow binds to it. Causally essential: the stone anchors the poet's hope and provides the physical locus for the shadow-trade. Removing it would collapse the story's mechanics and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" frames the central problem: the poet's shadow detached and seeks a vessel. The concept shapes Liora's stakes (she must bind it or risk possession) and tactics (offering her own shadow in exchange). Present in setup (footage reveals the shadow's independence), middle (Liora identifies it as hope), and closure (the combined shadow "settled—no longer restless"). The mechanics are specific and irreplaceable, driving both the middle choice (study the footage) and the ending action (the trade).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" describes the stone's "resistance—like a breath held too long" and recurs in the closing paragraph ("soft and deliberate" light). The trait characterizes the stone's presence and tonally underscores the patient, stubborn hope it embodies. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable an action with visible cost; it functions primarily as atmospheric description. Present in setup and closure reprise, but lacks middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears as a label in the footage analysis ("something inside her had begun to *metamorphose*") and is recorded in the ledger at the end. The concept underpins the shadow's transformation from bound to unbound and back to bound-with-Liora. The action is central to the story's logic (the poet's shadow metamorphosed into an independent entity), but the term itself is more diagnostic than dramatized. Present in middle and closure, shaping the problem Liora must solve, though the mechanics are implicit rather than enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The silent video footage is introduced early (archives paragraph), used in the middle beat to trace the shadow's evolution (1983 sharp, 1995 bleeding, 2001 independent), and its findings directly drive Liora's understanding and choice. The method is specific (decades-apart comparison reveals temporal change), irreplaceable (no other mechanism explains how she identifies the shadow), and shapes the story's investigative structure. Present in setup hint, middle execution, and thematically at closure (curator will record it). The footage mechanics matter causally.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "blooming library above the clouds" is anchored in the opening line and recurs throughout: books bloom when touched, shelves shift, air hums with unread words. The setting provides the spatial logic for why the shadow lingers (a place "where words never died") and why Liora can become a keeper bound to it. The library's function—repository of stories and shadows—constrains Liora's final choice by offering permanence. Present in setup, middle, and closure; the floating aspect is atmospheric but the blooming mechanism and archive function pressure the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After dreams became shareable" is mentioned once as backstory context ("years studying the phenomenon that emerged after dreams became shareable") but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The timeframe explains how shadows can detach but does not create urgency or a live clock. Introduced in the middle third, absent from closure; largely replaceable with a generic "in this world" framing. No visible cost tied to this element; it remains world-building rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is dramatized through Liora's recognition ("This one was hope. / Not the bright, brittle kind, but the quiet, stubborn sort"), the poet's last line ("I carved my longing into stone so the river wouldn't forget"), and Liora's trade decision. The motivation drives the closure choice (offering her shadow to bind the hope) with visible cost (thinned shadow, permanent binding to the library). Present in setup (stone's pulse), middle (identification of the shadow as hope), and closure (preservation achieved). The desire faces friction (risk of possession) and costs are legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" modulates through the piece: the library's glow, the stone's warmth, the light blooming from books, and the closing line's acknowledgment of loss-with-beauty ("regret—not for what was lost, but for the beauty of what remained"). Tone is coherent and charges the final image ("The light caught her, soft and deliberate, and for the first time, she didn't flinch"). Present in setup (fading sun, blooming books), sustained through middle reflection, and crystallized at closure. However, "regret" is more asserted than embodied in Liora's interior during the trade moment itself.</comment>
