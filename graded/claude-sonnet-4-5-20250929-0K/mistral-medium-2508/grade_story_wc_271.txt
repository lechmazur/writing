<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's embodied grief is vivid—the crumpled photograph, the somatic freeze technique, palms pressed into thighs—and her progression from freezing time to pruning deadwood tracks a credible internal shift. The therapist's maxim ("You don't have to let go. You have to make room.") works diagnostically but teeters on the edge of label-speak; the final act (plucking the leaf, returning to prune) rescues it by grounding the insight in concrete action. Internal contradiction appears in the want/need tension (erasing loss vs. anchoring to persistence), and the micro-choices (releasing the photograph, choosing the leaf) feel earned. Minor deduction: the "quietly talented once" attribute remains asserted rather than dramatized in a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: arboretum, Lena, grief from drone strike. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—layered sensory beats (wind, cypress, tide) and the photograph's release build toward the final pruning decision, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid: she accepts the weight as "something like roots" and commits to tending the living). The closure lands with felt cost: the empty pocket, the shift from holding grief to making room, the act of pruning as both literal and figurative. One tightening occurs when the child mistakes the photo for a bird, reweighting Lena's relationship to the image and enabling her to let it hang. The lens holds; no causality breaks. High-band entry secure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The arboretum is anchored early with layered sensory detail (salt wind, foghorn ghosts, olive leaves, tide pulse) filtered through Lena's grief-sharpened attention. The cypress tree constrains the photograph's fate and charges the final image (the leaf she plucks). Micro-setting work is strong: the bark, the low branch, the fig trees all pressure her choices and the ending. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (scent of cypress oils, the sting in her palms). The setting persists beyond her and frames the realism she can anchor to, directly supporting the thematic close. No occupational depth is needed at this length; the arboretum as sanctuary and worksite is sufficient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism while metabolizing trauma—is signaled early and tightens when Lena releases the photograph. Her agency is clear: she chooses to let the wind take it, plucks the leaf, returns to prune. The embodied pause technique imposes a visible cost (pain, breath held, the freeze itself) and the final act forecloses the path of paralysis. One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's misrecognition ("Look, a bird!") allows Lena to see the photograph differently, reweighting her relationship to the image. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the tide coming in and the tour group's fading laughter bracket the turn. No antagonist needed; internal and environmental pressures suffice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme—persistence and making room for grief without erasure—emerges through the photograph's release, the leaf's oils, the choice to prune deadwood. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "I am still here. And so are you." The cypress as anchor, the arboretum's stubborn life, and the leaf's veins mirroring cracks form a cohesive symbolic system without overt statement. The therapist's maxim risks didacticism but is redeemed by Lena's embodied enactment in the final beats. Subtext operates in the child's misrecognition and the tour group's oblivious optimism. The piece resists tidy resolution—grief remains, but a path forward is legible. The final image (pruning, leaving the rest to grow) reweights the opening freeze without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited, tight to Lena's perceptual signature: "the scent of something alive," "the quiet talent of meeting it without flinching." Diction matches her grief-sharpened attention—"fibrous with creases," "oils perfumed the air, citrus and resin"—and remains stable under pressure. The therapist's voice briefly intrudes ("embodied pause") but is filtered as recalled instruction rather than narratorial gloss. Psychic distance contracts during peak beats (the photograph release, the leaf pluck) and opens for reflective context (the arboretum's persistence). No head-hopping; the tour group's voices are external, their misrecognition observed. Rhythm modulates effectively from the long opening sentence to the clipped final beats. Minor slip: "the stubborn persistence of life" edges toward abstraction in a high-pressure paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled: "the wind off the cliffs carried salt and the ghost of foghorns," "the leaf's veins mirrored the cracks in the stone wall." Sentence variety supports rhythm; opening and closing beats breathe differently. Information density is high—most lines advance grief work, setting, or thematic charge. Two frictions: "the drone a speck in the sky no one had noticed yet" is clear but slightly expository for the photograph's caption-like moment, and the phrase "something heavier—something like roots" uses a hesitation pattern ("something... something") that feels writerly rather than Lena-voiced at a peak beat. The final paragraph's short declaratives (prune, leave, grow) land cleanly. No loops or scaffolding; clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of somatic trauma work and arboretum tending feels specific and non-obvious; the photograph caught on a branch and mistaken for a bird is a fresh inflection. The piece avoids the explain-everything ending and commits fully to its premise—metabolizing grief through embodied practice and environmental persistence. Risk: the therapist's maxim and the direct address to the cypress ("I am still here. And so are you.") hover near self-help diction, a safety middle that could lean harder into discomfort. The drone strike as inciting incident is widely used in contemporary literary fiction; transformation occurs through Lena's somatic method and the arboretum's particularity, lifting it above template. The ending's pruning metaphor is earned but familiar; the leaf-as-talisman is the more original choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout; her sister's wedding-turned-crater is the trauma anchor. Her choices—releasing the photograph, plucking the leaf, returning to prune—drive the narrative. The survivor attribute shapes her stance (freeze, embodied pause, metabolizing grief) and the final decision. Setup (backstory), development (photograph release), and payoff (pruning choice) all present. The element constrains her options (she came to freeze time, not move forward) and the ending shows her choosing to tend rather than hold. Cost: the empty pocket, the pain in her palms, the acceptance of weight as roots. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three distinct beats: introduced (crumpled in pocket), smoothed against cypress bark, and released to the wind/caught on branch. It returns with reweighted meaning when the child mistakes it for a bird, enabling Lena to leave it suspended. The photograph's physical state (fibrous with creases, image softening) tracks her emotional trajectory. Setup early, development mid-scene (release), payoff (the empty pocket beside the leaf). Causal pressure: the act of releasing it forecloses the path of clinging. Closure linkage: the empty space shapes the final choice. Specificity: the henna detail and "speck in the sky" make it irreplaceable. Cost visible in the act of letting go.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A pearl of stillness" is named once early ("The arboretum was her refuge, a pearl of stillness") and echoed thematically in the freeze/pause method. It frames the setting's function but does not constrain a choice directly—the somatic freeze does that work. The concept shapes the stakes (preserving stillness vs. metabolizing grief) but remains more atmospheric than tactical. Setup present, development arguable (the stillness she seeks vs. the movement she enacts), payoff indirect (the "embodied pause" and final pruning). Lyric resonance: the piece opens and closes with stillness-versus-motion tension. No middle causal beat where the pearl image alters a decision; swappable with "sanctuary" or "refuge" in most uses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is asserted in the opening ("She had been quietly talented once") and linked to the fig trees that no longer bear fruit, but it does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait colors her past but does not shape a present choice—her decision to prune is about grief work, not talent. Setup present (paragraph two), development absent (no middle beat where talent matters), payoff absent (pruning is an act of endurance, not skill display). The fig trees' barrenness mirrors her state but does not hinge on this attribute. Swappable with "capable" or "skilled" without altering the closure. Label-only mention; no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The freeze action—embodied pause, breath held seven beats, palms pressed into thighs—drives the narrative structure. Lena came to the arboretum to freeze time, practices the technique on the page ("Today, the freeze came easier"), and the arc turns when she releases the photograph and shifts from freezing to moving (pruning). Setup early (somatic method explained), development (freeze practiced mid-scene), payoff (the final choice to prune is a renunciation of freezing). The freeze defines the conflict (stillness vs. metabolizing grief) and the ending rejects it with visible cost (acceptance of weight, return to tending). Causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability all strong. Major turns trace to this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The somatic method—embodied pause, pressing palms into thighs until sting overrides screams—is signaled early (therapist's instruction), used twice on the page ("Today, the freeze came easier" / "She pressed her palms harder into her thighs"), and shapes the ending choice (shift from freezing to pruning). Setup (therapist's maxim), development (enacted mid-scene with visible cost: pain, breath control), payoff (the leaf pluck and pruning are somatic choices to engage rather than freeze). The method constrains her tactics (she cannot simply move on; she must anchor in the body first). Causal pressure: the technique enables the photograph release. Closure linkage: the final pruning emerges from this practice. Specificity: "sting overrides echo of screams" is irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arboretum on a seaside cliff is anchored early (wind, salt, foghorns, cypress, olive leaves, tide) and pressures every choice. The cypress catches the photograph, the cliff edge frames the stakes (persistence on the edge of loss), the fig trees await pruning. The setting supplies the leaf Lena plucks and the tide that marks time. Setup immediate, development (cypress branch alters the photograph's fate), payoff (the arboretum's persistence beyond her anchors the realism she seeks). Causal pressure: the environment constrains and enables her choices. Closure linkage: the final image (pruning, tide, arboretum humming) depends on this exact setting. Irreplaceable: a landlocked garden would not carry the cliff/edge/persistence charge. Visible cost: the exposure, the wind, the precariousness.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper had left decades ago" appears once in the opening and establishes atmospheric distance but does not tighten decisions or tactics. The timeframe suggests abandonment and the passage of time since human stewardship, echoing Lena's sense of being anchorless, but no on-page choice hinges on this detail. The tour group and the tide's rhythm provide immediate temporal anchors; the lighthouse keeper detail is scenic background. Setup present (opening), development absent (no middle beat where this timeframe matters), payoff absent (closure does not reference or charge the lighthouse past). Swappable with any marker of historical distance. Ornamental use; no causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to anchor optimism in realism is dramatized throughout: Lena's refusal to let go paired with the therapist's instruction to "make room," her rejection of the tour group's untested optimism, her choice to imagine a future where weight is "something like roots." The conflict between erasure (freeze) and persistence (prune) drives the arc. Setup early (her refuge, the freeze method), development (photograph release as a realist act—letting it hang, not erasing it), payoff (the final image: "Optimism wasn't the belief that pain wouldn't return. It was the quiet talent of meeting it without flinching"). Causal pressure: this desire shapes every choice. Closure linkage: the ending articulates and enacts it. Cost visible: the empty pocket, the acceptance of weight, the return to tending barren trees. Slight didacticism in the articulation ("Optimism wasn't...") edges toward tell, but the pruning choice grounds it.</comment>
