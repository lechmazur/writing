<comment>The knight's seven-year silence and final speech establish a clear arc, but interiority relies heavily on abstract constructions ("the shape of the thing that came after") rather than embodied contradiction. The moment of removing the gauntlet releases shadows—a symbolic gesture—but the choice feels dictated by metaphysical mechanics rather than earned by on-page micro-decisions that reveal competing impulses. The final smile "hurt like holy fire" gestures toward cost, yet the knight's internal conflict never dramatizes genuine struggle between staying silent and speaking.</comment>

<comment>The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the knight steps onto the stage, ending his withdrawal with the dark as audience, and the final image crystallizes his new stance. Cost is present but largely implied through metaphor (strings going taut, sky mending) rather than a legible forfeiture of a prior option. The causal chain from gauntlet-unsealing to voice to stage-entry holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the middle escalation is driven more by atmosphere and figurative language than by a tightening choice that narrows lived options. Orientation is clear early (knight, greenhouse, siege backstory).</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The alchemical orchard is vividly rendered with specific sensory anchors: glass panes weeping condensation, crushed silverleaf scent, plants that unfold rather than grow, and roots tracing sigils. The greenhouse functions as a temporal pressure chamber ("a moment stretched thin"), and the final clearing of the glass panes to reveal the stage constrains the knight's final choice. The body (gauntlet, breath, teeth aching from script) and the program object charge the climax, meeting the 9+ gate criterion that setting or object must shape the closure image.</comment>

<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—breaking the knight's withdrawal and speaking again—is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs when he breaks the gauntlet seal, but the escalation is more atmospheric accumulation (threads tightening, program flaring) than a protagonist-driven decision that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. The siege as "performance" reframes backstory, yet the knight's agency in the greenhouse remains reactive to mystical pressures rather than a choice between competing goods. The program's command "UNSNAP" serves as external prompt rather than internally contested calculus.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The theme of allegiance to silence versus the "shape of the thing that came after" emerges through image and action, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's abstract summary ("the allegiance had never been to the silence"). The marionette/performance metaphor recurs purposefully, and the final staging moment answers the thematic question without a stated moral. However, phrases like "the shape of possibility" and "what was and what could be" trend toward stock abstractions, and the ending risks thematic echo when it directly articulates the lesson rather than letting the stage image resonate alone.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register and metaphor-dense texture. The narrative voice is distinctive, but diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("echo of a color no human eye had named") that risks over-lyricism in a sustained run. The knight's internal voice stays consistent, yet the prose texture does not modulate under peak pressure—figurative density remains high throughout rather than tightening in crisis. No head-hopping, and the psychic distance is controlled, but the voice reads more as authorial performance than as character-filtered perception.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("sky split like rotten silk," "armor whispering," "threads of gold and rot"), but the metaphor load approaches overwriting: nearly every sentence carries a poetic vehicle, risking opacity and slowing momentum. Mixed or strained images occur ("light that wasn't light but the echo of a color," "shadows... thin, eager things") where vehicles compete. Paraphrase loops appear: "he had been there, once. Or he would be" restates without advancing pressure. Template cadence in some beats ("The knight's fingers twitched. He knew this dance.") and elevated register throughout ("murmured allegiance," "shape of possibility") risk distancing rather than propelling. Information density is high, but clarity suffers under the figurative load, especially in the closure paragraph where multiple abstractions collide.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The alchemical orchard setting and the siege-as-performance frame offer fresh angles, and the marionette theater program as artifact is a specific, non-obvious choice. The knight's seven-year silence and the final stage moment synthesize familiar withdrawal-and-return arcs with mystical mechanics in a purposeful way. However, the core emotional journey—character breaks vow of silence under supernatural pressure—follows a recognizable fantasy template, and the resolution (speaking aloud, stepping onto the stage, dark as audience) delivers symbolic closure without a sharp, non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost that would elevate ingenuity into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>The withdrawn knight is present throughout and his choices (touching the blossom, breaking the gauntlet seal, speaking, stepping onto the stage) create key turns. However, much of the action is reactive to mystical pressures (threads tightening, program commanding "UNSNAP") rather than internally contested decisions. The withdrawal trait shapes setup and ending but does not visibly constrain middle tactics with a felt trade-off. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) and drives two beats, but causal pressure and cost specificity remain moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The program appears early, is handled physically (edges frayed, warm as if just held, back bearing "UNSNAP"), and returns at closure (flares bright, dissolves into the knight's palm as a key). It shapes two beats: discovery and the unsealing moment. The object's transformation into a key with "teeth shaped like the words he'd never said" charges the ending image and links directly to the knight's speech. Present in all three gates and involved in closure, but its middle role is more symbolic than mechanically constraining a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Murmured allegiance is mentioned explicitly ("it had all been a prompt, a murmured allegiance to something that fed on half-finished vows") and framed thematically in the final paragraph ("the allegiance had never been to the silence"). It shapes the backstory context and the thematic stakes, but does not constrain or enable a distinct on-page action with visible cost. The concept is present in setup and payoff but lacks middle development as a tactical pressure. Primarily thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Factually mystical is embedded throughout: plants unfold with sigils, threads of gold and rot become visible, shadows spill from the gauntlet, and the greenhouse functions as a temporal moment. The trait enables the final transformation (gauntlet breaking, voice as sword-from-stone, wings from threads) and charges the closure. However, the mystical mechanics remain largely atmospheric; no specific trade-off or cost tied to the mystical property is dramatized on the page. Present in all three gates and involved in closure, but cost connection is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Unsnap is signaled by the program's command, enacted when the knight breaks the gauntlet seal, and directly triggers the major turn: shadows spill, greenhouse exhales, threads reweave, and the knight's voice emerges. The action is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the plot's hinge. Present in middle and closure, drives the escalation beat, and enables the final transformation with visible consequence (seal broken, shadows released, voice freed). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>Forgotten patterns appear explicitly ("the forgotten patterns in the air suddenly visible—threads of gold and rot") and implicitly throughout (plants tracing sigils, the siege as performance, the knight recognizing "this dance"). The method shapes the mystical mechanics and charges the middle escalation when threads tighten. However, the mechanics remain abstract; the reader does not learn how the knight uses the patterns to act. Present in middle and closure, but the method's tactical operation is summarized rather than demonstrated with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is anchored early with vivid, specific detail (no sun, glass weeping condensation, silverleaf scent, plants unfolding with sigils) and functions as a temporal pressure chamber ("a moment stretched thin between what was and what could be"). The setting constrains the knight's movement, supplies the mystical environment for the gauntlet-breaking, and transforms at closure (glass panes clear to reveal the stage). Present in all three gates, pressures choices, and charges the final image. The micro-setting (body, gauntlet, program) also functions as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>Timeframe "as reality shifts" is gestured at through the program's smudged date ("tonight, or never, or always") and the greenhouse as a stretched moment, but time does not function as a legible constraint that tightens decisions. The knight's actions unfold in a sequence (finding program, touching blossom, breaking gauntlet, speaking, stepping onto stage), yet elapsed duration and urgency remain vague. Present thematically but does not alter tactics. Functional but swappable; the story would work with a static or ambiguous timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>The motivation "to capture the shape of possibility" is articulated thematically ("the shape of the thing that came after," "the shape of possibility the blood") and implied in the knight's final act of stepping onto the stage to claim the performance. However, the desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices; the knight does not visibly weigh competing wants or costs tied to this specific motivation. Present in setup (backstory of refusing to applaud) and payoff (claiming the stage), but middle friction between this want and another impulse is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Tone "shivering bliss" is present in the final moments (moths singing, knight smiling "like holy fire," threads rewoven as wings, "the endless night held its breath") and modulates from the earlier atmosphere of dread and constraint (rotten silk, hungry air, aching teeth). The tone charges the closure image and supports the transformation from withdrawal to invitation. However, much of the middle maintains a single register of mystical dread without clear modulation under pressure. Coherent and purposeful at the ending, but static through the escalation beats.</comment>
