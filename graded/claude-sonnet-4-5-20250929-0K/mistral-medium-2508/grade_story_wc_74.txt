<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The painter's internal contradiction between insomnia and hope is embodied through concrete actions—painting on dying leaves, responding to the brush's memory. The calligrapher functions more as symbolic catalyst than pressure-applying character. The protagonist's choices (what to paint, when to rest) feel motivated but the stakes remain abstract; the final surrender to sleep reads earned but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Minor deduction for the "methodically hopeful" construction appearing as tell rather than fully dramatized choice-under-pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered images (moon, brush, leaf, script) toward a cadence shift when the painter finally sleeps and wakes to find transformation. Orientation anchors (rooftop greenhouse, smog city, forty-three nights) land early. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the painter's surrender to sleep with the brush worn down and air changed constitutes visible cost (exhaustion released, kindness passed forward). One meaningful deepening occurs when the child's laughter enters and the fig tree responds, reweighting the stakes from personal insomnia to collective memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse supplies concrete constraints (slats, air quality, moonlight access) and the fig tree functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—the vanished leaf and new growth directly alter the painter's understanding. Smog, jasmine scent, and rain-that-won't-fall create a sensory hierarchy filtered through the painter's priorities. The brush as tool-object returns with reweighted meaning (worn tip, midnight use). Spatial choreography is clean; the city hum and rooftop child's laughter anchor scale and proximity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving strangers remember kindness, signaled by the opening (forty-three nights awake) and the calligrapher's gift. One meaningful tightening: the child's laughter enters, prompting the painter to transcribe it into the dying script, which triggers the leaf's disappearance and the painter's first sleep. The cost is legible—exhaustion, the brush worn by "more than one hand," the leaf gone—but remains largely conceptual. Agency is clear (the painter chooses to write the laughter) but the external pressure is atmospheric rather than confrontational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the brush as kindness-token, the lost language as endangered memory, the fig tree's new leaf as proof of transmission. The final image (painter writing "dawn" where the leaf was) offers a resonant answer to whether kindness persists without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the calligrapher's absence, the child unseen, the midnight hand unknown. The glyph's double meaning ("rouse"/"forgive") and the painter's slow exhalation avoid thesis statements. No thematic echo; the piece trusts image and action to carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the painter notices moonlight "like a coin dropped into a wishing well," air tasting "of green things," brush bristles "stiff with the memory of her hand." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains controlled—elevated but consistent, no register clashes. The prose modulates with emotional intensity: compressed syntax during the painting beats, expansive when reflecting on the calligrapher. Minor slip: "the way she'd left before he could thank her properly" edges toward filter-verb stack, but the surrounding texture holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: "the greenhouse on the rooftop was the only place...where the waxing moon could slip through the haze" does scene-setting, atmosphere, and stakes in one move. One mild paraphrase loop: "wondered if any of them still dreamed" / "if any of them lay awake" restates the insomnia motif without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language ("moon like a coin," "embers in the smog") is vivid but clusters densely in the opening third; under Accumulative lens this is permissible pattern-building. No template cadence, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Final image is propulsive and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—lost language on dying leaves, insomnia as creative vigil, kindness transmitted through a borrowed brush—feels specific and earned rather than checklist assembly. The calligrapher pressed the brush into his palm "with quiet insistence" is a fresh inflection on mentor-gift tropes. The ending avoids the explain-everything trap; ambiguity (whose hand wore the brush? did the calligrapher wake?) serves theme without confusion. Proximity check clean; no close echoes of famous lines. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and sustains a singular voice throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening sentence; present across all three acts (painting, transcribing laughter, waking). The painter's key choice—to write the child's laughter into the script—triggers the leaf's vanishing and his first sleep, shaping the closure. The "forty-three nights" insomnia frames stakes. However, the character's agency is somewhat passive; external events (laughter, leaf response) drive the turn as much as decision. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: received from the calligrapher, described early. Development: used to paint on fig leaves, "hovering over a half-finished glyph," then to write the child's laughter. Closure: "the brush's tip had worn down just a little, as if it had been used by more than one hand in the night" charges the kindness-transmission theme and the painter picks it up again to write "dawn." Present in three distinct beats with evolving meaning; the worn tip is a visible cost that confirms the story's central claim. High irreplaceability—no other object could carry the calligrapher's touch forward.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "a language of curved thorns and floating dots, one that had died when the last speaker chose silence over exile." Development: the glyph meanings ("rouse"/"forgive") shape what the painter attempts; writing the child's laughter into the script is the key tactic. Closure: the new leaf "smooth and unmarked, waiting" and the painter writing "dawn" suggest renewal of the lost language. The concept constrains choices (which script to use, what to transcribe) and charges the ending. Causal pressure is moderate—more thematic resonance than hard plot constraint—but it's active across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" appears once as a label in "The painter exhaled, slow and methodically hopeful." The trait is somewhat embodied in his persistence (forty-three nights, continuing to paint) but the phrase itself does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The broader hope-despite-exhaustion mood is present throughout, yet the specific attribute functions more as narratorial description than character-driven friction. Setup present, closure participation weak, swappable with "carefully hopeful" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action "rouse" appears as one half of the ambiguous glyph meaning ("to rouse or perhaps to forgive"). The painter pauses over this glyph, then writes the child's laughter—an act that could be read as rousing the language or the tree. The fig tree "shuddered" and a new leaf unfurled, which may be the rousing. Present in setup (glyph description) and development (painting the laughter), with oblique closure tie (the tree responds). Causal role is present but indirect; the piece does not hinge solely on "rouse" versus another word. Mid-band: shapes one key turn but is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Via daydreams sparked by moonlight" is not dramatized as a method on the page. The moon is present throughout ("waxing moon," "moonlight catching the silvered tip"), and the painter's imaginings of the calligrapher and the child could be daydreams, but the text does not signal that the painting or transformation is caused by moonlight-triggered reverie. The moonlight is atmospheric and temporal rather than mechanistic. Late participation (moon watching at the end) does not show the method shaping the attempts. Functional presence, but the specific causal mechanism is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: "The greenhouse on the rooftop was the only place...where the air still tasted of green things, where the waxing moon could slip through." Development: "A draft slipped through the greenhouse slats," the fig tree's veins and leaves are the painting surface. Closure: "the greenhouse held its breath. Somewhere, a window opened." The setting provides unique resources (clean air, moonlight, living canvas) and the smog contrast underscores the stakes. The rooftop isolates the painter yet connects him to the city below (child's laughter, windows glowing). Essential to tone and metaphor; removing it would collapse the logic of why this place matters.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: "forty-three nights" and "waxing moon" establish a temporal frame. Development: the moon's state recurs ("the waxing moon could slip through," "the moon, waxing still"). Closure: "the moon, waxing still, watched him work" after he wakes. The timeframe creates urgency (insomnia count, moon approaching fullness) and the piece ends before the full moon arrives, suggesting ongoing process. The temporal pressure is atmospheric rather than a live countdown that alters tactics beat-by-beat, but it does frame the stakes and recur with reweighted meaning at the end. Moderate causal role, strong lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: "He had spent years chasing the idea that kindness, once given, could not be entirely forgotten, even by strangers." Development: the calligrapher's gift is the kindness to be remembered, the painter's transcription of the child's laughter is his attempt to pass it forward. Closure: "The kindness had been remembered. That was the point." The motivation drives the key choice (painting the laughter) and the ending directly confirms it. Visible cost: the brush worn, the leaf gone, the painter's exhaustion spent. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection. One friction: the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflict, but it constrains all major actions.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" as a phrase does not appear, but the tone—muted, warm, contemplative—coheres throughout. The prose maintains a hushed register even during the fig tree's shudder and the child's laughter. Modulation is subtle: slightly more compressed syntax during the painting beats, more expansive during reflection. The final image ("The moon, waxing still, watched him work") sustains the quiet and charges it with patience rather than triumph. Tone is consistent and purposeful, supporting the theme of slow transmission. It does not shift dramatically under pressure, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits dynamic range. Strong coherence, moderate charge at closure.</comment>
