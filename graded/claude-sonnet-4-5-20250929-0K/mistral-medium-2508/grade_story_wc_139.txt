<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and her internal contradiction—wanting fairness while inheriting her father's con-artist math—drives key choices. The girl's arrival and their collaboration feel somewhat convenient, weakening agency at the climax. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("her throat tightened," "her pulse spiked") rather than character-particular embodiment. The final renunciation has weight but the twelve-for-her realization arrives late without sufficient prior seeding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Lira abandons the ledger and ink pot, choosing collective action over her father's zero-sum math—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) with visible cost (she burns the ledger "in her mind" and flees). Drive lens reads Causal with hybrid accumulative texture; the ink pot's shattering and the minister's men approaching tighten options. Orientation is clean by ~80 words. One linkage feels thin: the girl's wet footprints and border-crossing backstory arrive without prior setup, creating a minor causality gap in how she knows Lira or why she's there at 3 a.m.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The funeral-home prep room is vividly anchored: porcelain table, formaldehyde smell, scalpels, death certificates. The ink pot's serpent etching and the liquid's autonomous swirl create tactile menace. Spatial choreography (door, table, tray of scalpels) tracks cleanly. The setting constrains choice—locked coffins, mortuary paper, the liminal space of death work—and charges the final image of "the world where debt could drown." Minor: the city-to-border escape compresses geography without friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (twelve lives vs. one ledger) is signaled early and tightens when Lira realizes the math is "twelve for her." The ink pot mechanic—names dissolving, the pot warming and shattering—creates one meaningful escalation. The girl's arrival and their collaboration feel convenient rather than protagonist-driven, weakening agency at the peak. The minister's men as off-page antagonists never materialize on the page, so the final escape lacks embodied cost or loss that would elevate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (debt, fairness, collective vs. zero-sum math) emerges organically from the ledger, ink pot ritual, and Lira's choice to flee rather than adjudicate. The serpent eating its tail and the ink that "liquefies rigid lines" support without stating. Final image—"the numbers didn't add up to her. They added up to them"—reweights prior material with minimal moralizing. Minor: "the only math that mattered" edges toward articulation, but the image of ink on her skin and the weight she carries forward earns the claim.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Voice has texture ("breath reeking of formaldehyde and bad decisions," "the night didn't either") and perceptual bias (she "counts what's missing"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the girl's lines feel slightly generic ("You count what's missing," "Next time, we count together") and lack idiolect. Register holds except for one slip: "consensus reality" scaffolding in "the pot *pulled*" anthropomorphism, which reads acceptable for magical-object agency. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is dense ("ozone and old parchment," "thick as blood, swirling"). Several artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops ("The ledger was blank. The ink pot was full" restates prior action without new pressure), stock metaphors ("her throat tightened," "her pulse spiked"), and one template-cadence run in the climax paragraph ("The room softened—the embalming fluid turned... the locks clicked... the death certificates blurred"). Clarity remains high; no causality breaks. The final image "the serpent had no end. Neither, now, did she" is evocative but edges purple without cost-grounding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Premise (con artist's child using mortuary ink to erase debt ledger) is fresh and the asylum-slot swindle adds moral urgency. The ink pot's self-aware liquid and rule-breaking shattering feel slightly convenient—late magic solving a problem it didn't help create. Emotional truth in Lira's inheritance of her father's math is specific. The funeral-home setting and the girl's coffin-crossing are vivid but not deeply transformed; the escape and map exchange feel stock. Risk-taking (liquefying debt as literal magic) is bold but doesn't fully commit to cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira (con artist's honest child) makes key choices: stealing the ledger, using the ink pot, writing names, fleeing. Her desire to decode "the inverse" of her father's cons shapes the inciting action. The twelve-for-her realization turns tactics. However, the girl's arrival shifts agency in the climax; their collaboration is functional but diminishes Lira's sole ownership of the breach. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending; causal but shared.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot appears early (setup), is used in two beats (writing names, shattering), and charges the final image (ink on Lira's skin, serpent with no end). Its autonomous liquid and rule-breaking shattering drive the climax. Specific properties (serpent etching, swirling liquid, warming pot) matter. Minor: the pot's mechanics (why it shatters, what the liquid becomes) lack grounding, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Political asylum shapes stakes (twelve refugees, Minister Veyra, asylum slots paid in advance) and Lira's moral calculus. The breach of the minister's deal is the inciting problem. The girl's border-crossing in a coffin concretizes asylum pressure. However, asylum remains largely told backstory; the refugees never appear on the page and the minister's men are off-stage. Present in setup and drives middle choice; ending references "border lights" but asylum itself is not reweighted in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" maps to the ink pot's literal effect (dissolving names, liquefying "rigid lines of debt") and Lira's shift from zero-sum to collective math. The attribute is demonstrated on the page through the ink mechanic and the ledger's transformation. However, the trait is more object-function than character constraint; Lira's thinking shifts because the pot breaks the rules, not because she actively embodies liquefaction as a method. Present in middle and ending; causal but mediated by object rather than direct character agency.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Breach" drives the climax: the pot shatters, the room "softens," locks click open, the ledger blanks. The breach transforms all prior rules and forces the escape. However, the breach is not Lira's choice—it happens to her after the names are written. The action is present in the ending and redefines options, but agency is ambiguous (did Lira cause it by overloading the pot, or did the pot choose?). Causal and irreplaceable but protagonist control is unclear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"By waiting actively" is difficult to identify on the page. Lira works fast with the girl, writing names under time pressure; this is not waiting. The ink pot's autonomous behavior (swirling, warming, shattering) could read as the pot "waiting" to act, but that's a stretch. If the method is Lira's years of decoding cons before tonight's action, that's told backstory, not a dramatized means. Late or absent; ornamental at best.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is anchored early and richly: embalming table, scalpels, formaldehyde, death certificates, coffins. The setting provides the ink pot, mortuary paper, and the liminal death-work atmosphere that charges the ritual. The room's transformation (fluid to water, locks opening, certificates blanking) is the breach's visible effect. The setting constrains (locked at night, trespassing) and supplies resources. Present in setup, middle, and ending; integral to tone and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To find the mathematics of a fair trade" is Lira's stated want ("she needed the inverse: the equation for a trade that didn't rot") and drives her use of the ink pot. The twelve-for-her realization dramatizes the impossibility of fair math under her father's rules. Friction between fairness and survival pressures the climax choice. However, the desire is somewhat told in the opening reflection; the phrase "fair trade" recurs but is not tested with visible cost until the escape. Present in setup and ending; causal but partially expository.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" coheres: the prep room (death work), the ink pot's living liquid, the girl emerging from a border-coffin, Lira's inheritance of her father's "bad decisions," and the final image of growth "in the wreckage." Tone modulates from eerie stillness (opening) to kinetic urgency (sirens, escape) while holding the death/life tension. The serpent eating its tail and ink that won't fade embody the oxymoron. The tone charges the closure image (debt drowns, but something grows). Purposeful and sustained.</comment>
