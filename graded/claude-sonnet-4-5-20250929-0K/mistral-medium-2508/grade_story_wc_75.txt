<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's choice to shatter the lens and begin carving her own initials feels earned by the lens's revelations, though her interior remains somewhat abstract during peak pressure. The displaced chorus functions more as atmospheric history than active relational crucible. Her transformation from guide to active rescuer is legible, but the beekeeper's absorption and her sudden understanding lean toward convenient epiphany rather than micro-choices under contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens inferring: Accumulative/Textural—the piece accrues pressure through layered images (hands, voices, initials) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where shattering the lens disperses its power into communal practice. The final bread-baking passage reweights the opening hum with visible cost (the lens destroyed, the beekeeper absorbed). Orientation anchors within ~120 words (grotto city, museum, Liora). One tightening occurs when Liora discovers the trapped hands, escalating her task from preservation to rescue. The cost—giving up the singular magical object to empower the collective—lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's waterfall, lichen-painted walls, and communal ovens recur with purposeful specificity and constrain Liora's final choice (she must return to the waterfall's heart to understand the absorption). The emerald lens functions as micro-setting anchor that charges the closure when shattered into dispersed stars. Spatial choreography (museum, ovens, waterfall's heart) tracks cleanly across moves. The hives reappearing on cliffs at the end adds a charged environmental reprise tied to the rescue.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue dying arts—is signaled early and tightens when Liora sees the hands slipping beneath the city's foundations. The lens revelation forces a meaningful choice: preserve the singular artifact or disperse its power. The beekeeper's absorption raises cost, though his vanishing three winters ago blunts immediacy. Pressure accumulates through the baker's clumsy letters and the child's dry loaf, culminating in Liora's shattering act that forecloses hoarding in favor of collective renewal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—rescue as release rather than retention—emerges through the lens's destruction and the dispersed glow enabling communal memory. The final line "They were too busy baking" offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. The beekeeper's name baked into bread and the honey-and-salt taste charge the ending with accumulated particulars. One slip: "letting the old ways *thaw* into new hands" in the penultimate section edges toward thesis statement rather than letting the image carry full weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Liora; no head-hopping. Diction shows purposeful compression ("thin as the last thread of a spider's abandoned web") that charges atmosphere without obscuring causality. Dialogue carries subtext ("They're forgetting how to knead the steam into it") and the baker's lament about river-curved letters versus tombstone forms. One register slip: "not while the waterfall still sang" and "whispering, *Remember, remember*" in the final passage tilt slightly meta-commentary rather than staying anchored in Liora's perceptual signature under accumulated stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final image recharges the lens motif with the baking chorus. Information density is high across most beats. However, several paraphrase loops touch key moments: "The displaced would not be lost. / Not while the waterfall still sang, not while the ovens still breathed" restates the same content across adjacent lines without added pressure (−0.2). "One by one, the grotto's people gathered, their hands finding the old shapes" then "The bread they pulled from the ovens that dawn" recycles the gathering concept (−0.3). Filter-verb stacking ("pressed," "bit into," "heard") clusters but does not reach the ≥3-line penalty threshold in a single beat. Cumulative text-pattern debt: −0.5 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto city framing and the lens-as-dispersed-memory premise offer a fresh synthesis of preservation anxiety and communal practice. The beekeeper's absorption into the grotto's bones is a non-obvious inflection that grows from prior particulars (displaced arts thinning, names dissolving). The turn—destroying the artifact to empower the collective—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the elliptical beekeeper reveal and the multi-layered lens function heighten stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Liora (museum guide) drives the inciting discovery, the peak choice to shatter the lens, and the closing act of carving initials herself. Present in setup (tracing the case), development (running to the ovens, stealing into the waterfall), and closure (shattering, carving, receiving the child's perfect loaf). Her profession as guide specifically enables access to the lens and museum context. Two major beats (discovering trapped hands, shattering lens) and closure participation. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The emerald-tinted opera lens is handled in setup (tracing the case), development (holding to light twice—revealing hands, then swelling the baker's K), and closure (shattered, shards pulsing in the wood, whispering at the end). It narrows Liora's options by showing what is slipping and enables the final dispersal tactic. Distinct beats: inheritance whisper, hand revelation, oven transformation, shattering. Closure linkage strong (shards become communal stars). High irreplaceability (its color, beekeeper origin, and thawing property matter). Cost connection: must be destroyed to save the arts.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Displaced persons (exiles from surface wars who carved the grotto) shape the stake—their arts are thinning—and tactics (Liora must recover their kneading songs from the waterfall's stone). Present in setup (opening exposition), development (hands pressing against rock, voices humming old songs), and closure (the new bread bears their initials; "The displaced would not be lost"). The concept alters Liora's understanding mid-story (the beekeeper was absorbed, not vanished) and her final choice (disperse the lens to empower them). Cost: their absorption is the price of the grotto's survival, now being reversed.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Historically oriented" constrains Liora's role (inherited post, reverence for the lens, knowledge of the beekeeper's lore) and enables her interpretive leap (understanding absorption rather than disappearance). Setup: "inherited her post from her grandmother, who'd whispered..."; development: reading the oven heat through the lens, connecting the waterfall names to the songs. Does not explicitly foreclose an option with visible cost, but her historical frame primes the closure insight. One beat with enabling function, minor cost connection (she must honor the lens's purpose by destroying it).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Thaw" anchors the premise (grandmother's whisper: lens could "thaw" forgotten things), drives the key middle beat (lens held to oven heat causes the K to swell and twist), and charges the closure metaphor ("letting the old ways *thaw* into new hands"). Present in setup, development (oven transformation), and closure (penultimate reflection). The action is irreplaceable—its thermal/melting connotation ties lens function to the ovens' steam and to the rigidity of tombstone letters becoming fluid again. Two distinct beats plus closure metaphor. Swapping for "restore" or "revive" would lose the heat/craft linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Baking bread shaped like initials is setup (elders twist dough, child's dry M.S. loaf), development (baker shaping clumsy K, Liora carving her own initials, villagers finding old shapes), and closure (golden bread with names, the beekeeper's T, the child's perfect M.S., the final "too busy baking"). The method constrains tactics (steam must be kneaded in; skill is measured by curve vs. tombstone) and delivers the closure cost (communal renewal visible in the bread). Three+ beats, high causal pressure, irreplaceable (the family custom ties memory to craft and the grotto's survival).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall supplies the museum (lens storage), the communal ovens (transformation site), the waterfall's heart (song/name repository), and the mist-shrouded cliffs (hive return at closure). Setup anchors location; development uses three distinct micro-settings (museum chamber, ovens, waterfall's heart) that Liora navigates to complete her quest. Closure: hives reappear on cliffs, bread pulled from ovens, museum case still whispering. The setting's layered access (surface to depths) and the waterfall's acoustic presence (roar, song, lullaby) constrain and enable Liora's choices. High beat involvement and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the beekeeper's last visit" (three winters ago) sets the stake and frames urgency (arts dying in his absence), but does not function as a live clock. The child's morning loaf and "that dawn" bread pull anchor present action, yet no on-page countdown tightens Liora's moves. Setup and closure participation present (hives return "that winter," new year's bread). The timeframe enables the absorption mystery but is not irreplaceable—another loss catalyst would work. Mid-range: shapes one turn (understanding he was absorbed, not vanished) without pressing tactics beat to beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Liora's desire to rescue dying arts is setup (tracing the lens, inheriting the post), dramatized in development (running to the ovens, stealing into the waterfall, carving her own initials), and fulfilled in closure (collective baking, hives return). The friction between preservation (keeping the lens intact) and rescue (shattering it to disperse its power) drives the peak choice with visible cost. Two major beats (oven intervention, shattering) and closure. The motivation is specific and conflicted, though her interior debate during the shattering moment is somewhat compressed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rosewater dread"—elegiac beauty laced with loss—coheres through "quiet industry of those who remembered," lichen glowing "like old regret," the dry loaf "thin as spider's abandoned web," and the waterfall's final shift from dirge to lullaby. Tone modulates under pressure: dread peaks when hands press against rock and arts slip away; rosewater sweetness returns with honey-tasting bread and reappearing hives. Setup, development, and closure all carry the tone. One slip: "The falls roared approval, or perhaps warning" in the penultimate beat edges slightly heavy-handed rather than letting the image hold the ambiguity. Overall strong coherence and purposeful modulation.</comment>
