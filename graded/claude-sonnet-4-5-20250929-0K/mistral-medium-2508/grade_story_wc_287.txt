<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and embodied—blood pressed into soil, hands quivering, the gauge tooth as both tool and unlocking metaphor. Her arc from isolation to tentative hope is earned through micro-choices (whispering to plants, accepting Elias's second gauge) rather than declared epiphany. Elias remains slightly under-realized; his motives and internal conflict are gestured at but not fully dramatized. The relationship deepens credibly, but Elias's scarred knuckles and night-watchman role function more as symbolic shorthand than individuated pressure.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors promptly: fire escape, harbor, moonlight, Lena alone with her pots. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Charged Poise closure—the two gauge teeth in the dirt and Lena's hum crystallize a shift from locked isolation to an open door without requiring a causal reversal. The cost is felt: she lets herself believe, a stance foreclosed before. One minor waiver: "the lockmaster vanished" is told rather than shown, a small causality gap that doesn't harm the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>The fire escape, harbor rhythm, and moonlight function as lived-in constraint and resource—Lena chose this perch "not for the view, but for the way the moonlight slanted here." The gauge tooth, tin pots, and basil are handled tactically, not catalogued. Spatial choreography (Elias climbing the ladder, his sleeve brushing thorns, soil from his coat pocket) stays coherent. The setting charges the final image: scattered moonlight on thorns, the harbor's pulse, seedling breaking soil. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) all constrain and charge closure, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—Lena's isolation versus the invitation to hope—is signaled early and tightens when Elias offers the second gauge tooth and she "let[s] herself believe." The tightening is achieved through accumulative pressure: wilting basil, nicked thumb, Elias's presence, the two keys "to a lock neither of them needed anymore." One felt cost: belief forecloses her prior refusal. Escalation reads cleanly under the Accumulative lens with a meaningful deepening, though the stakes remain intimate rather than urgent, which fits the design.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—locked versus open, light into dark corners—emerges from the gauge teeth, rosebush thorns scattering light, and the harbor's hush as invitation. The final image (open door, seedling reaching, two keys no longer needed) offers a resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Lena's arc is inextricable from the thematic question. One small friction: "the weight of a bloom reflecting light into dark corners" verges on over-articulation, though it stays within Lena's voice and doesn't flatten the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited stays tight to Lena; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: "moonlight silvering the water like a blade left too long in the rain," "fractured stars," the harbor's "quivering hush." Elias's dialogue ("Plants like water") and brief action carry subtext without explanation. Diction is consistent—lyric, compressed, but legible—and the psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during Lena's blood offering, pulling back slightly for Elias's arrival). One micro slip: "quivering hush" as both external and internal sensation is elegant but risks slight opacity on first pass.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, no paraphrase loops. Figurative language is dense but controlled: "copper-edged," "blade left too long in the rain," "oars in water." Two small artifacts: "instilling tiny furrows" (the verb "instill" is slightly elevated for the action) and "wistfully pragmatic offering" (the pairing, while voice-consistent, hovers near precious). The final third is clean, propulsion strong. Minor density friction in the opening paragraph where three images compete (petal, basil, harbor) before the reader has orientation, but the effect serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The fire-escape gardener premise and gauge-tooth-as-key synthesis feel specific and earned. The emotional truth—hope after isolation, the weight of vulnerability—avoids cliché through sensory particulars. One friction: the lockmaster's vanishing and Elias's night-watchman role are convenient rather than fully inhabited; swapping Elias for another helper would require minimal structural change. The final image (two gauge teeth, seedling, open door) is resonant but not wholly surprising. Solid transformation of familiar material without breakthrough originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Lena drives every key turn: scoring the earth, pressing blood into soil, taking the can from Elias, curling her fingers around the second gauge tooth, humming to the seedling. Her choices narrow options (she lets herself believe) and shape the closure image. Present early, active in three beats, essential to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The gauge tooth is handled in multiple beats: Lena turns it in her fingers, uses it to score furrows, nicks her thumb. Elias's second gauge tooth reweights the first as "keys to a lock neither of them needed anymore," directly charging the closure. Specific mechanics (jagged edge, measuring "the space between what was locked and what was free") matter. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Quivering hush" appears as the harbor's rhythm and the tremor in Lena's hands, braiding external and internal pressure. It shapes Lena's choice of perch and recurs in the moment with Elias when "the quivering hush between them became something like hope." Present in setup and closure, alters one tactic (choosing the perch), but the concept could be replaced with "fragile stillness" or similar without breaking logic. Functional with lyric resonance, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Wistfully pragmatic governs two actions: Lena presses blood into soil ("a wistfully pragmatic offering") and takes the tin can to plant a seed. The trait constrains her response to loss—she feeds the earth what she has—and bridges isolation with action. Visible in setup and closure beats, drives one key choice. Strong integration, though the label itself is slightly precious.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Instill" appears twice: Lena uses the gauge to "instill tiny furrows" for marigold seeds, and later the narration reflects on her ability to "instill" unlikely growth. The action frames her method and recurs at closure when she plants the final seed. It shapes tactics (scoring with the gauge) and charges the theme. The verb is slightly elevated but irreplaceable; swapping it would flatten the diction and thematic link.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"The rhythm of oars in water" describes the harbor's lapping and returns when "the harbor's rhythm swelled around them, a pulse, a promise." It colors atmosphere and modulates tone but does not mechanically shape an attempt or constrain a choice. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance, yet easily swappable with another rhythmic image. Mid-band for resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight pressures Lena's choices: she chose the perch for how the moonlight slants, the gauge tooth catches light, the rosebush thorns scatter moonlight in fractured stars at closure. The setting supplies both resource (light to coax growth) and constraint (the chill, the height). Integral to the final image and tactics, strongly causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The timeframe opens with the last petal drifting, signaling an ending and a threshold. The story unfolds in one continuous night scene after that marker. The petal's fall sets the emotional clock (transition from loss to new growth) and the rosebush's bare thorns return at closure to scatter light. Time doesn't tighten tactics mechanically but frames the arc's beginning and end with cost. Solid integration across setup and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Lena's desire to reflect light into dark corners is stated once and then dramatized: she grows non-edible plants, presses blood into soil, whispers "Grow toward the light," and finally hums as the seedling reaches. The motivation drives her refusal to abandon the fire escape and her choice to accept Elias's second gauge. Friction between want (connection) and fear (vulnerability) plays out in micro-choices. Strong causal role, present in setup and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Protected vulnerability coheres from the opening (Lena alone on the fire escape, guarded yet tending fragile things) through Elias's arrival (his presence "rough but not unkind") to the closure where she "let[s] herself believe." Tone modulates with pressure—quivering hush, fractured stars, the harbor breathing—and charges the final image of the open door. The tone is specific, consistent, and elevates the ending without becoming static.</comment>
