<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority is vivid and her motivation is clear—she decodes the scientist's cipher through embodied action. However, her dance-as-solution feels under-dramatized; the piece asserts "her body the only machine capable of solving what logic alone could not" without showing why logic failed or what cost the dancing exacts. The scientist remains abstract, a collection of journals rather than a presence that tests her resolve. Internal contradiction is present (stealing vs. liberating) but not pressed hard enough to compel a harder choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (water, dice, dance, encryption metaphors) toward a final reconfiguration where Lira transforms the scientist's encrypted fear into embodied code. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Conceptual Repricing): she lets the lab drown, carrying the pattern forward in her body with visible cost—the journals dissolve, the scientist's name is forgotten. Orientation anchors early (sunken lab, Lira alone, journal decoding). One meaningful deepening occurs when the dice trigger the failsafe and she must dance to unlock it, narrowing her path to embodied performance. Cost is felt but slightly diffuse: "the knowledge that even drowning could be an act of creation" gestures at transformation without a sharp on-page forfeiture that alters her next move.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken lab is vivid and purposeful: water pressure, corroded metal, emergency lights, and rising water all constrain Lira's actions and charge the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("greenish glow," "cold floor's rhythm," "breath fogging the glass"). The dice as micro-setting object recurs with reweighted meaning (rolled, then sunk). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The lab's sealing mechanisms and flooding lower chambers create physical stakes that drive the final ascent, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrains choice and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlock the scientist's final cipher and decide what to do with his secrets—is signaled early and tightens when the dice trigger the failsafe. One meaningful escalation: Lira must dance to "LIBERATE," then chooses to flood the lab, dissolving the journals and sinking the dice. Agency is clear (she presses the console, dances, kicks upward), and the cost is visible (the scientist's name forgotten, the lab a tomb). However, the choice to liberate feels predetermined by theme rather than tested by a live obstacle; no credible counter-pressure forces her to weigh keeping the secrets. The escalation is a deepening more than a tightening, which fits the Accumulative lens but slightly softens the felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: vulnerability as cipher, strength in setting free rather than locking away, drowning as creation. The final image—Lira tracing dice patterns in ink, "some codes weren't meant to be broken—only carried"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture (dance as code, flooding as liberation) and the scientist's encrypted fear. One slip: "the knowledge that even drowning could be an act of creation" edges toward thematic statement when the surrounding images already carry that weight. The ending avoids neat resolution and invites reflection, meeting the 9+ gate of reweighting prior material through the final action and its quiet aftermath.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Lira's perceptual signature: she filters the world through cryptographic metaphor ("each step was a variable, each turn a function") and embodied sensation. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in lyric passages ("Time here didn't pass; it accumulated"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates with pressure—closer during the dance, wider during the surface ascent. One minor register drift: "the vulnerable and unbreakable parts of herself" feels slightly elevated for peak pressure, though it remains within the established lyric mode. Rhythmic control is strong, and the final shift to quieter reflection ("She let it be") lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("ocean's currents swirled like a spider spinning its web" works; "vulnerability was a cipher waiting to be cracked, its solution not in hiding, but in transformation" verges on abstract theme-speak). Paraphrase loop detected: "The scientist had been trying to encrypt his fear, to turn it into something unbreakable. But Lira understood now—strength wasn't in the locking away. It was in the act of setting free" restates the same idea across three sentences without added pressure, triggering −0.2. Template cadence in the final section: "She had come… she had decoded… that, she thought, was…" runs a parallel structure across multiple beats without taught pattern, triggering −0.4. Minor filter-verb stack in "she would smile and say… she would trace… she had come… she had decoded" (−0.3). Total artifact penalty: −0.9 in Q7. The closure image itself remains clean, so high-band entry is not foreclosed, but accumulated line debt prevents 9+ and caps at 8.7 per high-band rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of cipher-breaking, embodied dance, and underwater setting is specific and feels earned. The transformation of "encryption as hiding" into "encryption as embodied carry-forward" offers a fresh angle on secrecy and vulnerability. The dice mechanism and dance-as-password are non-obvious and grounded in the scientist's established method. One friction: the "calm defiance" and liberation arc feel slightly template-adjacent to empowerment narratives without a sharper moral calculus or lived cost that personalizes the choice. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows through with boldness, but the emotional truth—Lira's internal conflict about theft vs. liberation—could be more contradictory and less resolved to elevate originality further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira (lyrical code breaker) is present throughout and her choices create the key turn: she rolls the dice, dances to unlock the console, and presses the failsafe to flood the lab. Her decoding work is active in multiple beats (tracing journal entries, interpreting the dice sequence, dancing the cipher). Causal pressure: her embodied interpretation is the only method that works, and her final choice to liberate rather than preserve drives the ending. Closure linkage: her decision and the dance are central to the final image. However, the "lyrical" aspect is more asserted than dramatized—her internal voice is lyric, but the text does not show her composing verse or using poetic language as a decoding tool distinct from her movement. The code-breaking is intermediated by dance rather than foregrounded as a separate skill with its own friction. Strong integration overall, but the "lyrical" modifier is underutilized, capping slightly below highest band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hangman's dice appear early (workbench in paragraph 2), are handled and rolled in a key beat (paragraph 11: serpent, lock, dawn, knife, echo, thread trigger the failsafe), and return with reweighted meaning in the ending (they sink, but Lira traces their patterns in ink on her skin). Three-gate presence: setup, development (the roll precipitates the dance and unlocking), and payoff (they are reweighted as carried code rather than physical artifact). Causal pressure: the dice roll narrows Lira's options to embodied performance. Specificity: the six-sided, cipher-etched design and the particular sequence matter. Cost connection: she lets them sink, accepting their physical loss while internalizing their pattern. One friction: the dice are more plot key than lived object—Lira does not struggle with their mechanism or misinterpret them; they function smoothly, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Calm defiance is signaled early ("defiance so calm it bordered on reverence") and shapes her final stance: she does not flee or destroy in anger, but liberates with deliberate poise. The concept pressures her tactics—she dances rather than forces, accepts drowning as creation rather than fighting the flood. It appears in the closure image ("the defiance—the quiet, unyielding kind—would persist"). However, the concept is more tonal backdrop than stake-altering force; "calm" modifies her execution but does not create a distinct cost or friction (e.g., a moment where calm nearly fails, or where defiance demands a sacrifice calm alone cannot sustain). Two-gate presence (setup and payoff) with weaker middle development, landing mid-band. The concept is legible but does not constrain a choice with visible tradeoff, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dance as explanation/cipher-solving is introduced early (paragraph 5: "began to dance, arms weaving patterns that mirrored the journal's encrypted stanzas") and is causally essential in the middle beat (paragraphs 14–15: "The journals had warned… It wanted a dance"). The dance enables the unlocking when logic alone fails. Visible cost: she must perform physically, embodying the cipher under time pressure (rising water). Closure linkage: she dances "one last time" as the water rises, and later reflects that she "decoded it into her own" body. Three-gate presence and causal pressure qualify for mid-7s, but one friction: the dance itself is asserted more than dramatized with micro-choices or visible struggle—she closes her eyes, moves, and the console responds. The attribute is essential but its mechanics and cost are slightly abstract, capping just above 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Liberate is the climactic action: Lira presses the console, the sealing mechanisms open, water floods the lower chambers, and she chooses to let the lab drown (paragraphs 16–17). This action is irreversible and drives the ending—journals dissolve, the scientist's name is forgotten, and Lira surfaces carrying the code in her body rather than preserving the physical archive. Three-gate presence: the concept is seeded early (the scientist's notes, the failsafe), developed in the middle (the console flashes "LIBERATE"), and executed at closure. Causal pressure: this choice forecloses preservation and commits her to embodied carry-forward. Specificity: the exact action (flooding) and its consequences (dissolution, forgetting, internalization) are irreplaceable. Cost is visible and undeniable. Fully essential to plot and closure, qualifying for high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Coded journal entries are present early (paragraph 3: "years decoding the journal entries… drowned his secrets in layers of poetry and numbers") and motivate Lira's presence and method. They appear again in the middle (paragraph 13: "The journals had warned of this moment") and at closure (paragraph 17: "The journals would dissolve"). Three-gate presence. Causal pressure: the journals teach her the dance cipher and prime the failsafe mechanism; without them, she would not know to dance or what the dice mean. However, the entries themselves are intermediary—Lira has already decoded them off-page; the on-page action is the dance and dice, not active journal consultation. The method shapes her preparation but does not constrain a live on-page choice with friction (e.g., misreading an entry, choosing between conflicting instructions). Strong setup and payoff, weaker development, landing mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is introduced immediately (paragraph 1: "water pressed against the glass… sunken laboratory") and pressures every beat: water limits time, corroded metal signals decay, emergency lights flicker, and rising water forces Lira's ascent. The setting supplies the central constraint (water pressure, the glass seal, the failsafe mechanism in the walls) and alters tactics (she must dance before the flood, then kick upward to escape). Closure linkage: the lab becomes a tomb, the water claims it, and the flood is Lira's chosen act of liberation. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The lab is not merely backdrop but active antagonist and tool, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging the final image. Fully essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "as a spider spins its web" appears as a simile (paragraph 9: "the ocean's currents swirled like a spider spinning its web, patient and inevitable") but does not function as a ticking clock or time-pressure mechanic. Time is treated as accumulative ("Time here didn't pass; it accumulated") rather than urgent, which fits the Accumulative lens but undercuts the spider-web metaphor's implied patience-to-strike dynamic. The rising water creates real-time pressure in the final beats, but that is driven by flooding, not by the spider metaphor. The timeframe is ornamental: it describes atmosphere but does not constrain Lira's choices or tactics with a legible deadline. One-gate presence (setup only, as tone/image), no middle or closure development. Swappable with "slow and inevitable" or similar phrasing. Functional but non-essential, mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to encrypt vulnerability as strength is signaled early (paragraph 7: "The scientist had written that vulnerability was a cipher waiting to be cracked, its solution not in hiding, but in transformation. Lira had come to believe him") and drives the ending choice: she internalizes the code, lets the physical secrets dissolve, and accepts vulnerability-as-strength in her body (paragraph 29: "she had decoded it into her own"). Causal pressure: this belief motivates her decision to flood the lab rather than preserve it. Closure linkage: the final reflection ("the only kind of strength worth having") directly echoes the motivation. However, the motivation is more philosophical inheritance than conflicted desire—Lira does not struggle between competing wants (e.g., fame for the discovery vs. honoring the scientist's wish); she arrives aligned with the scientist's view and executes it. Friction between want and cost is present but mild, as the choice feels thematically predetermined. Strong integration with slight reduction for lack of internal conflict, landing low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mysterious familiarity is evoked through recurring images (greenish glow, corroded metal, the scientist's journals, the dice) and the sense that Lira has long studied this place and its occupant. Tone is coherent and modulates: eerie stillness in the opening, rising tension during the dance, quiet release in the surface ascent and cabin reflection. The final image ("let the rhythm of the waves rewrite her, line by line") carries mysterious-familiar charge—she is changed yet continuous. However, "familiarity" as a tonal quality is underplayed; the lab feels alien and uncanny more than known, and Lira's relationship to it is scholarly distance rather than intimate recognition. The tone supports closure but does not sharply constrain choice or reweight meaning in a way distinct from general atmospheric coherence. Two-gate presence (setup and payoff) with weaker middle pressure, landing low-6s.</comment>
