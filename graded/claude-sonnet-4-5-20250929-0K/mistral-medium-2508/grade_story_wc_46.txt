<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Liora's interiority is consistently texture-driven and embodied through her hands and sensory focus, avoiding label-speak. Her decision to teach the girl emerges from established pattern (keeper, polisher, patience), though the arrival feels convenient rather than earned by prior pressure. The grandmother's backstory anchors present stance effectively. Elias functions as memory rather than on-page pressure, reducing interpersonal crucible work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through layered imagery (mist, sea glass, memories) and the girl's arrival provides a cadence shift that reweights the keeper role. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (knowledge transfer, Charged Poise as the girl grasps the weight), though the cost is implied rather than viscerally felt on the page. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The child's coincidental arrival at the exact teaching moment weakens causal linkage; the piece teaches its lyric pattern early but the final transfer lacks a visible price that alters Liora's stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The grotto's serpentine walls, quartz veins, and mist create a distinct micro-setting that charges the atmosphere and recurs purposefully. The sea glass functions as both object and setting element, constraining Liora's ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; the grotto "leans in" and "exhales" integrate environment with pressure. The setting does not force a hard choice, but the final image (grotto wrapping them in peace) elevates closure resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: passing the knowledge of stillness-light to the next generation, signaled early through "keeper" and grandmother memory. The girl's arrival provides one tightening (a live student appears), but pressure remains static rather than escalating—Liora faces no cost, refusal, or internal conflict when accepting the role. The coincidental timing (child arrives exactly when Liora is ready) undercuts agency. The "weight of understanding" in the girl's grip gestures toward cost but does not dramatize it with a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the fire/stillness opposition and the generational transfer of "light that lingers." The sea glass and pearl motifs accumulate meaning through specific handling (polishing, warming, pressing into palms) rather than assertion. The final image—"light learned to stay"—reweights the opening serpent/mist without stating a moral. The villagers' "miracle" vs. Liora's "Tuesday" provides understated tonal closure. Minor slip: "reflectively vibrant" twice and "pearl of stillness" feel slightly over-articulated as concept labels.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature (texture-focused, patient, tactile). Liora's focalization remains stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("I want to learn... how to *keep* it" advances plot). The prose modulates appropriately under emotional pressure (Elias memory tightens syntax, girl's arrival opens rhythm). Slight register drift: "serpentine peace" and "reflectively vibrant" read elevated against the otherwise grounded diction. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift across beats. Information density is high in sensory passages (grotto exhales, sea glass glows, quartz winks). Two minor loops: "reflectively vibrant" appears twice identically, and "light" recurs without fresh inflection in the final third (light that lingered, light is a language, light learned to stay). Metaphor coherence is strong except "coils of stone slick with breath of tide" strains the serpent vehicle. The "as if laughing" sea glass in the penultimate paragraph anthropomorphizes awkwardly. Overall propulsion is steady but the final paragraphs slow with stacked abstractions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The fire/stillness opposition is a familiar spiritual premise, but the story grounds it through specific rituals (thumb-polishing, sea glass warming) and the grandmother's "pearl of stillness" concept. The grotto setting and keeper lineage add texture. The girl's coincidental arrival at the teaching moment is a stock mentor-passing trope without transformation. The "Tuesday" final beat offers a fresh tonal inflection. Risk is moderate; the lyric mode fits but does not challenge convention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Liora is present throughout and her decision to teach the girl is the closure beat. She is signaled early as "keeper" and her polishing ritual fills the middle section. However, her choices do not create turns—she passively waits in the grotto and the girl arrives unbidden. The teaching moment is acceptance rather than active pursuit under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in the opening (finding it), middle (polishing with thumb), and ending (pressed into girl's palm, pulsing warm). Its warming and glowing state change across beats, and the final transfer charges the closure. It is handled concretely and its texture matters. Not fully indispensable—another polished object could serve—but tightly woven.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is introduced via grandmother backstory, explained as "the space that holds light," and echoed thematically in the girl finding "its next keeper." It frames the stakes but does not constrain a choice on the page—Liora already embodies it before the story opens. Functional concept anchor but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" describes the sea glass twice (opening and final paragraph) but remains ornamental. It does not enable or constrain action; the glass could glow any color without altering Liora's polishing or the girl's understanding. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weigh" appears in the opening beat ("She weighed it in her palm, feeling its quiet pulse") and sets up the tactile ritual. The girl's "weight of understanding" in the final third reprises the verb with reweighted meaning (conceptual burden vs. physical heft). Present in setup and closure, but the middle polishing does not depend on weighing—testing texture or warmth could substitute. Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Gem polishing" is signaled early (hands calloused from years of it, "pressure could coax brilliance from the unremarkable"), demonstrated in the middle beat (polishing sea glass with slow thumb friction), and referenced in the teaching moment ("learn stillness first"). It shapes Liora's method and the girl's lesson. However, any meditative craft (weaving, carving) could fulfill the same role with minor rewrites. Functional but not structurally unique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto is anchored in the opening line, its "serpentine walls" and "veins of quartz" recur, mist brackets the action, and the final image ("serpentine peace") charges closure. The setting encloses the teaching ritual and its dampness, darkness, and winking quartz create the "not fire" pressure that defines Liora's practice. Removing the grotto would require rebuilding the light/dark, inside/outside logic. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" governs the structure: the grandmother memory, Elias memory, and "Tonight, the memories rose with the mist" frame the middle section. The timeframe is "nights" and culminates at "dawn." However, the memories do not tighten decisions—they texture Liora's stance but she makes the same choice (teaching) regardless. Lyric reprise in setup and closure but no causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To share light without using fire" is dramatized through Liora's polishing ritual, her explanation to Elias ("You don't need flame to see"), and the girl's request ("Not how to make fire. How to *keep* it"). It drives the central opposition and the teaching decision. However, Liora never faces a friction between this want and a competing cost—she simply enacts it. Desire is shown but not conflicted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" (gentle, luminous, ephemeral) is sustained through mist imagery, soft light (glow, wink), and the quiet teaching moment. Tone modulates subtly—tightens during Elias memory, opens in the girl's arrival—and the final "serpentine peace" and laughing sea glass maintain the established register. Coherent and purposeful, though static mood across most beats keeps it mid-band. The "Tuesday" beat provides a slight tonal lift at closure.</comment>
