<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias is characterized through contradictory impulses—he pursues proof yet fears inheritance—and the final choice to hurl the prism is earned by his realization about what his mother left inside. Embodied emotion is strong ("pulse hammering," "knees hit the damp earth") with minimal therapy-speak. Internal conflict operates simultaneously in the climactic beat where understanding and dread coexist. Minor deduction for the phrase "attentive mystic" which reads as a label rather than being shown through action across more beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with clear because/therefore linkage: Elias communes → perceives absorbed emotion → prism warms and answers → frost reshapes into his mother's face → he realizes the prism contains her legacy → he shatters it. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost (empty pockets, hands still) that forecloses the inheritance path. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening when the prism begins answering, escalating from passive absorption to active haunting, narrows his options and forces the final act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and frost patterns constrain Elias's method of communion and charge the final image when the arbor "chimes in the wind" after the prism shatters. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"crystalline branches refracting the dawn," "cold bite through his gloves"—filtered through mystic perception. Spatial choreography is clean (arbor edge → car window → inside → heart of arbor). The prism itself functions as micro-setting, a recurring object that enables the communion and forces the climactic choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: proving objects absorb emotions, which braids with avoiding his mother's fate. One meaningful tightening when the prism begins answering (not just absorbing) forces the trade-off between proof and safety. The climax—hurling the prism—is driven by Elias's agency with visible cost: he walks away with empty pockets, proof unproven. The frost moving and reshaping into his mother's face provides a clear reversal that narrows his options from observer to inheritor, compelling the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: objects don't lie but offer "truthful lies," memory stripped of context, and inheritance as burden. The prism's shift from passive vessel to active respondent reweights the premise without stated moral. Final image—"some proofs were better left unproven"—resonates as a non-literal answer earned by the communion's cost. "Shifted hush" operates as subtext throughout (the arbor's stillness, the soundless shatter, the vibrating air) without mechanical recurrence. Minor deduction for the final-paragraph aphorism which borders on thematic summary, though it remains tied to scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices silence in degrees, weight of breaths, emotional residue in objects. Voice remains character-specific under pressure with strong rhythm control ("There—anger, sharp and metallic"). The prism's focalization tightens appropriately as stakes rise. Minor deduction for slight register drift in phrases like "commune was to listen with more than ears" where diction elevates beyond the mystic's established lexicon during a peak beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong opening and closing lines; information density is high with sentences doing double work (e.g., the prism description conveys both object and maternal legacy). Rhythm varies naturally with scene pressure, accelerating in the vision sequence. Two minor issues: "firmly grounded sorrow" uses a prompt-required phrase that reads slightly ornamental, and "the awful clarity of understanding" + "terrible knowing" form a near-synonym pair across adjacent sections. No loops or scaffold in peak beats. Figurative language is controlled and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mystic-who-communes-through-frost premise is specific and the turn—objects give emotions back—feels earned in hindsight rather than arbitrary. The mother's face in frost and the prism's warmth provide fresh sensory angles on haunting. Risk-taking in the lyric compression and the soundless shatter heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction for the "attentive mystic" archetype which, while personalized through his methods, still leans on familiar territory without full transformation through lived detail beyond the communion itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias drives two key turns: choosing to commune (inciting the vision) and hurling the prism (closure). His attentiveness is shown through measuring silence, tracing the prism, reading frost—observation that leads directly to decision. The final choice alters his entire path, emptying his pockets and ending his proof-quest with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The prism appears in setup (first sixth), middle (warms and hums against his thigh), and closure (glows on dashboard, he hurls it, it shatters). Its properties evolve from passive container to active respondent, driving the realization that objects give emotions back. The shatter is causally necessary—without it, no release or renunciation occurs. It constrains his final choice and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Shifted hush" is seeded early ("the air here held still") and returns in the ending ("some hushes were meant to stay shifted"). The concept shapes stakes obliquely—Elias seeks the vibration just beyond hearing—but its mechanics remain more thematic echo than tactical constraint. It reweights meaning at closure (the arbor's final silence) but does not directly narrow options in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" modifies sorrow in the middle beat, distinguishing it from sharp anger. It's present and purposeful but does not constrain a distinct on-page action or enable a tactic with cost. The phrase enriches texture without altering Elias's choices—swappable with "settled" or "deep-rooted" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Communing drives the inciting vision, the prism's response, and the realization that fuels the climax. The method is specific (hand on glass, exhaling, mind unspooling into patterns) and cannot be swapped without breaking the mystic's logic. It enables two major beats (the vision, the mother's face in frost) and the final understanding. Essential to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Frost patterns are signaled early (car windows "etched with intricate frost patterns") and used twice: Elias reads them to perceive absorbed emotions, then the frost moves to form his mother's face. The mechanics matter—wind writes the script, he reads it—and the method constrains his communion to this moment and place. The melting frost at closure (clean, sorrowless streams) provides reprise with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The quartz arbor frames the entire action, providing the "skeleton of light" that charges the opening and the final chime. It supplies the spatial pressure (car at arbor's edge, mist swallowing edges) and the heart where Elias hurls the prism, enabling the shatter and its vibration. The arbor's stillness—air "held still"—establishes the liminal space necessary for communion. Setting shapes tactics and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" is signaled as "the liminal stretch between frost and thaw" and the hour frames the entire scene. Time tightens the urgency (dawn light, mist thickening) and the phrase reprises in the prism's soundless shatter. It does not impose a live countdown but does crystallize the moment's instability, supporting one key decision. Functional early–final reprise with thematic resonance but no tactical clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elias's desire to prove objects absorb emotions is stated early and tested on the page through communion. The motivation creates friction when proof arrives but brings inheritance he cannot bear, forcing the final renunciation. The want (proof) conflicts with the cost (becoming his mother) in the climactic beat. The line "spent years chasing proof...only to realize too late" dramatizes the collision between desire and consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" is articulated mid-story ("objects don't lie, but they don't tell the truth either") and modulates through the piece: the prism's "shifted hush" of screams, memories "distilled into sensation, stripped of context," the frost's deceptive face. Tone coheres as paradox under pressure and charges the final image (some proofs better left unproven). The phrase itself reads slightly expository when stated directly, but its effect permeates the closure.</comment>
