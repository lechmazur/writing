<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elspeth's interiority is concrete and contradictory—her "combative tenderness" manifests in micro-choices like pressing the mirror shard into Kael's palm. The apprentice's trembling hands and doubt are embodied rather than labeled. The arc from fear to annotation-work is earned through prior demonstration, and Elspeth's final withholding ("the cost of coming back") adds consistent complexity. Minor slip: Kael's mother is mentioned but never pressures the scene directly, reading as setup without payoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is Charged Poise—Kael's annotations glow as a map, the shadow is bound, and Elspeth's unspoken knowledge ("the cost of coming back") crystallizes the stakes without resolving them. The cost is felt in her deliberate silence and the library's hum of possibility. One meaningful deepening (tea-leaf reading → binding the shadow) narrows options under pressure. Lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library's "geometry of the room" constrains the shadow and shapes Elspeth's decades of annotation work. The teacup, mirror shard, and desk are handled across beats and charge the final binding. The playground swing's hush filters through Elspeth's POV as a held breath, mirroring the trapped shadow. Spatial choreography (stool pulled with heel, sleeve brushing shadow) tracks cleanly. The setting pressures every key choice and the final image of the library "settling into quiet" completes the accumulative arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: teach Kael to bind doors/shadows and survive the return. The teacup misreading tightens into live annotation under the shadow's lunge, forcing Kael's first binding with visible cost (smudged fingers, the hiss of resistance). Agency is clear: Elspeth's withholding and Kael's tracing both foreclose paths. The shadow's testing and the final binding create one credible escalation. No false reversals; the pressure coheres under the accumulative lens and the price (unspoken cost of return) charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: reversible exile, the geometry of thresholds, and "love that didn't flinch from teeth." The teacup → annotations → bound shadow sequence answers the question of how to return without stating a moral. The mirror shard as both tool and symbol recurs with earned weight. "Doors work both ways" and the final library sigh offer a resonant, non-literal closure that reweights the mentor/apprentice arc. No late-breaking moralizing; the ambiguity of "the cost" lingers purposefully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Elspeth's perceptual signature is distinct: "counting the ribs of a sleeping beast," "the kind of quiet that makes people lean in." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext ("lies are where the interesting truths hide") and advances plot without exposition. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "the combative tenderness of it was the point" edges toward meta-commentary but recovers quickly. Diction remains within POV's lexicon (archivist's technical idiom). Rhythm modulates with pressure (short beats during the shadow's lunge).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Minor loop: "The library groaned... shelves shuddering" and "The library sighed, settling" are near-synonyms that restate the library's animate quality without added pressure (−0.3). One stock phrase: "holding its tongue" (−0.2). Figurative language is controlled except "tired light" in the opening, which blurs agency. No filter-verb stacks. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of mirror-archivist + tea-leaf geometry + reversible exile is specific and non-obvious. "Annotation" as binding-language and walking backwards as a reflex feel fresh. The "combative tenderness" frame coheres with the mentor dynamic. Risk-taking (shadow as door, library as living geometry) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the playground swing as timeframe feels ornamental rather than integral (−0.4). The transformation of tropes (magical mentor, apprentice trial) is solid but not exceptional. No close echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elspeth is present throughout; her choice to withhold the "cost of coming back" and her decision to hand Kael the mirror shard drive two key beats. She engineers the shadow-binding test and her refusal to explain (final beat) forecloses easy mastery. Setup, development, and closure participation are all clear. Her archival work shapes the geometry that binds the shadow. Cost: her silence at the end is a pedagogical choice with relational weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The shadow appears in paragraph four (setup), lunges during Kael's annotation (middle beat), and is bound back into the glass by the end (closure). It shifts from "pulsing like a held breath" to "coil like a spring" to being "swallowed back"—three distinct states. The shadow is the door Elspeth teaches Kael to bind, making it causally indispensable. Cost: Kael's annotations must counter its edge. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reversible exile" is introduced mid-story as the library's founding principle and shapes Elspeth's teaching ("I'll teach you how to return"). It reframes the dominant stake (mentoring return-capacity, not just escape). The concept enables Kael's annotations (mapping reversible paths) at closure. Setup is late (~30%); middle development is present (the "door works both ways" moment); closure participation is clear (annotations as map). Specific cost: the unspoken price of return. Lyric reprise from principle to final map.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mentioned in paragraph three as a habit "born from the first time she'd seen her own reflection fracture" but never demonstrated on the page. No scene shows Elspeth walking backward; the trait remains label-only. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action. Ornamental use without pressure. Setup only; no development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Annotate" is seeded in paragraph six ("thirty years annotating the margins"), explicitly commanded in paragraph thirteen ("Now. Annotate this."), and enacted by Kael in paragraph fourteen (tracing shapes that bind the shadow). The final beat hinges on Kael's annotations glowing as "a map of reversible paths." The action redefines the conflict from passive reading to active binding. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong. Removing "annotate" would collapse the ending. Indispensable causal role with visible cost (Kael's smudged fingers, the shadow's hiss).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is introduced in paragraph two (Kael staring at leaves), explained in paragraph six (Elspeth's notes "in the precise tilt of a teacup"), tested in paragraph eight ("What if I read the pattern and it's just… tea?"), and applied in paragraph nine (Elspeth swirls the leaves into a spiral). The method shapes Kael's doubt and Elspeth's teaching. It bridges to the annotation-binding (paragraph fourteen: "dipped his finger into the dregs and began to trace"). Setup, development, and payoff are present. Cost: Kael's trembling and the risk of misreading. Could be more causally tight if the tea-geometry directly triggered the shadow's lunge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The library is present from the title and opening line. Its "geometry of the room" (paragraph twelve) is the constraint that traps the shadow—Elspeth spent "decades perfecting" these angles. The library's single unbroken pane houses the shadow and the library itself "groaned" and "sighed" in response to the binding. The setting supplies the tool (geometry) and the stakes (reversible exile). Setup, development, and closure participation are clear. Spatial choreography is clean. Removing the library's geometric function would break the ending. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The playground swing's "hush" is mentioned in paragraph ten ("the world holding its tongue") and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("By the time the playground swing outside fell still"). It marks atmospheric time rather than tightening decisions. No character checks the swing to gauge urgency; the timeframe remains ambient. Setup and closure participation are present, but the element does not constrain tactics. Lyric reprise without pressure. Replaceable with another ambient marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elspeth's desire to "teach you how to return" (paragraph eleven) frames her refusal to teach escape. The motivation is dramatized in her choice to press the mirror shard into Kael's palm and her final withholding ("the cost of coming back"). "Combative tenderness" and "love that didn't flinch from teeth" (paragraph fifteen) embody the "quiet" resilience-building. Setup, development, and closure participation are clear. Friction: Elspeth's pedagogical withholding creates relational cost. Could score higher if the motivation's internal conflict were more visible (e.g., doubt about her method).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is named in paragraph fifteen but demonstrated throughout: Elspeth's quiet voice that "makes people lean in," her willingness to let Kael tremble, and the mirror shard pressed into his palm "sharp enough to draw blood." The tone coheres through the shadow's lunge (combat) and Elspeth's smile (tenderness). It modulates with pressure (soft teaching → live binding → unspoken cost) and charges the final library sigh. The phrase "combative tenderness of it was the point" edges toward meta-commentary (−0.3) but the execution is strong. Tone shapes the closure image.</comment>
