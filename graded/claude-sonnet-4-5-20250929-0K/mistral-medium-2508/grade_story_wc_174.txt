<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivations and choices are present but abstract. His decision to "let the puppets stumble" and show the seams arrives with minimal prior dramatization of the ethical dilemma—the miner's rage is told in past summary rather than witnessed. Interior contradiction exists (precision vs. deliberate looseness) but remains conceptual rather than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The final stance crystallizes but without a visible, felt cost that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: reflection and image accumulate toward a stance shift. Orientation anchors arrive (dome, campfire, past puppet show) by the first third. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Elias decides to return and "let the strings loose"—reweighting his approach with conceptual cost (abandoning precision for transparency). However, the cost remains implied rather than undeniable; no specific path is foreclosed on the page, and the miner confrontation is summarized, not dramatized, weakening causal linkage to the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dome's acoustics and history (a machine built to listen, now deaf) are specific and purposeful, charging the thematic texture. The salt flats and campfire ground the setting with vivid, selective detail. The charred stick functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning in the final beat (pocketed, "glowing like a secret"). Spatial choreography is clear; the setting constrains perception and subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exploring ethical storytelling through puppet shows—is signaled but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs: the miner's accusation prompts Elias's decision to expose the seams. However, the confrontation is summarized ("Tonight's performance had gone wrong"), not dramatized, so the reversal lacks on-page immediacy. The cost of the new approach is conceptual and forward-facing rather than felt in the present. Agency is present (renunciation of precision) but the price is not legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as puppet string, half-lit epiphanies, the space between teller and told—emerges organically from image and choice without overt statement. The stick, dome acoustics, and puppet metaphor accumulate meaning without checklist recurrence. The final image ("some tales weren't meant to be told, only carried") resonates as a non-literal answer. However, the miner's "You think this is a game?" feels like a Thematic Echo that articulates the premise too directly, and "half-lit epiphanies" is named in narration rather than fully earned through dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and poetic, with controlled diction and rhythm ("meteor hush," "puppet's string"). However, register drifts into elevated lyric phrasing pervasively ("the kind of quiet that follows a shouting match—when words still hum in the bones"), sometimes at odds with a calligrapher's practiced, embodied POV. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is stable, but the heightened figuration in nearly every sentence flattens differentiation between reflective and urgent beats. Free indirect style is clean; focalization remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled, but overwriting is pervasive: figurative density appears in most sentences ("ribs rusted into a permanent sigh," "words still hum in the bones," "unspooled lies like silk," "bright has burned itself out"), creating a lyric drumbeat that dulls propulsion in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but several metaphors strain coherence ("campfire's light flickers just beyond the circle" while seated "by a dying campfire"). Template cadence is avoided; information density is high. No scaffolding or syntax monotony, but the uniform elevation in register reduces clarity at pivotal moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of decommissioned Cold War relic, calligrapher, subversive puppet shows, and ethical storytelling is specific and non-obvious. The stick's lightning-struck grain and the dome's repurposed silence offer fresh particulars. However, the core frame—artist questioning ethical storytelling after a confrontation—is a familiar template, and the miner's challenge is summarized rather than transformed through lived detail. The final turn (showing the seams) feels earned in hindsight but the lack of dramatized cost limits ingenuity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is introduced early, present across all beats, and his choice to "let the puppets stumble" drives the ending. However, his role is primarily reflective; the key confrontation with the miner is past-summary, so his agency is conceptual rather than on-page under pressure. Swappable with "urbane painter" or similar; the calligraphy trait is ornamental (mentioned but not constraining). Two beats (campfire reflection, decision to return) involve him, and closure links to his stance shift, but without dramatized cost tied to his specific choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The stick appears in at least three beats: introduction (lightning-struck grain, stories half-told), tracing its scars mid-reflection, reversing it into embers, pocketing it at the end ("charred tip still glowing"). It is handled physically and returns with reweighted meaning (from his grandfather's whisper to his own carried secret). Setup is early, development shapes the campfire beat, and it charges the final image. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; its role is lyric-symbolic rather than causal. Swappable with any inherited totem without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is named in narration ("half-lit epiphanies weren't about clarity, but about the shape of the dark") and echoed in the final lines ("even half-lit, some things were bright enough to see by"). It frames the thematic question but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; Elias's decision to expose the seams is more about transparency than partial illumination. The concept is present as theme but not as a constraint that changes options or costs. Setup occurs late (midpoint); no middle choice is driven by it; closure references it but does not depend on it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is labeled twice ("Elias wasn't serene by nature, but his hands were" and "serene in the knowledge..."). The trait is told rather than shown constraining a choice. No on-page cost or trade-off emerges from this quality; his hands move with stillness, but this does not enable or limit a key action. The attribute is ornamental, not causal. Late appearance (mid-story for the label), no middle development where serenity alters tactics, and the final beat references it but does not depend on it.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reverse" appears physically (Elias reverses the stick into embers) and conceptually (he reverses his approach: from precision to showing seams). The physical act is present in one beat, the conceptual reversal drives his decision to return. Setup is mid-story, development occurs in the reflection beat, and it shapes the ending choice. However, the mechanics are abstract; "reverse" as a verb could be replaced with "invert," "shift," or "change" without breaking the story. The element is functional but not indispensable; the turn would remain with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Subversive puppet shows at The Static Hound are mentioned in setup ("three nights there, staging subversive puppet shows"), referenced in past-summary (the miner's lunge), and return in the final paragraph ("the puppets waited"). The method frames the premise and the ending choice (to let puppets stumble), touching setup and closure. However, the mechanics are never dramatized on the page; the shows are past-summary, so the method does not shape on-page attempts or constrain present tactics. Swappable with "subversive street theater" or similar without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The radar dome is introduced early, grounding the setting with specific detail (ribs, acoustics, Cold War history, curved walls that bend firelight). It appears across beats: campfire inside, the dome's shadow at exit, its creak and settling. The acoustics ("sound curled inward like a secret") and history (machine built to listen, now deaf) charge thematic texture and the final image. However, the dome does not constrain a choice or provide a resource that alters outcome; Elias could reach the same decision in any isolated space. Setup, development (ambient presence), and closure participation (shadow, settling) are present, but causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the hush left behind by a heated argument" is signaled in the opening ("the kind of quiet that follows a shouting match") and sustained through "the hush left behind," "after the argument," and the final "hush hold him." The temporal frame anchors the story and modulates tone (reflective aftermath). However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics; no live clock or urgency alters moves. The hush is atmospheric, not causal. Setup is early, the frame persists through middle beats, and closure echoes it ("the sound of listening"), but the timeframe is passive rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to explore ethical storytelling is stated early ("test a theory: that truth wasn't a blade but a puppet's string") and returns in reflection ("ethical storytelling wasn't about truth at all") and the decision to expose seams. It frames the dominant stake and drives the ending choice. However, the desire is told in abstract terms rather than dramatized in conflicted on-page choices. The miner's challenge is past-summary, so the friction between wants (precision, control) and costs (audience rage) is recounted, not felt. Setup is early, the motivation persists, and it shapes the ending, but without visible cost on the page, the exploration remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is named once late in the story but the tone—quiet aftermath, lingering charge, something bright burned out—pervades from the opening ("the kind of quiet that follows a shouting match") through the embers, the dome's settling, and the final "hush hold him." Tone is coherent across beats and modulates subtly with reflection and decision. The hushed, charged atmosphere supports the concept (half-lit epiphanies, the space after an argument) and charges the final image. However, the label "meteor hush" arrives too late to teach the pattern, and the tone is more consistent than dynamic—it does not escalate under pressure or shift at closure, remaining a single sustained mood.</comment>
