<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eldrin remains a static conduit for lyric meditation rather than a character with contradictory impulses acting under pressure. His "mild obsession" with silence is asserted but never tested—no choice forces him to weigh competing values or foreclose a path with visible cost. The woman defender and the world itself supply atmosphere but impose no relational crucible or status friction. Interiority remains abstract label-speak ("the way silence could be a wound or a cradle") rather than embodied micro-choices that alter present options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: silences are collected, the booklet's gold leaf flakes away, Eldrin dissolves into the map he sought to draw. The lens holds through to the final dispersal, and a Resonant Reconfiguration (Eldrin becoming "another layer of quiet") lands on the page. Cost is conceptual—the oracle's erasure into the night—but the Orientation Test falters: who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the opening third without deliberate pattern-teaching, and the narrative never dramatizes a causal tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending reweights premise but lacks felt pressure because no live choice was at stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ridge fort, storm aftershocks, flaking gold leaf, and pebble shore supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Eldrin's professional bias as an oracle. The booklet constrains his ritual (he traces, exhales, lets it slip), and the fort's stone holds the ghost of the defender's vigil, charging the final image when the gold leaf glints "in the memory of light." Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The micro-setting—booklet, stone, star—shapes the closure image and meets the Q3 9+ gate, lifting the score solidly into the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to draw a map of an endless night"—is signaled early but remains abstract and contemplative rather than tested by opposition or choice. No reversal narrows options; Eldrin's actions (tracing pages, exhaling, releasing the booklet) are iterative meditations, not escalations driven by agency. The closure is an image of dissolution, not a decision with visible cost that forecloses a live path. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here it disperses rather than tightens, and no antagonist or constraint forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the nature of silence as record, erasure, and map—emerges organically from booklet, gold leaf, and fort without overt statement. The final image (Eldrin dissolving, the pebble shifting unheard, "the night remembered") reweights the opening pursuit with conceptual cost. Yet the thematic answer remains oblique and static; no protagonist arc tests or complicates the premise, and the piece leans toward atmosphere over dramatic friction. The work invites reflection but stops short of a resonant, non-literal answer forged from on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with a consistent lyric register: "breath curling into the frigid air," "the ambered hush." Perceptual signature is oracle-specific (recording silences, tracing gold leaf), and diction remains elevated but controlled. However, at peak moments the prose slips into diagnostic abstraction ("the way silence could be a wound or a cradle") and the voice does not modulate under pressure—every beat carries the same contemplative cadence. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is stable but lacks urgency-driven compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is vivid ("flaking gold leaf," "salt and gales"), but overwriting and paraphrase loops pervade. "The ambered hush—a quiet so thick it hummed, like the aftertaste of a struck bell" offers three successive restatements of the same idea. Runs of parallel constructions ("the silence of her sword leaving its sheath... the silence of her watching... the silence of her knees") create template cadence without taught pattern. Figurative language ("splinter of ice," "gilded snow," "ghost of a tide") accumulates densely in high-image beats, blurring propulsion. Minimal scaffold but synonym churn and phrase recycling dull momentum: −0.8 for loops and density, −0.3 for register drift into abstract metaphor at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—an oracle who collects silences to map the night—offers a fresh lyric angle, and the fort setting, gold-leaf booklet, and final dispersal cohere into a singular vision. Yet the emotional arc and structure echo familiar meditative-dissolution templates without transforming them through specific lived stakes or non-obvious moral calculus. The defender's vigil and Eldrin's dissolution feel inevitable but not earned by on-page friction. Specificity in image (flaking gold, pebble shore) lifts the work above generic abstraction, but the lack of protagonist agency or risky structural choice keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Eldrin is present throughout and his actions (crouching, tracing, exhaling, retelling, releasing) frame the narrative. Setup by paragraph one, development in the middle (he traces pages, presses palm to stone), and payoff at closure (he dissolves into "another layer of quiet"). However, none of these actions constitute choices that narrow options or create turns—he observes, meditates, and releases without conflict or cost. The character is a lens, not an agent driving causality. Functional but replaceable with any contemplative figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The booklet appears in the opening ("fingers tracing the flaking gold leaf"), is handled across multiple beats (turning pages, gold leaf flaking onto his lap, smudging into his skin, tracing the last page, letting it slip), and returns at closure when "the booklet's gold leaf, caught in the ridges of the stone, glinted once in the memory of light." The object's physical decay (flaking, wearing away) parallels Eldrin's dissolution and charges the ending image. Essential across beats and ending, with irreplaceable specificity (gold leaf as both record and erasure).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" is named once in the opening third ("the storm had scrubbed the world raw, leaving only the ambered hush") and reprised near the end ("the hush, amber and unbroken"). It supplies atmosphere and tone but does not constrain tactics or alter options—Eldrin's meditation proceeds identically whether the quiet is amber, silver, or grey. Present and consistent but ornamental; a purposeful early-final reprise qualifies for low-functional range under lyric allowance, but the concept does not shape stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" is asserted in the opening third ("He was mildly obsessed with these absences") and supplies motivation label, but no on-page action demonstrates obsession constraining or enabling a choice with cost. Eldrin collects silences and releases the booklet in a smooth arc; obsession neither drives a mistake nor forces a trade-off. Label-only mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Retell" appears in setup ("began to retell the silence of the ridge's last defender"), recurs in development ("He began to retell the silence of the star above"), and the act of retelling frames the middle passage. The action is signaled and repeated, but the retellings do not create turns or alter options—they are parallel iterations of the same contemplative gesture. One major beat (the defender's vigil) depends on this action, qualifying for mid-band under the gate model, but easily swappable with "record" or "inscribe" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is method; the text demonstrates this through lists of silences summarized ("the silence of her sword leaving its sheath... the silence of her watching... the silence of her knees"). Present in setup and development, but the mechanics do not constrain attempts or create friction—summarizing proceeds without cost or obstacle. Functional but generic; "cataloging" or "transcribing" would serve identically. No closure participation beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ridge fort is anchored in the opening ("wind howled through the bones of the ridge fort," "crumbling watchtower"), supplies spatial grounding throughout (lee, walls, stone), and at closure the fort endures and holds the booklet's gold leaf. The setting provides atmosphere and a container for the oracle's ritual, and the stone absorbs the defender's vigil, but it does not pressure Eldrin's choices—he could perform the same meditation anywhere. Lyric early-final reprise (fort endures, gold leaf glints in stone) reweights the stake with undeniable image, qualifying for low-7s under the lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When only one star remains in a dimming sky" is named in the opening ("The last star clung to the sky") and at closure ("The last star blinked out"). Time is marked but does not tighten tactics or create urgency—Eldrin's ritual unfolds at contemplative pace regardless of the star's presence. The star's extinction coincides with closure but does not force the choice to release the booklet. Purposeful reprise charges the ending image but supplies no live clock altering moves; mid-functional under lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To draw a map of an endless night" is stated explicitly in the opening third ("He had come here to draw a map") and recurs at closure ("the map he had been trying to draw"). The desire frames the narrative arc and Eldrin's actions (recording silences, tracing pages) serve this goal. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—no friction between mapping and another desire, no price paid for the attempt beyond conceptual dissolution. One major causal beat (the ritual of retelling) depends on this motive, qualifying for mid-band, but lack of on-page conflict limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" does not appear as a phrase; "ambered hush" and "hush, amber and unbroken" do. Interpreting tone as the sustained quality of quiet suffusing the piece: the tone is coherent, lyric, contemplative throughout, and modulates subtly from storm aftermath to perfect dark. The hush charges the final image ("only the hush, amber and unbroken") and the recurring emphasis on silence and stillness creates a consistent atmospheric pressure. Tone is essential to the piece's effect and integral to closure, qualifying for mid-7s, but it does not shift under pressure—every beat carries the same meditative register.</comment>
