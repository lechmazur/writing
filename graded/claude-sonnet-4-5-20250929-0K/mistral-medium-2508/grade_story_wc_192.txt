<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lior's interior is textured—"tender shadow keeper," the deliberate bridge-burning—but motivation remains abstract. The choice to step through at the end feels more thematic than earned by prior contradiction; we see his isolation but not the competing impulses that would make the turn inevitable. Embodied emotion is present ("throat tightened") but the final choice lacks visible cost tied to a hierarchy of values dramatized earlier.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with situational pressure: the threshold fades, shadows encroach, and Lior's reckoning with burned bridges accumulates until the door appears. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): stepping through reweights the sanctuary's meaning and his isolation. Cost is felt conceptually—he won't look back—but the exact price (what he loses by leaving) remains slightly oblique. Orientation is swift and pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen sanctuary is vivid and purposeful: "charcoal and old incense," starlight through the cracked dome, scars in the wood. The doorknocker ring is handled twice and the sanctuary's fading edges constrain Lior's final choice. Micro-setting (the ring, the wood, the threshold) charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Lior will remain in self-imposed isolation or release the shadows—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure tightens when the shadow touches his wrist and the doorknocker offers passage. The turn (striking the ring, stepping through) narrows options with a felt cost, though the trade-off could be sharper on the page. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is present.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from image and action: isolation as suffocation, release through burning, breath learned from smoke. The final image—"smoke taught you how to breathe"—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shadow's dialogue and the sanctuary's "offering." No thematic echo or stated thesis; the ending is resonant and non-literal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression, metaphoric density, syntactic rhythm that modulates with pressure. POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization. The shadow's dialogue feels purposeful and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is present—Lior notices scars, breath, weight—and diction remains character-bound. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high. Two mild issues: "tender shadow keeper" and "teach suffocating to breathe" edge toward abstraction without full embodiment, and metaphoric density is heavy in some beats ("roots split stone," "ink in rain") without clear pattern-teaching. No loops or template cadence. Clarity holds at closure. Minor figurative muddle in mid-beats prevents higher band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The frame—sanctuary keeper who burned bridges, fading threshold, shadows returning—is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of isolation, breath, and threshold as metaphor feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk is present in the lyric compression and the abstract closure, though the emotional arc (isolation to release) is familiar. Transformation test passes: the particulars matter.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lior appears early and his choices drive the ending: he reaches for the ring, turns it, steps through. Setup and closure participation are clear. Development is present but light—his decision feels more responsive to the shadow than a mid-beat choice that narrows options. Cost is conceptual but legible. Two beats involved; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring is introduced early (first paragraph), handled in the middle ("fingers brushing the coiled bronze"), and turned twice at closure to open the door. It appears in three distinct beats and its mechanics (turning, warmth, ripple through scars) shape the final action. Specificity is high; swapping for another object would require structural change. Cost is tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fading threshold frames the entire story: introduced in paragraph seven, it constrains Lior's situation (the sanctuary is disappearing), and the final door's appearance is the closure hinge. The concept shapes stakes ("the threshold itself was fading") and tactics (he must act). Causal pressure is strong and closure linkage undeniable. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The attribute is signaled early ("burned every bridge carefully, one deliberate cut after another") and referenced again ("every bridge he'd burned"). It motivates Lior's isolation and the shadow's accusation, but the on-page cost is more conceptual than tactical—no single beat where careful burning alters a choice under pressure. Development presence is thin; closure tie is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Encroachment drives the plot: the dead encroach ("breath against your neck"), the shadow encroaches ("unspooled from the corner"), and the verb recurs to tighten pressure. It shapes two beats and the middle turn. Closure is linked (Lior must respond to encroachment by opening the door), but the action is swappable with near-synonyms (approach, intrude). Causal role is solid; specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Linking through scars appears early (paragraph two: "scars in the grain"), returns in the middle ("vibration of something linking through the scars"), and again at closure ("ripple through the scars"). The method shapes the doorknocker's function and the final action. Two beats involved; mechanics matter. Setup and payoff clear, but mid-beat choice constrained by it is light.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary is present throughout: ashen, charcoal-scented, under starlight, with a cracked dome. It pressures Lior's choices (the threshold fades, the sanctuary "exhaled") and supplies the resources (the ring, the door). Micro-setting (the wood, the rafters, the corners) alters tactics. Setup, development, and payoff all clear; causal pressure solid. Specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after cutting off all contact") is signaled early and frames Lior's isolation. It motivates the setup and the shadow's return, but elapsed time within the scene is vague—no live clock tightens decisions. The element shapes backstory more than on-page tactics. Development and closure linkage are indirect; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph twelve ("teach suffocating to breathe") and again at the end ("taught you how to breathe"). It frames Lior's role and the closure image. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page beat where teaching conflicts with another want or cost. Setup and payoff clear; development (friction between wants) is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Loaded emptiness is established early ("silence between them," "vast, so clean") and sustained through the piece ("the loaded emptiness of the sanctuary pressed in"). Tone modulates with pressure (starlight brightens, the sanctuary exhales) and charges the final image ("air tasted like rain after a long drought"). Coherent, purposeful, and integral to closure. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
