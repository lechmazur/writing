<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The inspector's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interiority leans heavily on abstract phrasing ("electric air," "resonant hush") without embodied specificity. The final transformation—she "learns how to shine"—reads as label-only epiphany without a micro-choice that earns it. The shells' confessions are compelling, but the protagonist remains a vessel for mystical forces rather than an agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: Who/where/when are anchored by ~120 words. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the inspector walks toward the horizon, carrying shells with the intent to plant them, and the final image reweights the bunker as "womb" rather than refuge. Cost is conceptual (she rejects her assignment and spreads confessions) but not viscerally felt on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the final cadence shift reweights the premise, but the because/therefore linkage between pearl-absorption and world-change is abstract rather than causally grounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystal caves pulse with bioluminescent detail, and the shells constrain the inspector's path through their trail. The pearl's placement "in a hollow of stone" and the cave's "softening" stone at the climax give the setting causal weight. Minor issue: the bunker's "emergency rations" and "rusted doors" are mentioned once without later relevance, and spatial choreography during the pearl-absorption beat is vague ("pressed it to her forehead" → "stone around her softened" without clear mechanics).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: find the latent radiance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the inspector realizes "the pearl wasn't for keeping. It was for giving" and absorbs it, altering her mission. However, the higher-ups' opposition is declared but never tests her on the page; she walks away from the radio without visible consequence. The shells' trail provides accumulative pressure, but the final choice lacks a trade-off or felt cost that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shell confessions and the image of walls dissolving between hearts. The final image—"The walls were never real"—risks moralizing but is embedded in the inspector's action of planting shells. The pearl as method rather than weapon offers a non-obvious angle. However, the closing paragraph over-explains ("learning how to shine") and the bunker-as-womb metaphor is stated rather than earned through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("resonant hush," "stitching the words into the air like embroidery") that clashes with the inspector's operational role. The shells' shifting inscriptions are inventive, but the inspector's internal voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—she observes mystical transformations without a skeptical or procedural filter one would expect from an inspector. Radio dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in the opening: "damp, electric air" and "pulsing with veins of bioluminescent crystal that throbbed like a slow, buried heartbeat" restate vitality without adding pressure. Template cadence in the shell sequence: "I wanted to be seen." "I pretended not to care." "I built this place…" accumulates without syntactic variation. Figurative density in peak beats: "the light unfolded—not outward, but in, seeping through her skin, her bones" stacks metaphors that blur the physical action. Cumulative artifact penalty: −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The shell-confession mechanic and pearl-as-method offer a fresh inflection on the mystical-artifact trope. However, the inspector's transformation into a radiance-bearer echoes chosen-one templates without sufficient character-specific grounding. The bunker-as-womb and walls-between-hearts concepts lean abstract rather than earned through lived detail. Risk-taking in the lyric mode is present but not fully integrated with the inspector's procedural role.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The inspector character is present throughout and makes the choice to absorb the pearl and reject the higher-ups' assignment. However, her decisions are reactive to mystical prompts (shells, pearl) rather than driven by internal conflict or professional calculus. She observes and follows rather than creating key turns through contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pearl appears early as the assignment's object, is discovered at the cave's heart, and is absorbed in the climax, altering the inspector's state and enabling the final action. It shapes three beats (search, discovery, absorption) and participates in closure by transforming into light that spreads into the world. Cost is tied to the pearl's disappearance and the inspector's irreversible change.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Latent radiance" is named early as the assignment's goal and returns in the pearl's "trapped light" and the inspector's spreading radiance. However, it functions more as thematic label than a concept that constrains tactics or alters options on the page. The inspector does not navigate competing definitions or test the concept's mechanics; she receives it as revelation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Acquires abandoned hopes" is gestured at through the caves "acquiring abandoned hopes" and the inspector absorbing confessions, but it remains a told trait rather than a dramatized constraint. The inspector does not wrestle with the acquisition's cost or agency; the caves perform the acquisition, and she becomes a conduit without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crown action appears late ("Not a weapon. A crown.") and is reframed when the inspector presses the pearl to her forehead in a coronation-like gesture. It redefines the pearl's purpose and enables the final spread of light. However, the crown metaphor is stated rather than enacted through ritual or choice; the inspector does not choose to wear it so much as absorb it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Confessions etched inside shells are introduced early and drive the inspector's path through the caves. She follows the shell trail across multiple beats, and the confessions' content shifts and intensifies. The final shell ("Wear it. Dissolve the walls.") directly precipitates the climax. The method shapes attempts and participates in closure, though the mechanics of etching are not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Crystal caves are introduced immediately and provide the path, the shells, and the hollow where the pearl rests. The caves' bioluminescent glow intensifies with the confessions, supplying feedback that shapes the inspector's understanding. The stone softening at the climax directly alters the environment. The caves constrain movement and charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "heartbeat of hesitation" is named once at the pearl-absorption beat ("In that heartbeat of hesitation, the cave held its breath with her."). It crystallizes a micro-moment of choice but does not tighten decisions across the narrative. Time otherwise flows without visible clock pressure; the inspector's journey and the light's spread are untimed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dissolve the walls between hearts" is stated in the final shell's instruction and echoed in the inspector's realization and action. However, the desire is received rather than generated by the inspector's own conflict. It shapes the final image (confessions scattering, walls thinning) but lacks on-page friction between the inspector's wants and the cost of enacting this dissolution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is sustained through phrases like "silence that carries farther than a shout" and "the wind carried the confessions." The tone modulates appropriately during the pearl-absorption beat (urgency, then stillness) and charges the final image of the inspector walking toward the spreading light. Minor register drift into elevated diction ("embroidery," "birth the radiance") occasionally tensions the hush with ornamentation.</comment>
