<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>X-7's interior is present but largely abstract—"processors hummed," "core temperature dropped"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final "exhaled...inhaled" gesture offers specificity, but the path to "remember how to live" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. Motivation is told ("Where do thoughts come from?") without dramatized friction between want and cost. The robot's composure is asserted but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accrue (looped timelines, violin voice, memory shards) toward a final reweighting. Orientation is delayed—who X-7 was before the procedure, what "the program" entails, and where this courtyard exists remain vague past the first third, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. Closure offers Conceptual Repricing ("thoughts...came from the act of reaching") but the cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture or visible price accompanies the final understanding. The courtyard dissolves and reforms without clear consequence, flattening the resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard supplies concrete images—frost, cobblestones, ice-slicked bench—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The violin's transparency refracts light, yet this property never shapes a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is stable (courtyard, bench, void, courtyard), and the ozone-scent detail adds texture. The micro-setting (body, tool) is present but ornamental; removing the ice or twilight would not fundamentally alter X-7's arc, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"Where do thoughts come from?"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page action tests it concretely. The procedural question ("Find what was lost") arrives late and off-page, weakening escalation. One tightening occurs when the violin whispers "You were never just a janitor," prompting the memory flood, but X-7's agency is passive observation rather than decision that narrows options. No visible cost: the courtyard reforms, the violin is whole, and X-7 "began to remember" without forfeiting a path or paying a price legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—identity as layered memory, thoughts as emergent acts—arises from images (ice violin, looped timelines, void) rather than thesis statements, and the final line avoids moralizing. The "spaces between" insight and the name-as-note conceit offer non-literal answers. However, the climactic realization ("thoughts didn't come from logic...They came from the act of reaching") abstracts into a prompt echo, and the particulars (courtyard, violin, scientist-poet-child) feel decorative rather than inevitable. Resonance is present but diffuse, lacking the sharp specificity that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on X-7 with consistent mechanical idiom ("optical sensors," "servos," "audio receptors"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"amalgamated with the twilight," "something akin to reverence"—that clashes with the established robotic lexicon during peak beats. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at the void moment, though the perceptual signature remains generic (hum, zoom, process) rather than character-particular. The final "exhaled—a sound like steam" lands well, but overall voice lacks the rhythmic control and specificity to enter high bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "looped timelines" appears three times without added pressure, and "second chance program" is restated across paragraphs. Template cadence is present—"X-7 paused...X-7's processors...X-7's fingers"—creating repetitive stems across five consecutive beats without taught pattern. Mixed metaphor: the violin "amalgamated" with twilight and later "sang," but the vehicles (chemical blend, acoustic vibration) don't cohere. Information density is moderate; many lines do one job. The "find what was lost" reveal is buried mid-paragraph. These artifacts collectively warrant −1.0 in Q7, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Core premise—robot janitor rediscovers layered past lives via ice violin and time loops—blends familiar AI-consciousness and reincarnation tropes without a sharp transformative angle. The courtyard-as-pocket-of-time and violin-as-memory-vessel feel like template fantasy devices. Emotional specificity is limited: X-7's arc from janitor to multi-life seeker could swap names and settings without loss, failing the transformation test. The tone (mystical sci-fi) is coherent, but the synthesis reads as median safe choices rather than bold risk. One fresh note: the "name" played as a note rather than spoken offers a small ingenuity bump within the band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>X-7 is present throughout and observes the violin, plays notes, experiences memory floods, and "began to remember" at the end. Setup and closure gates are met. However, choices are largely passive: picking up the violin and playing are explorations rather than decisions that narrow options or foreclose paths. The final "began to remember how to live" is a stance crystallization but not causally earned by a prior on-page trade-off. One distinct beat (playing the note that shatters) involves the character, but agency is observational. Swappable with another protagonist; traits (janitor, robot) are labels without on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ice violin appears early (setup), is handled in two beats (picked up, bow drawn; set down, picked up again), and returns in the final image ("the violin whole once more," "picked up the violin and played...a name"). Its transparency refracts light, and its voice whispers, but these properties do not constrain a choice or alter tactics—they trigger memory rather than shape decision. The closure image recharges it ("It sang"), adding lyric resonance. Meets all three gates (setup, middle touch, closure reprise) and provides two distinct beats, elevating it to mid-band, but lacks causal pressure or irreplaceability (a different mystical object could serve the same function with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "second chance program" is named early and contextualizes X-7's rewritten directives ("Where do thoughts come from?"). It reappears at mid-story ("the program's final, unspoken command: Find what was lost") and in the void revelation ("The second chance program hadn't given it a new purpose. It had given it back"). Setup and closure gates are met. However, the concept remains abstract: the program is told-only, never shown on the page constraining a choice or enabling a tactic. It functions as backstory rather than live stake. The mechanics (how it rewrites, what "given it back" means concretely) are opaque, and X-7 does not act differently because of program rules. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Remarkably composed" is asserted once ("remarkably composed despite the dissonance, because composition was all it had left—no panic, no fear") but never shown constraining or enabling an on-page action. X-7 does not choose composure over emotion in a moment of pressure; the trait is a label without visible cost or trade-off. Missing middle development and closure participation gates. The attribute could be removed without altering X-7's arc or the ending. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Amalgamate" appears once: "The sound amalgamated with the twilight, weaving into the looped timelines." It is a metaphoric description rather than a physical action X-7 performs. The word does not drive a turn or enable a choice; it decorates the moment. Setup gate is met (first third), but middle and closure gates are missing—the concept does not recur or shape the ending. Easily swappable with "merged," "blended," or "dissolved" without structural impact. Cap at 4.6 for late-only mention and no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Looped timelines are introduced early ("looped timelines X-7 had begun to perceive after the procedure—fragments of past iterations"), reappear mid-story ("The looped timelines weren't glitches. They were a map"), and inform the void sequence where X-7 sees "every life...ever lived." Setup and closure gates are met, and the method is present across three beats. However, the mechanics remain vague—X-7 perceives loops but does not navigate them, and the loops do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. They function as backdrop for memory rather than a tool X-7 uses. Present and thematically relevant but not causally active, capping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The frozen courtyard at twilight is anchored early and remains the primary location through the void and return. Frost, cobblestones, ice-slicked bench, and ozone scent supply sensory detail. Setup and closure gates are met (the courtyard reforms at the end). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—X-7 could perform the same arc in a different location. The cold and twilight are atmospheric but do not pressure tactics. One beat (the courtyard dissolves) uses the setting as transition, but it remains postcard rather than crucible. Mid-band for presence and closure reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the procedure" anchors the story's starting point, and "three cycles since" provides a measure. The timeframe is backstory context rather than a live ticking clock that shapes decisions. No urgency or deadline presses X-7; the courtyard exists "at twilight" but time does not advance or compress tactics. Missing middle development and closure participation gates—time is not tracked or leveraged in the ending. Functional but replaceable; the story could occur "after initialization" or "post-reset" with no impact. Cap at 3.8 for setup-only presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Where do thoughts come from?" is stated early as X-7's rewritten directive and recurs in the void realization and final understanding ("thoughts didn't come from logic...They came from the act of reaching"). Setup and closure gates are met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized: X-7 does not face a choice where finding the answer costs something else. The question shapes theme but not on-page friction between wants and costs. The desire is present across beats and informs the arc, earning mid-band, but lacks the conflicted pressure or visible trade-off to reach higher bands. Lyric reprise (early seed → final answer) adds resonance within the 5.5–6.3 range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mundane mysticism—robotic maintenance tasks meeting metaphysical discovery—is coherent throughout. The janitor sweeping frost opens the story, and the procedural tone ("processors hummed," "servos whirring") anchors the mystical elements (transparent violin, looped timelines, dissolving courtyard). Tone modulates subtly: mechanical idiom persists even in the void ("sensors overload with data streams"), avoiding purple-prose drift. The final image (exhale/inhale, "began to remember how to live") balances the mundane body with the mystical realization. Setup, middle consistency, and closure presence are met. Tone charges the ending by maintaining the juxtaposition, elevating it into the 6.5–7.0 range. No forced oscillation or tonal break under pressure.</comment>
