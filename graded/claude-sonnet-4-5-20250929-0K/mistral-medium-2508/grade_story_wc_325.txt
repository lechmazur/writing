<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "stand by the unremembered" is asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or embodied cost. His claustrophobia is mentioned early but never constrains a choice or complicates his descent—he simply proceeds. The internal texture leans heavily on abstract poetic assertions ("the weight of the invisible light in his bones") rather than micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing impulses. The final decision to return feels declared rather than forged through visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural (poetic layering with recurring motifs). Orientation anchors arrive by ~120 words (research facility, tide, cables). The closure operates as Charged Poise—Elias surfaces with the gold fleck and a glowing drop of water, crystallizing his role as retriever of the unremembered—but the cost remains abstract and asserted ("finally seen") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or tangible consequence. The phase-seam crossing and the junction-box discovery advance knowledge without narrowing tactics or forcing a visible sacrifice, weakening the felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The facility's rusted ladder, collapsed corridor, and silt-covered junction box provide vivid spatial grounding. The phase seam—a groove where "the air itself seemed thinner"—functions as a micro-setting constraint that Elias must cross, and the tidal timeframe pressures his exit. The cables' blue glow and the detector's hiss charge the final image. However, the "other side" corridor described as "wider" lacks choreographic consequence; Elias kneels and retrieves without spatial friction, slightly dulling the setting's role in the peak choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: retrieve evidence of the "unremembered" and escape before the tide seals the phase seam. One meaningful tightening occurs when the detector spikes and the gold fleck vibrates, signaling the junction box's importance. Yet Elias's decision to take the fleck and cross back feels preordained—no live option is visibly foreclosed, no resource spent. The "minutes before the phase seam sealed" creates urgency in principle, but on the page he "exhales" and transitions without dramatized friction or visible cost, leaving escalation more asserted than lived.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of retrieval and witnessing the forgotten emerges through the cables that "remember" and the unremembered waiting "patient as the deep." The gold fleck's shift from warm to cold, and the blue-glowing water drop, offer non-literal imagery. However, the final paragraphs veer into explicit thematic echo: "The unremembered were not gone. They were simply waiting to be found" restates the premise rather than letting particulars charge the insight. The closure image (the drop vanishing, the cables remembering) is evocative but somewhat diluted by the preceding on-the-nose declarations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean and maintains psychic distance. The perceptual signature leans heavily on lyric compression ("crashing hush," "the weight of the earth above him was a living thing") that reads as elevated rather than character-specific idiom. Diction is consistent but occasionally drifts into stock poetic phrasing ("drowning light," "the world, unaware, turned above them both") that feels authored rather than inhabited. Purposeful repetition ("The tide returned. The cables slept.") creates cadence, but the fragments sometimes prioritize rhythm over propulsion, flattening momentum in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear frequently: "The cables weren't just tracking invisible things. They were *keeping* them" closely echoes prior assertions about cables that "learned" and "remembered." Multiple sentences open with template stems ("Elias didn't…," "He'd come…," "He should have…," "He hadn't come…") creating rhythmic monotony. Stock metaphors ("cables as serpents," "silence that wasn't empty but *full*") and elevated diction ("the crushing dark," "invisible light") cluster in high-pressure beats, reducing specificity. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase/template accumulation and −0.3 for register drift, totaling −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of undersea cables, phase transitions, and a codex-guided retrieval mission offers a non-obvious premise. The image of cables that "remember" and a junction box warped as if something clawed from inside provides fresh horror-infrastructure texture. However, the emotional arc—solitary explorer overcomes fear to witness the forgotten—follows a familiar template. The gold fleck as mystical key and the "finally seen" payoff lean on genre conventions without sharp transformation, and the repeated cycling through "The tide…," "The cables…," "And Elias…" refrains feels more formulaic than earned inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias (claustrophobic spelunker) is present throughout and his choice to press through the phase seam and retrieve the fleck drives the middle and ending. However, his claustrophobia is mentioned once and never constrains a choice or alters tactics—he descends, squeezes through corridors, and kneels without friction tied to that trait. Setup and payoff are present; causal pressure is moderate (one key choice at the seam); swappability is low (his retrieval role is specific). Score: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, minus ornamental trait mention −0.5 = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gold fleck appears in the codex margin (setup), vibrates warm in Elias's pocket at the junction box (middle), goes cold after surfacing, and gleams once at the end. Three distinct beats with evolving state. However, its function as "key" is asserted rather than mechanically demonstrated—it vibrates but does not visibly unlock or transform the seam. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5, minus summary-only key role −0.6 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Undersea cables frame the mission (setup: "thick, coiled serpents… humming faintly"), constrain the middle (cables that track and remember, the junction box half-buried), and anchor the closure ("the cables singing," "the cables remembered"). They shape stakes (retrieve what cables keep) and appear in the final image. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, minus minor swappability (could be another data medium) −0.5 = ~7.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Tracks invisible things" is mentioned in exposition ("the cables had begun to track things no instrument could measure") and the detector picks up "something moving through the phase seam." However, the trait never constrains a choice or imposes cost—Elias does not navigate around invisible entities or sacrifice a resource to detect them. Setup +0.4, one beat (detector hiss) +0.4, minus label-only and no visible cost −0.7 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The action "Return" is signaled early ("the next time the water receded, he'd return"), drives the final stance ("He would return. He always did"), and appears in the ending paragraph. It crystallizes Elias's role and forecloses the option of abandoning the mission. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure (stance crystallization) +1.2, cost connection (commitment to ongoing risk) +0.5, minus minor swappability (could be "continue" or "persist") −0.4 = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Phase transitions" (the seam where walls divide kinds of space) appears in setup, enables the middle crossing ("let the transition take him"), and recurs at the ending ("The transition took him before he could doubt"). Two beats, causal role. However, its mechanics are vague—Elias presses his palm and "the transition" happens without cost or friction beyond a sensory shift. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.8, minus ornamental mechanics and no visible cost −1.1 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility anchors the entire scene (setup, middle, ending), provides the rusted ladder, collapsed corridor, silt, and junction box. It constrains Elias's descent and supplies the phase seam. However, once "on the other side," the corridors are "wider" but do not alter tactics—Elias kneels and retrieves without spatial friction. Setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.7, minus missed tactical constraint in peak beat −0.5 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The tidal timeframe is signaled in the opening ("The tide had just begun its slow retreat"), mentioned midway ("He had minutes before the phase seam sealed"), and returns at closure ("The tide returned," "the tide swallowed the shore whole"). However, the clock is asserted rather than tracked—Elias deliberates, crosses, examines, and surfaces without visible time pressure altering his moves. Setup +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, minus told-only urgency without tactical constraint −1.1 = ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to stand by the unremembered" is declared in exposition ("He'd come to stand by the unremembered") and restated at the end ("for the quiet things that waited"). It drives the descent and retrieval, but the piece tells rather than dramatizes competing wants or visible cost—Elias never weighs abandoning the mission or sacrificing a resource. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, minus told-only desire without friction −0.6 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" (silence "full of voices never spoken") appears at the phase crossing and modulates throughout—"the crushing dark," "quiet things," "the tide whispered." Tone is coherent and charges the final image ("the world, unaware, turned above them both"). However, the repeated lyric fragments ("The tide returned. The cables slept.") sometimes flatten momentum rather than intensifying pressure. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.1, coherence across turns +0.8, minus static mood in peak beats −0.4 = ~6.1.</comment>
