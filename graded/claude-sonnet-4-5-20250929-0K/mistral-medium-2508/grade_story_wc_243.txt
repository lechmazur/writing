<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear—preserving memory through ink and objects—but her interior life remains abstract across most beats. Embodied contradiction appears only briefly ("the bitterness became part of her"), and the final walk feels more stated than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths. The man in the locket exists as memory-object rather than complicating force; no secondary character applies immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through ink, violets, locket, and covenant fragments, building to a final image where the jetty "would bloom again" and "the covenant was breathing." Closure reads as Charged Poise—the archivist's ritual reconfigures her stance from steeping loss to weaving it forward, with the cost felt in her solitary labor and the covenant's incompleteness. Orientation anchors (walnut-ink archivist, jetty, twilight) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when she whispers the old words and the harbor answers, crystallizing her commitment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting: violets in cracks, salt-bleached wood, tide pulling at pilings all charge the atmosphere and mirror the archivist's work of preservation through decay. The locket, vellum, and walnut ink constrain her ritual choices on the page. Sensory detail (damp earth, salt, ink drying dark) is selective and filtered through her archival focus, and the jetty's recurring bloom at the end charges the final image with regenerative cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: regenerating the covenant through memory-work. One meaningful deepening: she moves from steeping memory passively to actively tracing the locket photo onto vellum and whispering the old words, which the harbor answers. The tightening is clear—her ritual forecloses passive grief and commits her to return—but the price (solitude, incompleteness, "not yet whole") is more implied than dramatized in a pivotal choice under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: ink, violets, small moments as relics. The final image—jetty blooming again, covenant breathing—offers a resonant answer to whether memory-work can regenerate what's broken, without stating a moral. The locket's snap and her refusal to look back charge the ending with commitment. Minor slip: "the weight of small moments like a relic, like a weapon, like a gift" edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is consistent—archival focus on ink, vellum, preservation—and diction fits the character ("walnut-ink," "poorly sized paper," "proximate causes"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("wondered if the new covenant would hold") to wider lyric register at closure. Minor register drift: "euphoria, haunted by what could have been" reads slightly elevated for the immediate moment, though it serves the tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language (water "the color of old parchment," stars as "holes in the sky") charges atmosphere. Three distinct frictions: (1) Paraphrase loop—"The archivist walked… carrying the weight of small moments" restates her role without new pressure; (2) "steeped" recurs three times across the piece, becoming template cadence; (3) Final-third figurative density ("like a relic, like a weapon, like a gift") stacks modifiers without advancing the beat. Deductions: −0.6 for template cadence and loops, −0.3 for stacked modifiers near closure. Total: −0.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist and regenerated covenant through proximate causes offer a fresh synthesis. The jetty blooming through cracks and the use of ink from the man's tree particularize the premise. Risk: the piece commits fully to lyric-accumulative mode and trusts image over exposition. Minor derivative echo: "stars were just holes in the sky" reads familiar, though filtered through the man's voice. The final image of stubborn green and breathing covenant feels earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist frames expectation early, traces the locket photo onto vellum (middle beat), and commits to return at closure. Her choices drive the ritual structure, though much is internal observation. Two distinct beats plus closure participation elevate the score, but swappability (any memory-keeper role would function similarly) and lack of a high-cost pivot cap the grade.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locket appears in paragraph 3 (early), she holds it open and later snaps it shut (two beats), and its edge imprints through the vellum, linking to the final covenant image. The photo inside anchors her memory-work and the locket's closure punctuates her commitment. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; minor cap for modest irreplaceability—any keepsake photo would serve a similar function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant is named early, shapes her ritual (tracing, whispering old words), and the closing lines confirm it is "breathing" and "not yet complete." It appears across three beats and drives her motivation. Score capped by modest causal pressure—the covenant remains thematic frame more than tactical constraint that narrows on-page options under immediate conflict.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" appears once in paragraph 7 ("her strokes gently thorough") to describe her brush technique. It characterizes her method but does not constrain a choice with cost or return with reweighted meaning. Present and apt, but ornamental. One functional beat without closure linkage or causal pressure caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Steep" appears early (paragraph 4: "steeped the memory of him for years") and returns in paragraph 13 ("steeped herself in the moment") and paragraph 25 ("steep the past into the present"). The action frames her method and recurs across the arc, but it remains metaphorical description rather than a tactical choice that redefines options under pressure. Lyric reprise with modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Proximate causes" is named once (paragraph 9: "proximate causes were her method") and demonstrated through ink from his tree, places he stood, things he touched. The method shapes her ritual logic but is more told than dramatically tested. Present in setup and implicit at closure (she returns to the jetty), but lacks a middle beat where the method constrains a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors the opening, its groaning pilings and closing violets mark time, and the final image promises it "would bloom again." Twilight bleeding into harbor and the tide pulling at pilings create atmospheric pressure. The setting charges three beats (opening, middle ritual, closing promise) and the jetty's cracks filled with "stubborn green" encapsulate the theme. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"When context changes" appears in the title phrase (paragraph 13: "context was shifting again—this time, by her hand") and the bell chimes mark the hour "when the old world blurred into the new." Time as context-shift frames her agency and the covenant's transformation. The timeframe shapes her stance (she acts during the shift) and charges the closure, though it lacks a ticking-clock that alters tactics beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of small moments" is stated in paragraph 6 and embodied when she traces the locket photo, presses vellum to her chest, and walks "carrying the weight of small moments" at closure. The motivation drives her ritual across three beats, but friction appears only once ("wondered if the new covenant would hold"), and most choices feel procedural rather than conflicted. Modest cost legibility caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named once (paragraph 10: "the air hummed with something like euphoria, haunted by what could have been") and threaded through diction—bitterness steeped like tea, hope in blooming cracks, loss in the locket. The tone modulates from twilight melancholy to quiet resolve at closure and charges the final image of stubborn green and breathing covenant. Coherent through turns with one explicit label; strong modulation under pressure.</comment>
