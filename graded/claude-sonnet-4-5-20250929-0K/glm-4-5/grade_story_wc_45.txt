<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is articulated ("to turn mistakes into constellations") but her interiority relies on abstract philosophical musings rather than embodied, contradictory impulses under pressure. The Arthur-figure's line "My bones need setting" + "vulnerability that seemed both ancient and shrewdly innocent in its calculated display" hints at contradiction but reads as authorial commentary rather than dramatized tension. The final choice to join hands feels obligatory rather than earned by prior micro-choices with visible trade-offs. Backstory weight (~30%) meets BRR expanded mode tests but flattens present-tense pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (garden imagery, tooth motif, bone-setting ritual accumulate toward a conceptual repricing of reality). Closure occurs on-page: Eleanor touches Arthur, boundaries soften, "constellation they would become together" reweights her skepticism with felt cost (certainty lost). However, the Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive past ~120 words (hedge maze, Wembley estate, secret garden sequencing is diffuse). The cost is legible but soft—loss of skepticism is asserted more than shown in a concrete forfeiture. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt and cap Q3 at 7.0 per the test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The secret garden and hedge maze are vividly rendered (upside-down blooms, firefly light, moonpetals) and the garden's edges blur at closure, charging the final image. However, spatial choreography inside the maze is vague—Eleanor "navigates" but no turns, distances, or obstacles constrain her path. The tooth and moonpetals serve as micro-setting objects that enable the ritual. Orientation debt (Q2) caps this category at 7.0; within that ceiling, vivid but non-constraining description lands mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Eleanor's quest to restore or transform her worldview. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tooth begins to vibrate and Arthur emerges, narrowing her options to "reach out" or withdraw. The cost—yielding skepticism to wonder—is declared on-page but not tested by a prior refused alternative or visible sacrifice. Arthur's "My bones need setting" creates a pivot but Eleanor's "I have been preparing my whole life" bypasses friction. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (skepticism vs. wonder, forgiveness, "turn mistakes into constellations") emerges from the tooth motif and bone-setting ritual. The final image—hands joining, constellation glimpsed—reweights prior material without a stated moral. However, thematic statements proliferate: "forgiveness was more powerful than skepticism," "renewal through mystery," "turn mistakes into constellations" (repeated verbatim by Arthur). These reduce resonance to thesis. The ending avoids a sermon but the mid-story commentary dilutes the earned insight. Deduct −0.5 for thematic echo in body text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited to Eleanor is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("shrewdly innocent," "nostalgic innovation," "forgiving skeptic") but the register occasionally drifts into prompt-like abstraction ("dimensional barriers," "bone setting must work across realms"). Arthur's dialogue "My bones need setting" and "turning mistakes into constellations" carries subtext but also reads as thematic ventriloquism. Filter verbs ("she yearned," "she whispered," "she asked") cluster in key beats without harming clarity but dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is present (Eleanor notices the tooth's iridescence, recalls grandmother's teachings) but not character-specific under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied; opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image well. However, several artifact patterns reduce density: paraphrase loops ("Eleanor had always been a forgiving skeptic" → "With her shrewdly innocent approach"), stock metaphors (firefly light, perpetual twilight), and scaffolding phrases ("As Eleanor navigated," "With her shrewdly innocent approach," "As their hands joined"). Template cadence in Arthur's dialogue ("My Ellie" → "Building" → "My bones need setting") and synonym churn around "impossible" (extraordinary, peculiar, impossible ×3) lower information density. Deduct −0.8 for patterned artifacts clustered across beats but not touching closure directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The changeling-substitute-body premise and bone-setting ritual are non-generic, and the hedge-maze secret garden adds a fairy-tale texture. However, the core arc—skeptic confronts the supernatural, yields to wonder—is familiar, and the emotional beats (yearning, recognition, acceptance) follow a template path. The "turn mistakes into constellations" motif is poetic but repeated without fresh inflection. Victorian botanical engineering and the tooth's iridescence add specificity but do not transform the underlying structure. No bold risk beyond premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor ("forgiving skeptic") is present throughout, frames the opening, makes the key choice to perform bone-setting, and reaches out at closure. Her skepticism yields to wonder on-page, altering her stance. The trait shapes her approach (willing to entertain extraordinary claims) and the final turn (yielding to mystery). Present in all three gates; drives two beats (ritual, hand-joining); irreplaceable. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.5 = base 7.2; swappability (another cautious scientist) −0.4 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tooth appears in para 3 (Eleanor holds it), para 12 (placed in moonpetals), para 15 (vibrates), para 23 (dissolves into light at closure). Four distinct beats; the tooth enables the ritual and its dissolution completes the exchange. Setup +0.7, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6 = 5.4 base → 7.1. Strong integration; the exact object's properties (iridescence, vibration, dissolution) matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is introduced early (para 2) as Eleanor's opening state, recurs obliquely ("dimensional barriers," "possible vs. real"), and the ending reweights certainty → mystery. However, the concept functions primarily as theme rather than constraining tactics. Eleanor does not face a choice between certainty and mystery with visible cost; she simply progresses from one to the other. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure (weak) +0.3 = 1.7 base; thematic rather than tactical use −0.6; swappable phrasing −0.4 = 5.2 (corrected via lyric-resonance allowance for early seed + final reprise).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears twice (para 6, para 25) as label. In para 6 Eleanor's approach to the gardener's boy is described as "shrewdly innocent" but no on-page action demonstrates the trait—she does not deceive or reveal anything to the boy. In para 25 Arthur's vulnerability is "shrewdly innocent in its calculated display," again a label without visible trade-off. The trait does not enable or constrain a choice. Setup (label only) −0.5, ornamental −0.7, swappable −0.5 = 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Yearn" is present in para 4 ("she yearned for answers") and implied throughout Eleanor's quest. The action motivates her maze navigation and ritual, but it is a sustained state rather than a discrete turn. The ending fulfills the yearning (she reaches out, ready to understand), linking it to closure. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8 = 2.4 base; swappable (search, seek) −0.5; summary-only (not dramatized as a pivot) −0.5 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Bone setting" is seeded in para 8 (grandmother's teachings), enacted in para 14 ("precise motions"), para 19 ("practicing bone setting on the air"), and para 25 ("My bones need setting"). The method enables the ritual and is mechanically specific (aligning realities as one aligns a fractured limb). Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7 = 5.1 base → 6.9. Irreplaceable; the exact technique matters.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The secret garden is introduced in para 5, described in para 7 (Victorian botanical engineering, upside-down blooms, firefly light), houses the ritual (paras 12–16), and at closure "the garden around them shifted, the maze walls dissolving" (para 27). The garden's perpetual twilight and moonpetals enable the ritual; the dissolving walls charge the final image. Setup +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7 = 5.4 base → 7.3. Strong integration; the exact setting's properties matter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the substitute body is found" (para 2: "three weeks ago") anchors the timeframe. The time elapsed does not tighten Eleanor's choices—no clock, no deadline, no urgency tied to the three-week gap. The ritual occurs "now" but the when does not alter tactics. Setup +0.5, swappable (could be three days or three months) −0.6, ornamental (does not pressure) −0.7 = 4.8. Present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is introduced in para 13 as Eleanor's evolved motivation, repeated by Arthur in para 21, and implied in the final "constellation they would become together" (para 28). The motivation frames her quest but is not dramatized as a conflicted choice—Eleanor does not face a trade-off between mapping errors and another goal. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (weak) +0.4 = 2.2 base; told-only (not enacted with friction) −0.6; swappable phrasing −0.5; AI-pattern artifact (repeated verbatim, prompt echo) −0.3 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is embodied in para 7 (Victorian botanical engineering, upside-down blooms, firefly light) and modulates at closure when the garden shifts according to Arthur's perceptions. The tone is coherent—wistful yet forward-looking—and charges the final image (constellation, rewritten story). Setup +0.7, closure linkage +1.3, coherence +0.8 = 2.8 base → 6.2. The tone is consistent and purposeful but not irreplaceable; a different tonal pairing could serve the arc.</comment>
