<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The illustrator's motivation is declared but not internally contradicted or embodied through micro-choices under pressure. The pendant-touching gesture and sketchbook references provide concrete anchors, but interiority relies heavily on exposition ("his motivation burned within him") rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. The final collapse registers exhaustion but the cost feels summarized rather than lived through embodied degradation across prior beats. Agency at closure—shattering the cage—arrives without prior hesitation or competing desire that would earn the renunciation of his future.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is unclear past 120 words: the "rooftop canal system," "giant," and "place where echoes are born" remain abstract without spatial or causal grounding, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens reads as attempted Causal but causality is undercut by convenience: the pendant glows and grants exactly the power needed at each beat without constraint. The closure—cage shattering and rhythm restoration—occurs on the page, but cost is told ("his future now shortened") rather than shown through a specific forfeited moment or image. The "interrupted cadence" motivates the quest but its mechanics (how water pulses unnaturally, why it matters beyond declaration) are never dramatized, weakening the because/therefore chain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rooftop canals and central tower provide a fantastical frame, but spatial choreography across rooftop leaps and tower entry remains generic without distances, obstacles, or micro-setting that alters a choice. Sensory detail leans visual and abstract ("crystalline cage," "ethereal light") without tactile or auditory anchors that would ground the "place where echoes are born." The pendant and sketchbook are handled twice but do not constrain movement or resource use. The giant's breathing and cloud-stirring offer atmospheric pressure but do not force a tactical adaptation on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore cadence before the giant awakens—is signaled early, but escalation is episodic rather than causal: each obstacle (rooftop distance, door lock, cage) is introduced and solved in the same beat without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options. The time pressure from the giant's nap should tighten choices, yet the illustrator never sacrifices accuracy, safety, or an alternate path; he simply "quickened his pace." The final act (shattering the cage) is framed as desperate but no prior failed attempt or visible cost (a tool broken, a friendship betrayed, a memory lost) makes the success feel earned under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>A theme of natural rhythm versus suppression emerges through the caged cadence and canal restoration, and the infinity pendant's recursion hints at cost across time. However, the ending summarizes theme ("his purpose fulfilled") rather than offering a non-literal image that reweights the premise. The giant's dream-threat is declared but never dramatized in a way that tests the illustrator's values or forces a moral calculus. The "echoes waiting to be born" image has potential but remains abstract; no concrete particular (a specific sound, a memory-image in the crystal) anchors the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the illustrator's perceptual filter (sketchbook details, flora/fauna training) provides specificity early. However, diction drifts under pressure: "bizarre juxtapositions," "ethereal light," and "impinging upon the world" read elevated rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the pendant/sketchbook anchors recur with purpose. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he could hear") appear but do not obscure immediacy. No dialogue is present; voice relies on narration, which carries a faint template cadence in action sequencing ("he leaped," "he reached," "he gripped").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Template cadence across action beats: "The illustrator [verb]," "With one hand…the illustrator leaped," "When he reached…he found," "As he reached…the entire structure lurched" (−0.5). Paraphrase loop: "interrupted cadence" appears in four distinct sentences with near-identical phrasing without adding pressure (−0.3). Stock metaphors: "burned within him," "stretched thin," "crystals sparkled with memories" reduce specificity (−0.3). Sentence-level propulsion is present in the rooftop sequence but sags in the chamber description, where exposition replaces action. Information density is mixed: the sketchbook and pendant recur purposefully, but "legend spoke" and "those who feared its power" are scaffolding that could be cut.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The time-manipulation pendant, rooftop canals, and sleeping giant combine fantastical elements, but the core arc—hero races against clock to unlock cage and restore balance—is a widely used template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral cost. The illustrator's natural-history training is mentioned but never applied (no observation skill that reveals a clue, no taxonomy that unlocks the cage). The "place where echoes are born" is a vivid phrase but remains abstract; no specific sound or memory-image anchors the concept. Risk is present in the compressed time frame but the resolution is linear and the protagonist's expertise does not shape the method of uncaging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The natural history illustrator's occupation is named and his sketchbook recurs, but his observational skills do not drive a key turn. He identifies the water disturbance in the opening but does not apply taxonomy, pattern recognition, or field knowledge to solve the cage or navigate the tower. His choices (leap, activate door, shatter cage) are generic hero actions unrelated to his illustrator expertise. Present in setup and ending but functionally replaceable with "adventurer" or "scholar."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The infinity symbol pendant is handled in three beats: touched at the opening, gripped and glowing during the rooftop chase, and gripped again at the cage to borrow time. It enables time manipulation and activates the tower door (same symbol), linking setup to middle and ending. However, its mechanics remain vague (how does borrowing work? what is the felt cost?) and it functions as a magic-wand convenience rather than a constraint that forces a tactical choice. Causal role is present but specificity is low; a generic "time amulet" would work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence is named in the opening, motivates the quest, appears in the water-crystal trail, is caged in the chamber, and is restored in the ending. It shapes the dominant stake and recurs across beats, satisfying setup, development, and payoff. However, the concept's mechanics are never dramatized: what does "pulse unnaturally" mean in observable terms? How does restoring rhythm change a character's choice or alter tactics on the page? The element functions as thematic glue but remains abstract; removing it and substituting "stolen heartbeat" or "blocked flow" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Sculpts time itself" is declared early and demonstrated twice: slowing canal water to form crystals and borrowing time from the future to shatter the cage. The ability enables key beats but imposes no visible constraint—the illustrator uses it whenever needed without a failed attempt, a tool requirement, or a moment where he cannot afford the cost. The "depleted his own future" claim is told in summary rather than shown through a specific forfeited memory or skill. Functional in one beat (cage-breaking) but the mechanics lack texture and cost is abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Uncage" drives the climax: shattering the crystalline cage releases the cadence and fulfills the quest. The action is on-page and concludes the central conflict. However, it is introduced only in the final third (no prior mention of a cage until he enters the chamber), weakening setup. The act itself is a single gesture without complication—he reaches, grips the pendant, pulls time, cage shatters—so it does not test his values or force a trade-off between competing goods. Essential to closure but arrives late and resolves smoothly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"By borrowing time" is named early ("a dangerous practice that depleted his own future") and demonstrated in two beats: slowing water and shattering the cage. The method shapes the time-manipulation mechanic and imposes a declared cost (shortened lifespan). However, the mechanics remain vague (from where does he borrow? does each use cost a fixed amount?) and no on-page moment shows him hesitating, calculating the price, or failing because he cannot afford another borrow. The method is present in setup and closure but functions as a passive flavor rather than a constraint that alters tactics mid-attempt.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system is named early, provides the water-disturbance clue, forms the crystal trail the illustrator follows, and flows smoothly again at the ending. It supplies the visual frame and a navigation resource (crystal map). However, the canals do not constrain movement—no broken trough, no gap too wide to leap—and their restoration is a reported outcome rather than a choice-point. The setting is present across beats but functions as backdrop; swapping "canals" for "ley lines" or "wind currents" would not break logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The giant's nap provides the time constraint: the illustrator must act "across the giant's nap" before awakening alters reality. The giant's breathing is checked twice (growing heavier, clouds stirring) to signal time running out, and the final lurch (giant awakening) coincides with the cage-shattering, tightening the climax. The timeframe drives urgency in narration ("he quickened his pace") but does not force a visible trade-off—no choice to skip a clue, abandon the sketchbook, or risk a shortcut. Present in setup and ending with some middle development, but pressure remains abstract rather than forcing a tactical adaptation on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To find the place where echoes are born" is declared as motivation in the opening and fulfilled when the illustrator enters the chamber and frees the cadence. The goal is consistent and shapes the quest structure. However, it is never dramatized as a conflicted desire: no moment where he doubts the legend, weighs personal cost against the city's need, or faces a choice between uncaging and another value. The motivation is told ("his motivation burned within him") rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of wants. Present in setup and closure but remains a plot label without internal friction.</comment>
