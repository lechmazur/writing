<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eira remains abstract throughout; her "synesthetic blessing" is label-only description without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal values under pressure. The responsibility "felt heavier" and tears "flowed freely" are stock emotional markers rather than character-particular reactions. The piece offers no internal conflict—no competing impulse that would make the performance costly or her stance vulnerable—and the final "mission complete" reads as declarative satisfaction rather than earned endurance or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening; Eira begins ready to perform, performs without opposition or complication, and achieves the declared outcome without narrowing options or paying a visible cost. The "sculpted hush" unfurls as promised with no dramatized friction. Orientation is clear, but the causal chain is a straight line: preparation → performance → success. The ending offers emotional affect in the crowd but no on-page change in Eira's options, knowledge, or stance—no Decisive Change, Earned Stasis, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered with synesthetic interplay of light, sound, and crystalline surfaces. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics during the performance. The amber music sheet glows and the bells refract, but these details amplify atmosphere rather than imposing logistical friction. Micro-setting (the sheet, the bells) charges the final image but does not shape a turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"certify wonder as essential"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or complication. Eira's performance proceeds without error, interruption, or internal doubt; no tactic is forced to change, no cost forecloses a path. The crowd's tears affirm success without dramatized friction. The piece offers escalation in sensory intensity but not in narrative pressure or protagonist agency under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of wonder's essentiality emerges through image and sensory density rather than on-page conflict. The final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("proving irrefutably that such wonder was not merely decorative but essential") but stops short of overt sermon. The sculpted hush and the synesthetic tapestry charge the concept, yet the absence of a thematic complication or counter-reading limits resonance. The ending reweights perception subtly but does not crystallize a non-literal answer with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable focalization and elevated diction appropriate to the ceremonial premise. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract intensifiers ("ethereal," "pristine clarity," "profound silence") and recycled constructions ("seemed to," "began to") that flatten immediacy. Interiority remains label-driven ("responsibility felt heavier") rather than embodied through specific perception. No dialogue appears; voice is consistent but lacks a character-particular perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting: figurative language clusters in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, and mixed registers ("unfetter the potential energies," "doves from confinement," "blanket of serenity woven from starlight") blur clarity. Template cadence runs appear ("As she continued," "As the final sequence approached," "When her fingers struck") and paraphrase loops recur (e.g., "colors bloomed behind her eyes" / "each hue… sang its own secret melody"). The final third stacks metaphors ("lotus," "presence," "tears of joy") that obscure rather than sharpen the closure image. Apply −1.2 for density + coherence + cadence artifacts touching closure, and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—synesthetic bell-ringer performs a ritualistic piece in a glacial cathedral—combines familiar fantasy elements (ceremonial magic, last-of-her-kind protagonist, light/sound synesthesia) without transformation through lived constraint or moral calculus. The performance succeeds as planned with no surprise turn or cost that redefines the opening expectation. The "sculpted hush" concept is evocative but remains abstract; no specific detail anchors it to Eira's particular struggle or world logic. Apply −0.8 for derivative premise without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Eira is on-page throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her choices (tap bells per the sheet, continue through the sequence) are procedural execution rather than pressure-driven reversals. She is present in closure but observes her own success rather than enacting a costly turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The amber music sheet appears in paragraph 3 (setup), glows in paragraph 9 (development cue), and is "brilliant with captured light" in the final line (closure reprise). However, its role is ornamental: it holds the composition but does not constrain a choice or introduce friction. The glow signals progress but does not reweight meaning. Two-gate presence (setup + closure cameo) with static function caps at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sculpted hush" is introduced as the composition's intended effect (paragraph 4) and declared achieved in paragraph 18 ("silence that could be felt, tasted, and seen"). It shapes the announced goal but not on-page tactics; Eira does not adjust her method when the hush fails to materialize or deepens unexpectedly. The concept is told as outcome rather than dramatized as constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Synesthesia is seeded early (paragraph 2) and described throughout (colors bloom as notes, hues sing melodies). However, it functions as perceptual texture rather than a constraint or tradeoff; Eira's gift enables the performance without visible cost or complication. No moment shows her synesthesia forcing a difficult choice, missing a cue, or imposing a price. Label-present but not pressure-active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Unfetter" appears once (paragraph 9: "unfetter the potential energies stored within silence itself") as metaphor for the performance's purpose. The action is summary-only and not causally distinct from the broader act of bell-ringing. No turn or closure moment traces specifically to unfettering; the verb is decorative rather than load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The aurora is seeded in paragraph 1, mirrored in paragraph 6 (performance begins when aurora dances), and translated through synesthesia in paragraphs 11–12 (colors guide bell strikes). This method shapes the middle beat (guiding which chimes to strike) but does not constrain or complicate; Eira translates fluidly without friction. Two-gate presence (setup + middle) with functional but smooth use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ice cavern is anchored early (paragraph 1) and its crystalline surfaces interact with light and sound throughout, charging the sensory texture. The cavern "oscillates between states of repose" (paragraph 13) as the performance unfolds. However, it does not impose a tactical constraint (temperature, acoustics, structural threat) or force a choice. Micro-setting (bells, ice walls) charges the ending image but does not alter options. Three-gate presence with lyric rather than causal function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble" is invoked once (paragraph 6) as poetic parallelism for the aurora's appearance but imposes no clock pressure or decision constraint. Time is not tracked; the performance's duration is elastic and unopposed. The simile is ornamental and does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Certify wonder as essential" is stated explicitly in paragraph 5 and affirmed in paragraph 19 ("proving irrefutably that such wonder was… essential"). The motivation is declared but not dramatized through conflicting desires or on-page friction. Eira never weighs wonder against a competing need or pays a visible price to secure it. Told-only at setup and closure without middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Oscillating repose" is directly named in paragraph 13 ("cavern began to oscillate between states of repose—moments of profound quiet punctuated by pristine clarity of resonant sound"). The tone modulates between stillness and sound throughout the performance and is coherent with the ritual premise. However, it remains static in affect—ceremonial throughout—without tension or a shift that charges the final image. Functional but not elevating.</comment>
