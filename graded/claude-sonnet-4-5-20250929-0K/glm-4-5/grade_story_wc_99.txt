<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tutor's motivations (finding the color of unspoken apologies, reconciling with his dead brother) are present but primarily told through reflection rather than tested through contradictory impulses in scene. Interior life is dominated by slow-spoken monologue that remains consistent in register without degradation under pressure. The final whisper of his brother's name reads as a gesture toward closure but lacks visible cost—no on-page foreclosure of a path or embodied struggle that would earn the transformation from "cerulean regret" to "something like peace." Backstory exceeds 30% without sufficient interleaving of present micro-choices that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the compass's behavior, lace pattern revelation, and bonsai arrangement build toward the final glow and whispered name. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the compass settles, pointing inward; the tutor acknowledges the severance is "not ended" but the current has "found its true direction"), yet the cost remains oblique—no specific on-page forfeiture or visible price paid in the final beat. The confession "I never told her..." introduces a second unresolved thread (her eyes/waves) that diffuses focus without payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The islet setting (petrichor, salt, post-rain foliage) and interior props (glass case, bonsai, lace, compass) are vividly rendered. The compass and lace constrain the ritual sequence, and the bonsai are positioned to "participate," but environment does not materially alter a tactical choice—the tutor follows the revealed pattern without friction. The breezy windows and prismatic dew charge the final image, lifting the score, but the setting functions more as atmospheric container than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the color of unspoken apologies) is signaled early. The compass's shift from wild spinning to rhythmically placid sweeps, then pointing at his heart, constitutes a single tightening, sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens. However, the protagonist's agency is passive observation and monologue; the compass and lace drive the sequence, not his choices. The confession "I never told her..." is spoken to an empty room without on-page consequence, and the final whisper of his brother's name lacks visible cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (reconciliation, memory, unspoken grief) emerges from the compass ritual and bonsai patience metaphor. The antique lace as instruction-bearer and the compass as memory-navigator are purposeful, recurring images. The final line attempts resonance ("the severance is not ended, but the current... has found its true direction"), yet this insight is stated rather than embodied in a choice or renunciation. The "color of unspoken apologies" remains abstract—its "transcendent beauty" is told, not shown through a concrete image or action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; the tutor's slow-spoken cadence and measured diction are consistent. Free indirect style is clean. However, the voice adopts an elevated, near-poetic register throughout ("cerulean regret," "rhythmically placid," "prismatic colors") that reads as authorial rather than naturalistic for a grieving man alone. Psychic distance remains static; there is no compression or shift under the ritual's peak moment. No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is gentle but lacks character-specific bias or selectivity—he notices everything equally.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Density is low; many sentences paraphrase or restate mood without advancing action (e.g., "The slow-spoken bonsai tutor traced..." then "his voice carrying the weight of cerulean regret..."). Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" and quote-attribution structures. Stock phrases accumulate: "weathered fingers," "otherworldly energy," "the weight of words unexpressed," "transcendent beauty." Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "would") dull immediacy. The final third carries these artifacts into the closure beat, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Figurative language ("tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret") recurs in most high-pressure lines without variation or payoff, adding overwriting debt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ghost-ship compass, antique lace instructions, and bonsai patience metaphor combine into a coherent ritual frame. However, the premise (bereaved man seeks mystical reconciliation through inherited object) follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The "color of unspoken apologies" remains a declared rather than dramatized discovery. Emotional progression is orderly and risk-averse; the tutor's slow-spoken monologue and the compass's cooperative behavior avoid friction or surprise. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The tutor observes, arranges bonsai, touches branches, and whispers his brother's name—actions present across setup, middle, and ending. Yet these are responses to the compass's behavior rather than decisions that narrow options. The whisper at closure is gestural; no visible cost or foreclosed path. Functional but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The compass appears early (glass case, first paragraph), drives the middle sequence (wild spinning → placid sweeps → pointing at his heart), and anchors the ending (glows, pulses in response to the whispered name). Its needle's behavior shapes the tutor's interpretation and timing. Meaning reweights from geographic tool to memory-navigator to self-pointing reconciliation marker. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The phrase "tides of remembrance" bookends the story (opening and penultimate paragraph) and frames the fifteen-year wait. The compass washes ashore "with the tide," and the lace's revelation coincides with post-rain conditions, suggesting cyclic return. However, the concept remains thematic metaphor rather than on-page constraint—no tidal clock or water-level pressure alters the tutor's choices. Present in setup and closure; modest causal role in middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" describes the waves in the opening line, then the compass's final sweeps. It establishes tone but does not constrain action—the tutor's slow cadence is labeled "slow-spoken" separately. The attribute is ornamental, used twice for mood without enabling or limiting a choice. Swappable with "steady" or "calm."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears twice: the lace pattern implies "a diffusion of energy rather than concentration," and the tutor says "To diffuse the accumulated sorrow." This reading prompts him to arrange the three bonsai around the compass, a middle-beat action. The word returns in the penultimate paragraph ("to diffuse the remaining shadows"). Present in setup (lace reading), middle (bonsai arrangement), and closure (stated goal). Shapes one tactical choice but could be replaced with "release" or "disperse" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The antique lace pattern is introduced early (first paragraph: "its intricate weave containing instructions only he could decipher"), drives the middle revelation (new sequence of loops), and the tutor "followed the instructions woven into the lace pattern" in the penultimate paragraph as the compass settles. The method is signaled, used, and paid off. However, the mechanics remain opaque—what specific action the "spiral" instructions prescribe is not shown. Essential across gates but mechanically thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The breezy islet after rain provides sensory detail (petrichor, salt, dew, foliage) and frames the tutor's isolation. The post-rain timing coincides with the lace's new revelation, suggesting environmental trigger. However, the setting does not constrain or enable a choice—the ritual could occur in any quiet room with windows. The prismatic dew in the final image charges atmosphere but does not alter outcome. Present in setup and closure; weak causal middle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the severance, fifteen years prior" anchors backstory; "each morning" establishes routine; "last night's downpour" and "this morning" frame the present ritual. The fifteen-year span explains the tutor's patience and the compass's long presence but does not create urgency—no approaching deadline or clock. The timeframe contextualizes motivation and supplies thematic weight (long grief), yet it does not tighten present decisions. Setup and thematic closure participation; minimal middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The desire "to find the color of unspoken apologies" is stated early (second paragraph) and restated at the climax ("There it is... the color of unspoken apologies finally revealed"). It shapes the tutor's fifteen-year quest and ritual focus. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page friction between this goal and a competing need. The final "revelation" is declared without showing what the color looks like or what it costs to see. Present across all gates; modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" labels the tutor's emotional state in the opening and recurs when it "lifted slightly" and "transformed into something like peace" at closure. Tone is consistent (quiet, elegiac, slow-spoken) and modulates gently as the compass settles. However, the tonal shift is told ("something like peace") rather than embodied in changed perception or syntax. The color "cerulean" links to the "color of unspoken apologies" but remains abstract. Setup and closure presence; thematic label without pressure modulation.</comment>
