<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("preserve the shape of hope") is stated rather than shown through embodied choices under pressure. Her recognition of the shadow-friend arrives as epiphany rather than earned through prior internal contradiction. The interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("luminous regret," "effortlessly elegant") instead of character-particular perception, and the final choice—continuing her vigil—feels passive rather than a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story assembles a pattern of shadow observations building toward the revelation of the friend's face, which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow reunites with its source conceptually). However, the cost remains abstract—Elara continues her work with altered understanding but no forfeited path or visible price. The orientation is clear early (library, Elara, her role), and the lens holds, but the closure effect is more conceptual than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The blooming library above the clouds is vivid and present throughout, supplying atmosphere and recurring imagery (cloud-flowers, crystal dome, moonlight). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions primarily as a lyrical backdrop. The river stone returns at the closure beat and grows warm, charging the final image slightly, which lifts the score into mid-range.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding shadow anomalies to navigate the new reality—is signaled early but remains abstract. Elara's nightly observations accumulate without a tightening choice or visible trade-off until the shadow reveals itself; that moment is received rather than forced by protagonist agency. The escalation is textural (pattern intensification) rather than causal, and no on-page cost narrows her options or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of love's persistence beyond death emerges from concrete particulars: the shadow's search, the river stone warming, the friend's face. The ending reweights "preserve the shape of hope" from professional duty to personal mission without overt moralizing. However, phrases like "love's endurance beyond the limits of time" trend toward abstract summary rather than letting the image speak, and the final paragraphs risk thematic echo by restating the concept multiple times.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara. The prose has distinct texture—"petal-soft leaves," "shadow unbound," "luminous regret"—that remains consistent. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, matching the cloud-library setting, though it risks uniformity under pressure (no compression or shift when stakes rise). Free indirect thought is clean, and there is no head-hopping. One brief line of dialogue at the climax ("I meant to preserve the shape of hope") lands with purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is largely clear, but multiple passages loop conceptually: the shadow's nature is described across several paragraphs with near-synonyms ("metamorphose," "transforming," "effortlessly elegant," "reverse origami") without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "shadow + verb" stems. Figurative density is high throughout without escalation pattern, and some connective tissue ("In the years since," "Night after night") reads as scaffold. No single artifact obscures closure, so deductions remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds and the Sharing Revolution offer fresh world-building particulars. However, the shadow-as-lost-friend revelation follows a familiar arc (unrecognized presence finally identified by the observer). The "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" role and video-footage method are underused; Elara's passivity and the convenient shadow approach reduce risk. The ending's transformation is predictable once the friend's face appears, limiting originality to atmospheric execution rather than structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and the role ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") frames her observations, but her choices do not create key turns. She catalogs shadows night after night; the shadow approaches her without her agency forcing the encounter. The decision to continue her vigil at the end is a continuation, not a reversal. Setup and closure participation are present, but development (a middle choice constrained by observation) is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in paragraph 3 (early), returns at the climax when the shadow gestures toward it, and grows warm as the shadow dissolves—three beats. It carries symbolic weight (grounding, bridge between moments) and is physically handled. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its role is lyric resonance rather than causal pressure. Strong reprise lifts it to mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The shadow unbound is the central mystery, shapes Elara's nightly observations, and drives the reveal at climax. It appears early, recurs across beats, and the metamorphosis action is tied directly to it. Removing it would collapse the plot. However, Elara does not actively pursue or bind the shadow; she receives its approach. Strong causal presence and closure linkage, but protagonist agency is low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" is applied to the shadow's movement in paragraph 6 and echoed in descriptions of its behavior, but it functions as atmospheric label rather than a trait that constrains action or imposes cost. No on-page choice hinges on this quality; it could be replaced with "purposeful" or "careful" without structural change. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" appears multiple times as the shadow's key action: it stretches, folds, transforms across paragraphs, and the final metamorphosis reveals the friend's face—the story's climax. This action is irreplaceable and defines the closure moment. Early signal, beat involvement across the arc, and direct closure linkage. Strong integration, though the repeated mentions trend toward decorative layering in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The method is introduced in paragraph 4 ("comparing silent video footage from decades apart") and enables the initial discovery of the shadow anomaly. It reappears in paragraph 12 as she builds a timeline. However, the footage does not shape the climax—the shadow approaches her directly, not through recorded study. Setup and one development beat present, but no closure participation. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is omnipresent, supplies vivid imagery (petal-soft leaves, crystal dome, cloud-flowers), and frames every beat. The setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as atmospheric container. The final scene uses moonlight through the dome to charge the shadow's transformation, which adds slight closure linkage. Strong setup and ending presence, weak development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the Sharing Revolution" and "dreams became shareable" establish the timeframe in the opening and recur as background context. The concept does not tighten a deadline or alter tactics; Elara's observations span "years" and "night after night" without urgency. The element provides world flavor but no causal pressure. Present in setup and mentioned at closure, but no development beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is stated in paragraph 9 as Elara's motivation, returns in her whispered line at climax ("I meant to preserve the shape of hope"), and reframes as personal mission in the final paragraphs. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices, and no on-page friction tests it. Lyric reprise with closure reweighting, but weak embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is named explicitly in paragraph 15 at the climax and recurs in the final paragraph. The tone pervades the prose—wistful, elegiac, charged with loss—and modulates slightly as understanding dawns. However, the mood remains static across beats rather than escalating with pressure. The final image charges regret with the friend's dissolution, which elevates closure linkage. Coherent and purposeful, but limited dynamic range.</comment>
