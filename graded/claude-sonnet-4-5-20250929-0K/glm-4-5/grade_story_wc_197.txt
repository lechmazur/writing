<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is stated early but her internal contradictions remain thin; the piece tells us she's "carefully resourceful" yet most key moments rely on external luck (the puddle map, Old Theodor appearing). Theodor's sudden appearance and ready cooperation feel convenient rather than earned through prior character work. Embodied emotion is minimal—"hope blossom[ing]" and "smiling grimly" are generic labels rather than character-specific physical states under pressure. The final choice to flee is externally driven by alarms rather than an internally conflicted decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but fractures into coincidence at key turns: the puddle-reflection map appears with no prior setup or cost, and Theodor materializes exactly when needed with the final piece of exposition. The Orientation Test penalty applies—"who" and "where" anchor by ~200 words, but "when" (relationship to the informant's "dawn breaks" warning) remains vague until late. Closure attempts a Decisive Change (data transferred, rebels escape) but the cost is abstract—"security forces closed in" yet the escape succeeds off-page with no visible price paid in tactics, injury, or sacrifice. The "memories will live elsewhere now" is told rather than dramatized, weakening closure legibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon under starlight provides a vivid visual anchor and the underground data vaults add spatial stakes. The marshes enable the escape tactically, meeting the micro-setting test. However, much setting detail remains decorative—"bruised purples and oranges" at dusk, the "liquid gold" water—without constraining Mara's choices. The phone booth key's physical interaction (insertion, glowing) does tie object to setting at the closure beat, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (save the archives) is clear early. The tightening from "usual approach" blocked to puddle-map discovery to archive infiltration shows structure, but escalation is undercut by convenient solutions: the map appears unbidden, Theodor supplies missing knowledge, and the key works despite protocol changes. No visible cost is paid—alarms sound but the escape succeeds off-page, and "the truth would reappear when least expected" is asserted rather than earned through on-page sacrifice or tactical trade-off. Agency at closure belongs more to the key and Theodor than to Mara's internal choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (memory vs. erasure, resisting indifference) is coherent and emerges from plot rather than being stated outright. The phone booth key and TrueComm logo function as motifs that reappear with cumulative meaning. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly—"coded freedom that came with remembering," "the line against those who thrived on forgetting"—replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The piece gestures toward complexity (the Revisionists' motives, the cost of rebellion) but doesn't dramatize moral ambiguity or a non-obvious stance, settling instead into clear hero-versus-oppressor framing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the tyranny of indifference," "auric lagoon," "coded freedom") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, but the lapses are brief. Dialogue is functional and advances plot; Theodor's lines carry exposition but remain naturalistic enough. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose has some rhythmic variation though sentence openings repeat patterns ("Mara felt," "Mara turned," "Mara patted") in the final third, creating mild template cadence without fully obscuring the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn damage density: "reappear" echoes across the text without evolving meaning, "carefully resourceful" / "practiced ease" / "practiced efficiency" recycle the same trait-label, and the final two paragraphs restate closure consequences in overlapping phrases ("crack in their wall," "foundation for rebuilding," "world was ready to see again"). Template cadence is present in the closing beats ("When they find us," "When plans unraveled," "The lagoon would keep"). Some metaphors are strained—"fog" of indifference, "ripples" as both literal water and abstract symbol. Grammar and tense are clean. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise (rebel archivist saving erased histories from authoritarian regime) is a widely used template without fresh transformation—the Revisionists remain faceless, the archives are generic "unedited histories," and the resolution follows the expected path. The puddle-reflection map and auric lagoon offer surface novelty but function as convenient plot devices rather than organic extensions of worldbuilding or character. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece opts for straightforward chronology and clean heroism. Emotional specificity is thin, relying on stock rebellion language ("hold the line," "wall of indifference").</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara (underestimated rebel) is present throughout and makes the decision to infiltrate and transfer data, meeting setup and closure gates. However, key turns are driven by external elements (puddle map, Theodor's help, the key's function) rather than her resourcefulness altering tactics under pressure. "Underestimated" is told ("authorities had tagged her as...harmless") but not dramatized—no on-page moment where her being underestimated enables a tactical advantage. The trait is more ornamental framing than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears early (first paragraph, setup), is used twice on-page (inserted into the guardian's podium, initiates the final protocol), and returns in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning ("not just a physical door, but a pathway to liberation"). The key constrains the middle choice (only TrueComm keys can bypass new protocols) and shapes closure (glowing brighter, transfer cables). However, its mechanics are convenient—"unexpected slot," protocol change this morning—rather than earned through prior cost or specificity. The key drives two beats and participates in closure, but swappability remains moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Revised histories" as core concept is signaled early and frames the dominant stake (save unedited histories from erasure). It shapes Mara's goal throughout and the closure action (data transfer). However, the concept remains abstract—"inconvenient histories," "unedited histories complete with voices"—without specific on-page content that would make revision tactics or costs concrete. The mechanics of how the Revisionists revise or why certain memories matter more are told rather than dramatized, limiting the concept's causal pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is labeled in the opening line and mentioned again as "practiced ease" and "practiced efficiency," but the trait is not demonstrated through constrained problem-solving with visible cost. Mara's key actions—following the puddle map, using the key, fleeing—rely on external aids rather than her own resourcefulness altering tactics. The trait is ornamental, present in narration but not shaping on-page choices or trade-offs. No scene shows her improvising under scarcity or choosing one resource over another with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reappear" is seeded early (the informant's warning that archives will "vanish," memories "vanish from public consciousness"), drives the middle turn (images "reappear on the shimmering surface"), and explicitly shapes closure ("reappear when least expected," "The rebels continued to vanish and reappear"). The action is causally essential—Mara's entire mission is to make the memories reappear elsewhere. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown (data "flowed freely" off-page), and the word itself is repeated so often it becomes thematic echo rather than fresh tactical shift. The action is indispensable to the story's logic and participates in all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection map appears in the middle third (development gate met) and enables Mara's route through the marshes, directly shaping one key beat. However, it arrives with no prior setup, no cost to access, and no causal link to Mara's skills or choices—"nature itself conspiring" is convenient magic rather than resourceful method. The mechanics (how reflections encode paths, why only Mara sees it) are opaque. The method is swappable (any discovered map would serve the same function) and does not reappear or constrain later choices. It meets one gate (middle) but remains replaceable and unexplained.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is signaled early, provides spatial stakes (underground vaults below, water as facade), and is present in the closure beat (the escape across the water, "ripples on the auric surface"). The lagoon constrains tactics—Mara must reach the shore, work at the guardian's podium—and the starlight contributes to tone. However, the lagoon's unique properties (why auric, why this location matters beyond being guarded) remain decorative. The setting pressures choices moderately and charges the final image, meeting all three gates, but its specificity is more atmospheric than causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" as timeframe is signaled early (security patrols triple, the informant's "dawn breaks" deadline) and shapes urgency in the middle (Mara moves under cover of darkness, security forces close in at the end). However, the clock is vague—no clear sense of how much time passes or how much remains before dawn. The escape succeeds without dramatized time pressure forcing a tactical sacrifice. The timeframe motivates the attempt but does not tighten decisions with a felt cost; the alarms sound but the outcome is told off-page. Meets setup and development; closure participation is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is articulated early as Mara's motivation and reinforced throughout ("quiet rebellion," "first crack in their wall"). The motivation drives her goal and is present in the closure beat ("holding the line" recurs in the final paragraph). However, the desire is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—no scene shows Mara tempted to abandon the mission, weighing personal safety against the abstract ideal, or paying a visible cost for her stance. The motivation is coherent and consistent but lacks friction or embodied trade-off, remaining more thematic claim than lived pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" as tone is present in scattered images (the puddle map as "coded freedom of this message," the final reference to "coded freedom that came with remembering") and the secretive, resistance-flavored diction. However, the tone is inconsistent—much of the prose is straightforward action-adventure ("Mara turned to see," "Working with practiced efficiency") rather than encrypted or layered. The tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure; the closure beat's register is similar to the opening. The phrase itself is more thematic label than enacted tonal quality, and its recurrence feels ornamental rather than resonant.</comment>
