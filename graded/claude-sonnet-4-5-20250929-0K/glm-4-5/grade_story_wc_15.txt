<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to transform ruin into reverence") but never tested by a competing desire or cost. Her sleepwalking removes agency—she acts "beyond conscious control," making key choices automatic rather than pressured. The "hauntingly optimistic" trait appears only as a label without constraining any on-page decision. Villagers witness the transformation but apply no pressure, leaving Elara's arc a passive unfolding rather than earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph (passing Orientation Test). However, causality is loose: the plate "spoke to her in dreams" and her sleepwalking "overlaps" with canyon paths without clear mechanism or cost. The ending offers no decisive change—Elara "continued her work" in perpetuity, and the orchids bloom without consequence or foreclosed option. The accumulative design gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but delivers summary ("testament to the power of art") rather than a charged final image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth and harbor setting are vivid but remain postcard backdrops. The canyon "rose like dragon spines" and "pulsed with new life" without constraining any choice or altering Elara's tactics. The illustration plate and thread/needle are handled across beats, yet their physical properties (weight, friction, wear) never shape an action. Spatial choreography is vague—villagers "followed her sleepwalking path one night" without legible distance or effort.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the labyrinth—is declared but never tightened by a reversal or competing pressure. Elara's sleepwalking removes conscious choice, so escalation cannot arise from protagonist agency. Villagers worry briefly but immediately become pilgrims, collapsing potential friction. The ending summarizes perpetual success ("would endure, growing more beautiful") with no on-page cost, trade-off, or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly: "sew new meaning into ancient stones," "transforming ruin into reverence," "the power of art to transform." The final paragraph moralizes directly ("had carved her path... with dreams and determination") rather than earning resonance from particulars. The orchid/thread motif is mentioned repeatedly but never reweighted—it blooms without complication. No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the piece telegraphs its thesis in prompt-like language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Voice texture is present ("poetic wharf weaver," "morning mist curled like sleeping serpents") but drifts into elevated tourism register ("centuries of history," "testament to the power") inconsistent with a weaver's idiom under pressure. Perceptual signature is thin—Elara's noticing is generic rather than trade-specific. No dialogue appears, so related bullets are waived.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "overlapping" appears five times across adjacent paragraphs without functional variance; "ruin to reverence" repeats three times in identical phrasing. Template cadence runs: "The [noun] had [verb]... The [noun] now [verb]... The [noun] would [verb]" across the final third. Stock metaphors ("dragon spines," "sleeping serpents") and summary scaffolding ("Her work continued," "The seasons would change") dull momentum. The closure beat is buried in summary rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—magical thread that sprouts orchids to restore sacred ruins—follows a familiar template of solitary artisan redeems lost heritage through mystical craft. Transformation is cosmetic: swap orchids for roses or thread for paint and the arc is unchanged. The "sleepwalking paths" and "illustration plate" are underused conveniences rather than specific constraints. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis appears; the piece hedges toward safe reverence without friction or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her sleepwalking removes conscious decision at key turns. Observation without agency dominates; she "believed," "whispered," "continued" but does not choose under pressure. Not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The plate appears in paragraph three, recurs in dreams, and is mentioned at the end ("remained her most treasured possession"). It guides sleepwalking but is not handled or used in distinct beats—static symbolic anchor rather than evolving tool. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" is stated once ("breaking precedents—not defacing") as thematic claim without shaping tactics or stakes. The labyrinth's precedent is honored, not broken. Concept ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" appears once as a label ("Hauntingly optimistic despite years of hardship") without constraining or enabling any on-page action. No visible trade-off or cost tied to the trait. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sewing appears in multiple beats: "sew the old ways into new meanings," "began to sew along the canyon paths," "Each stitch was a meditation," and the ending's "sewn with orchid solace." It drives the transformation and closure image, though the mechanics (how thread becomes orchid) are unexplained. Present across setup, middle, and payoff with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Overlapping sleepwalking paths" is named four times but never shown in action—how paths overlap, what it costs, or why it matters remains abstract. The method guides Elara to the canyon but does not shape her attempts or constrain tactics. Summary-only; swappable with "following a map."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth is described vividly and recurs at closure ("red canyon walls echoed"). However, it supplies no resource or obstacle—Elara sews without friction from the environment. Postcard setting rather than tactical pressure. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After the tide pools empty" anchors discovery of the plate but does not tighten later decisions. Time remains vague ("As days passed," "each year") with no live clock altering moves. Ornamental temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated explicitly and drives Elara's project across beats. However, it is never conflicted—no friction between want and cost, no competing desire. Told and pursued without dramatized obstacle. Present in setup and payoff; lacks visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" appears twice: as thread color bringing "comfort to harsh red stone" and in the ending's summary. Tone remains static—gentle reverence without modulation under pressure. Does not charge the final image beyond label. Functional but replaceable with any peaceful hue.</comment>
