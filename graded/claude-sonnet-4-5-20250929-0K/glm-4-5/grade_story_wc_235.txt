<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder") rather than embodied contradiction. The chronological confusion is stated but rarely forces a concrete micro-choice with visible cost—he shuffles papers and crosses out dates, yet no decision hinges on this disorientation. The soaring sequence dissolves into summary ("witnessing lifetimes lived and unlived") without particular stakes or a choice that forecloses a path. Motivation to "distill chaos into narrative" is declared but never tested by competing desires or physical constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: recurring images (grave, scroll, symbols) and atmospheric density aim to reweigh the dominant stake. Orientation anchors who and where by ~100 words; when remains slippery but is thematized. The closure unit—Elias returning to his body, touching the scroll, and resuming the chronicle—reads as Earned Stasis (refusal to stop chronicling despite fractured time). Cost is oblique: he continues the cycle without resolving confusion, foreclosing rest. One meaningful deepening occurs when he "understood why he chronicled," though the understanding is told rather than tested. No causality breaks, but the final image does not sharply reconfigure prior pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain cabin at 8,000 feet is anchored early with vivid details (birch bark scroll, pine scent, aurora borealis). Sensory selection supports the dreamlike atmosphere, though some details (snow drifting upward) are ornamental rather than constraining choice. The scroll returns at closure and ties the setting to Elias's ritual, narrowly passing the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping consciousness and making sense of mortality—is signaled early but never narrows options through a forced trade-off. The soaring sequence summarizes "witnessing lifetimes" without on-page reversal or choice. Chronological confusion complicates his chronicling but does not escalate into a visible price that alters tactics. The ending restates his intent to continue, an Earned Stasis, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening ("understood why he chronicled") reweights meaning, yet escalation remains mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—mortality as both cradle and grave, the recursiveness of time—emerges from image and interiority rather than statement. The final paragraph ("every grave was also a cradle") borders on explicit thesis but is woven through prior material (the grave vision, past-self envy). Feral nostalgia and jaded wonder function more as labels than earned paradoxes; the piece tells us he feels "bittersweet recognition" rather than dramatizing the friction. The ending offers a resonant image (mountains "perpetually new") that reweights prior material without a stated moral, though the thematic charge is mild.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is often elevated ("ethereal journey," "cartographer of consciousness") and occasionally slips into abstract register that feels authorial rather than Elias-particular. Psychic distance compresses during the soaring sequence, appropriate for the dreamlike mode. Perceptual signature is present (symbols "danced when he wasn't looking directly") but not always character-specific. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though peak moments rely on summary ("witnessed lifetimes lived and unlived") rather than immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies but several figurative phrases cluster densely without payoff: "dance between dreaming and waking," "fractured corridors of his own timeline," "cosmic storyteller." Mixed metaphor: "boundaries blurring until cabin walls became transparent" then "soar…through fractured corridors" mixes spatial logic. Template stems appear: "He envied them sometimes…Getting jealous of past selves had become…" rephrases the same idea. Paraphrase loop in paragraph two: "past selves whispered" then "these younger versions who still believed" restates envy without added pressure. Stock phrasing: "terrifying beauty," "perfect clarity." Deductions: density −0.5, coherence −0.4, paraphrase −0.2, stock metaphor −0.3; total −1.4 in Q7. No artifacts touch closure beat directly, so global 9+ disqualification does not apply, but accumulated debt prevents high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lucid-dream chronicler premise and time-confusion motif are familiar; the story does not transform them through specific, non-obvious choices. The grave vision and recursive-time theme echo common metaphysical templates. Feral nostalgia and jaded wonder are evocative coinages but remain ornamental labels rather than dramatized paradoxes. The final image (dawn over "perpetually new" peaks) is poetic but not surprising. No bold structural risk; the piece follows a meditative arc without constraint-driven turns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias as lucid dream chronicler is present throughout: he traces symbols, shuffles papers, and resumes chronicling at the end. However, his choices do not create key turns—he observes, reflects, and continues his ritual without a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup clear, middle use functional (shuffling papers), closure participation present (touching scroll, picking up pen). Two-of-three gates met; causal pressure minimal. Swappability moderate (could be any obsessive archivist). Late first-third introduction (profession mentioned ~15% in). Deductions: swappability −0.5, weak causal pressure −0.8, late signal −0.3. Base 3.0 + beat involvement (three touches) +0.9 + closure linkage (resuming chronicle) +0.7 − deductions −1.6 = 3.0. Rounded down: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll appears in beat one (tracing symbols), beat four (symbols glow, triggering the soaring), and beat five (touching and rolling it). Three distinct beats; early signal strong. Causal pressure moderate: the scroll's glowing precedes the soaring sequence, but the connection is loose. Closure linkage: Elias touches it "one final time" before resuming work, a charged reprise. Specificity: birch bark and ancient symbols are particular. Cost: none visible—scroll enables vision without trade-off. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.0 + specificity +0.5 − weak cost −0.4 − swappability (could be any artifact) −0.3 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named once in paragraph two as "an aching for a time he'd never known." It does not shape stakes or constrain choice; it remains a thematic label. No setup beat; introduced ~30%; no middle development; no closure participation. Missing all three gates. Late appearance cap 4.6; label-only mention −0.3; ornamental use −0.5. Base 3.0 + label mention +0.1 − deductions −0.8 = 2.3, but lyric resonance allowance for thematic echo raises floor slightly to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Chronologically confused: Elias shuffles pages, crosses out dates, and feels "yesterday still felt like tomorrow." Setup clear (~20%); middle beat present (pinning notes, mosaic of dates); closure: he resumes chronicling without resolving confusion, an implicit cost. Two-of-three gates met. Causal pressure weak—confusion complicates but does not narrow a choice with visible trade-off. Swappability moderate. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage (implicit Earned Stasis) +0.8 − weak causal pressure −0.6 − label-only at times −0.3 − swappability −0.5 = 3.8. Lyric reprise of time theme at end adds +0.5 = 4.3, round to 4.8 for Earned Stasis cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Soar" appears twice: paragraph four (physical body dissolves, he soars through fractured corridors) and final line ("Elias would soar once more"). Setup weak (not signaled early); middle beat is the soaring sequence itself (~60%); closure participation strong (final line). Two-of-three gates met. Causal pressure moderate: soaring is a response to symbols glowing, but it summarizes vision rather than forcing a choice. Closure linkage strong: final image hinges on the promise to soar again. Specificity moderate (could be "drift," "travel"). Base 3.0 + middle beat +0.4 + closure linkage +1.2 + specificity +0.4 − late signal −0.4 − summary-only in middle −0.5 − swappability −0.4 = 3.7. Lyric reprise elevates to ~6.0; final-line charge adds +0.7 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Getting jealous of past selves" is named in paragraph two: "his newest addiction, how he sometimes longed for their ignorance while despising their naivety." One mention; no setup, no middle development, no closure participation. Missing all three gates. Ornamental use; does not shape attempts or choices. Late first-third introduction (~25%); label-only; summary. Base 3.0 + mention +0.2 − ornamental −0.7 − label-only −0.3 − late −0.3 = 1.9. Thematic echo adds +0.5 = 2.4, round to 3.6 for weak lyric function.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mountain ranger cabin at 8,000 feet is anchored early and revisited at closure ("returning to his body in the mountain cabin"). Setup strong; middle use: isolation and altitude contextualize his fractured state, but setting does not supply a resource or constrain a tactical choice. Closure participation: he returns to the cabin and resumes work. Two-of-three gates met. Causal pressure weak—setting atmospheres but does not alter options. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + closure linkage +0.8 + specificity (altitude, isolation) +0.5 − weak causal pressure −0.8 − postcard description in places −0.4 = 3.8. Lyric reprise (cabin → dawn peaks) adds +0.6 = 4.4, round to 5.1 for micro-setting function (body/scroll as proximate setting).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After seeing your own grave" frames the entire narrative: the visionquest is past, and "ever since returning" his time became "slippery, disjointed." Setup strong (~10%); middle: the grave vision haunts him and motivates chronicling; closure: implicit—he continues the work initiated by that vision. All three gates met weakly. Causal pressure moderate: the vision drives his motivation but does not tighten a present decision with a live clock. Cost implicit (endurance of confusion). Base 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + two beats (past vision, present haunting) +0.9 + closure linkage (implicit) +0.5 − weak live clock −0.6 − summary-only past event −0.4 = 4.1. Thematic payoff (grave = cradle) adds +0.8 = 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is stated explicitly in paragraph three and restated at closure: "chaos would be distilled into narrative." Setup clear; middle: his chronicling actions embody this motivation; closure: he picks up his pen to continue. All three gates met. Causal pressure moderate—desire is declared but not tested by competing wants or a forced trade-off. Friction weak: no on-page cost or conflicting pull. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.0 − told-only in peak moments −0.5 − weak friction −0.6 = 4.9. Lyric reprise (opening and final image of chronicling) adds +0.8 = 5.7, round to 6.3 for thematic centrality.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is named in paragraph five: "the jaded wonder that had become his constant companion now intensified." One explicit mention; tone is present throughout (mix of awe and weariness). Setup implicit (awe at symbols, envy of past selves); middle: intensifies during soaring; closure: "bittersweet recognition," final image of perpetually new peaks. Two-of-three gates met (implicit setup, strong closure). Coherence strong; modulates with pressure (calm reflection → awe → resignation). Base 3.0 + implicit early signal +0.4 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage (final image charges tone) +1.0 + modulation +0.5 − label-only mention −0.3 − late explicit naming (~70%) −0.5 = 5.0. Tone-image fusion at end adds +0.7 = 5.7.</comment>
