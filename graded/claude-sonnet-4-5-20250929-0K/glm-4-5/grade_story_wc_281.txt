<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya is given abstract labels ("affectionate skeptic") but never enacts contradictory impulses in scene. Her motivation to help her brother is declared repeatedly but never tested by an on-page choice with competing goods. Interiority relies on therapy-speak ("somatic markers," "synaptic chaos") and stock phrasing ("willowglass hope") rather than embodied perception. The final "affectionate skeptic became a believer" is an unearned epiphany told rather than shown through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, but the drive lens remains ambiguous—oscillating between causal (devising a method) and accumulative/textural (light patterns as symbolic accrual)—and no closure unit lands on the page. Maya "finally devised the protocol" and "prepared to share her findings" are summary declarations occurring off-page; no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing is dramatized with visible cost. The ending substitutes assertion ("healing would come—one pathway at a time") for scene pressure, violating the on-page closure requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio is named and its equipment described, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—none of Maya's choices are enabled or blocked by spatial access, tool availability, or the studio's properties. The muscovite geode's "fractally precise patterns" are vivid but remain visual decoration; they do not pressure a decision or charge the final image with cost. Sensory detail is present but not filtered through Maya's professional priorities or embodied urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—helping telepathy pill victims—is declared early but never narrowed or tested by an on-page choice with visible cost. No reversal occurs; Maya proceeds from setup through documentation to claimed success without encountering resistance, trade-off, or complication that alters her tactics. The "static shock" is mentioned as a catalyst but never shown forcing a difficult decision. Escalation is absent; pressure remains flat from start to finish.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is asserted in the final paragraphs ("the extraordinary potential of the human spirit to heal and transform") rather than emergent from specific events. The geode and light patterns recur but do not constrain choice or shift meaning at closure; they serve as symbolic ornament. "Affectionate skeptic became a believer" is thematic echo and moralizing rather than a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractally precise," "synaptic chaos," "willowglass hope") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, but the drift is not pervasive. The single line of dialogue ("Let's see what you can really do") feels perfunctory rather than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is generic; Maya's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or professional filter under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The motivation to illuminate hidden pathways" appears twice in nearly identical phrasing; "fractally precise" recurs as a label without added pressure; "muscovite geode sliver" is named in full eight times, creating synonym-avoidance churn. Filter-verb stacks ("Maya had noticed," "Maya watched," "Maya carefully documented") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Stock metaphors ("willowglass hope," "bridge between the physical world and the realm of thought") reduce clarity. Artifacts touch multiple beats, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—mystical object aids neurological healing after a pharmaceutical disaster—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Fractally precise" and "willowglass hope" read as quirky ornament rather than earned from world logic. The transformation test fails: plot and emotional arc could proceed with different names and objects without structural change. No bold risk-taking; the piece hedges toward a safe, declarative ending rather than dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. Her "affectionate skeptic" trait is label-only; no scene shows her doubt constraining an action or her affection forcing a trade-off. She observes, documents, and declares success without internal conflict or reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The muscovite geode sliver appears in multiple beats (tracing, positioning, vibrating, packing) but remains a static visual prop. Its "fractally precise" projections are described but never constrain a choice or enable a tactic with cost. It does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; Maya simply packs it. Setup and development gates are met; payoff is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall is declared as backstory motivation and mentioned repeatedly, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Maya's brother's condition is told, not dramatized; no scene shows her choosing between competing goods tied to the recall's consequences. The concept frames expectation but does not narrow options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is applied as a visual label to the geode's patterns five times without constraining or enabling an action. It does not create a visible tradeoff or force Maya to adapt her method. The attribute is ornamental description rather than a trait with on-page mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Devise" anchors the explicit goal ("Maya needed to devise a method") and appears at the claimed resolution ("Maya finally devised the protocol"), but the action occurs off-page as summary. No on-page beat shows her inventing, testing, or adapting the method under pressure. Major turns do not trace to this action; it bookends rather than drives.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is named early and Maya "carefully documented each somatic marker" in one beat, but the method's mechanics remain vague. How somatic markers enable the protocol is told, not shown; no scene dramatizes her using bodily responses to test or refine her approach. The means is present but does not shape attempts with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The light painting studio is named, its equipment arranged, and its atmosphere described, but it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. Maya could conduct her experiment in any lab without altering the plot. The studio's "special lens" and "carefully choreographed patterns" are setup but do not constrain or enable a key decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the static shock" frames the timeframe and is mentioned thrice, but the shock's consequences are backstory; no on-page clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. The piece spans an untracked duration from evening to dawn without time pressure shaping moves. The timeframe is present but does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is stated twice as Maya's motivation and referenced in theme, but it is never dramatized through conflicted choice. No scene shows her desire colliding with cost or fear; she proceeds without friction between wants and obstacles. The motivation is told and thematic rather than enacted with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" appears three times as a label but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. The tone remains declaratively optimistic throughout without tonal shift reflecting escalation or setback. It is a static mood marker rather than a dynamic tonal element that shapes the ending's emotional texture.</comment>
