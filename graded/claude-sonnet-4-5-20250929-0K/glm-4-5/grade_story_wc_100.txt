<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation ("to give rest a permanent address") is stated rather than embodied in early micro-choices, and his "inadvertently stubborn" trait functions as a label that narrates rather than constrains on-page decisions. The final transformation into library keeper arrives through external mechanics (lens assembly) rather than protagonist struggle with visible cost. Interiority remains abstract—"vibration…like distress signals echoing through time"—without the contradictory impulses or embodied emotion required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: the protagonist's name, occupation, and immediate situation are anchored quickly, but the inciting object (lighthouse lens) lacks concrete spatial grounding until after several paragraphs of reflection. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (density increase toward a final reconfiguration), but the closure—Elias becomes keeper, lens gives rest—occurs via assembly and manifestation rather than a choice or renunciation with on-page cost. The Conceptual Repricing is asserted ("giving rest a permanent address") but not felt; the final image is told, not shown through a decisive moment that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The underwater library's "impossible spaces" and architecture are visually striking but remain postcard description; the environment does not constrain Elias's movements or choices (airlock functions conveniently, no navigation obstacles). The lens fragments as objects shape the ending assembly, lifting the score moderately. Spatial choreography inside the library is vague—pedestal location, Elias's movements, and the manifestation of ethereal figures lack concrete staging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the lens's purpose—is signaled early but never narrowed by a reversal or deepening that forecloses an option. Elias follows coordinates, rents a submarine, and assembles the lens without resistance, tactical cost, or a moment where success is uncertain. The manifestation of souls and his transformation into keeper happen to him rather than through his agency, and no live cost (time, stamina, social credit) alters tactics along the way.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of "giving rest a permanent address," but the final paragraph explicitly states it ("The broken lens was doing what Elias did for the living dead") rather than earning it through image and action. The lighthouse lens as symbol is introduced with purpose, but its assembly does not reweight prior material—it simply fulfills a declared function. The ending offers a tidy conceptual closure without ambiguity or earned wisdom from Elias's specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature—"weary undertaker" filtering the world through mortality—is present but generic ("the weight of all the souls he'd committed to earth"). Diction occasionally elevates beyond the POV's plausible lexicon ("occupying impossible spaces that physics shouldn't allow" reads more like authorial explanation than Elias's perception). No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he understood") cluster in key beats without adding texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "giving rest a permanent address" is stated in paragraph 11, repeated in paragraph 26, and rephrased in the final line without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "No longer…Elias became," "The underwater city had found," "Every book, every soul, every lost thought now had" (three parallel summary statements). Stock metaphors—"chased stillness," "silver thoughts"—appear without fresh inflection. Figurative density in descriptive passages (rainbows, vibration, whispers, song) does not always advance story or character, particularly in the library discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—underwater library, broken lens restores its beacon—combines familiar quest and restoration tropes without a non-obvious synthesis or transformation. Elias's arc from weary undertaker to eternal keeper is signaled early and delivered without complication or fresh moral calculus. The "impossible spaces" and manifestation of ethereal scholars offer surface novelty but function as set dressing rather than stakes-altering world logic. The story reads as a competent execution of a template rather than a singular vision.</comment>
