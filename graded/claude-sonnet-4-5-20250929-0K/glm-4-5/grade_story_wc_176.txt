<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and coherent—guilt over forgotten names drives her pilgrimage—but her interior life reads as functional rather than contradictory. The "technically gentle" trait enables the rope-work but appears as a skill label without embodied cost or tradeoff on the page. Her final decision to become keeper arrives as fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses another path; the emotional arc is smooth and upward, lacking the genuine struggle or blind spot that would create inevitable mistakes under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a causal lens with escalation: Elara enters, matches the organ card pattern to the rope, reconfigures it, and the sanctum responds. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she commits to remain as keeper—but the cost is declared rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture or friction. Orientation is clean early (who, where, when by the second paragraph). The tightening from card-matching to illumination is legible, but the final choice feels preordained rather than earned by a prior constraint that forced a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is vividly anchored with aurora, ice stairway, and the glowing rope. Sensory detail—frigid air, frozen tears, aurora's shifting light—grounds the scene and modulates with urgency. The rope as a tool constrains Elara's action (she must separate threads without breaking them), reaching the micro-setting standard. However, the environment does not alter tactics or create a live obstacle; the sanctum cooperates once the pattern is matched, and the space functions more as a stage than a pressure source.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained. The rope-work provides a concrete task that tightens once (comparing card holes to braids, then reconfiguring), meeting the minimal escalation for this length. However, there is no on-page reversal or visible trade-off; the sanctum rewards her immediately without complication. The cost ("years of guilt" forgiven, deciding to stay) is told retrospectively rather than dramatized as a live choice that forecloses another option, weakening the pressure profile under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory, preservation, redemption—emerges from the premise and is reinforced by the rope-as-record and the organ card fragment. The ending offers a quiet answer (names preserved, Elara becomes keeper) but articulates it through near-explicit statement: "she had found a way to preserve those still within reach." The final paragraph's reflection ("her work was just beginning") reads as thematic summary rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal; guilt and forgiveness are named rather than embodied in contradictory action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("snowmelt ardor," "celestial glow"). Diction leans elevated ("transcribed memory," "ethereal blues") but remains coherent within the POV. The single line of dialogue ("The names must be preserved") is functional but does not advance subtext or reveal new facets of character. Under peak pressure—rope-work and illumination—syntax compresses appropriately, maintaining clarity and rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentences are grammatically clean, and word choice is controlled. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (e.g., "street organ punched card scrap" anchors both backstory and present tool). However, stock phrases appear repeatedly: "snowmelt ardor" (twice), "technically gentle" (twice), "forgotten names" and variants (five times). Template cadence emerges in the final third with parallel "she had done it / she would stay / she knew" constructions. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but figurative language ("aurora painting," "shimmering column of living energy") tilts toward decorative in high-pressure beats without adding causal clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The core premise—transcribing memory via ceremonial rope under aurora—synthesizes fantasy elements in a fresh frame. However, the emotional arc (guilt → pilgrimage → redemption → vocation) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived contradiction or a non-obvious moral calculus. The organ card as key is evocative but underused; its holes map to the rope without complication, and no false attempt or misreading generates friction. The ending grants Elara her goal without a visible trade-off or renunciation, defaulting to safe wish-fulfillment rather than a bold stance that accepts cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her profession (lost wax caster) primes the "technically gentle" skill, but the casting itself does not shape a beat. Her key choice—reconfiguring the rope—alters the situation, but the decision to stay as keeper is told retrospectively without a live moment where she weighs leaving versus staying. Present in setup and ending, functional in one beat (rope-work), but swappable with "artisan" or "weaver" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The organ card appears early (pocket possession, paragraph 4) and is used twice: once as memory anchor and again as pattern-key when compared to the rope. At closure, new patterns form on the card, reweighting it from static relic to active tool. Setup, development (guides rope-work), and payoff (evolves at end) are all present. However, its properties are told rather than tested; no failed attempt or alternate interpretation complicates the match, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" frames the premise and is literalized when names crystallize in light and are "etched in the ice." It shapes the dominant stake and the rope-work method. Present in setup (paragraph 5), drives the middle action (matching pattern to preserve names), and is fulfilled at closure (names transcribed, Elara becomes keeper). However, the concept operates as goal rather than constraint; no cost or trade-off specific to transcription itself (e.g., losing her own memories, erasing recent names to preserve old) appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is introduced in paragraph 7 and repeated in paragraph 12 during the rope-work. It enables the action (separating threads without breaking them) but is presented as a skill label without visible friction or price. No moment shows her gentleness costing time, causing hesitation, or requiring a trade-off against speed or force. Present in setup and one beat, but closer to ornamental competence than a trait that constrains choice or charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is signaled in paragraph 6 (legends of the rope), enacted in paragraphs 15–16 (sanctum begins to glow, light streams, aurora descends), and directly produces the climax (names crystallize in light). The illumination is causal—rope reconfiguration triggers it—and is indispensable to the closure (names preserved, Elara's purpose fulfilled). Present in setup, development (light channels in ice), and payoff (names made visible). Removing "illuminate" would require a different mechanism for transcription, confirming high integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method is introduced in paragraph 6 (legends of the ceremonial rope), used in paragraphs 12–14 (Elara separates and rebraids threads guided by the card pattern), and its success triggers the illumination at closure. Setup, development (the rope-work itself), and payoff (sanctum responds) are all present. The mechanics matter on the page: matching holes to braids, separating threads without breaking them. However, no failed attempt or alternate configuration is tested, and the rope succeeds on first try, limiting the causal pressure the method exerts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is anchored early (paragraph 1) with vivid sensory detail (aurora, frozen walls, ice stairway) and houses the rope and basin. It provides the physical space for the rope-work and the climax. However, the sanctum does not constrain tactics or supply a resource Elara must work around; it cooperates passively once she acts. Present in setup, continuous through development, and integral to the ending (light streams through ice channels), but functions more as backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" is mentioned in paragraph 2 (backstory: "since the day she finally forgave herself") and echoed in paragraph 22 ("After years of guilt, after finally forgiving herself"). The timeframe establishes Elara's readiness to act but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no clock or urgency tied to "after forgiveness" shapes the rope-work or the ending. Present in setup and thematic closure, but closer to label-only context than a constraint that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in paragraph 2 ("driven by a purpose… names she'd let slip into silence"), visualized in paragraph 4 (organ card scrap with ancestor names), and dramatized in the rope-work (paragraphs 12–17) where she acts to preserve names. At closure, her purpose is fulfilled (names transcribed) and extended (she will stay as keeper). Setup, development (action pursuit), and payoff are all present. However, friction between want and cost is minimal; the sanctum grants her wish without requiring her to sacrifice another value or path on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears twice (paragraphs 3 and 19) as a phrase describing Elara's "quiet passion." The tone is lyric and reverent throughout, coherent across beats. However, the phrase itself functions as a label rather than a modulating quality that charges the final image; the tone does not shift under pressure or deepen through contradiction. Present in setup and echoed at closure, but closer to atmospheric descriptor than a tonal force that reweights the ending.</comment>
