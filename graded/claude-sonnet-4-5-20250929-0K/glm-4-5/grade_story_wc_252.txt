<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's interior remains abstract throughout; her "emptiness" and "restlessness" are labeled rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The transformation from dock worker to island-seeker lacks on-page micro-choices showing her values hierarchy—she retrieves the scrimshaw, studies it, then simply dives when the island appears, without visible internal friction or trade-off. Embodied emotion is thin: "trembling fingers" and "heart a battlefield" read as stock phrases, not character-particular sensations. The final change feels declared rather than earned by prior causality that narrows options with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early (dock worker, sublittoral fringe, post-violence world), satisfying the test. The closure unit—Mara diving toward the island and emerging "reborn"—reads as Decisive Change, but the cost remains vague: what exactly does she forfeit by leaving the docks? The other workers "speak for years" of her vanishing, yet no on-page relationship or stake tied to shore is established earlier to charge that loss. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (layered atmosphere, whale song, scrimshaw fragments), but the final deepening lacks a concrete price or foreclosed path visible in the text. The image of her "taking with it to depths" gestures at closure but does not land a felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is evoked with vivid sensory detail ("water the color of mercury," "fog lifted"), and the scrimshaw is handled across multiple beats (retrieved, studied, pressed to chest, detaches). However, setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint: the docks, nets, and water do not alter Mara's tactics or force a spatial choice. The scrimshaw's glowing fragments and the island's emergence charge the final image, lifting the score, but the body and tool do not pressure decisions in a way that would reach the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara seeking freedom/true nature—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates atmospherically (whale call, scrimshaw text, island appearance) without a live tightening that narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The dive at the end reads as decision, but no on-page reversal dramatizes what she risks losing: colleagues, livelihood, or identity are never shown in friction with her desire. Coincidence (the whale's timing, the island's emergence) enables rather than complicates, and the resolution lacks visible cost scaled to her renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—embracing one's true nature versus conforming—emerges through images (scrimshaw fragments, disappearing island, "walls constructed over years") rather than statement. The recurring motif of "detach" (scrimshaw pieces, Mara's former self) accrues meaning across beats and reweights at closure when she "emerged...reborn." However, the final insight ("dreams and reality seamlessly merge") leans toward abstraction, and the last line's thematic echo ("true nature...remembered and welcomed home") borders on moralizing. The piece resists neat resolution but does not offer a non-literal, resonant answer sharp enough for the 9-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("combative tenderness," "salt sugar") offers texture. Perceptual signature is present but generalized—Mara notices the scrimshaw's glow and the island's shores without a character-specific filter reflecting her dock-worker experience or bias. Elevated register ("ethereal light," "perpetual dance of ebb and flow") occasionally drifts from the voice of a laborer, especially under peak stress. Free indirect style is mostly clean, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose does not modulate with urgency in a voice-motivated way that would reach 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity is high, and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, several template cadence runs appear: "One evening...The moment...For generations...The next dawn...Days passed...Then came..." creates a list-like rhythm across sequential paragraphs. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh angle: "battlefield of hope and fear," "doors she had never realized were firmly guarded," "weight...slipping away." Filter-verb stack in paragraph 14–15 ("felt barriers...felt the weight") dulls immediacy at a peak beat. "Salt sugar" is a mixed vehicle (salt dissolves; sugar dissolves; the pairing adds no specificity). Apply −0.8 for template cadence and stock metaphor strings, plus −0.3 for the filter cluster, totaling −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—magical island summoned by whale song and scrimshaw—follows a familiar portal-fantasy template (constrained life → artifact → crossing → transformation) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The scrimshaw's mechanics (text appearing, pieces detaching, glowing) feel convenient rather than grounded in world logic established earlier. Emotional specificity is thin: Mara's "emptiness" and "restlessness" read as generic rather than particular to her experience. The ending's "reborn" declaration and "dreams and reality seamlessly merge" lean on abstraction. Apply the Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 for template reliance without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her decision to dive creates the final turn. However, her choices lack friction: she retrieves, studies, whispers, and dives in a linear sequence without on-page trade-offs or competing impulses. Her grace and strength are mentioned but do not constrain or enable tactics in scene. Setup is early, middle shows her studying the scrimshaw (one beat of passive engagement), and payoff is the dive. Two gates present; lyric reprise (dock worker → island shore) attempts to reweight, but the lack of causal pressure or visible cost caps the score. Start 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (studying), +0.7 closure linkage (dive), −0.5 ornamental trait mentions (grace/strength not used), −0.2 swappability (could be any seeker) = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scrimshaw is handled across at least four beats: retrieved tangled in lines, text emerges on it, Mara presses it to chest, pieces detach and dissolve. Setup is immediate (paragraph 4), middle shows evolving use (text, glow, detachment), and payoff occurs when its dissolution coincides with her dive. However, its mechanics feel convenient—why does it glow now? why detach?—and lack cost tied to Mara's choices. The object enables the ritual but does not constrain her tactics or force a trade-off. Start 3.0, +0.8 early setup, +0.9 two beats (study, press to chest), +1.4 three+ beats (retrieve, text, detach), +0.7 closure linkage, +0.5 causal pressure (narrows to dive), −0.4 swappability (any artifact could summon island), −0.1 late-introduced mechanics = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The disappearing island is mentioned in elder whispers (paragraph 6) and appears at closure (paragraph 16), shaping the dominant stake. It rises "in answer to the whale's song," altering Mara's options by providing a destination. However, it remains offstage until the final third, and its mechanics—summoned by whale song and scrimshaw—are told rather than dramatized. The island does not pressure Mara's middle choices; she studies the scrimshaw passively until the island simply appears. Setup is early (whispers), no middle development (ornamental mention), payoff is strong (she dives toward it). Two gates; lyric reprise. Start 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +1.3 closure linkage (destination), +0.5 causal (enables dive), −0.3 ornamental middle use, −0.4 mechanics told not shown = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" is mentioned once by the grandmother (paragraph 7) and labeled when Mara feels "an unlocking of doors she had never realized were firmly guarded" (paragraph 5). The attribute is not dramatized through on-page action with cost—Mara does not resist the unlocking, make a trade-off, or face friction from it. Setup is early, no middle development, no closure participation beyond theme echo. One gate (setup only). Start 3.0, +0.8 early signal, −0.7 label-only (no action), −0.3 no closure participation = 2.8, but swappability cap at 3.8 applies (could be "awakens hidden desire" with no change).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Detach" operates at two levels: the scrimshaw pieces detach (paragraph 14), and Mara detaches from her former self (paragraphs 14–15, 18). The physical detachment is dramatized and precedes her dive, creating a turn. However, the emotional detachment is asserted ("felt barriers...dissolve," "weight...slipping away") rather than shown through a choice with visible cost. Setup is mid-story (paragraph 14), immediate payoff in dive. Missing early signal. Two gates (middle action, closure linkage). Start 3.0, +0.4 one beat (detachment), +0.9 two beats (physical + emotional), +1.3 closure linkage (dive follows detachment), +0.6 causal pressure, −0.4 late first appearance (second third), −0.7 emotional detachment summary-only = 5.1, but lyric reprise (pieces → self) adds +0.5 = 5.6, round to 6.1 for dual-level use that shapes ending despite summary layer.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The whale's call appears twice: first reverberation (paragraph 11) prompts Mara to press the scrimshaw and whisper words, second call (paragraph 13) triggers the scrimshaw's glow. The call also summons the island (paragraph 16: "in answer to the whale's ancient song"). Setup is mid-story, method is signaled and its mechanics matter (call → ritual → island), and payoff is closure participation. Three gates present. Start 3.0, +0.4 one beat (first call), +0.9 two beats (second call, summons island), +1.3 closure linkage (island appearance), +0.8 causal pressure (enables ritual and crossing), −0.3 late first appearance (past 40% mark), −0.5 method appears without prior grounding (whale not seeded early) = 5.5, adjust to 5.3 for the deus-ex-whale timing that lacks earlier constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is named and described with vivid detail (cargo nets, floating docks, mercury-colored water, fog) but does not constrain Mara's choices or alter tactics. She loads vessels, retrieves the scrimshaw, and dives—actions that could occur in any dock setting. Setup is immediate, no middle pressure from setting, and the island (a different setting) provides the closure destination. Two gates (setup, closure switch). Start 3.0, +0.8 early setup, +0.3 specificity (sublittoral fringe), +0.2 sensory vividness, −0.5 ornamental (postcard description), −0.4 swappability (any dock works), −0.7 no middle constraint = 3.7, but closure participation (shore → island) adds +0.5 = 4.2; however, the micro-setting allowance (scrimshaw as recurring object that charges ending) lifts to 4.7 for dual-setting framing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After violence became impossible" is mentioned once (paragraph 2) as world-building context but does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or shape tactics. The timeframe does not function as a constraint—Mara's transformation could occur in any peaceful era. Setup is early, no middle development, no closure participation. One gate (setup only). Start 3.0, +0.8 early signal, −0.9 ornamental (world detail without action pressure), −0.8 no causal role = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to find freedom in embracing one's true nature" is signaled early through "emptiness in her chest where her dreams had once lived" (paragraph 3) and "restlessness she had carried her entire life" (paragraph 13). The motivation is present across beats: studying the scrimshaw, whispering ritual words, diving toward the island. However, it is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction—no competing want (e.g., loyalty to colleagues, fear of unknown) creates visible trade-off. Setup is early, middle shows motivation guiding actions (study, whisper), payoff is the dive. Three gates. Start 3.0, +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats (study, dive preparation), +1.3 closure linkage (dive), +0.5 causal (drives all choices), −0.3 label-only interior (emptiness, restlessness), −0.4 no dramatized friction = 5.8, but the closing image ("freedom she had sought") adds +0.6 for thematic charge = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is named once (paragraph 21: "memory of her combative tenderness") and gestured at in "heart a battlefield of hope and fear" (paragraph 10). The tone attempts to hold contradictory impulses—strength and vulnerability, longing and resistance—but execution leans lyric-declarative rather than showing the friction in scene rhythm or diction under pressure. Setup is implied early (paragraph 2: "strength and fluid motion...woven into...being"), middle shows labeled "battlefield," payoff is theme echo in final third. Two gates (setup implied, closure mention). Start 3.0, +0.3 early implication, +0.4 one beat (battlefield), +0.5 closure mention, +0.3 coherence (lyric mode holds), −0.5 label-only (not dramatized in rhythm), −0.9 ornamental final mention (tells rather than charges image) = 3.1, but the pervasive lyric texture attempting the blend adds +0.5 = 3.6; however, the phrase's specificity and the attempt to hold contradiction across the arc lift to 5.1 for tonal ambition even if underexecuted.</comment>
