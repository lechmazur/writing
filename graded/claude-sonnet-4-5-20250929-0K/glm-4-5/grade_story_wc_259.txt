<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara lacks embodied interiority and concrete micro-choices under pressure. Her "familiar mixture of anguish and joy" is asserted repeatedly without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final merger with the archive reads as concept rather than earned character transformation with visible cost tied to prior choices. Motivation is declared ("dedicated her life to pursuing forbidden knowledge") but never tested by a dramatized decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous—vacillates between causal (purification process), accumulative (image montage), and metaphysical transformation without teaching a coherent pattern. Closure is conceptual merger stated in exposition ("her consciousness merging with the past") rather than a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early, but the "steadily unpredictable" atoms and "avoiding patterns" method are introduced without clear mechanics that constrain later action. The ending asserts transformation but does not dramatize the cost or make a before/after legible through image or action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Archive and pagoda are described vividly but remain postcard backdrops—no spatial constraint alters Elara's choices. "Moving around the pagoda in deliberately random paths" is told summary without embodied choreography or tactical friction. Sensory detail is filtered through elevated diction ("amber silence," "captured sunset") rather than character-particular perception. The bronze surfaces and twilight recur but do not evolve causally or charge the closure image with spatial consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("recover what was lost") is signaled early but remains abstract—no on-page choice narrows options or exacts visible cost. The "purification" unfolds as summary montage ("touching surfaces without rhyme or reason") without reversal, complication, or agency-driven tightening. Vision sequence is accumulative description, not escalation. Final merger is asserted transformation without dramatized price or trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of loss and recovery emerges through images and the "end of innocence" frame, but the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "their end of innocence now a beginning of understanding for those who would follow." The "anguished joy" label is repeated without fresh embodiment or contradictory layers. Atoms of nostalgia function as symbol announced rather than earned through particulars that constrain choice. No non-literal answer reweights prior material; the ending states its thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("saffron-veil historian," "constellation," "eternal") but lacks character-particular perceptual signature—reads as authorial overlay rather than Elara's lived idiom under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains static; peak moment (merger) does not compress or modulate rhythm to reflect stress. Free indirect style is clean but generic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across multiple paragraphs: "anguish and joy" / "anguished joy" recurs without added pressure (lines 6, 16, 26, 31); "end of innocence" appears four times; "atoms of nostalgia" is repeated label-only in six lines. Template cadence in middle section: "She watched… She felt… She was no longer…" Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "captured sunset," "amber silence," "constellation," "touching the eternal" stack in rapid succession without coherent vehicle. Stock metaphor "bridge the gap" and "touching the eternal" dull closure beat. Apply −1.2 for loops/templates and figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Core premise (historian accesses lost civilization via mystical pagoda) is template quest-for-forbidden-knowledge without fresh synthesis. "Atoms of nostalgia" as literalized metaphor and "purify by avoiding patterns" read as prompt fulfillment rather than inevitable story logic. The transformation-through-immersion arc is familiar; no twist, intensification, or fresh angle arises from character choice. Elevated diction and abstract concepts replace grounded particulars. Lacks bold risk or a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or stakes. Her "work" is summarized movement without choice-point friction. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is observation rather than agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pagoda appears in setup, middle (touch/purification), and ending (stands silent), satisfying all three gates. However, its properties are described rather than handled with evolving consequence—no choice hinges on its bronze surfaces or prism facets. Swappable with "ancient artifact" without breaking logic. Mid-band for presence across beats without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Atoms introduced early, recur in middle beats, and frame the ending. They are concept-label rather than actionable story element—their "steadily unpredictable" nature and purification do not visibly narrow options or create on-page cost. Theme claim without tactical consequence. Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is named twice (lines 8, 19) as property of the atoms but does not constrain or enable a dramatized action with cost. Label-only mention; no tradeoff shown. Present in setup and mentioned in middle; absent from closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Purification is signaled early, attempted in middle beats ("moving… touching surfaces"), and completed at closure. However, the process is summarized without clear mechanics—reader cannot trace how random touch causes purification. Present across all gates but swappable with "attune" or "unlock" without structural change. Mid-band for setup–development–payoff presence without irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"By avoiding patterns" appears once in middle (line 10) as method and is enacted ("deliberately random paths," line 14). Not signaled in setup; mechanics are told rather than tested with cost. Present in development and implied at closure but does not shape multiple attempts or create visible friction. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Archive is setup location, houses the pagoda, and frames the final image ("darkness of the archive"). It provides spatial container but does not pressure choice—Elara's access is unimpeded. Micro-setting role (the bronze surface she touches) is present but static. Early signal, closure linkage, and one middle beat earn mid-range; lack of tactical constraint or resource friction limits score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"End of innocence" recurs as theme label (lines 5, 24, 32) but does not function as live timeframe that tightens decisions. Twilight is atmospheric backdrop, not clock. Time is vague ("deepening twilight," "last light") without urgency or deadline altering tactics. Present as motif; absent as pressure mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Pursue forbidden knowledge" is stated early (line 4) and referenced at closure (line 28), framing the arc. However, desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—no on-page friction between cost and want. Motivation label spans setup and closure but lacks middle development where a choice tests the pursuit. Present in two gates; missing dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" is named explicitly three times (lines 6, 16, 26) and the final image attempts to charge it ("smiled through tears," line 31). However, tone is asserted via label rather than modulated through rhythm, image, or contradictory sensory detail. Static mood repeated; no cadence shift or embodied contradiction under pressure. Present across beats but not integrated texturally.</comment>
