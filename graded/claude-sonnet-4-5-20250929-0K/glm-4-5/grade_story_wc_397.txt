<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to "learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated but never dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. The transformation from death-seeker to life-affirmer occurs through summary ("she understood") rather than embodied contradiction or decision with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("gripped reality loosely," "fold in patience") without character-particular texture. The parasol tip is handled repeatedly but never constrains a choice or reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story opens with disorienting abstraction ("waking up changed") that remains unexplained past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. No causal linkage connects Elena's volunteering to her internal shift; the ending epiphany ("change doesn't always mean loss") arrives via assertion rather than earned pressure. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual only—no on-page forfeiture or tactical narrowing makes the transformation legible. Drive lens appears Accumulative but the final cadence shift lacks concrete constraint or price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered ("jagged sheets of frozen water that cracked and moaned") and returns at closure to anchor the transformation metaphor. However, the setting never constrains a tactical choice—Elena stands, watches, and reflects without the environment altering her options. The parasol tip and thermos are handled but remain postcard props. Spatial choreography is clear and the ice-melting image charges the final beat, meeting the micro-setting allowance but not the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elena's confrontation with mortality—is signaled early but never tested on the page. She arrives seeking death, volunteers without friction, and discovers hope via summary realization rather than a pressure-driven trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Marcus's dialogue and the ice imagery add texture but no escalation. The ending reconfigures her stance but the cost is asserted ("acceptance") rather than dramatized through forfeiture or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The transformation theme (endings as beginnings) is coherent and the ice-melting metaphor recurs with shifted weight at closure. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly ("change doesn't always mean loss," "beautiful transformations") instead of trusting the image to carry resonance. The parasol tip functions as a token bridge-symbol rather than a particular that constrains choice. Subtext is minimal; epiphanies are stated rather than earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable but the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—diction could belong to any reflective tourist. Dialogue between Elena and Marcus is functional but carries no subtext or goal pursuit; lines explain theme rather than advancing pressure. Filter verbs ("she found herself," "she understood") dull immediacy at peak beats. The prose shifts into elevated register ("windborne solace," "fold in patience") that reads decorative rather than character-particular under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "ending"/"beginnings" churn across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure, and the parasol tip is described identically in multiple beats. Template cadence ("She [verb]," "Elena [verb]") runs for six consecutive sentences mid-story. Stock metaphors ("precious stone," "bridge to the future") replace concrete action. The final paragraph stacks three summarizing epiphanies that restate the same realization, triggering −0.8 for loops and −0.4 for scaffold. Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The euthanasia-tourist-finds-hope premise follows a recognizable redemption template without fresh synthesis. "Grips reality loosely" and "fold in patience" read as abstract prompt labels rather than lived detail. The parasol tip and drift-ice marina are vivid but their combination feels checklist-driven rather than inevitable. Marcus exists solely to voice theme. The ending's peaceful acceptance avoids risk by delivering the expected tidy transformation without moral ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elena appears throughout but her "euthanasia tourist" identity shapes no on-page choice—she volunteers, reflects, and decides to stay without the tourist frame altering tactics or cost. Present in setup and closure but swappable with "grief traveler" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The parasol tip appears in four beats (pocket, tracing, sunset, final placement) but remains decorative. It never constrains a decision or enables a tactic; each mention repeats its symbolic function (grandmother's grace, bridge to future) without causal work. Early seed and closure reprise qualify it for mid-band but lack of pressure caps it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Fold in patience" appears once via Marcus's dialogue and is echoed thematically in the final third but never shapes an on-page action or narrows Elena's options. Label-only; could be cut without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated in the opening line and claimed as a gift in paragraph 23 but never dramatized—no scene shows her perceiving differently or making a choice enabled by this trait. Summary-only, no visible cost or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Trawl" appears literally (nets from water) and metaphorically (trawling memories) but the action does not drive any turn. Elena's transformation occurs via reflection, not trawling. The verb could swap with "search" or "sift" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is present in setup (Marcus, nets, thermos) and mentioned at closure but the mechanics never matter—Elena's shift comes from standing and thinking, not from the work itself. The method frames the setting but does not enable or constrain her final choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina anchors every scene, supplies the central ice-melting metaphor, and charges the final image with seasonal pressure ("breaking up earlier this year"). However, the setting does not alter Elena's tactical options—she could reflect anywhere. Strong atmosphere and closure linkage but no causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" opens the story but the timeframe remains vague—days pass but no clock tightens decisions. The phrase signals transformation but does not function as a pressure element; it could be "after arriving" without loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated explicitly in paragraph 6 and echoed at closure, but never tested by conflicting wants or costs. Elena observes, then decides to stay; no friction between the goal and a competing desire. Present in setup and ending but told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" appears in three beats (paragraphs 7, 16, 35) and anchors the tonal shift from dread to peace. The tone modulates coherently through the arc and charges the ending image, but the phrase itself reads decorative—removing "windborne" would not alter the emotional trajectory. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but replaceable diction.</comment>
