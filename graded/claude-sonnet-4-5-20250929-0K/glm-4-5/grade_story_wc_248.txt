<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to "rescue a forgotten promise" arrives as abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction. The arsonist backstory is told in a single expository line without dramatized guilt shaping present micro-choices. Internal conflict remains summarized ("her arsonist's mind understanding the urge") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final portrait revelation feels unearned—no prior scene work dramatizes her self-recognition with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words; "Archive of Aeridor" and "off-grid" function as labels without spatial grounding. The closure—Maya seeing her own face in the restored portrait—arrives via summary ("Years passed, and Maya's library grew") rather than on-page dramatization with felt cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the redemption arc is asserted, not charged. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence at closure makes the price of transformation legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The archive remains a generic "dusty halls" placeholder without spatial choreography or sensory hierarchy. The tapestry fragment is handled across multiple beats and returns at closure, constraining the final choice to weave it into the entrance—this micro-object work lifts the score above pure ornament. However, the underground sanctuary and lending library lack tactile grounding; no tools, access constraints, or environmental pressure shapes Maya's restoration work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redeeming her arsonist past—is declared but never tested on the page with a live choice between competing goods. "Weeks" of following the trail compresses all escalation into summary. The portrait restoration, the story's only concrete action, lacks visible tradeoffs or a moment where Maya must forfeit something to proceed. Agency reads as passive discovery rather than decision under pressure; coincidence (finding the complete tapestry) resolves without protagonist cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The phrase "volcanic tenderness" recurs as a label without dramatized embodiment; its meaning remains static. "Fire destroys, but art preserves" is stated by the hidden message rather than earned through scene particulars. The final paragraph moralizing ("even those who have destroyed can learn to create anew") replaces resonance with thesis statement, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The tapestry motif is present across beats but does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure—it functions as symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic: Maya's "analytically intuitive" lens does not color her noticing in character-specific ways. Diction remains mid-register throughout without modulation under stress. The dialogue snippet ("Who would destroy their own image?") and ("I will protect the stories") read as thematic placeholders rather than goal-driven speech. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she wondered") stack without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "faded tapestry fragment" appears six times with minimal variation; "volcanic tenderness" recurs identically in three beats. Template cadence: "Maya's [noun] [verb]" opens five sentences within three paragraphs. Synonym churn: "dusty halls echoing," "underground sanctuary," "vast archive" restate setting without added detail. The closure paragraph contains two adjacent sentences restating the same redemption theme. Stock metaphors ("bridge between destruction and renewal") in the final third disallow 9+ globally and trigger cumulative artifact penalties totaling −1.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The redemptive-arsonist-as-archivist premise closely tracks a familiar template: destruction → guilt → off-grid quest → symbolic restoration → underground sanctuary. The self-portrait twist (curator's face becomes Maya's) is foreshadowed only by summary rather than scene clues. No bold structural or perspectival risks; the piece chooses the safety middle at every turn. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: the core arc is not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus, triggering −0.8 in Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She follows a trail, discovers clues, and restores a portrait—all passive reception. The decision to build a library is summarized in the final third rather than dramatized with competing options. Late closure participation without middle development; swappable with a generic seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in the opening beat, is traced and referenced across the middle ("her only connection," "complete tapestry as her guide"), and is woven into the library entrance at closure. Three-gate presence with causal pressure: it frames the quest and returns with reweighted meaning as a "bridge between destruction and renewal." However, the fragment does not narrow options or impose a trade-off; it functions more as talisman than constraint, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is discovered early and drives the middle restoration action. Its reveal (Maya's face) shapes the closure image. However, it does not constrain tactics—Maya restores it without on-page difficulty or resource cost. The concept is present and functional but swappable with any symbolic mirror/artifact without altering story logic. Two gates met (setup, payoff); missing middle cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is labeled twice ("a trait that had once made her an exceptional librarian," "Maya's analytical intuition kicked in") but never enacted. No on-page scene shows her noticing a pattern others miss or making a trade-off between analysis and intuition. The trait could be removed without altering any action. Ornamental use; no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Portray" appears as "self-portrait" and "artistic creations—paintings, sculptures, etchings." The curator's trail of art drives the middle quest, but Maya's own act of portraying (sketching replicas) is mentioned in summary without scene weight. The action is functional but does not redefine options at closure; the library-building could proceed without the sketching. Missing closure participation; swappable with "discover" or "interpret."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations is signaled early, shapes the middle quest ("each piece containing subtle clues leading to the next"), and culminates in the complete tapestry's hidden message. However, the mechanics remain vague—no on-page puzzle-solving or failed attempts. The method enables the plot but does not constrain choices or impose visible cost. Two gates met (setup, payoff); functional but replaceable with any treasure-hunt device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "Archive of Aeridor" and "lost civilization" frame the setting and provide the curator's trail. The archive becomes Maya's sanctuary and the site of her library. However, spatial choreography is absent—no rooms, access constraints, or environmental pressure shapes her choices. The setting is present across beats and at closure but functions as backdrop rather than crucible. Two gates met; missing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After going off-grid" anchors the timeframe in the opening, and "five years ago" establishes backstory distance. However, the present action unfolds in vague duration ("For weeks," "Years passed") without a live clock that tightens decisions. The timeframe is present but ornamental; removing it would not alter any on-page choice. Setup only; no development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The forgotten promise ("I will protect the stories") is seeded early in flashback and returns at closure as Maya's guiding motivation. It drives her decision to build the library and charges the final image of the tapestry entrance. However, the promise is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows Maya torn between protecting stories and a competing want. Lyric reprise with closure linkage; missing middle friction and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is labeled three times but never embodied in action or perception. The phrase appears identically in beats describing intensity softening, but the prose remains at mid-register throughout without modulation. Tone is declared rather than demonstrated; no sentence-level rhythm or diction shift charges the emotional peaks. Present but static; ornamental use without causal function.</comment>
