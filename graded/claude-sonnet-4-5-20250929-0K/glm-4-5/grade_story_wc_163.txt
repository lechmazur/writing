<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation for belonging is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "softly ingenious mind" is a label applied repeatedly without showing her making a single difficult trade-off or mistake under pressure. The final transformation—tears, understanding, connection—arrives as an unearned epiphany; no prior choice forecloses a path or reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by ~120 words, waiving that penalty. However, the plot follows an and-then structure: Maya descends, finds a feather, follows it, discovers creatures, watches them form a constellation, then ascends with a transformed feather. No meaningful reversal tightens options; the feather's pull is convenient rather than earned, and the transformation at sunrise solves a problem the feather did not help create. The closure lacks visible cost—Maya gains a map and understanding without forfeiting anything on the page. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The underwater research facility is vividly described (flooded corridors, reinforced glass, collapsed dome, filtered moonlight), and spatial choreography remains clear. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a single choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The feather's pull guides Maya through the facility without friction, and the dome's partial collapse conveniently allows moonlight exactly when needed. Micro-setting (the glass barrier) appears in the gesture of pressing her palm, but does not charge the closure with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Maya encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and the creatures respond to her presence without friction. The feather's transformation and the creatures' constellation display resolve the quest without a single choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Escalation is absent; the journey is a passive unfolding rather than a tightening under pressure. The final map is a reward, not an earned consequence of prior agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of belonging emerges through images (bioluminescent creatures, constellation patterns, cosmic connection), but the ending states rather than dramatizes the insight: "belonging not as a destination, but as the eternal dance of connection." The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("profound simplicity of belonging," "eternal dance") instead of allowing the image to resonate. The burnt feather's glow-map transformation is convenient symbolism rather than a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material. No counter-reading or meaningful ambiguity remains.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and maintains stable third-person limited focalization. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstracted register that clashes with the immediacy of underwater exploration: "shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite," "softly ingenious nature" appear as labels rather than Maya's specific idiom. Filter verbs ("watched in wonder," "felt an overwhelming connection") dull immediacy in peak beats. No dialogue is present to judge. The perceptual signature remains generic; Maya's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or selection under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "shadowseam wonder" appears twice; "softly ingenious" recurs as a label three times; "belonging" is restated across adjacent lines in the final paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "In what must have been... / As midnight approached... / Here, suspended..." Stock metaphors ("living stars," "cosmic dance") appear without transformation. The final two paragraphs rephrase the same thematic claim four times. Figurative density in high-pressure beats ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite") obscures concrete perception. Apply −1.2 for loops/scaffold and −0.4 for stock phrasing touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—underwater research facility revealing cosmic connection—is a familiar template (hidden place, mystical discovery, belonging quest). The landscape astrologer occupation adds surface novelty but does not transform the arc; the same plot works unchanged with "marine biologist" or "astronomer." The burnt feather's glow-map transformation is convenient symbolism rather than an organic surprise. No bold structural risk or specific, non-obvious synthesis elevates the material. The ending's "eternal dance of connection" is a generic abstraction that could apply to countless discovery narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout but makes no consequential choices. She descends, follows the feather's pull passively, watches the creatures, and ascends. Observation without decision. Her "softly ingenious mind" catalogs the layout but does not enable a tactic or force a trade-off. Setup present; middle beat is passive observation; closure participation is reception rather than agency. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development. Subtract −0.8 for swappability (any explorer works) and −0.6 for ornamental use (label-only trait).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The burnt feather appears in three beats: discovery on the desk (beat 1), pressed against glass during the creature display (beat 2), transformed into a map at sunrise (beat 3). Setup clear; middle beat is static (pressed, no action); closure participation is transformation. The feather's blue glow is described but does not constrain a choice or narrow options. Its "subtle pull" guides Maya without friction. Lyric reprise (blue glow → map) reweights meaning but lacks visible cost. Three beats +1.4; closure linkage +0.7; swappability −0.8 (any mystical object works); ornamental in middle −0.5. Base ~3.0 + positives 2.1 − frictions 1.3 = 3.8, but round to observed integration at 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Luminous respite" appears as a label in one sentence: "The luminous respite of this moment washed over her..." It does not shape stakes or alter tactics; it is thematic echo, not causal pressure. No setup, no middle development, closure participation is label-only mention. Missing all three gates. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation. Subtract −0.3 for label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Softly ingenious" is applied as a label four times: "Her softly ingenious mind immediately began cataloging," "Her softly ingenious nature kicked in once more," "softly ingenious patterns," "the softly ingenious rhythm of all living things." No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait with visible cost. Maya's cataloging and glove-removal are unimpeded. Label-only, no setup in action, no middle constraint, closure is generic rhythmic claim. Missing all three gates. Cap 2.8. Subtract −0.3 for label-only use, cumulative across four instances = −0.6, but cap text-pattern at −1.0 per element. Base 3.0 − 0.4 label churn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Captivate" appears twice: the feather "captivated her instantly" (beat 1) and Maya "had been changed forever, captivated not just by the discovery" (ending). Setup present; the feather's captivation drives the search (middle beat), but the creature display and final transformation do not trace to captivation—they arrive through passive observation. Swappable with "drawn," "compelled," "entranced." Two beats +0.9; early signal +0.3; swappability −0.8; ornamental closure mention −0.5. Base ~3.0 + 1.2 − 1.3 = 2.9, but observed integration ~4.7 for two-beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer's underwater equivalent" appears in one sentence as Maya watches the creatures awaken. Setup absent (no priming of this method); middle beat is the single use; closure absent. The "shared exhale" is observation, not a method that shapes attempts or alters tactics. It is a simile for the creature display, not a dramatized action with mechanics. Missing setup and closure gates. Cap 4.6 for missing setup. Ornamental use −0.5; summary-only (told, not shown as method) −0.4. Base ~3.0 + middle mention 0.4 − 0.9 = 2.5, but lenient read for one functional beat ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater research facility is established in the opening, explored through flooded corridors and laboratories (middle beats), and the central dome with collapsed roof is the closure location. Setup clear +0.8; three distinct beats (corridor, laboratories, dome) +1.4; closure linkage (dome provides moonlight and creature display) +1.0. However, the facility does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is backdrop. The collapsed roof conveniently allows moonlight without friction. Causal pressure absent −0.8. Base ~3.0 + 3.2 − 0.8 = 5.4, round to 6.2 for strong spatial presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is signaled in the title beat and closure: "She remained in the dome until the first rays of sunlight penetrated the water" and "she had witnessed until sunrise." Setup present (twilight descent); closure present (sunrise ascent). Middle tracking is vague: "As midnight approached" is mentioned once, but no ticking clock tightens decisions. The timeframe spans ~12 hours without tactical pressure. Two gates (setup, closure) allow ≤6.0; lyric reprise could reach ~6.3. However, time does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics. Ornamental −0.5; no middle tightening −0.6. Base ~3.0 + setup 0.5 + closure 0.7 − 1.1 = 3.1, lenient to 4.3 for two-gate presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of belonging" is stated in the opening: "something had drawn her to this submerged place, whispering that here she might finally learn the rhythm of belonging her soul craved." It recurs thematically at closure: "recognizing one's place in the infinite pattern of existence," "belonging not as a destination." Setup clear +0.8; closure linkage +1.0. However, the desire is never dramatized in a conflicted choice. Maya encounters no friction between belonging and another want or cost. The motivation is told, not tested. Two gates allow ≤6.0. Ornamental (no friction) −0.8; summary-only −0.4. Base ~3.0 + 1.8 − 1.2 = 3.6, lenient to 4.9 for thematic presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Shadowseam wonder" appears in beat 2 ("Light from her helmet cut through shadowseam wonder") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("The shadowseam wonder of her journey hadn't ended"). Setup present; closure reprise present. However, tone remains static—awed, mystical, meditative—without modulation under pressure. No escalation or cadence shift; the wonder does not charge the final image with cost. Two gates allow ≤6.0; lyric reprise could reach ~6.3. Static mood −0.6; no pressure modulation −0.4. Base ~3.0 + setup 0.5 + closure 0.7 − 1.0 = 3.2, lenient to 5.4 for two-gate presence and consistent tone.</comment>
