<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains a placeholder: "logical page indexer" and "tranquilly perceptive" are repeated labels without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The discovery of his family sigil triggers contemplation rather than difficult trade-offs. The final shift from "indexer" to "bridge between past and present" is declared, not earned through on-page forfeiture or visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words; Chinese character "通常" appears mid-sentence, breaking immersion). The piece accumulates discoveries but lacks a decisive on-page change: Elias ends "understanding" his heritage with no visible forfeiture or altered tactic. The blackout functions as backdrop rather than constraint—power returns without consequence. Cost is asserted ("weighed differently") but not dramatized in a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sunken library and emergency lighting create atmosphere, and the scrolls/stamp/shadows are described with care. However, setting remains postcard: the blackout does not constrain a choice (he adapts "quickly," works "tranquilly"), and no environmental feature blocks or enables a tactic at closure. The antique ink stamp is handled but does not alter access or cost in the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tracing text origins—shifts mid-story to personal heritage without a turn that narrows options. Elias encounters no resistance: scrolls appear when needed, his hypothesis "becomes undeniable truth" without counter-evidence, and the blackout lifts on cue. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; discoveries accumulate without forcing a choice that forecloses a path or pays visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme (connection to history) is stated overtly in the penultimate paragraph: "we are never as separate from history as we might believe." The antique stamp recurs but as a talisman, not a constrained choice or charged reprise. "Reclaimed stillness" and "dappled resolve" are repeated phrases without scenic grounding. The ending summarizes Elias's future work rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable, but diction is consistently elevated and abstract ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness") regardless of pressure. Elias's perceptual signature is generic: he notices "minute details" without character-specific bias. The Chinese character "通常" mid-sentence (likely a generation artifact) breaks voice and legibility. Sentence rhythm is uniform, opening with subject–verb–object in most lines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "tranquilly perceptive" appears four times, "reclaimed stillness" three times, "dappled resolve" twice, "antique ink stamp" six times, often in functionally identical clauses. Template cadence dominates: "Elias [verb]" opens eight sentences; "The blackout [verb]" opens three. Stock metaphors ("phoenix rising from waves") and therapy-speak ("sense of self," "emotional" without embodiment) dull the closure beats. The Chinese character "通常" is a clear artifact. Cumulative line-level debt reaches −1.4 in Q7 and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—protagonist discovers ancestry in place he's cataloging—is familiar (template: hidden heritage revealed through job). Elias's "logical" indexer role and phoenix-wave emblem are convenience symbols without transformation. The blackout serves as lighting cue rather than constraint, and the discovery requires no sacrifice or non-obvious moral calculus. No fresh inflection or risk elevates the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics. He "decided to readjust his methodology" (summary) and "stood at the center… understanding" (contemplation). The indexer role is a label; no on-page indexing action creates a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The stamp appears in four beats (pouch, scroll markings, hand-weighing, palm at closure) but is handled passively. It triggers thought rather than constraining choice. Its presence at closure is descriptive, not causally active or reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is mentioned three times as theme but never shapes an on-page tactic or forecloses an option. It functions as atmosphere and final-paragraph summary, not as a driver of stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears four times as label. Elias notices details but no trade-off is shown: his calm does not cost him urgency or force a difficult choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears twice: once as methodology shift (told, not shown), once as self-concept. The methodology adjustment enables traditional work but does not create a turn; the self-adjustment is summary. Swappable with "reconsider" or "rethink."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is introduced at midpoint and "becomes undeniable truth" by the end. Its mechanics (cross-referencing without power) are asserted but not dramatized. It structures thought, not on-page attempts with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library and sunken city frame all action and provide the scrolls that drive discovery. However, the setting does not pressure a choice: Elias navigates "carefully" and finds what he needs without obstruction. The blackout dims light but does not block access or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The blackout is mentioned in six beats and brackets the story, but duration is vague ("beyond expected") and it does not tighten a decision. Power returns at the end without consequence. No clock alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To trace honest origins" is stated early and governs Elias's goal throughout. It pivots from text origins to personal heritage at midpoint. However, the motivation is not conflicted on the page: Elias encounters no friction between tracing texts and tracing self, and no cost is paid for the shift.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears twice as a phrase but is not embodied. Tone remains uniformly calm and contemplative; no modulation under pressure. The closure image ("new illumination") restates mood rather than charging it with cost.</comment>
