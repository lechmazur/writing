<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation to "witness change without judgment" is clearly stated but never tested under pressure—no moment where judgment tempts them or where witnessing costs something personal. The "loose grip on reality" attribute remains label-only, never constraining a choice or enabling a specific tactic. Internal contradiction is absent; the keeper moves through the sequence without conflicting impulses. The final choice to notate and return feels procedural rather than earned by struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of observation → notation across two spatial layers (refuge, library pocket). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the keeper witnesses the regenerative silence, records it, and returns to the refuge without succumbing, reaffirming their role. Cost is felt but oblique—the temptation of stasis is mentioned but never dramatized as a live choice that forecloses an alternative. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the silence is discovered, but no reversal or tightening narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge and the library catacombs are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (cascading murk, leaf litter, ozone and ancient paper). The origami swan functions as a micro-setting object that enables the transit but does not constrain a choice at closure. Spatial choreography is clean across both locations. The regenerative silence pocket charges the final image by reweighting the keeper's detachment, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to chronicle the anomaly without succumbing—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through spatial descent and sensory immersion, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the keeper proceeds methodically without setback or trade-off. The "tempting stasis" is declared but never dramatized as a live threat requiring a visible sacrifice. Cost at closure is conceptual (the secret etched onto soul and stones) but lacks a felt price that alters later tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme—witnessing entropy versus preservation—emerges organically from the contrast between the crumbling library and the regenerative silence. The final image (the swan bearing tracings, the refuge holding) offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question. However, the keeper's "loose grip on reality became an anchor" borders on thematic statement rather than earned demonstration. Subtext operates in the silence as both threat and gift, but the piece avoids fully exploring the cost of refusal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The prose carries a distinct, patient texture ("past and present bleed together like ink on wet parchment," "solidified honey, reality sliding past like cold silk"). Perceptual signature is controlled—the keeper notices symbols, motifs, and patterns befitting their role. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("felt like," "seemed") appear appropriately for the contemplative stance. No head-hopping or elision debt.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high across most beats. The opening paragraph contains minor overwriting: "cascading murk," "fleeting patterns," "weathered hands" stack figurative touches without propulsion. "Drift of untold seasons" recurs twice as a phrase without variation. The swan's "cryptic folds" appears three times, bordering on template cadence. No paraphrase loops, and clarity remains high. Deduct −0.4 for patterned repetition that does not escalate meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper + origami key + regenerative silence is a fresh synthesis that avoids stock portal-fantasy mechanics. The "loose grip on reality as anchor" inverts expectation but remains under-exploited. The piece commits fully to its contemplative premise without hedging, and the sensory particulars (ozone, ancient paper, obsidian walls) ground the fantastical elements. However, the emotional arc is thin—no bold risk-taking in character stakes or structural choice—and the keeper's detachment insulates the reader from urgency.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Chronicle keeper present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure). The keeper's decision to notate and return shapes the ending, but the choice is procedural rather than fraught. Two beats: retrieving the swan, making the notation. Causal pressure is minimal; the keeper's role as observer precludes high-stakes agency. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.5 (could be "archivist" or "witness" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge present in opening and closing paragraphs (lyric reprise). It frames the keeper's role and absorbs the river's roar as counterpoint to the silence, reweighting the dominant stake at closure. Two beats: opening anchor, final return. Closure linkage strong. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, lyric reprise reweights stake +0.4, no middle causal involvement −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Regenerative silence appears mid-story (second third) as the anomaly discovered. It shapes the keeper's choice to witness without succumbing and charges the final notation. Three beats: sensing the void, entering the pocket, making the symbol. Causal pressure: narrows the keeper's tactic to brief observation. Closure linkage strong. Late first appearance (second third) −0.3, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.5, cost connection +0.4, swappability −0.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Loose grip on reality mentioned twice but never constrains or enables a specific action. The narrative tells us it "became an anchor" at the climax without showing the cost of this trait. Label-only. Setup gate met (first paragraph), development absent, closure mentioned but not dramatized. Early signal +0.4, closure mention (not causal) +0.3, ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Burrow (via origami swan) enables the transit to the silence pocket and the return, shaping two beats and the middle escalation. The action is specific and irreplaceable given the established mechanics. Three beats: activation, descent, return. Setup in middle third, development and closure clear. Late signal (middle third) −0.4, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, irreplaceability +0.7, swappability −0.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cryptic folds in origami swan introduced mid-story (second third), used twice (activation, return). The method is specific and enables the plot. Two beats. Late signal −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, irreplaceability +0.6, swappability −0.5 (any portal key could substitute with minor rewrites).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overgrown library present in setup (second paragraph) and middle exploration. Supplies the anomaly but does not constrain the keeper's final choice. Two beats: description, housing the silence pocket. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal involvement (houses the anomaly) +0.6, closure absent −0.7, postcard description flavor in opening −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drift of untold seasons recurs as phrase but imposes no live clock or deadline. Time is thematic backdrop, not tactical pressure. Two mentions (setup, closure). Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise +0.3, no causal pressure (vague time) −0.6, no development gate −0.3, swappability −0.4, ornamental −0.5. Missing middle development cap at 3.4 overridden by minimal positive signals; score 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Witness change without judgment stated early and shapes the keeper's return without succumbing. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no moment where judgment tempts or witnessing costs something dear. Two beats: stated in opening, affirmed at closure. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, told-only (no friction) −0.7, swappability −0.5, cost connection weak −0.3, lyric reprise reweights +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Crumbling peace coherent across both refuge and library, modulates subtly when the keeper enters the regenerative silence ("profound quiet" versus "relentless rush"). Tone charges the final image by contrasting stasis and flow. Three beats: refuge peace, library decay, silence restoration. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, modulation under pressure +0.8, irreplaceability +0.5, static mood risk −0.4.</comment>
