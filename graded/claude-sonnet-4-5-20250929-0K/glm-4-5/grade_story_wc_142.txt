<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's dual allegiance provides motivation, but interiority remains surface-level throughout—"struggled with their dual allegiance" is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The "orderly intuitive mind recognizing patterns others missed" is label-only characterization without specific behavioral manifestation under pressure. The resolution (placing the stone back, removing the earpiece) arrives without visible internal cost or foreclosed path; the protagonist glides smoothly from conflict to synthesis without genuine struggle at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal but the closure lacks felt cost. Maya's final acts (returning the stone, removing the earpiece) are declarative gestures rather than choices that foreclose options—the "dual allegiance resolved" is asserted, not dramatized through sacrifice or irreversible consequence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first sentence, avoiding penalty. The three-night mapping montage and the favorable terms arrival constitute summary telling that flattens the central pressure arc; the story lists outcomes rather than dramatizing the turn that earns them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating raft city, perpetual carnival atmosphere, and graffiti murals are vividly established early and recur throughout. The foundation stone chip appears in three beats (pocket, clutching, returning) and the final placement charges the closure moment by reweighting collective vs. individual power. However, spatial choreography is vague—Maya's movements through the city lack concrete geography, and the corporate emissaries' visit and council meeting occur off-stage or in summary, reducing environmental constraint on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving Neptunia's culture against privatization) is signaled early, but escalation occurs primarily through summary montage ("For three nights, Maya barely slept") rather than on-page reversals. The "favorable terms" arrival feels like external rescue rather than protagonist-driven outcome, undercutting agency. The final image (spiral inside circle, earpiece removal) gestures toward earned resolution but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of community power vs. individual guidance emerges through the graffiti network and the stone's return, avoiding overt statement until late ("reorganizing a community was never about one person's guidance"). The encoded murals as survival blueprint offers a fresh angle on resistance. However, the final paragraph's thematic echo ("never forget how to dance on water," "flow with them") veers into sermonizing that replaces scene pressure. The dual allegiance resolution is abstractly satisfying but lacks the particular cost that would make the thematic question resonate beyond assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, but diction drifts between Maya's perceptual signature and expository voice ("culture shock absorber," "gentrification as inevitable survival"). The two dialogue lines feel inert—neither advances plot nor carries subtext. Sentence stems recycle throughout: "Maya [verb]" appears in nine consecutive beats mid-story, creating template cadence. The translator earpiece functions as symbolic prop rather than voice-shaping constraint; its removal at the end is thematic gesture, not POV evolution dramatized through syntax or perception shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: the dual allegiance concept is restated across four paragraphs without added pressure, and "encoded messages/graffiti" synonyms churn throughout. Template cadence is pervasive—runs of "Maya [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" flatten rhythm. The climactic summary ("For three nights, Maya barely slept, mapping graffiti locations and cross-referencing symbols")告 rather than showing pivotal action. Stock metaphors ("splash of cold water," "dance on water") appear without fresh inflection. The final paragraph stacks three thematic restatements where one concrete image would suffice, dulling closure impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The graffiti-as-encoded-resistance premise offers a non-obvious synthesis of visual art and tactical organizing, and the floating carnival city provides vivid specificity. However, the "culture shock absorber" role and translator earpiece feel grafted onto the story rather than integrated—they perform symbolic work without constraining choice. The dual allegiance arc follows a familiar template (mediator bridges opposing factions) without transformation through lived cost. The resolution's safety-hedging (favorable terms, partial victory, consensus achieved) retreats from bolder implications the premise invited.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maya as "culture shock absorber" is mentioned twice (opening, closing) but the role never constrains a choice or enables a tactic—it functions as symbolic label rather than character driver. The translator earpiece, the role's "telltale sign," is ornamental until its removal at the end, which is thematic gesture rather than causal turn. The character's key decisions (mapping graffiti, organizing flash mobs, slipping counterproposals) trace to the mediator/organizer role, not to "culture shock absorber" specifically; the element is swappable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in three beats (pocket trace, clutching during corporate visit, returning to monument) and the final placement articulates the theme of collective vs. individual power. However, it remains passive talisman rather than active constraint—Maya's choices would proceed identically without it. The chip's "relic from when the first hundred rafts were tethered" provides backstory texture but does not narrow options or enable tactics. The return reweights meaning but lacks felt cost; no live path is foreclosed by the act.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Dual allegiance (carnival elders vs. young entrepreneurs) is stated early and recurs as motivation throughout. It shapes the protagonist's mediator stance and drives the choice to encode messages that bridge factions. The resolution ("Their dual allegiance resolved, not through choosing sides but through bridging them") directly addresses the concept. However, the allegiance never creates on-page friction that forces a trade-off—Maya smoothly satisfies both sides without visible cost. The concept themes more than it constrains; it guides tone rather than altering tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" appears once as label ("their orderly intuitive mind recognizing patterns others missed") and enables the graffiti-decoding revelation. However, the trait is not dramatized through contradictory impulses or specific perceptual filter—we are told Maya sees patterns but not shown how orderliness and intuition conflict or complement under pressure. The mapping and cross-referencing over three nights occurs in summary. The trait could be replaced with "perceptive" or "analytical" without structural change; it lacks specificity that would make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reorganize" drives multiple beats: mapping graffiti locations, embedding instructions in new messages, organizing flash mobs, and the thematic closure acknowledgment that "reorganizing a community was never about one person's guidance." The action shapes tactics and the ending reflection directly reweights it. However, much of the reorganizing occurs off-stage in summary ("For three nights, Maya barely slept"), and the favorable terms arrive through the junior council member rather than Maya's reorganizing alone. The element is essential to the arc but its causal chain is partly told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Encoded graffiti messages are signaled early ("murals weren't just art, but encoded messages") and drive the middle sequence (mapping, creating new messages, flash mob coordination). The method enables the resistance network and the counterproposal delivery. However, the encoding mechanics remain vague—we are told messages are "encoded with nautical charts and historical references" but the decryption process is summarized, not shown. The method's specificity (graffiti vs. any other covert channel) matters thematically but not tactically; the story does not demonstrate how the visual medium constrains or enables in ways text or speech would not.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival and floating raft city are established vividly in the opening and recur throughout (ferris wheel, floats, festival posters, floating lanterns). The setting supplies the graffiti surfaces that enable Maya's method and the cultural uniqueness that justifies resistance. The foundation stone and outermost rafts figure in the resolution terms. However, the carnival itself does not pressure choices—Maya's organizing could occur in any close-knit neighborhood under threat. The perpetual aspect is atmospheric rather than causal; no choice hinges on the carnival's continuity or its sensory chaos.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Before privatization" frames urgency from the opening ("before privatization loomed on the horizon") and tightens through "privatization rumors transformed into scheduled meetings" and the dawn notice. The timeframe drives the protagonist's covert organizing and the flash mob timing. However, the three-night mapping sequence and the corporate timeline remain vague—no countdown or specific deadline forces tactical compression. The "before" is backdrop tension rather than active clock; Maya's choices proceed at the same pace regardless of how near privatization is.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To navigate gentrification" is stated early as Maya's challenge and drives the organizing arc: decoding survival knowledge, embedding legal resistance instructions, demonstrating cultural value to investors. The motivation directly shapes the graffiti method and the favorable terms outcome. However, the desire is never conflicted on the page—Maya's path from recognition to action to partial victory is linear, without friction between preservation and adaptation. The motivation is told as dual (elders vs. entrepreneurs) but Maya's choices never test competing wants with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is signaled through "desperation mounted as privatization rumors transformed into scheduled meetings, yet hope persisted" and modulates across beats (chaotic carnival energy, mounting urgency, partial victory celebration). The tone coheres but remains declarative rather than embodied in rhythm or perception. The final image's "defiant day" leans toward hope, but the desperation thread is resolved rather than held in tension. The tone supports rather than charges the closure; removing this exact tonal blend would not break the story's logic.</comment>
