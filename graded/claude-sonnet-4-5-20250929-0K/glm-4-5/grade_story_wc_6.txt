<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to "prove that scars can sing" is stated repeatedly rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her competence as a firefighter faces no meaningful internal conflict or blind spot that compounds; she executes her rescue flawlessly without struggle. The backstory about her father is told in long reflective blocks that don't anchor to present micro-choices that alter her stance. Interiority relies on abstract poetic phrasing ("unyielding compassion," "kelp-drift peace") rather than embodied, character-particular thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story opens with reasonable spatial anchors but the drive lens remains ambiguous—causal links are weak (fire advances, Maya wraps plants, fire stops without clear reason), and accumulative design is not taught early. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; Maya's grafts survive without cost or choice that forecloses a path. The ending recycles the opening's symbolic language ("scars can sing," obsidian lagoon) without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible with felt cost. Closure does not land on the page with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon and volcanic black sand appear in multiple beats and charge the final image through reprise, meeting the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is vivid but often ornamental (clouds, moonlight) rather than constraining choice. The botanical garden supplies the grafts but does not pressure Maya's decisions—she rescues them without spatial obstacles or resource trade-offs. Proper-noun economy is observed and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing the grafts—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens. Maya wraps the plants, shields them, and they survive; no live option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid. The fire's advance and the cloud migration create atmospheric tension but do not force a trade-off or alter her tactics. Agency is present (she acts) but her decisions do not narrow options or incur cost, so escalation under any lens is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation and inherited legacy emerges from the character's backstory and the graft motif, but it is stated overtly in the final beats ("scars can sing," "transformation requires both fire and water") rather than earned through a non-literal answer. The graft image is purposeful but the piece loops the same symbolic language without reweighting it—repetition substitutes for deepening. The ending does not offer a resonant reconfiguration; it summarizes the thesis in paraphrase.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent access to Maya's interiority. Perceptual signature is present (fire, plants, father's coin) but voice leans toward elevated poetic register ("kelp-drift peace," "migration of clouds") that feels generic rather than character-specific. The captain's brief radio call is the only dialogue; it is functional but does not test subtext or advance plot. Psychic distance remains steady but diction drifts into abstract lyricism that does not reflect a firefighter's lived idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "scars can sing" appears five times, "gracefully alert" twice, "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" four times, "migration of clouds" six times, often in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure or detail. Template cadence runs appear in reflective beats ("She touched… she whispered… she collected"). Figurative language is dense ("kelp-drift peace," "scars need protection to sing") but mixed and ornamental rather than propelling action. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 for loops and template stems, escalated to −1.4 because they recur in the final third and dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist's daughter becomes firefighter—offers thematic potential but the execution follows a familiar redemption template without fresh synthesis. The graft metaphor is purposeful but stated rather than transformed through specific choice under pressure. The migration of clouds and obsidian lagoon provide vivid setting detail but remain ornamental; they do not generate non-obvious turns. The piece commits to its symbolic frame but does not subvert or deepen it in hindsight, and the final image recycles the opening's language without reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her firefighting role is functional, but her decisions do not create key turns—she rescues plants without opposition or cost. Her identity as an arsonist's daughter is told in backstory rather than constraining present choices. She is setup, has middle action, and is present at the ending, but her choices are replaceable and do not narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Black sand appears early (first paragraph), is referenced in backstory (father's gift), is used mid-story (mixed with soil), and returns in the final third (sprinkled around roses). It shapes one choice (nurturing plants) but does not constrain a difficult trade-off or charge the closure with visible cost. The element meets setup, development, and payoff gates but remains illustrative rather than causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is mentioned twice as a label guiding Maya's decisions but never dramatized as a constraint that forces a cost or alters tactics. It functions as thematic echo rather than shaping on-page stakes. The concept is present but ornamental, with no middle beat where compassion conflicts with survival or efficiency.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears twice (opening and late) as a descriptor of Maya's movement but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It is a label-only trait without a tradeoff—her grace never conflicts with urgency or precision. The attribute is mentioned but not integrated into causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Grafting is introduced early, developed through Maya's protective actions (wrapping, shielding), and present in the ending (grafts intact, new growth). It drives the central rescue action and supplies the symbolic frame for transformation. However, the grafting does not redefine options under pressure—Maya succeeds without sacrifice or adaptation. The element is essential to the story's logic but does not transform at closure, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The foreign coin on red thread is mentioned in the first paragraph, appears in backstory (father's gift), is touched twice mid-story, and is present at the ending ("touched the foreign coin on her chest and smiled"). It serves as a talisman linking past to present but does not shape tactics or constrain a choice. The mechanics do not matter; it is ornamental presence across beats without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes is introduced early, appears mid-story (Maya descends for "kelp-drift peace"), and is present in the final image (mirroring the emerging sun). It provides atmospheric setting and symbolic resonance but does not constrain choice or supply resources that affect outcome. The lagoon is a backdrop for reflection rather than a pressure point; it shapes one brief recovery beat but not the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"During the migration of clouds" is mentioned six times but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a ticking clock. The captain notes the clouds create "unpredictable weather" and Maya observes their shifting light, but no decision is tightened by the timeframe. The element is present throughout but does not alter tactics or narrow options; time remains vague and untracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is stated five times and frames Maya's project, but it is told rather than dramatized through friction between desire and cost. Her motivation is consistent but does not conflict with fear or survival—she succeeds without a moment where proving the thesis risks something she values. The element is present in setup, middle reflection, and ending but lacks on-page tradeoff, capping it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" appears three times as a descriptor of Maya's centering state but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Tone remains static and lyrical throughout, without a cadence shift that reflects escalation or the closure beat. The phrase is ornamental rather than shaping emotional progression under stress.</comment>
