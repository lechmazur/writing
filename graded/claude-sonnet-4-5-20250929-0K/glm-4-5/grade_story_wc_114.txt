<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—to find "the weight of a swallowed truth"—arrives as a post-fever fixation rather than growing from prior character traits, making the turn feel unmotivated. His "fault-tolerant oracle" status and prophetic abilities function as labels without constraining on-page choices; no micro-decision reveals hierarchy of values under pressure. The final act (stepping into cold, drawn toward coordinates) reads passive, driven by destiny rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority leans heavily on abstract concepts ("swaying certainties," "auroral sorrow") rather than embodied, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers atmosphere, backstory, and metaphysical exposition toward a closure image. However, the decisive change at closure—Elias stepping out to retrieve a "crystallized fragment of meteoric origin"—lands as off-page summary rather than on-page dramatized action with visible cost. The final paragraph tells us what he will discover rather than showing the choice or renunciation with felt consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs; pressure remains static across the second half.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station at 11,200 feet supplies vivid sensory anchors (cold floor, inch of snow through window seal, massive observation windows) and the altitude constraint is signaled early as necessary for prophetic clarity. However, setting details accumulate without altering Elias's tactics; the station functions as backdrop rather than obstacle or resource. The botanical illustration and auroras charge the final image but the cave coordinates and indigenous legend arrive late without prior spatial grounding, weakening micro-setting coherence at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what was swallowed during fever—is declared midway but never tested by a reversal or on-page cost that narrows options. Elias's preparations (systematic margin work, gear packing) proceed without friction or trade-off. The auroral sorrow and meteoric fragment are told as revelation rather than earned through protagonist agency; the final image describes what will happen rather than showing a decision that forecloses a path. No escalation under the Accumulative lens; the second half loops exposition without deepening pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme—swaying certainties between fate and free will—is articulated through direct statement ("quantum-like and unpredictable until observed") rather than emerging from concrete events. The auroral sorrow concept (celestial tears for unvoiced truths) reads as imposed metaphysics rather than organically discovered stakes. The closure lacks a resonant, non-literal answer; instead it explains the premise in the final paragraph. No ambiguity or counter-reading is invited; the ending resolves into a tidy symbolic package (return fragment to earth) that states the moral rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains stable third-limited POV with no head-hopping and carries a consistent elevated register. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Elias notices margins and peripheral details, yet the filtering feels mechanical rather than character-specific. The prose occasionally veers into expository interiority that paraphrases on-page action ("proof that destiny had been guiding him all along") and leans on filter verbs ("seemed to move," "could almost see") at peak moments, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance stays controlled but rhythmic modulation under pressure is absent; syntax remains uniform across emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence mar multiple beats: "the proposition that neither fate nor free will truly existed, but rather something between them, quantum-like and unpredictable until observed" restates the concept without adding pressure; "For hours, Elias worked systematically...Each smudge revealed another fragment until the pattern emerged" summarizes action rather than dramatizing it. Stock metaphors ("fever breaks," "clarity that always comes," "mountain air") and elevated diction ("subcutaneous map," "meteoric origin") clash with the scene's immediacy. The final paragraph stacks simultaneity constructions ("drawn toward," "would finally discover," "asked to be returned") that blur action sequence. Information density is low; many sentences restate concepts without advancing situation or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle frame and mountain-station isolation evoke familiar "gifted loner in retreat" templates without transformation through specific lived detail. The botanical illustration harboring hidden coordinates, auroral tears as literal truth-weight, and the climactic cave discovery follow well-worn genre patterns (mystic map, celestial metaphysics, fated journey). The emotional arc—fever delirium to prophetic certainty—proceeds without friction or counter-evidence. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece hedges toward median safety with elevated prose masking derivative premise. The swaying-certainties concept is asserted rather than enacted through contradictory on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias's "fault-tolerant oracle" status is present in exposition and backstory (seven disasters predicted, Edge-Seer nickname) but does not constrain an on-page choice with cost. His prophetic abilities function as label rather than lived tradeoff; no moment shows him functioning near-prophetically under lacunae or paying a visible price for his gift. The decision to step into the cold is passive, drawn by destiny rather than enabled/limited by oracle mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in three beats: beneath pillow as heirloom, smudged to reveal coordinates, packed with gear. However, its use is decorative in the first beat and summarized in the third; only the middle smudge drives plot. The illustration's delicate petals illustrate "swaying certainties" as metaphor without altering Elias's options. It enables discovery but could be swapped for any hidden-message artifact with minor edits. Closure linkage is absent; the illustration is packed but not reweighted in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is articulated as theme ("neither fate nor free will truly existed, but rather something between them") and echoed in the illustration's moving petals, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. No choice tests the quantum-like unpredictability; Elias's path feels deterministic (destiny guiding him) rather than charged with genuine ambiguity. The concept remains abstract assertion rather than lived friction that alters his options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Elias's "peripherally aware" trait is introduced with backstory (Edge-Seer nickname, mentor's teaching) and functions once when margin discoloration catches his eye. However, this noticing feels convenient rather than constrained; no cost or tradeoff accompanies his peripheral vision. The trait does not shape a second beat or charge the closure. The method of occupying margins overlaps with the attribute, diluting both.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The smudge action appears in one key beat: deliberately smudging the illustration's margin to reveal coordinates. This act violates his training (scientist/archivist) and drives the plot turn. However, the smudge is not prepared by prior temptation or hesitation, and its consequences (revealing map) are immediate and frictionless. No later beat revisits or reweights the smudge. Swappable with other reveal mechanisms (UV light, heat) without deep rewrite, though the defacement angle adds modest specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The method "by occupying margins" is signaled midway ("by occupying margins, both literal and figurative, he would uncover what had been hidden") and enacted in one summarized beat ("For hours, Elias worked systematically, occupying each margin..."). Mechanics remain vague; we see result (pattern emerged) not process. The method overlaps with the peripherally-aware attribute without distinct integration. No cost or constraint tied to margin-work shapes later tactics; it functions as convenient puzzle-solving rather than contested means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is established early with vivid detail (11,200 feet, Chugach/Wrangell location, radio equipment, barometers, massive windows) and its altitude enables prophetic clarity—a functional constraint. However, after setup the setting becomes passive backdrop; no station resource or limitation alters Elias's preparation or departure. The cave coordinates lie outside the station, and the final image (stepping into cold, auroras above) uses atmosphere rather than station mechanics. Present across beats but does not pressure the ending choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" anchors the opening line and establishes a before/after boundary. The fever delirium is referenced as inciting the obsession, and Elias's pale legs and shaking hands carry physical trace. However, time progression is vague ("For hours, Elias worked") and no clock tightens his window. The post-fever state grants clarity rather than imposing cost or urgency. The timeframe sets mood but does not shape tactics or narrow options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" crystallizes midway as post-fever obsession and drives the second-half action (margin work, gear prep, departure). However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. No friction between this want and competing fears or costs; Elias pursues it mechanically. The phrasing "swallowed truth" reads as metaphor turned literal without embodied stakes. The motivation charges the middle but does not face a test that forces trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is woven throughout: the auroras appear early as backdrop, redefined midway as "celestial tears shed for truths too heavy to voice," and return in the final paragraph as the crystallized fragment pulsing with sorrow. Tone is consistent—melancholy, elevated, metaphysical—but static; no modulation under pressure. The concept remains abstract and tell-heavy ("amplifying the sorrow he now carried as both burden and purpose"). The final image restates the tone without reweighting it through new action or cost.</comment>
