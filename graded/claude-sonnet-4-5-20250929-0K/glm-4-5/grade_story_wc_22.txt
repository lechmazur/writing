<question>1</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>The coachman remains a cipher—his ability to speak dead languages and understand bird calls is asserted but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The piece tells us he is motivated and knowledgeable but never dramatizes internal conflict or shows him wrestling with competing wants. His "smile" at the end is an externalized gesture without the embodied cost or renunciation that would earn it. The final decades-later visit summarizes transformation rather than dramatizing the choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors appear late (who/where/when crystallize only after ~150 words of abstract scene-painting). The piece opens with accumulative texture but never commits to a drive lens; by midpoint it has not taught whether causality, pattern, or situational pressure will govern closure. The ending summarizes decades of change ("Years later, travelers would speak…") rather than landing a decisive on-page moment with visible cost. No clear before/after is legible in the coachman's final paragraph—he witnesses what he "unleashed" but the closure image is passive observation, not reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The "blooming jetty at twilight" and "gloom-hill" are evocative labels but remain postcard backdrops; no micro-setting detail (a plank, a tool, the texture of soil) constrains a choice or alters tactics. The seed pods are handled in summary ("scattered the first handful") without tactile specificity. Spatial choreography is vague—where exactly does the coachman stand, how far does he walk, what does he physically do with the pods at each site?</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—restoring the battlefield garden—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or reversal. The coachman encounters no failure, no cost that narrows his options; the bird's instruction ("The western hollow first") is a helpful pointer, not a complication. "Exhausted but hopeful" summarizes rather than dramatizes a price paid. The decades-later coda tells us the mission succeeded without showing the moment of transformation or the trade-off that made it possible.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>The theme of "narrow vastness" is stated outright in the penultimate paragraph ("the idea that even the smallest actions could transform infinite possibilities"), converting subtext into thesis. "Submerged concord" recurs as a label without accruing new meaning through dramatized particulars. The ending moralizes ("transforming memories of war into promises of peace, one seed pod at a time") rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material without explicit gloss.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>The voice is competent but generic literary-fantasy register without a distinct perceptual signature. The coachman's interiority is absent—no sentence shows how he notices or what he prioritizes under stress. Dialogue with himself ("The blackberries will grow first") and the bird's suddenly-clear call are exposition rather than voice-driven action. The final paragraph shifts to omniscient summary ("travelers would speak in wonder") without anchoring whose knowledge or stance we are tracking.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "a promise in his wake" echoes "hope speaking to the waiting soil"; "renewing reef" repeats "submerged concord was restored" within two sentences. Stock metaphors abound ("dying sun," "fragile embrace," "wounded world"). The phrase "ttk duelersi" appears mid-sentence as a typographic artifact, unacknowledged. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The + noun" or "From his coat, he…" Figurative density in the opening (gloom-hill, windswept, dying sun, long shadows, barren landscape within 25 words) frontloads mood without propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>The premise—lone mystic restores a blighted battlefield with seeds and ancient knowledge—is a familiar eco-fantasy template without fresh transformation. The coachman's abilities (dead languages, bird calls) are asserted conveniences that solve rather than complicate. No specific, verifiable detail grounds the magic; the reef regeneration and garden bloom are summarized outcomes, not dramatized friction. The piece hedges between lyric accumulation and causal plot without committing boldly to either.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>Present throughout; scatters seeds and follows bird instructions, but never makes a choice that narrows options or reveals hierarchy of values. His actions are uncomplicated execution of a plan; no on-page reversal or cost-bearing decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Signaled early, handled in multiple beats (withdrawn from coat, scattered at jetty, scattered at battlefield, "nearly depleted" at dawn). However, the pods are generic vessels; their specific properties (which seeds, why these and not others) never constrain a choice or charge the final image with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>Mentioned four times but functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping force. The "agreement between coastal villages and sea creatures" is backstory; on-page action does not dramatize its mechanics or cost. Reef regeneration is told in summary decades later, not shown as a present constraint or choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>Asserted early and mentioned again mid-story ("a dialect that hadn't been spoken in seven hundred years"). Never constrains a choice or creates visible tradeoff—he simply sings to the ground "in words that had fertilized fields" without cost, mistranslation, or failure. Label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Central to the plot and present across beats (scattering seeds, singing to ground, "fertilize" stated). The action is swappable with "plant" or "sow" without altering logic. Late reprise: decades later the garden blooms, reweighting the initial act with visible consequence. Reaches low-6 band via lyric callback but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Signaled early ("ability to understand bird calls had been crucial"), used in middle beat (bird instructs "western hollow first"). However, the mechanic is convenience—bird calls guide without cost or misunderstanding. Does not create a turn; the method enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Appears in title-like opening and returns in final paragraph ("one final journey to the blooming jetty at twilight"). Evocative but does not supply resource or obstacle that alters tactics. Wildflowers "already begun to reclaim" the structure are backdrop, not pressure. Lyric reprise lifts score slightly but lacks causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.3</grade>
<comment>Establishes loss ("Years ago, before the coral bleached") and final state ("decades after his first visit"). Does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock narrows his window or forces trade-offs during the planting night. Time is summary frame, not tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Stated clearly ("to let a garden reclaim the battlefield") and drives the protagonist's journey and actions across beats. However, no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear; the motivation is executed without dramatized doubt or sacrifice. Functional but uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>4.4</grade>
<comment>"Narrow vastness" is explicitly defined in the text ("the idea that even the smallest actions could transform infinite possibilities"), converting tone to thesis. The mood is consistently elegiac-hopeful without modulation under pressure or tonal shift that charges the final image. Static rather than dynamic.</comment>
