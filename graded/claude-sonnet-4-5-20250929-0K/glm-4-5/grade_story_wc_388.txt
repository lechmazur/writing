<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is told through label-only statements ("sharply observant," "determination unwavering") rather than embodied, contradictory impulses. Her decision to touch the diamond and become a keeper arrives without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a prior path. The piece summarizes her emotional states ("felt hope") instead of dramatizing them through specific perception and micro-choices under pressure. No genuine flaw complicates her choices; she progresses through discovery to resolution without meaningful struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story summarizes nearly all pivotal discoveries rather than dramatizing them: the letter reassembly, the stillpoint revelation, and the corporate conspiracy are recounted in past-tense exposition. Orientation is delayed—who Maya is, where she is specifically, and when this occurs remain vague past the opening. The closure offers no decisive change or visible cost; Maya's choice to "become the keeper" is stated intent, not an on-page action or renunciation that forecloses a path. The inferred lens is unclear: causal linkage is weak (discoveries happen off-page), and no accumulative pattern is taught early enough to justify the structure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard supplies vivid sensory anchors (glowing soil, trees leaning toward center, radioactive dust storms) that establish atmosphere. However, spatial choreography is vague—Maya's physical position relative to the pedestal, box, and trees shifts without clear transitions. The orchard's details remain static description rather than constraining her choices or shaping tactics; she moves through the space without friction. The diamond and orchard do participate in the final image, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (uncovering the stillpoint's truth) is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Maya encounters no setbacks, reversals, or dilemmas; each discovery leads smoothly to the next without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The corporate threat is mentioned but never dramatized—no on-page antagonist applies pressure. Her final decision to protect the knowledge carries no visible price; she simply plans her next move without sacrifice or constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus lies is stated explicitly throughout ("excavate truth from comfortable lies," "reality rather than lies") rather than emerging from particulars. The flawed diamond as a transformation device offers potential but is explained directly instead of resonating through image and implication. The final paragraph moralizes ("Hope was the one thing the corporations couldn't liquidate") rather than letting the orchard image carry thematic weight. No complex ambiguity or counter-reading is available; the piece resolves into a simple binary of corporate deception versus heroic truth-telling.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into register mismatches: "dimensional boundaries thinned," "prism," "conduit" feel technical rather than character-filtered, and "sharply observant" is repeated as a label. Perceptual signature is weak—Maya's noticing reads generic rather than distinctly hers. Sentence stems recur: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "Maya [verb]," creating template cadence that flattens rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "sharply observant eyes" / "sharply observant nature" / "sharply observant mind"; "hidden stillpoint" appears five times with minimal variation; "the letters" / "reassembling shredded letters" / "by reassembling shredded letters" churn without added detail. Template cadence runs throughout: "The locals whispered... yet the orchard," "The letters spoke... By reassembling," "The liquidation hadn't been... Corporate scientists had." Stock phrases dominate: "impossibly perfect," "relentless pursuit of truth," "fate worse than liquidation." Information density is low—many sentences restate the same revelation. These artifacts spread across the text and touch the closure beats, applying the maximum scaffold penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise (post-apocalyptic orchard sustained by mysterious energy source + corporate cover-up) follows a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The flawed diamond as a "key" and "conduit" reads as standard fantasy mechanics. Maya's arc from debunker to keeper echoes familiar chosen-one patterns. No turn or image feels inevitable in hindsight; the stillpoint explanation arrives via exposition rather than growing from prior particulars. The combination of elements serves the prompt checklist rather than synthesizing into a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maya appears throughout but her choices are mostly observational or recounted in summary. She decides to touch the diamond and to become a keeper, but these decisions arrive late (final third) and are stated rather than dramatized with on-page cost. Present in setup, minimal middle development, weak closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is introduced early (paragraph 6), described in the middle as a "key" and "conduit," and Maya touches it near the end. However, its role is explained rather than shown through action—it does not constrain her choices or enable tactics. The "black inclusion" detail is mentioned but never functionally matters. Present across three beats but with ornamental rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The hidden stillpoint is named in the reassembled letters (middle third) and explained as the source of the orchard's vitality. It shapes the thematic stakes but does not alter Maya's tactics or force choices on the page. Mentioned in the final paragraphs but as concept rather than dramatized pressure. Functional but replaceable with any mysterious energy source.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is used as a label three times but never demonstrated through specific perceptual choices or trade-offs. The trait does not constrain action or enable a unique solution; it is claimed rather than shown. No visible cost tied to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears once in paragraph 14 to describe Maya's process of understanding the diamond's nature. The action is summarized after the fact rather than shown in scene. The intuition does not drive a key turn or alter her options; it merely names what the text then explains. Swappable with "realize" or "discover" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is introduced in paragraph 10, signaled as Maya's method in paragraph 12, and credited with revealing the stillpoint in paragraph 14. The mechanics are mentioned ("patterns in the paper fibers and ink," "days of work") but not shown in action. The method shapes one key revelation but is recounted rather than dramatized. Meets two gates (middle, closure participation via revelation) but with summary-only execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The wasteland orchard is established in the opening and sustained throughout as both setting and mystery. It provides the central enigma (thriving amid radiation), houses the pedestal and letters, and supplies the final image of trees bending and the diamond pulsing during the dust storm. The orchard's vitality is causally linked to the stillpoint, making it essential to the plot logic. However, it does not constrain Maya's physical choices or supply tactical friction—she moves freely within it. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure image; irreplaceable as the story's anchor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" is mentioned in paragraph 3 and referenced again in paragraphs 16, 21, 27, and 32. The timeframe provides backstory context (corporate purge) but does not tighten present decisions or create a live deadline. Maya's actions unfold without temporal pressure; "days" pass for letter reassembly without urgency. The liquidation is static historical fact rather than a constraint shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Maya's motivation "to excavate truth from comfortable lies" is stated in paragraph 18 and echoed in paragraphs 2, 3, and 25. The desire frames her general stance but is not dramatized through a specific on-page choice where truth conflicts with comfort or safety. Her mission progresses smoothly without moral friction or cost. Functional framing but lacks embodied conflict between wants and prices.</comment>
