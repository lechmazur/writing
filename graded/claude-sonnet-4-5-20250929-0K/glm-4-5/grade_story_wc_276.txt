<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fisher's "cool-headed" trait is asserted but never tested by genuine panic or mistake; he executes his plan flawlessly without dramatized internal conflict or contradictory impulses. His ability to "transliterate emotions" remains a label without embodied cost—we see no moment where the act of transformation taxes him physically or mentally. The final smile and rest feel unearned because no visible struggle preceded them, only patient execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (sound-wave garden, voicing silence, transliterated emotions) and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the fisher rests with his catch. However, the cost remains abstract—"his purpose complete"—without a legible forfeiture or tension that the ending image reconfigures. The orientation is clear (who, where, when by the opening lines), and the pattern holds, but the closure lacks felt weight because the divine catch imposes no visible sacrifice or transformation on the fisher himself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is vividly described with "visible ripples" and "transparent flora," and the rail spike appears in multiple beats, but neither constrains a choice at closure. The setting remains ornamental: the fisher navigates it without friction, and the spike serves as anchor and receptacle but never forces a tactical compromise. Spatial choreography is clear, and sensory detail is purposeful, but the environment does not pressure the final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early and pursued without meaningful reversal. The fisher's zigzag weaving and "voicing silence" unfold as planned; no live option is foreclosed, and no cost materializes on the page. The piece offers no moment where the fisher must choose between competing goods or adapt tactics under unexpected pressure. Escalation reads as textural accumulation (constellations stir, garden settles), not a tightening that narrows options or raises cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the particulars of sound, silence, and divine encounter, avoiding overt moralizing. The final line—"a legacy written in resonance rather than words"—gestures toward understanding-through-touch, and the rail spike's transformation hints at sacred cost. However, the piece leans on prompt labels ("transliterates emotions," "feral lullaby") and the fisher's epiphany is asserted ("the profound beauty of understanding") rather than earned through on-page friction. The ending offers a resonant image but does not reweight prior material with visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct texture ("weathered hand," "banked fire," "feral lullaby"). POV remains stable in third-person limited, and diction stays elevated throughout without register drift. However, the prose occasionally slips into explanatory mode ("for what is fishing but the desire to touch something beyond oneself") and the narrative certainty exceeds what the fisher's interiority can plausibly know ("the longing of the wind, the loneliness of the stones"). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries vivid figurative language ("sleepwalking constellations," "voicing silence") but suffers from pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence. Examples: "The fisher smiled, cool-headed once more" repeats the opening trait; "His motivation burned steady" and "his motivation fulfilled" frame the same idea; "when patterns broke themselves" appears three times without variation. Sentence stems recur mechanically ("The fisher possessed," "He would return," "And in the sound wave garden"). These loops dull momentum and drop information density, particularly in the final third where closure should tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of sound-wave garden, transliterated emotions, and divine fishing is imaginative and commits fully to its lyric premise. The piece avoids stock fantasy tropes and offers a coherent vision. However, the emotional arc—patient execution leading to satisfaction—follows a predictable template without a non-obvious turn. The fisher's cool-headedness remains static, and the "echo" catch resolves exactly as set up, reducing risk and ingenuity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cool-headed fisher is present throughout and executes the plan, but his choices do not create turns—he follows a predetermined method without adaptation or surprise. His trait is asserted ("cool head served him well") but not tested by a moment of genuine panic or error. Present in closure but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rail spike appears in three beats (opening, middle anchor, final hum) and is handled on the page. It serves as grounding tool and receptacle for the echo, and the final image shows it "transformed by its sacred purpose." However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; the fisher uses it as planned without friction. Two-gate reprise (setup, closure participation) with causal presence but no decisive pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations are described vividly and recur across the narrative (opening sky, mid-story stirring, final journey). They frame the scene but do not alter the fisher's tactics or choices on the page. Their "unconscious wanderings disturbed" is a described effect, not a dramatized complication. Present in closure image but not causally active; the piece could function with stationary stars.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "transliterates emotions" is introduced early and described ("transforming intangible feelings into tangible threads"), but the mechanics remain abstract. We are told he weaves "the longing of the wind, the loneliness of the stones" into a net, yet no on-page moment shows the cost or difficulty of this transformation. The trait enables the catch but imposes no visible tradeoff or constraint. Label-only use; swappable with "magical weaving" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Zigzagging appears in multiple beats (opening movement, weaving emotions, final securing move). It is described as "deliberate yet untamed" and "creating a pattern," but the action itself does not create a turn or reversal. The fisher zigzags as planned; the movement is method, not pivot. Present across beats but replaceable with "circling" or "spiraling" without changing outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Voicing silence" is introduced early ("a paradoxical art") and described as creating "pockets of quiet" and "pathways in the sound waves." It appears in two beats (midpoint explanation, final reflection) but the mechanics remain vague. We do not see the fisher perform the action with specific cost or difficulty; it is summarized as method rather than dramatized as constraint. Functional but abstract; the piece tells us it works without showing friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sound-wave garden is present from the opening and described with vivid particulars ("visible ripples," "transparent flora," "auditory blooms"). It frames every beat and is mentioned in the closure ("the sound wave garden began to settle"). However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the fisher navigates it successfully without tactical compromise. Strong setup and closure participation, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When patterns break themselves" is introduced in the opening and repeated at the end ("when patterns broke themselves again"), framing the temporal window. The timeframe creates atmosphere and justifies the goddess's appearance, but it does not impose a deadline or alter the fisher's tactics. No ticking clock or urgency on the page; the fisher works at his own pace. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to catch the echo of a goddess" is stated early ("his motivation burned steady") and fulfilled at closure ("his motivation fulfilled, his purpose complete"). It drives the fisher's presence and actions, but no on-page friction tests it—no competing want, fear, or temptation. The desire is told rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. Present across beats but uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"Feral lullaby" appears twice (mid-story "feral lullaby of his movements" and final-third reprise) and attempts to blend wildness with comfort. The phrase is evocative but remains a descriptor rather than a tonal force that modulates with pressure. The narrative maintains a consistent lyric calm throughout; no tonal shift or intensification at closure. Purposeful reprise but static mood.</comment>
