<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from control-obsessed to intuitive partnership is architecturally sound, but interiority remains thin—her micro-choices often summarized ("she made a decision") rather than dramatized with embodied contradiction. The climactic moment of opening vents lacks visceral stakes or hesitation in the act itself, reading more as plot pivot than character crucible. Marco's function is purely catalytic, his presence efficient but not pressurized. Backstory reflection exceeds the allowance and flattens present momentum in the early third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three (Elara, nursery, post-storm), clearing the test. The accumulative lens is taught early and holds—storm cycles deepen the control-versus-nature tension—but closure cost is abstract: "transformation complete" tells the change rather than landing a decisive image or forfeited path on the page. The ending summarizes outcome ("most verdant," "surprising everyone") instead of crystallizing a final choice or renunciation with felt price. One meaningful deepening occurs (vents-open gambit), meeting minimum escalation, but the resolution dilutes into reflective summary rather than a charged final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mossy trellis, moist soil, and rain-soaked greenhouse ground the nursery convincingly; sensory detail (dripping wood, doubled linden growth) is selective and pressure-relevant. The trellis returns at closure and charges the final reflection, meeting the 9+ gate in principle, but spatial choreography during the vents-open night remains vague—no concrete image of Elara walking away or returning makes the discovery visceral. Occupational plausibility (rain shields, soil composition) reads credible without overexposition. Environment constrains mid-story tactics (shields versus exposure), lifting this above postcard mode.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (scientific control versus natural adaptation) signals early and tightens once when Elara removes shields, a live gambit with observable consequence (destruction/growth). However, the cost of that choice is told in summary ("some areas...others") rather than showing Elara confronting a specific lost experiment or plant, diluting immediacy. Escalation under the accumulative lens is minimal—storm cycles repeat the same observation loop without compounding pressure or narrowing options until the final third. Agency exists (she opens vents) but feels schematic, a thesis maneuver rather than a desperate trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (control as limitation, partnership with nature) emerges cleanly from linden growth patterns and Elara's arc, avoiding overt thesis. The trellis-as-classroom metaphor in the final line offers non-literal closure. Yet the penultimate paragraph's advice ("Perhaps it's not about directing growth...") verges on moralizing; Elara articulates the theme in prompt-like language, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5). Subtext operates in Marco's deflected question and the leaf's disappearance, but the ending leans explanatory ("she finally understood," "surprising everyone but her") where image alone could resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and naturalistic ("circuitously sincere," "reverence for nature's wisdom"), though the latter phrase edges toward elevated register during peak reflection. Elara's perceptual signature (precise measurement, cataloging impulse) distinguishes early beats; under stress, however, her interiority remains evenly articulated without syntactic compression or contradictory impulse in the moment. Dialogue (Marco, other nursery owners) feels natural and goal-driven, each line advancing theme or doubt. Filter verbs ("noticed," "observed") stack in the middle third without obscuring meaning but dulling immediacy slightly (−0.3).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence variety and rhythm serve the material; no catastrophic loops. However, synonym churn appears in the middle third: "control" and variants recur across adjacent paragraphs without added nuance, and "circuitously sincere" (prompt element) is inserted twice via tell rather than shown behavior, reading as token fulfillment (−0.4). The phrase "reluctant metamorphosis" appears verbatim, a label echo (−0.2). Clarity and propulsion are solid; information density is moderate—several lines paraphrase prior beats ("her motivation had shifted," "transformation was reluctant") without advancing pressure. The opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly; the final line resonates but tells rather than shows the classroom lesson.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The nursery-owner-learns-to-let-go premise is familiar template (control-versus-trust arc), and the story executes it competently without transformation: swap "linden" for any crop, "trellis" for any marker, and the emotional arc persists unchanged. The accumulative storm structure and the leaf's disappearance offer modest freshness, but the climactic vent-opening and final reflection follow expected beats. Marco's Socratic nudge and the other-nursery-owners epilogue are stock moves. No bold perspectival or structural risk elevates the material; the piece aims for thematic clarity over ingenuity, landing in the functional-but-predictable band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices (documenting, pinning leaf, installing shields, opening vents, releasing control methods) create two key turns: the vents-open gambit and the method reconstruction. Setup is immediate, development spans multiple beats, and closure hinges on her transformed approach. However, many decisions are summarized ("she made a decision," "began to slowly reconstruct") rather than dramatized with visible hesitation or cost in the act, capping the score below 7.0 despite structural presence across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The linden leaf appears in beats two (discovery), three (examination), and four (disappearance/replacement), meeting the ≥2-touch floor. Its vanishing triggers new shoots, a functional middle turn. Yet the leaf itself is static description ("patterns of growth," "veins") without tactile handling or evolving symbolic charge; the shoots do the causal work while the leaf remains ornamental catalyst. Closure mentions "the linden leaf her most unexpected teacher" (summary claim), but the final image centers the trellis and living lindens, not the leaf. Two-gate presence (setup, development) with weak closure linkage and swappability (any anomalous specimen could substitute) place this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reluctant metamorphosis" shapes the arc—Elara resists, then undergoes transformation—and the text flags it explicitly ("her reluctant metamorphosis...complete"). Setup is present by paragraph three, development occurs as she confronts control failure, and the ending confirms the change. However, the concept functions primarily as thematic label rather than on-page constraint: no beat shows Elara actively resisting a choice because of reluctance (agency hesitation), and the metamorphosis is told in summary ("transformation was both reluctant and profound") instead of through a single dramatized micro-choice where reluctance costs her. Causal pressure is moderate; the concept could be implicit without the label and the story would read identically, indicating replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Circuitously sincere" appears twice: Marco's "circuitously sincere concern" and Elara's later advice described the same way. Both instances are narrator labels, not embodied behavior—no scene shows Marco or Elara delivering indirect-yet-honest communication with dramatized cost or enabling effect. The attribute is ornamental descriptor, present but functionally inert. Late explicit repetition (final third) reads as token prompt-check rather than integrated trait. No on-page choice hinges on this quality; removing it requires only two-word edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reconstruct" drives two beats: Elara's attempt to "reconstruct its genetic anomaly" (paragraph seven) and her decision to "slowly reconstruct her methods, this time by releasing control" (paragraph twenty-three). The second usage inverts the first, creating thematic symmetry and a meaningful turn. Setup is early, the reversal charges the transformation, and closure references the shift. However, the action itself is summary-level ("began to slowly reconstruct") without showing a specific method change on the page—what does she do differently the next morning? The verb is more conceptual anchor than dramatized tactic. Causal role is present but the beat lacks physical immediacy, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Releasing control" is seeded in paragraph eleven ("most remarkable growth occurred where...interventions were minimal"), developed through Marco's question and Elara's vent-opening choice (paragraph nineteen/twenty), and named explicitly at closure ("by releasing control rather than imposing it"). The method shapes the climactic gambit—she removes shields and walks away—with observable consequence (explosive growth). Mechanics are clear: withhold intervention, let nature act. The method is indispensable to the transformation and integral to three beats (observation, decision, reconstruction). Cost is visible (some destruction) and the final image depends on this exact means. Strong integration across all gates; slightly generic phrasing and one step of tell (naming the method) keep it shy of 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mossy trellis appears in five beats: discovery site (paragraph four/five), observation post (paragraph twenty-six), growth locus (paragraph twenty-one: "lindens near the trellis had doubled"), and final reflection ("mossy trellis after rain had been her classroom"). It supplies the anomalous shoots that disprove Elara's control thesis, pressuring her method. The trellis is irreplaceable: its specific location (eastern post) and material (softened wood enabling shoots) matter causally. Setup is immediate, development hinges on its properties, and closure charges it as teacher-symbol. The setting constrains Elara's late-season observation routine and provides the evidence that forces change. Only minor gap: the trellis is more passive stage than active constraint on a single choice, holding it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Storm season" frames the entire piece: opening line ("storm season having brought...vitality"), escalation cue ("following days brought increasing storms," "heaviest rainfall in weeks"), and closure marker ("final weeks of storm season," "when the storms finally passed"). Time tightens decisions—each storm cycle tests Elara's control measures and accelerates the linden changes. The timeframe is present in all three gates and causally active: storms drive the growth anomalies that force Elara's shift. However, the clock is loose (weeks pass "in a blur") without day-specific pressure or a single storm that must be met by a deadline. The season structures pacing but does not create urgent choice-points within scenes. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To study plant behaviors" anchors Elara's identity (paragraph two: "twenty years...meticulously documented") and her initial method (cataloging, charting). The motivation is dramatized in early beats (pinning the leaf, tracing veins) and shifts mid-story ("Her motivation had shifted from pure study to a deeper questioning"). Conflict arises when study-as-control fails to predict the linden's thriving. However, the desire is more premise than live friction: no scene shows Elara forced to choose between studying and another competing want (e.g., profit, reputation, rest). The motivation enables the arc but is not tested with visible cost—she continues studying throughout, merely changing her approach. Setup and development are present; payoff is implicit (she "still studied...but now with reverence"). Functional integration, moderate dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" describes the arc's outcome ("a sustaining transformation that continued to evolve") and colors the ending's reflective mood. Tone is coherent—patient accumulation, no false urgency—and modulates appropriately: controlled early, frustrated mid-story, reverent at closure. The final image (verdant nursery, Elara's reverence) supports the sustaining quality. However, tone is more consistent backdrop than shaping force: no beat shows tone pressuring a choice or reweighting stakes. The word "sustaining" appears once, late, as summary label rather than enacted quality. Closure linkage is present but passive; the tone charges the ending mildly without making the transformation's sustainability a dramatized cost or constraint. Two-gate presence (development, closure) with moderate payoff.</comment>
