<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is declared but rarely dramatized through on-page choices under pressure. Her "theoretically rebellious" stance is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The father exists only in reflection and hospital-room memory, never applying pressure in scene. The ending's "peace" feels asserted rather than earned through a visible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece lacks a clear closure unit with visible cost. Elena moves from discovery to reflection to a vague "pilgrimage" intention, but no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs—she simply decides to continue doing what she's already been doing. The Fibonacci sequence discovery offers a micro-turn but leads nowhere causally. Orientation is adequate (Moscow library, post-heart-attack timeframe established early), but the drive lens remains ambiguous: accumulative texture competes with causal setup that never pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and candle lantern create atmospheric texture, and the mica pane returns with tactile detail. However, the setting doesn't constrain Elena's choices—the library could be any quiet space. The subway seats are mentioned but never visited on the page, weakening spatial coherence. Sensory details (dust, certainty smell, candlelight) are present but don't pressure the central action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling her father's gambling with her probability theory—is declared but never tested through on-page conflict. The Fibonacci discovery could escalate tension but instead triggers only reflection. No reversal or tightening narrows Elena's options; she ends intending to do tomorrow what she did yesterday. The "peace" arrival carries no visible price or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lucid-contradictions theme is overtly stated ("irony followed her like a personal shadow") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The piece offers intellectual texture around probability versus gambling, intuition versus mathematics, but these remain abstract toggles. The final image of "clover melancholy" and "space between certainties" gestures toward resonance without a non-literal answer rooted in prior action. The father's heart attack primes thematic stakes but never tests them on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The third-person narration maintains stable distance and carries a literary register appropriate to an academic protagonist. However, Elena's interior voice occasionally slides into thesis-speak ("widening perspectives responsibly," "theoretically rebellious") that feels prompted rather than lived. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The perceptual signature is present but generic—any professor might notice "patterns" and "numbers dancing."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops appear: "patterns she'd never noticed before—patterns that seemed to align" and the repeated "lucid contradictions" framing. Template cadence shows in "Unlike her father, who saw... Elena was theoretically rebellious" constructions. Stock metaphors like "irony followed her like a personal shadow" and "drug and a poison simultaneously" flatten texture. The final paragraph loops "traverse" and "clover melancholy" without new pressure. Information density is moderate; some sentences advance multiple jobs, but scaffold sentences about her mission and approach dilute momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—probability professor's gambler daughter decoding subway equations—offers surface novelty but follows a familiar template of academic reflection on family trauma. The Fibonacci-encryption convergence feels convenient rather than inevitable. Emotional specificity is low; Elena's relationship to her father could be any dutiful child's. The ending hedges into safety ("something like peace") rather than committing to a bold stance. No risk elevates stakes or complicates the declared theme.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her role as probability professor colors narration but doesn't constrain action. The father's gambling appears only in backstory summary. She begins collecting subway scrawls and ends intending to continue—no turn driven by her specific contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lantern appears in three beats: research desk, Elena touches the mica pane, and she packs it up. However, its function is atmospheric rather than causal—it could be any light source. The mica pane is handled but doesn't enable or constrain a choice. Grandfather provenance adds texture but no pressure. Present across the piece but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is stated three times as a label but never dramatized as a stake-shaping force. The concept is described (father's gambling vs. her theory, intuition vs. mathematics) rather than enacted through conflicting on-page choices. It functions as thematic decoration, not a driver of action or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is introduced as a label—"questioning established axioms not to defy convention but to expose where intuition and mathematics diverged"—but never shown through a visible trade-off or constrained choice. It's told in exposition with no on-page cost or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears in past habitual (she traverses Moscow each evening documenting scrawls) and future intention (she will traverse again tomorrow). It frames the piece but doesn't create a turn—Elena's evening routine continues unchanged. The action is present across beats but could be replaced with "search" or "collect" without altering structure. Early signal and closure callback lift it to mid-band, but no causal hinge depends on this exact verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Cryptic subway scrawls appear in setup (she's been collecting them for months) and tonight's Fibonacci discovery drives her to the library. However, the interpretation method is never shown—we're told the sequence "wasn't random" but don't see her decode it. The mechanics remain vague. Present in two beats but its process doesn't shape tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer anchors the single on-page scene and supplies the research desk and quiet for reflection. "Midsummer" ties to the "clover melancholy" tone (longest days moving toward diminishment). However, the library is generic; it could be her apartment or office without loss. The rain and season provide texture but don't constrain Elena's choice. Early anchor, closure presence, but micro-setting role is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the heart attack" is mentioned four times, framing the three-month window and her mission's crystallization. It provides emotional backstory and motivates her desire to help her father understand probability. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten present decisions—no clock pressures her tonight. It's setup without escalation through the middle or cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To widen perspectives responsibly" is stated as her mission post-heart-attack and echoed in the final reflection about "acknowledging the beautiful uncertainty." It's told rather than tested: no on-page moment forces her to choose between widening her father's view and another cost. The desire exists as summary, not dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is introduced mid-piece as "that particular blend of happiness and longing that always arrived when days were longest but moving toward diminishment" and returns in the final paragraph. The tone is coherent across reflection but doesn't modulate with pressure—there is no pressure escalation to test it. The image charges the ending through lyric reprise, lifting it just into mid-band despite static application.</comment>
