<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated early ("to discover what walls dream about") but her interior life reads as generic wonder and thrill rather than character-particular contradiction. The discovery sequence progresses without visible cost or internal conflict; she moves from chamber to negative to lab in smooth succession. The final commitment ("weight of legacy's burden") is asserted rather than earned through on-page choice that forecloses a path. Therapy-speak intrudes at key beats: "sensitively perceptive," "legacy's burden," and "accumulated consciousness" flatten rather than embody experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece follows a causal chain (passage → chamber → diaries → negative → lab development → realization) with motivated progression. However, the closure unit—Elara's understanding and commitment—lacks on-page cost; she simply "realized" and "committed" without forfeiting a tangible option or enduring visible friction. The film's revelation arrives cleanly but doesn't narrow her choices or impose a felt price in the final image. One meaningful tightening (discovery of Thorne's work) occurs, but the ending restates theme rather than landing a decisive change or reconfiguration with demonstrable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is sketched with selective detail (stone, vines, fireplace) and returns in the developed negative, creating a visual reprise. The chamber's fireplace supplies the diaries, so setting enables discovery. However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates her movement; she kneels, extracts, returns to the lab without spatial friction. The body and tools (recording device, developing solution) appear but do not pressure tactics. Sensory detail is present but not character-filtered or urgent. The passage's pristine-versus-reclaimed contrast charges the conceptual frame but does not alter Elara's on-page options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding architectural memory—is signaled early and pursued across beats. Discovery of the diaries and negative constitutes a reversal that deepens knowledge. Yet escalation is informational rather than pressure-driven; Elara encounters no obstacle, trade-off, or cost. The lab development yields insight smoothly with no failed attempt or forfeited path. The final commitment is declared without on-page demonstration of what she must surrender or endure. Agency is observational; her choices (kneel, extract, develop) advance plot but lack visible consequence that narrows later options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme—walls as repositories of memory, the burden of preserving lost civilization—emerges through diary content and the film's bridge between sonic and visual records. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "what walls dream about is the accumulated consciousness" and "something far more valuable than mere knowledge—she found connection." These statements replace scene pressure with thesis summary. The film negative functions more as symbol than causal object; its meaning is announced rather than discovered through friction. The ending offers connection as tidy resolution without ambiguity or conceptual cost, flattening thematic complexity into a consoling epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is generally clear, though several phrases ("sensitively perceptive," "legacy's burden," "accumulated consciousness") drift into expository register outside the immediate narrative texture. Elara's perceptual signature—focused on sound and vibration—appears in early beats but fades during the lab sequence. No dialogue is present. The prose shifts toward summary at closure ("she recognized," "she realized") rather than showing decision through embodied action. Sentence rhythm is functional but lacks variation under emotional pressure; syntactic patterns become predictable in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple line-level issues accumulate: paraphrase loops ("The passage had once been a grand hallway... now reclaimed" restates the opening's "ivy-veiled passage"), template cadence in early paragraphs ("Her motivation... her profession... her equipment"), and stock phrasing ("her heart quickened," "with trembling hands," "made her breath catch"). The final paragraph stacks near-synonyms ("legacy's burden" × 2, "dreams of walls" × 2) and tells rather than shows the thematic claim. Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation: "she realized," "she recognized," "she understood." Clarity is maintained, but information density is low; several beats could compress. The paraphrase loop and template cadence in early beats, plus summary phrasing in the closure paragraph, disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "echo cartographer mapping architectural memory" premise offers a fresh occupational hook, and the post-climate-shift reclamation setting adds specificity. However, the emotional arc—lone explorer discovers predecessor's work and embraces shared mission—follows a template inheritance plot without transformation. The film negative as key, the burned diaries, and the reflective ending all trend toward familiar genre moves. The conceptual bridge between sonic and visual memory is interesting but underexplored; it arrives as explanation rather than dramatic problem. No bold risk reshapes the expected trajectory; the ending delivers the consolation the premise telegraphs.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes three functional choices: press device to stone, extract diaries, develop negative. These choices advance discovery but lack visible cost or tactical constraint. Her decisions do not create reversals; each step proceeds smoothly to the next. The character's role is observational; she receives information rather than forcing turns through agency under pressure. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) but replaceable with a generic explorer archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The film negative appears at midpoint, is handled in the extraction beat, developed in the lab, and interpreted at closure—three distinct beats. It bridges sonic and visual memory, a specific property. However, its discovery is convenient (nestled between diary pages) and its development yields smooth revelation without complication. The negative's meaning is told in the final paragraphs rather than shown constraining a choice. Present in middle and ending gates; shapes two beats with modest causal pressure but no felt cost tied directly to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is named twice and frames the ending's commitment, but it operates as theme label rather than on-page stake. The concept does not constrain Elara's choices or impose visible cost; she embraces it without friction. Thorne's abrupt diary ending suggests prior stakes, but Elara's inheritance of the burden is declared, not dramatized through sacrifice or tactical shift. Present in setup (Thorne's work) and ending (explicit claim) but does not alter tactics or options in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is asserted in paragraph one as a character trait but never demonstrated through on-page action with cost. Her ability to detect subtle resonances is told rather than shown constraining a choice or enabling a tactic others could not perform. The trait does not prevent her from any action or force a trade-off. Label-only mention without functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Glimpse" as the major action occurs in the lab development beat when the image emerges, a pivotal moment that redefines her understanding. The text explicitly frames it: "she was able to glimpse something that made her breath catch." This action is signaled (developing the negative) and its result (pristine passage with symbols) drives the thematic realization at closure. However, the glimpse does not narrow options or impose cost; it delivers insight smoothly. Present in middle and ending, shapes the turn to understanding, but the ease of revelation limits causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are discovered at the one-third mark, extracted and read in the chamber beat, and their content (Thorne's phenomena, abrupt ending) primes the quest for the film negative. The method's mechanics—partial charring, legible text, smudged ink—matter to the discovery and add urgency. The diaries enable the negative's extraction (nestled between pages) and frame the thematic inheritance. Signaled early, used across two beats (chamber, interpretation), and their content directly shapes closure understanding. Strong integration with visible causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is named in the opening line, serves as the discovery location (side chamber), and returns in the developed negative showing its pristine state. The setting enables the find but does not constrain movement or force a tactical choice. Elara navigates it without friction; spatial properties do not alter her approach. The pristine-versus-reclaimed contrast charges the conceptual frame at closure but does not pressure an on-page decision. Present in all three gates with thematic reprise but lacks micro-setting pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" anchors the world state and explains the vegetation reclamation, appearing in the opening and referenced at closure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; no clock pressures her exploration. The shifts are backstory context rather than live constraint. The phrase recurs but does not alter tactics or impose cost. Functional world-building but passive integration; swappable with other environmental catastrophe frames.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To discover what walls dream about" is stated as motivation in paragraph one and answered explicitly at closure ("what walls dream about is the accumulated consciousness"). The desire drives her exploration and frames the thematic resolution. However, the motivation is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No on-page friction between this desire and competing needs; she pursues it smoothly. Present in setup and ending with thematic bracket but lacks choice-level conflict or trade-off in middle beats.</comment>
