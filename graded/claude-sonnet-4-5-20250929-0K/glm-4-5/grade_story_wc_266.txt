<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maris as protagonist is present and drives the key choice to enter the waterfall, but her interior life remains largely abstract—"understanding washing over her" is told epiphany rather than embodied contradiction. The realization about courage is delivered as sudden clarity without on-page friction or prior misbelief to dramatize. The guides as collective lack individual differentiation; their shared journey dilutes individual agency and the final choice costs nothing visible on the page—they simply receive dragons and return unchanged.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "who" anchors by ~200 words, "where" remains vague throughout (mist-locked passages, invisible shore, veiled ridgeway are interchangeable abstractions), triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—dense imagery building to the dragon chamber—but the closure lacks decisive cost: receiving dragons is passive acceptance, not choice that forecloses a path. The "vigil complete" declares closure without showing visible consequence or altered stance. Causality is present but thin; the star stamp heats and pulls them forward without clear because/therefore linkage to their earlier actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting is lush but generic: "mist-locked passages," "veiled ridgeway," "liquid twilight" could describe any liminal fantasy realm. The ticket punch recurs and pulses, creating a small constraint (they follow its heat), lifting the score above ornamental. Spatial choreography is vague—boats form a circle, then pass through a waterfall into a chamber, but distances and transitions lack concrete anchors. The black sand shoreline and double-mooned sky are vivid but arrive late and do not shape choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where unused courage waits"—is abstract and declared rather than dramatized through a concrete goal under pressure. No visible obstacle resists them; the journey is atmospheric glide without friction. The star stamp heating provides mild directional pressure, but no reversal or complication narrows their options. The climax is discovery (sleeping dragons) followed by passive receipt; agency is observation, not decision. Cost is absent—they gain dragons and return to resume their positions with no visible trade-off or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of dormant courage emerges through the dragon chamber image, which reweights the earlier "unused courage" premise with specificity. The final realization—"we become the ferry guides of courage"—is stated rather than shown through choice. The ticket punch as motif recurs and shifts meaning (fare verification → marking hearts), providing purposeful reprise. However, the ending remains conceptually tidy without moral ambiguity; the discovery answers the thematic question without friction or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through Maris without head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"gentle persistence," "shoreline lullaby," "chambers of the soul"—creating a lyric, fable-like register. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature specific to Maris; phrases like "wisdom favored the winding way" read as narrator commentary rather than her embodied thought. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the guides' speech ("We should begin now," "Remember") lacks individual idiom or subtext. Psychic distance remains stable but slightly remote, preventing full immersion in Maris's interior struggle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences ("Balancing their small boats...") alternating with shorter declaratives. Figurative language is dense—"boundary between worlds grew thin as silk," "glimmered like fish in deep waters," "waterfall of liquid twilight"—but patterns repeat: metaphors of thinness, veiling, and luminosity appear in most beats without escalation. Template cadence emerges in mid-section: "They followed... they reached... they guided..." runs across three beats (−0.4). Clarity remains high; no loops or scaffold obscure causality. Paraphrase appears once: "traverse" echoes across multiple lines without added pressure (−0.2).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ferry-guides-as-courage-carriers premise offers a fresh inflection on psychopomp mythology, and the star-stamp-as-soul-marker detail is specific. However, the execution follows familiar beats: liminal journey → symbolic chamber → realization → return. The sleeping-dragons-as-dormant-courage conceit is inventive but arrives late and resolves without friction. Emotional truth is diluted by abstraction; "unused courage" remains conceptual rather than tied to a character's lived fear or renunciation. The transformation test reveals generic bones—swap "courage" for another virtue and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ferry guides appear early (setup), drive the traversal (development), and receive dragons at closure (payoff). However, agency is collective and observational; Maris's key act is punching the air with the stamp, which reveals the waterfall—this constrains one choice (to enter). The guides do not face internal conflict or cost; they move as a unified group without individual friction. Causal pressure is mild; the element shapes two beats (punching tickets, entering the chamber) but the guides' choices do not narrow options or demonstrate visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ticket punch with star stamp appears early (Maris clutches it), is used in two distinct beats (punching guides' tickets, stamping the air to reveal the waterfall), and its meaning shifts at closure (fare verification → marking hearts ready for courage). The object constrains one key choice (following its heat/pulse directs the journey; stamping the air opens the hidden cavern). However, the transformation is told in the final realization rather than dramatized through cost. Specificity is high—star-shaped indentation, silver surface, pulsing like a miniature star—and the object could not be swapped without altering closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vigil is mentioned early ("kept their vigil") and referenced at closure ("The vigil complete"), framing the journey. However, it functions as thematic label rather than constraint on tactics; the vigil does not shape what the guides do or trade off. Twilight appears in "twilight hours" and "liquid twilight" but remains atmospheric. The concept reads as mood rather than stake; removing "vigil" would leave the journey intact. Late reprise at closure (−0.3 for swappability).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is stated early ("gentle persistence of tides") and reprised at closure ("With the gentle persistence that defined them"). However, the trait is label-only; it does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost. The guides glide through the journey without friction that tests their persistence; no moment shows them enduring resistance or choosing patience over haste. The attribute colors tone but does not alter tactics or reveal trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Traverse" is the dominant action, repeated across multiple beats: "traverse the veiled ridgeway," "traverse back through indirect routes." It shapes the journey structure (development) and appears at closure. However, the action is generic—"travel" or "journey" could substitute with minor edits, capping at mid-band. Traversal does not create a key turn or cost; it is method rather than choice. The guides traverse without obstacle or visible friction, reducing causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is stated early ("travel through indirect routes, never the straight path") and reprised at closure ("traversed back through indirect routes"). The method is thematic—"wisdom favored the winding way"—but does not constrain tactics; the text does not show the guides choosing a longer path over a shortcut or paying a cost for indirection. The mechanics of "indirect" remain abstract; no on-page beat demonstrates how winding paths alter their approach or options. Lyric reprise lifts the score slightly, but the element remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Veiled ridgeway" appears early, recurs in mid-journey ("winding through the veiled ridgeway where lost possibilities glimmered"), and is mentioned at closure ("the veiled ridgeway parting before them"). The setting is named but not explored; it does not supply resources or obstacles that shape choice. Spatial details are vague—"passages," "clearing in the mist," "shoreline of black sand"—and do not constrain movement or tactics. The ridgeway functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure. Three-gate presence and recurring mentions prevent lower score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" is signaled early as inciting event ("Tonight was special, for it was after the leash broke") and reflected at closure ("After the leash breaks, we become the ferry guides of courage"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the journey unfolds without clock pressure or consequence for delay. The "leash" is conceptual—"magical tether that had bound the ferry service for centuries"—but the text does not show what constraints it imposed or what new options breaking it opened. The element frames context but does not shape tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits" is the stated mission, present in setup ("their mission was personal"), developed through the search ("following [the star stamp's] pull"), and answered at closure (dragon chamber). The motivation drives the journey but remains abstract; no on-page beat shows conflicting wants or costs that test the guides' commitment. The desire is told rather than dramatized through friction—no moment where a guide hesitates, doubts, or trades off something to continue. Closure linkage and causal involvement across three beats lift the score, but lack of internal conflict or visible cost caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" appears early ("shoreline lullaby of waves licking stone"), recurs mid-journey ("the shoreline lullaby that had accompanied their journey"), and is implied at closure ("The shoreline lullaby continued"). The tone is lyric and consistent—gentle, meditative, dreamlike—and modulates minimally (discovery of dragons adds wonder but no sharp tonal shift). However, the lullaby does not charge the final image with pressure or cost; it remains atmospheric. The phrase is specific and recurring, preventing lower score, but the tone does not deepen stakes or reveal friction at closure.</comment>
