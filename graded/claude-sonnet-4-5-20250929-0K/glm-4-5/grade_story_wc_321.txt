<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Liam's motivation is declared ("childhood accident that had split his existence") but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His "resiliently positive" trait remains label-only; no on-page moment shows him suppressing doubt or paying a cost for optimism. The translucent passengers and Captain Althea appear as props without applying pressure or forcing trade-offs. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("permanent transient," "ardent dedication") rather than concrete, character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern and imagery accumulation), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—beats simply stack without reweighting stakes or narrowing options. The grotto arrival and hourglass-filling sequence offers no visible cost or foreclosed path; the "miracle" is asserted, not earned. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late and remain vague (multiple timelines, spectral grotto mechanics unexplained). The ending declares wholeness without demonstrating what Liam forfeited or how the merger altered his present stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Setting details (translucent hull, liquid starlight, frozen time stalactites) are vivid but ornamental—they never constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The grotto's "ancient chronal energy" and three moons exist as postcards, not pressure. Spatial choreography remains coherent (ferry to grotto, two vessels converging) but the micro-setting (radio, control panel patterns, hourglass) is handled without consequence. No environmental detail charges the final image or narrows Liam's options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("merge parallel timelines") is declared but never tested on the page—no reversal, no complication, no live price. The ferry arrives at the grotto, the counterpart appears, the hourglass fills, and success is granted without dramatized risk or trade-off. Liam's optimism faces no friction from crew fears or timeline physics. Coincidence (the moons, the grotto's pulse) enables resolution rather than complicating it. No escalation under the Accumulative lens; the sequence is additive decoration without pressure increase or cost legibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme (fractured selves seeking wholeness, time as malleable) is stated outright ("taught time itself new patterns," "fractured selves now whole") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The hourglass recurs but its meaning is explained, not earned through evolving use. The ending moralizes ("they would simply live more authentic lives") instead of offering a resonant image. No ambiguity or counter-reading; the text declares triumph without thematic friction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Liam, but diction veers into expository summary ("a permanent transient who could now move freely through united realities") and therapy-speak ("resiliently positive," "authentic lives"). Perceptual signature is generic—Liam notices what the plot requires, not what his role as deckhand/time-traveler would bias him toward. Dialogue with Captain Althea is functional but carries no subtext or tension. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "understood") stack without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "vanishing ferry" / "disappeared every night," "patterns glowed brighter" / "interconnected patterns," "permanent transient" repeated verbatim across beats. Template cadence dominates ("He wore... He picked up... He watched... He adjusted..."). Stock metaphors clutter peak moments ("liquid starlight," "lover returning from a long absence"). Figurative density in the grotto sequence (stalactites of frozen time, waters containing memories, moons representing past/present/future) obscures causality without pattern-teaching. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for pervasive artifacts; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Core premise (parallel-timeline ferry, time-traveler deckhand) draws heavily from portal-fantasy and multiverse templates without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "spectral grotto" and "hourglass filling with sand" are stock genre images. No risk-taking; the story hedges toward safe median choices (optimistic hero, tidy convergence, passengers saved). The ending's "miracle" and "authentic lives" echo countless reconciliation fantasies. Apply derivative premise adjustment: −1.0 in Q8 for untransformed template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Liam is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or cost. He adjusts the throttle, radios coordinates, and removes the hourglass—all scripted moves without friction or trade-off. Observation without decision dominates; his role is passive receptacle for the convergence rather than agent forcing it. Missing middle development (no choice that narrows options) and weak closure participation (the hourglass fills on its own). Cap at 2.8 per missing closure-participation gate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hourglass appears in beat one (worn on thong), recurs mid-story ("empty hourglass was meant to hold sand"), and figures in the ending (fills with two-color sand). However, its function is ornamental—Liam does not use it to solve a problem or make a choice; it passively receives the timeline-merge effect. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but ornamental use −0.8 and swappability −0.4 (any symbol could serve). Rounds to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The vanishing ferry is present throughout but functions as setting backdrop rather than stake-shaping constraint. It vanishes on schedule, transforms on cue, and arrives at the grotto without complication—world mechanics, not character pressure. Setup present +0.6, three beats +1.4, but swappable with any magical-transport device −0.8 and no causal pressure −1.0. Rounds to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is label-only. Liam is described as optimistic and his reply to Althea asserts it ("I am resiliently positive"), but no on-page moment shows him suppressing doubt, choosing hope over caution, or paying a price for his outlook. Missing middle development and closure participation. Ornamental −1.0, label-only trait −0.3, late intro (second para as descriptor) −0.3. Rounds to 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Radio use bookends the story: Liam calls Althea early, radios coordinates mid-sequence, and presses the button "one last time" to signal convergence. However, the radio does not create a turn or face interference—it simply transmits information. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but swappable with any comm device −0.6 and no causal pressure (no signal failure, no choice required) −1.0. Rounds to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" appear on the control panel (Liam traces them, they glow, respond to touch), recur as "patterns indicate success," and are invoked in the convergence sequence. Yet the mechanics remain unexplained decoration—patterns glow but never constrain a choice or fail. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, but ornamental −1.0, summary-only use −0.4, and swappable with "magic interface" −0.6. Rounds to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The spectral grotto is the climax location (stalactites, pulsing energy, three moons) but supplies no resource and poses no obstacle—it is a stage for the hourglass-filling, not a pressure source. Setup (signaled early as destination) +0.6, closure presence +0.7, but postcard description without tactical constraint −1.2. Rounds to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is a thematic phrase invoked once ("a place existing only when clocks run sideways") with no on-page effect. Time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the ferry departs and arrives on a vague schedule. Missing setup (appears in middle third), missing development, weak closure tie (not referenced at ending). Late intro −0.4, ornamental −1.0, summary-only −0.4. Rounds to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Liam's motivation to merge timelines is told in exposition ("stemmed from a childhood accident") and asserted ("his ardent dedication had paid off") but never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. He never hesitates, sacrifices an alternative, or confronts doubt. Setup +0.6, three beats (intro, grotto, ending) +1.4, but told-only friction −1.2 and no on-page trade-off −1.0. Rounds to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is repeated verbatim three times as label; tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. The phrase describes Liam's state but does not constrain choice or evolve meaning. Setup +0.6, closure mention +0.7, but static mood −0.8, label-only use −0.3, template phrasing −0.3. Rounds to 3.8.</comment>
