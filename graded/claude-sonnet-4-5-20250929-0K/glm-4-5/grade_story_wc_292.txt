<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is clear (honoring ancestor) but internal contradiction is thin—nervous confidence is labeled repeatedly rather than enacted through simultaneous conflicting impulses. The climactic choice to activate the system feels undercooked; we see no visible struggle between competing goods, just a deep breath and initiation. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("spongey dread," "nervous confidence") without embodied particulars. Dr. Aris is functional but exerts little genuine pressure; her skepticism dissolves too quickly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with late Accumulative elements (coded stanzas, coffin nail). Orientation anchors arrive within bounds. The closure—initiating the ancestor's system—occurs on the page, but felt cost is vague: Eli prepares to "question decades of meteorological consensus" without showing what personal or professional path is foreclosed. The reversible-exile theme is asserted in dialogue rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off. One meaningful tightening (discovery of hidden controls) is present, but the stakes remain conceptual rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The weather station setting is vivid (concrete walls, damp chill, blue-lit panels) and the coffin nail recurs across beats, anchoring the closure image. However, the environment does not constrain Eli's choices—tools and systems respond conveniently when needed. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting supports atmosphere but does not pressure tactics, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring ancestor, understanding weather chaos) is signaled early. Escalation is thin: Eli decodes journals, finds hidden controls, and activates them with minimal friction. No reversal narrows options; the copper nail fits the panel on first try, and Dr. Aris's skepticism evaporates. The initiation moment lacks visible cost—no shown consequence of failure, no trade-off between competing goods. "Spongey dread" shifts to action without dramatized internal resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The reversible-exile theme is articulated clearly but depends on dialogue and summary rather than scene pressure. The copper nail and coded stanzas recur, but their thematic weight is told ("His exile was reversible, not just in reputation but in purpose") rather than earned through image. The final beat gestures toward consequence ("challenge everything the scientific community believed") but offers no non-literal answer or resonant ambiguity. The piece leans toward prompt-echo rather than emergent complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable. Narrative distance and tense are consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("institutional blindness," "overwhelming responsibility") that feels writerly rather than character-lived. Dialogue is functional but on-the-nose; Dr. Aris's lines serve exposition more than subtext. Perceptual signature is thin—Eli's way of noticing weather and family history does not differ sharply from default narrator voice. No head-hopping; no major filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "The spongey dread had settled… The spongey dread in the room had shifted"; "reversible technology… reversible… reversible"; "experimental weather station" appears four times. Figurative language is stock ("spongey dread," "copper nail… talisman and burden"). Sentence openings repeat ("The experimental weather station," "The shipwrecked journals," "Their…"). Information density is moderate; many lines restate rather than advance. Applying cumulative artifact penalties: −1.2 for loops, stems, and stock metaphor density across the piece.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise (ancestor's suppressed weather-control tech, coded journals, reversible climate shift) follows a familiar template: overlooked visionary, hidden blueprint, vindication quest. The copper-nail-as-key and stanza-decoding add specificity, but execution does not transform the armature—plot and arc would survive transplant to other settings. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus. Freshness is modest; the piece reads competent but derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Eli (idealistic map librarian) is present throughout and makes the final initiation choice, but that decision is underwritten—no visible trade-off or cost. Middle beats involve decoding and discovery without tactical constraint. The character shapes turns functionally but could be swapped for another researcher archetype with minor edits. Causal role in one major beat (activation), but the choice feels automatic rather than agonized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in beat one (pendant), beat middle (pressed to panel indentation), and closure (warm against skin during activation). It enables the climactic unlock and recurs with shifting symbolic weight (talisman → key → witness). However, its physical properties are convenient rather than earned—why does it fit the indentation? Swappability is moderate; any heirloom token could serve. Two-beat involvement and closure linkage push it into mid-6s, but specificity and cost are thin.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Reversible exile is the thematic spine: ancestor's professional exile, environmental exile (jet stream shift), and the possibility of reversal through the hidden tech. The concept shapes the dominant stake and is articulated in the climax ("His exile was reversible"). However, it remains largely asserted rather than dramatically tested—no on-page cost of attempting reversal, no friction between personal vindication and scientific responsibility. Present across beats but does not narrow tactical options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" is labeled three times ("nervously confident," "nervous confidence," "fingers trembled with their usual nervous confidence") but rarely constrains action. Eli proceeds steadily through decoding and activation; the trait does not generate a visible mistake or trade-off. It colors mood without altering choice. Label-only use without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Question" appears in the ending: Eli prepares to "question decades of meteorological consensus." The act of questioning shapes the thematic posture but is not dramatized—no on-page confrontation, no shown consequence. Easily replaced by "challenge" or "overturn" with identical effect. The action is promised rather than performed, limiting its causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals are signaled early and recur: Eli decodes them across years, finds the blueprint, and follows instructions to activate the system. The method matters mechanically (decoding yields the copper-nail instruction) and pressures Eli's credibility with colleagues. Present in setup, middle (decoding), and closure (following instructions). The journals are indispensable to plot logic. Two-beat involvement and closure linkage with moderate specificity earn solid mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is anchored early, supplies atmosphere (damp chill, concrete walls, hidden panels), and houses the climactic tech. Setting enables the activation but does not constrain Eli's choices—equipment responds as needed. Micro-setting (control panel) matters at closure. The station is essential to logistics but does not generate tactical friction. Present across all three gates; functional rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the jet stream shifts" frames the premise and drives the research mission, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page. No live clock; Eli has worked "for years" without urgency until the moment of activation. The shift provides backstory stakes but does not alter present tactics. Setup and thematic presence without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Honoring the ancestor's bravery is Eli's stated motivation, present from the opening (coffin nail) through closure (activation of the ancestor's system). The desire drives the research and final choice, but internal conflict is thin—no friction between personal duty and scientific caution, no visible cost of prioritizing family legacy over career safety. Motivation is clear and consistent but not dramatized under pressure. Two-beat causal role without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is named twice and described as settling and shifting, but the tone does not modulate with pressure—dread remains static from decoding through activation. No cadence shift or tonal charge at closure; the initiation proceeds with a "deep breath" rather than visceral dread. The tone is asserted rather than enacted through syntax, image, or sensory degradation. Present but does not shape the final image.</comment>
