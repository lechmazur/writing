<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's face-blindness is presented as character color but never constrains a choice or creates internal contradiction under pressure. Her "methodical approach" remains label-only; the reconstruction feels algorithmic rather than driven by contradictory impulses. The final leap to "the slight body frame of Julian's assistant matching the struggle patterns" arrives without prior dramatized groundwork, reading as convenience rather than earned insight. Motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" is declared but never tested against a competing want or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when cleanly and moves through investigative beats with causal links (ribbon → mask design → custom order → assistant). However, closure relies on off-page confession rather than an on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. The final image ("empathy never truly disappears") offers thematic summary instead of a charged moment that reweights prior material. Drive lens reads as Causal but the ending replaces scene pressure with exposition, weakening the closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quarry anchors location early with vivid sensory detail ("granite face met the morning fog," "furrowed hush"). The ribbon fragment is handled twice (extraction, comparison) and the terrain's angles are measured, but neither the quarry's geography nor the ribbon's physical properties constrain Elena's choices in a peak beat. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure point. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the cold case—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens through elimination (guest list → three sources → one custom mask commissioner), but the escalation is procedural rather than driven by protagonist agency under duress. The "sudden clarity" that identifies the assistant feels asserted rather than earned through prior groundwork. No visible cost appears on the page; the confession happens off-stage the following day, deflating the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of dormant justice and empathy is declared multiple times ("justice has been dormant," "empathy never truly disappears") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes with "empathy never truly disappears; it waits only to be awakened," replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The masquerade/anonymity motif is present but not reweighted at closure. The piece tells its theme rather than letting the ending image embody it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is suggested ("her fingers pausing," "hands remembered what her eyes couldn't discern") but diction doesn't consistently reflect Elena's artist lens under pressure—much of the investigation reads in neutral procedural register. Dialogue with Reyes is functional and advances plot without subtext. Free indirect style is clean, though some phrases ("furrowed hush" repeated verbatim) feel inserted rather than organic to Elena's interior voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean with varied sentence structure. However, several scaffold loops appear: "furrowed hush" recurs identically without reweighting, "methodical" is restated multiple times without demonstration, and the final paragraph stacks thematic declarations ("Justice has been dormant," "empathy never truly disappears") that paraphrase the same sentiment. Stock phrases like "uncanny accuracy" and "countless witnesses" dilute specificity. Information density is adequate but peaks with exposition rather than concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The face-blind detective premise offers surface novelty but the story executes it as decorative trait rather than transforming investigative procedure. The case follows a standard cold-case template: overlooked physical clue → cross-reference → deduction → confession. The masquerade/anonymity angle and the "unifying opposites" method are mentioned but not dramatized in ways that feel inevitable to this exact premise. Emotional specificity is limited; the resolution could transfer to a different investigator without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Face-blind portrait artist is established early and present across beats, but the condition never constrains a tactical choice or creates friction. Elena's reconstruction skill is told rather than shown; the leap to identifying the assistant's "slight body frame" feels asserted. The trait colors her worldview ("saw the world through shapes, shadows, and textures") but doesn't drive key decisions differently than a standard detective would. Setup and development present; payoff is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment is extracted and examined (beat one), then cross-referenced with mask descriptions (beat two), and its torn state proves struggle, leading to the custom-mask link (causal pressure). It appears in the setup, drives middle elimination work, and enables the final identification. However, the fragment itself is never charged with reweighted meaning at closure—it functions as static evidence rather than an image that transforms. Strong beat involvement and causal role, but no lyric reprise or closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cold case status is established early ("marked as unsolvable," "after the evidence disappears") and shapes the initial constraint (no physical proof). The twenty-year gap matters thematically but doesn't tighten on-page tactics—Elena's investigation proceeds as if evidence were fresh. The timeframe provides premise and atmosphere but doesn't alter mid-scene options or create a live clock. Setup clear, development functional, closure participation indirect (community closure mentioned but not dramatized).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is declared ("Her very methodical approach") and demonstrated through measuring, cross-referencing, and elimination, but the trait never forces a tradeoff or complicates a choice under pressure. It reads as unalloyed strength rather than a constraint that creates cost. The methodical process succeeds linearly without friction from intuition, time limits, or competing impulses. Present across beats but label-heavy; no visible cost tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Lance" appears once in dialogue ("I will lance through what others could not see") as metaphorical declaration, not as a performed action that creates a turn. The verb could be swapped with "cut," "pierce," or "see" without altering plot. No on-page moment where Elena's act of lancing—literal or figural—redefines options or stakes. Ornamental use only; closure does not hinge on this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"By unifying opposites" is mentioned early ("combining the analytical with the artistic, the forgotten with the prominent") but the method's mechanics never shape an investigative choice or complicate a beat. The final identification doesn't dramatize synthesis of opposites—it's a straightforward deduction (custom mask → one commissioner). The method is declared thematically but not operationalized. Setup present, development and payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The shadowed quarry in mist anchors the opening and provides atmospheric pressure ("furrowed hush," "mist thickened around her"). Elena measures terrain angles and notes the ribbon's positioning relative to rock indentations, so the setting supplies investigative detail. However, the quarry's geography doesn't force a tactical choice or alter the outcome—the case is solved via documents (guest list, schematics) rather than site features. Setup strong, development present (terrain measurement), closure absent (resolution happens "the following day").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" frames the initial constraint (all physical proof stolen/destroyed) and the twenty-year anniversary is noted ("exactly twenty years ago tonight"). The timeframe creates thematic resonance but doesn't function as a live clock that alters tactics—Elena's two-hour wait for documents and the next-day confession proceed without urgency. Setup clear, but the temporal element doesn't tighten choices or charge the ending. Mid-band for premise role without escalation leverage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Motivation "to awaken dormant empathy in a community" is stated directly but never dramatized through a choice where Elena weighs this desire against a competing cost. The goal remains abstract; no on-page beat shows her sacrificing efficiency, safety, or another value to honor communal healing. The final claim ("gave a community the closure it had silently needed") is summary rather than embodied consequence. Told-only with no friction between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" is introduced early and repeated verbatim twice, establishing a somber, pressured atmosphere. Tone remains consistent through the investigation—no jarring shifts—but doesn't modulate meaningfully with escalation or charge the final image (which pivots to thematic summary). The phrase is static rather than evolving; its recurrence feels scaffolded rather than purposeful reprise. Coherent but mid-band for lack of tonal deepening at closure.</comment>
