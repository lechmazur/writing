<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal world is present but relies heavily on abstract labels ("ache," "meditation," "understanding"). The shift from mechanical repairer to metaphysical savant feels unmotivated by prior interiority—her epiphany arrives through contemplation rather than struggle with contradictory impulses. The mentor teaching moment and her patient listening are asserted personality traits rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to restructure perception filters lacks visible cost; no path is foreclosed, no capacity surrendered.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the cameras now capture phenomena beyond the visible spectrum—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than legible on the page. Orientation anchors appear by ~120 words (lunar observatory, Elara, tremors). Causality is loose: the spinning hand's message unfolds through contemplation rather than because/therefore linkage, and the solution (tuning perception filters) emerges from offstage meditation rather than on-page tactical narrowing. One tightening occurs (hand slows as she adjusts equipment), but the stakes never visibly narrow options or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lunar observatory is vivid in opening anchors (clouds below, moon in viewport, observation deck), and the clock as micro-object recurs across beats. However, setting does not constrain Elara's choices—she could perform the same contemplation and adjustment in any high-tech facility. The clock's placement outside "away from artificial sounds" gestures toward environmental pressure but the method revelation is auditory metaphor ("sound of a leaf falling") rather than spatial or material constraint. Sensory detail is present but largely ornamental; the round moon and cloud-ocean are postcard images that do not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stopping the tremors by understanding the clock—is signaled early. Escalation is mild: Elara tries "various methods" (summarized, not dramatized) and then places the clock outside for a single contemplative night. The reversal (clock isn't broken, it's attuned) arrives via epiphany rather than a choice under pressure. Agency is present in her decision to restructure perception filters, but no visible price is paid—no tool sacrificed, no relationship strained, no prior plan abandoned. The head astronomer's skepticism dissolves without friction. Accumulative deepening occurs (tremors subside through alignment), but cost legibility is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—transcending limited perception to observe the ephemeral—emerges organically from the clock, tremors, and Elara's work. The final image (cameras capturing luminous energy patterns) offers a non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans on abstract vocabulary ("ephemeral," "luminous ache," "quantum fluctuations") that declares profundity rather than earning it through concrete particulars. The mentor's aphorism ("universe spoke in whispers") borders on platitude. Subtext is thin; the resolution is stated ("speed required to transcend perception") rather than implied through image and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Elara. Voice carries an elevated, lyric register ("luminous ache," "changelessly constant," "leathered the boundaries") that remains consistent but occasionally drifts toward ornamental vocabulary outside a camera repairer's working lexicon. The astronomer's brief dialogue ("We must restructure the stabilization matrix") serves function but lacks subtext. Perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices beauty and mechanics but without idiosyncratic bias. Filter verbs and abstract phrasing ("bordered on meditation," "spoke of escape velocity") dull immediacy at peak beats. Internal thought formatting is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, but several phrases loop or paraphrase: "luminous ache" appears three times, "changelessly constant" twice, "ephemeral" recurs without adding pressure. Abstract nouns cluster heavily ("precision," "meditation," "recognition," "alignment," "resonance," "profundity"). The spinning hand is described multiple ways (ceaseless rotation, furious hand, spinning hand) with synonym churn rather than fresh detail. Figurative language is dense in contemplative passages ("speak in whispers," "ocean of darkness," "leathered the boundaries") without on-page payoff in choice. Scaffold phrases like "the realization unfolded" and "causing an ache of recognition" tell state rather than showing through action. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate theme without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—mysterious tremors solved through attunement rather than force—offers a familiar metaphysical angle (listening vs. acting, harmony vs. control). The spinning clock hand as diagnostic tool has potential specificity, but its resolution through "perception filters" remains abstract and unexplained. Elara's sage-repairer role and the lunar observatory setting are functional but not transformed through lived detail or non-obvious choices. The epiphany structure (days of failed attempts, then sudden insight during contemplation) follows a well-worn template. Emotional specificity is low; "luminous ache" is repeated as a tonal marker rather than embodied through contradictory action. The transformation test suggests moderate swappability: similar beats could occur in a different facility with different instruments.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in all beats and her choice to restructure perception filters drives the resolution. However, her decisions emerge from offstage contemplation ("various methods," meditation on the deck) rather than on-page tactical pivots under pressure. She is present throughout but much of her key realization happens in summary. Causal pressure is moderate; the astronomer's proposed solution (force) is rejected in favor of her insight (resonance), creating one meaningful turn. Cost is absent—no tool, relationship, or prior plan is sacrificed to implement the new approach.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The clock hand appears in three distinct beats: tumbles during tremor (discovery), Elara attempts to still it over days (middle use), placed outside and eventually slows as she tunes equipment (closure participation). Its spinning is tied to the tremors and its slowing marks resolution. However, the clock's mechanics remain abstract—"attuned to vibrations others couldn't sense"—and its specific properties (why this clock, why now) are not explored. The hand's return at closure reweights prior material but the causal linkage is thin; it serves as metaphor more than tool. Swappability is moderate; another diagnostic instrument could serve similar function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Escape velocity" is introduced as metaphor in paragraph two ("spoke of escape velocity—of breaking free") and restated near the end ("not escape velocity in the physical sense… speed required to transcend perception"). It frames theme but does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page. Elara does not calculate velocity, test thresholds, or face a physical barrier requiring speed. The concept remains ornamental—a thematic label rather than a stake that shapes her moves. No cost is tied to achieving or failing to achieve escape velocity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" describes the spinning hand twice ("changelessly constant frenzy," "changelessly constant spinning"). It characterizes the problem but does not enable or constrain action. Elara's methods are not shaped by the hand's constancy; she tries various approaches and eventually tunes filters without the trait imposing a visible trade-off. The attribute is label-only, restating the spinning without functional consequence. Removing "changelessly" would not alter plot or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Restructure" appears in three contexts: the astronomer proposes restructuring the stabilization matrix (rejected option), Elara realizes she must "restructure not the stabilizer but the perception filters" (key turn), and the final paragraph notes "they had restructured… their understanding" (closure echo). The action drives the resolution—tuning equipment to the clock's rhythms is the solution that stops tremors. However, the mechanics are abstract; we do not see what restructuring entails on the page, only its result. The action is essential but its specificity is low; "recalibrate" or "retune" could substitute with minor edits. Cost is absent; restructuring succeeds without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"By the sound of a leaf falling" appears once, in paragraph four, as the revelation Elara hears when she places the clock outside. It signals the method (delicate listening, subtle perception) but its mechanics do not shape prior attempts or later execution. We are told she "heard it" but not how this auditory metaphor translates into the technical work of tuning perception filters. The method is ornamental—a poetic image rather than a procedure that could succeed or fail with visible cost. It is introduced late (past midpoint) and resolves the problem it did not help create. Swappability is high; "through silence" or "in stillness" would serve the same thematic function.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lunar observatory is anchored early (elevated, silent, above clouds) and the observation deck outside is used in the revelation beat. However, setting does not pressure Elara's choices—her contemplation and equipment tuning could occur in any isolated facility. The moon and clouds provide atmosphere but do not supply resources or constraints that alter outcome. Micro-setting (the clock, the cameras) matters more than macro-setting. The observatory's elevation is thematic (close to stars yet separated) but does not force tactical trade-offs. Spatial choreography is clear but static; no movement through the space shapes stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When foundations shake" frames the inciting incident and recurs as pressure throughout ("erratic shaking," "tremors intensified," "tremors subsided"). The shaking creates urgency (equipment at risk, astronomer alarmed) and Elara's solution directly addresses it. However, time is not tightly tracked—"days" pass in summary, and the shaking's escalation pattern is asserted rather than dramatized beat-by-beat. The timeframe shapes the problem but does not impose a visible countdown or force Elara to choose speed over precision. The resolution (alignment) happens at an unspecified moment when her adjustments succeed. The shaking is essential but its temporal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is stated as the observatory's collective motivation in the final paragraph and implied throughout (capturing nebulae, observing phenomena). Elara's personal stake—understanding the clock to save the observatory—aligns with this broader goal. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Elara never faces friction between harness-the-ephemeral and a competing want (safety, recognition, ease). The motivation is consistent but lacks on-page cost; achieving it does not require her to sacrifice an alternative path. The phrase "to harness the ephemeral had always been the deepest motivation" is exposition, not enacted desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears three times across the story (paragraph two, four, six, eight) as a descriptor of Elara's emotional state and the final image. The tone is coherent—wistful, elevated, tinged with beauty and sadness—and modulates with contemplative pressure rather than action pressure. However, the phrase becomes a repeated label rather than evolving through embodied perception. At closure, the "luminous energy that seemed to ache with beauty" restates the tone without charging it through new cost or contradiction. The tone is static and asserted; it does not deepen under stress or shift when Elara's understanding changes. Removing one or two instances of "luminous ache" would not alter tonal impact, suggesting ornamental repetition.</comment>
