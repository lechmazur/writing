<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clearly stated but rarely tested on the page through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. His interiority relies heavily on abstract language ("cradle empathy in arms of steel," "aberrant mercy") rather than embodied emotion or character-particular perception. The ritual scene offers a moment of agency but the action feels preordained rather than genuinely chosen under pressure. The ending delivers a statement ("We are not the fire...") that tells rather than dramatizes his stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (ancient plaza, post-fire timeframe, Elias as focal character) within the first 120 words. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elias walks, finds the tessera, places it, performs the ritual, and speaks to witnesses—pressure accumulates through layered images and the naming act. Closure occurs when Elias renames "Samarkhand" and others witness the plaza respond, followed by his declarative speech and departure; this is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the ritual crystallizes his revolutionary stance. Cost is more conceptual than visceral—the piece asserts that "naming" reclaims the plaza but does not dramatize what Elias forfeits or risks in the act beyond his continued walking.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient plaza, shattered sky, cracked stones, and mosaic stepping stone are vividly rendered and anchor the story spatially. The minaret tessera functions as a recurring object that Elias handles twice (encounter, placement) and its blue-and-gold enamel charges the final image. Sensory selection is strong (dust, warm tessera, fractured light) and the environment subtly mirrors Elias's internal state. The mosaic's chipped patterns constrain his ritual method and the tessera's placement alters the visual field at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's mission to rebuild through naming and ritual—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when he places the tessera and performs the renaming, which others witness as transformative. However, the ritual's success feels declarative rather than earned through visible resistance or cost; no live option is foreclosed and no tactical trade-off is dramatized. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images rather than escalating conflict, appropriate for the Accumulative lens, but the cost at closure is more asserted than shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme (renewal through naming, empathy as revolutionary act) emerges from Elias's ritual and his final speech, avoiding heavy-handed moralizing until the last beats. The tessera and mosaic function as motifs that shift meaning from loss to potential. The final line "aberrant mercy was perhaps the most enduring form of strength" edges toward thematic summary but the earlier ritual grounds it in specific action. The piece invites reflection on post-disaster recovery and the power of reclamation, though the theme is somewhat abstract and the ending risks telling rather than resonating purely through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Elias's perceptions and memories. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy," "warm coldness") that fits the mythic tone but occasionally drifts into prompt-label territory rather than Elias's lived idiom. The single line of dialogue ("We are not the fire...") feels oracular and voice-consistent but lacks subtext or goal-driven tension. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping occurs, and the perceptual signature is selective (Elias sees ghosts, traces patterns others miss).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (cracked stones, warm tessera, fractured light). However, several passages loop conceptually: the opening paragraph establishes "retrocognitively trapped" and "ghosts of the past," then the next paragraph immediately restates "His mind constantly wandered to the time before." Stock phrases ("warm coldness," "cradle empathy in arms of steel") recur without fresh inflection. The final third stacks abstract descriptors ("aberrant mercy," "revolutionary kindness," "gentle radical's vision") that feel more like prompt fulfillment than character-driven language. Template cadence is minimal, but thematic label-speak in peak beats triggers a −0.6 deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a post-disaster ritual of renaming via mosaic repair—offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic recovery. The oxymoronic phrases ("gentle radical," "warm coldness," "aberrant mercy") feel manufactured rather than earned through specific events, reading more like prompt-label fulfillment than organic character voice. The ritual itself is vivid but the transformation (plaza responds, others feel history acknowledge survival) is asserted rather than dramatized with concrete sensory or social consequence. The piece commits to its mythic register but the ending speech and thematic summary reduce risk and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias as "gentle radical" is present throughout and his decision to place the tessera and perform the ritual constitutes a key turn. The trait is embodied in his slow gait, reverence, and the ritual act itself. He appears in the opening, drives the middle ritual beat, and delivers the closing speech, meeting all three gates. However, his choices feel preordained rather than genuinely conflicted; the "gentle radical" label is more asserted than tested through difficult trade-offs. The element shapes two beats (tessera placement, renaming speech) and participates in closure, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The minaret mosaic tessera is encountered early (first third), handled in the middle beat (placement into the mosaic), and gleams in the final image, meeting all three gates. It drives two distinct beats: discovery and ritual placement. The object's blue-and-gold enamel and "hidden meaning" are specific enough to resist easy swapping, and its placement enables the renaming ritual. The tessera's warmth under Elias's palm signals a transformation and it is present in the closure image, though its causal role could be stronger if the story dramatized what the placement costs Elias or why this exact tile matters beyond symbolic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is labeled explicitly twice and implied in Elias's ritual and final speech. The concept frames his motivation (giving names to places that lost them) and his stance at closure (mercy as enduring strength). However, the element functions more as thematic assertion than on-page pressure; it does not constrain Elias's options or create visible trade-offs. The story tells us Elias practices aberrant mercy but does not dramatize what makes it aberrant or costly. Present in setup (first third label) and closure (final paragraph restatement) but missing middle development where it would narrow tactics or force a choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced early (first paragraph) and informs Elias's perceptions throughout (seeing ghosts, remembering the plaza's past). It enables his ritual by grounding his knowledge of the old name and patterns. However, the trait does not constrain him or impose visible cost; it is a label-only attribute that enhances his mystique but never forces a difficult choice or tradeoff. The visions of families and merchants are summary-only and do not alter present tactics. Present in setup and implied in the ritual beat, but missing a middle moment where being "trapped" in memory costs him something in the present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The action "rename" is signaled in the middle beat ("his action required came naturally now, born of purpose and necessity: rename") and executed when Elias whispers "Samarkhand" twice, feeling the tessera warm and the air shift. This act drives the ritual's climax and is present in the closure sequence when others witness the plaza respond. The renaming is specific to Elias's mission and not easily swappable; removing it would collapse the story's central ritual. It shapes two beats (the act itself, the witnessed transformation) and is causally linked to the closure image of the gleaming tessera and transformed plaza.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method "via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" is introduced early (mosaic stepping stone at plaza's center) and its mechanics matter: Elias places the tessera into the mosaic, traces the chipped patterns, and uses them as a map/language to perform the ritual. The patterns are specific ("older than the city itself") and constrain his ritual approach. The method shapes the middle ritual beat and is present in the closure image (mosaic brighter, tessera embedded). However, the story could more clearly dramatize why this exact method (chipped patterns as map) is necessary rather than merely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky is established in the opening line and remains the sole location throughout. The setting supplies the mosaic stepping stone (ritual site), the minaret tessera (found object), and the spatial context for Elias's walk and gathering witnesses. The fractured sky mirrors the broken plaza and is reframed in the closure image as "a cathedral ceiling open to stars." The setting pressures the narrative by framing post-disaster scarcity and the need for renewal, and its transformation (plaza "renamed and reclaimed") is integral to closure. The setting participates in all three gates and its details (cracked stones, dust, broken archways) are consistently used.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the great fire" establishes a post-disaster timeframe that informs the entire narrative (ruins, silence, ash, survivors gathering). The temporal setting creates the initial condition (destroyed city needing renewal) and Elias's mission to rebuild. However, the fire is backstory rather than a live clock; no time pressure tightens Elias's decisions in the present scene. The element is present in setup (early paragraphs) and implied in closure (rising from ashes) but does not constrain tactics or escalate urgency in the middle beats. The timeframe is functional but largely static backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated directly in the first third and embodied in Elias's ritual and final speech. It frames his desire to rebuild through naming and his "compassion...like steel, strong enough to cut through despair but flexible enough to bend with sorrow." The metaphor appears twice and informs his stance at closure. However, the motivation is more asserted than dramatized through conflicted choices; Elias's empathy is never tested against a competing desire or obstacle that would force him to choose between warmth and steel, cradle and weapon. Present in setup and closure, but missing middle friction where the dual nature (empathy/steel) would create visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is introduced early ("the warm coldness of his presence creating a space of sanctuary") and modulates at closure ("the warmth of his revolutionary kindness contrasting with the cold reality"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, evoking paradox (post-disaster hope, steel empathy, gentle radicalism). The oxymoron charges the final image where warmth persists in "the coldest darkness." However, the tone is more a static descriptive label than a dynamic modulation under pressure; Elias's "warm coldness" does not shift in response to escalating stakes, and the paradox is asserted more often than embodied through specific sensory or relational beats.</comment>
