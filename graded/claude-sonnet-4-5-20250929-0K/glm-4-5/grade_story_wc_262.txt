<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena remains a singular POV with spatially imaginative perception, but her interior life consists almost entirely of generic metaphysical labels—"crystal gazer," "psychometry reading," "incubate emotions"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The story tells us she "needed to know where unused love was stored because her own heart had been a repository too," yet this motivation never manifests as a visible trade-off or conflicted impulse on the page. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she simply performs her gift and promises to "give you voice again," a declaration rather than a choice with cost. Interiority reads as abstract catalogue rather than character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who and where early (Elena, projection booth), but causality is absent: no because/therefore linkage drives events, only a static séance where Elena touches film, receives impressions, and declares intent. The ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—Elena begins able to read film and ends promising to project it, with no options foreclosed or stance crystallized on the page. Under any inferred lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the closure unit fails the cost-proof test: no sentence makes a before/after legible with felt price. The repetitive middle beats (lines 10–26) loop through synonym variations of "unused love stored in film" without escalation or turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The vintage projection booth is anchored early with vivid period detail (reel, celluloid, sprocket holes, red light, dusty beam), and the film strip functions as a tactile micro-setting Elena handles across multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a static backdrop for her perceptions. The ending does not charge the booth or film with reweighted meaning—she threads the projector as intended from the start, so the setting supplies atmosphere but not story pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is signaled early but never tested: Elena seeks, discovers (lines 13–14), and prepares to share without obstacle, reversal, or cost. No tightening occurs; she possesses the ability from the opening and exercises it without friction. The promise to "give you voice again" (line 29) is a declaration, not a choice that forecloses a path or trades one value for another. Under any lens, escalation is absent and the ending resolves a quest the text never dramatized as difficult.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of "unused love stored in liminal spaces" emerges clearly through recurring images (film strip, projection booth, phantom light), but it remains an assertion rather than an earned insight. The final line—"in the liminal spaces, the pauses between heartbeats, the moments before goodbye"—restates the premise as direct philosophizing instead of letting scene and image do the work. Elena's realization lacks friction or counter-reading; the text delivers a tidy moral without ambiguity or cost. The psychometry conceit invites reflection, but the piece explains rather than dramatizes its thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("spatially imaginative," "quantum archive of feeling," "conduit between eras"). However, perceptual signature is weak—Elena's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific, and her internal voice is indistinguishable from the narrator's meta-commentary. Under pressure (the "hushed thunder" beats), diction remains uniformly elevated without modulation. The single line of dialogue (line 29) does not feel distinct from narration. No head-hopping, but the voice lacks embodied particularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops pervade the text: lines 6/13, 10/25, 14/32, and 20/26 restate identical content without added pressure or detail. Template cadence runs dominate (e.g., "The crystal gazer… / While forgotten lyrics… / The psychometry reading…"), flattening rhythm across 15+ sentences. Stock metaphors cluster without transformation: "phantom light," "silver halide crystals," "cathedral," "quantum archive." The final third (lines 27–33) continues the loops rather than tightening, obscuring any closure image. Artifacts touch every structural beat, warranting the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry applied to film in a projection booth—offers mild novelty, but the execution reads template: a gifted protagonist discovers hidden emotion, promises release, and frames the work as sacred calling. The "crystal gazer" and "unused love stored between frames" echo familiar metaphysical-romance beats without transformation. Emotional arc and thematic question (where is love stored?) could transfer wholesale to tarot cards, vinyl records, or letters with identical structure. No bold risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; the piece plays safe within its lane.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elena ("crystal gazer") is present throughout and performs the psychometry reading, but she makes no decisions that alter tactics or outcomes. She begins able to read film, reads it, and declares intent to project—observation and assertion without choice. No key turn traces to her agency. Setup and development gates pass, but closure participation is passive declaration rather than decisive action, capping at 2.8. Swappability (any sensitive could perform this role) and ornamental use (no cost tied to her choices) lower the score further within the allowable range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The film strip is handled in at least four beats (lines 2, 5, 12, 23, 29) and returns with evolving meaning: from tactile artifact to vessel of "goodbye letters" to projection medium. Setup, development, and closure gates pass. Causal pressure is moderate—the film enables Elena's discovery—but the object could be swapped for any vintage recording medium without breaking story logic. Specificity (sprocket holes, celluloid chemistry) adds texture but does not impose unique constraint. Closure linkage is present (threading the projector) but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Goodbye letters" appear in lines 7, 15, 29, framing the concept but not shaping on-page stakes or tactics. Elena seeks them, finds them embedded in film, and promises to deliver them—told rather than dramatized. Setup and closure gates pass (mentioned early and in the ending promise), but middle development is absent: no choice hinges on their content or cost. The concept functions as thematic echo rather than plot driver. Late appearance of the label in setup (line 7, after ~20% of text) and summary-only use apply small penalties.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is labeled in lines 1, 10, 25, 30 but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait describes Elena's perception ("mapping hidden spaces," "walk through the movie palace of memory") without showing how it alters her choices or imposes trade-offs. Setup gate passes; development and closure gates fail—no middle beat turns on this ability, and the ending does not hinge on spatial imagination. Label-only use and swappability (generic psychic sensitivity) cap the score below functional contribution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears in lines 3, 11, 24, framing Elena's method but not driving plot turns. She incubates emotions and memories, but the action is static observation rather than a choice with consequence. Setup and development gates pass (mentioned early and in middle reflection), but closure participation is weak—the ending turns on threading the projector, not incubation. The verb could be replaced with "absorb," "channel," or "decode" without structural impact. Summary-only use (Elena incubates, result described) and swappability lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Psychometry reading" is named in lines 4, 12, 24, 32 and frames Elena's central action across the arc. Setup, development, and closure gates pass—the method is signaled early, performed in the middle ("deepened" in line 12), and referenced in the final beat. However, the mechanics are opaque: the reading never faces obstacle or constraint, and no turn depends on its specific properties versus generic clairvoyance. Causal pressure is low—Elena succeeds without friction—and the method is swappable with any paranormal perception. Beat involvement (three touches) and closure linkage keep it functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace projection booth is anchored immediately (line 1) and returns in lines 8, 10, 20, 29, supplying rich sensory detail (red light, hum, dusty beam, sprocket holes, projector mechanism). Setup, development, and closure gates pass. The booth provides the film strip and projector, enabling Elena's work, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—she could perform psychometry anywhere film is present. Closure linkage is solid (threading the projector charges the final image), and specificity (vintage equipment, cathedral metaphor) is high, but the setting remains atmospheric rather than pressure-imposing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"While forgotten lyrics searched for tune" appears in lines 3, 13, 20, 32 as a lyric motif rather than a functional timeframe. No clock or deadline tightens decisions; the phrase recurs as thematic echo without altering tactics or pressure. Setup and closure gates pass (present early and in final line), but development gate fails—no middle choice hinges on time. The element reads as decorative parallelism, easily cut without affecting causality. Ornamental use, no causal pressure, and swappability (any poetic timeframe) result in a low score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elena's motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is stated in line 27 (late, final third) and implied throughout her actions. She seeks, discovers (lines 13–14), and prepares to share—setup and development gates pass. Closure participation is present (the ending fulfills her quest), but the desire is never dramatized as conflicted or costly. No friction between want and obstacle, no trade-off that alters tactics. The motivation is told in summary and enacted without resistance. Late explicit statement, summary-only friction, and lack of on-page cost lower the score despite structural presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" is named in lines 8, 17, 28 and tonally anchors the piece's restrained intensity—quiet yet charged. Setup and closure gates pass (mentioned early and near the end). The tone modulates slightly (building in line 8, expanding in line 17, becoming audible in line 28), showing purposeful development, but it remains a single static mood rather than shifting with turns. The ending does not reweight the tone; "hushed thunder" describes rather than charges the final image. Functional tonal coherence without decisive pressure contribution places it mid-band.</comment>
