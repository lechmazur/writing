<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains flat and ornamental, defined by told traits ("fluidly logical," "intuitive sense") rather than lived contradiction. His motivation to "teach silence how to comfort" is stated early but never pressured by failure, doubt, or cost—passengers respond instantly and perfectly, leaving no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The young woman's tears and the businessman's tie-loosening are gestures observed from a distance, not relational crucibles. Internal conflict is absent; Elias executes his plan without friction, foreclosing the chance for renunciation or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>**Drive Lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural.** Orientation anchors arrive early (gondola, prism terrace, valley). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias settles into his stance "ready once again" with the storm glass predicting fair skies. The problem: no on-page cost or deepening—every passenger responds favorably, Elias encounters no obstacle, and the final image recycles the opening without a legible before/after pressure shift or felt sacrifice. The pattern of silence-shaping is taught but never tested. **Cost proof test fails:** no sentence in the ending beat shows a visible, felt, or conceptual price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, gondolas, and storm glass vial supply vivid, purpose-driven detail that filters through Elias's professional priorities. Sensory selection—rainbow patterns, crystalline predictions, vaulting hush—serves atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; spatial choreography (how passengers board, where Elias stands relative to them, how prisms are "adjusted") remains vague. The setting decorates rather than pressures, keeping this functional but below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—catalyzing a healing sound environment—is signaled early. Yet no reversal, tightening, or complication appears; Elias executes his plan without friction, passengers respond instantly, and the ending recycles the setup. Agency requires a choice that forecloses a path with cost; here Elias's actions meet no resistance, leaving escalation flat. The storm clouds on the horizon are noted but do not materialize into a test. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern break or density shift; neither occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme—silence as comfort, the impermanence of peace—emerges through concrete images (train whistle echo, prism angles, storm glass clarity). Subtext operates in the passengers' unconscious easing. The final image ("profound quiet... could comfort even the most troubled heart") skirts moralizing but does not reweigh prior material; it restates the premise without earned cost or a non-literal answer. Prompt-like phrases ("fluidly logical," "vaulting hush," "teach silence") crowd the text, reducing organic emergence. No friction or counter-reading complicates the resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Elias's perceptual signature (storm glass as fortuneteller, noise as communication) is distinct. Distance control is clean. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("vaulting hush of intentional silence," "fluidly logical intuition," "profound quiet") that exceed a gondola operator's plausible lexicon without ironic framing. Template cadence appears in mid-story beats: multiple paragraphs open with "Elias," "The," "In," then action. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose never tightens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>**Patterned-artifact penalty pack:** Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle third—"monitoring noise levels" recurs without added detail; "drifting prism terrace" and "vaulting hush" are synonym-churned across adjacent lines. Template cadence: runs of "Elias [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" across seven consecutive paragraphs without variation. Filter-verb stacks appear in peak beats ("began to relax," "felt a satisfaction," "knowing that"), dulling immediacy. Stock metaphors: "storm glass vial shimmered slightly," "landscape for healing." Baseline **−1.2** in Q7 for spread; artifacts touch the penultimate paragraph, so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The gondola-as-healing-space frame offers a mildly fresh angle, and the storm glass vial as atmospheric predictor adds specificity. Yet the core arc—skilled operator perfects invisible service, passengers feel better—follows a template without transformation. "Fluidly logical," "catalyze," "vaulting hush" read as writing-prompt labels rather than lived idiom. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; emotional beats (crying woman, businessman's tie) are stock. The ending restates the opening without a turn that redefines prior material. Swapping "gondola operator" for "park ranger" or "train conductor" would leave the arc intact, signaling insufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and performs the central action (adjusting prisms). However, his role is observational and procedural—he executes a plan without on-page decisions that alter tactics or stakes. Passengers respond passively; no friction forces a choice. The character is functional but replaceable with any skilled operator. Cap at 3.8 for swappability and absence of causal decision pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The storm glass vial appears in three beats: pocket (opening), removal and crystal observation (midpoint), shimmer and cloud prediction (late). Each touch is observational; the vial does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure. The final mention ("predicted fair skies") adds metaphorical resonance but no causal weight. Setup + payoff gates met; development gate weak. Lyric reprise (early seed → final callback) lifts it into mid-5s, but lack of causal pressure and visible cost prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"In transit" is stated three times and thematically present (gondolas crossing the valley, passengers moving, Elias in transit "purposefully"). Yet it does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page—travel is backdrop, not pressure. The concept echoes as theme without constraining choice. Functional presence without causal work places it in the low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" is labeled twice ("fluidly logical mind," "fluidly logical plans") but never demonstrated through on-page action with cost. No choice shows a tradeoff between logic and intuition, nor does the trait constrain a tactic. Label-only mention without dramatized pressure; ornamental use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is named explicitly ("catalyze the new sound environment") and is the story's central action—Elias adjusts prisms to create healing silence. The action is setup and executed, but no reversal or complication tests it. Swapping "catalyze" for "initiate" or "activate" would leave the arc intact, signaling mid-band replaceability. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Monitoring noise levels" is stated twice: "monitoring noise levels with his whole being, not just his instruments" and later "his precise method of monitoring noise levels." The method is claimed but its mechanics are never shown—no instruments appear, no adjustment depends on a noise reading. Summary-only use without dramatized application. Cap at 3.9 for told-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is present throughout, named repeatedly, and supplies vivid sensory detail (glass facets, rainbow patterns, valley transit). Elias adjusts its prisms in two beats, and the terrace's glass structures "communicate" with him. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it decorates rather than pressures. Setup, development (prism adjustment), and payoff (final journey) gates are met, lifting it into mid-5s, but lack of tactical constraint prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"The quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" is stated three times, framing the opening and closing beats. The timeframe is poetic and signals the moment for Elias's work, but it does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures tactics, and the whistle's recurrence is decorative rather than causal. Lyric reprise (early seed → final callback) and thematic presence lift it near mid-band, but vague tracking and no tactical constraint cap it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To teach silence how to comfort" is stated explicitly ("His motivation was simple yet profound") and reappears in the final paragraph ("sculpt silence into comfort"). The desire is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows Elias struggling with doubt, failure, or cost. Passengers respond instantly without friction, leaving the motivation decorative. Told-only integration and absence of conflicted choice place it in the low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" is named three times and supported by consistent imagery: silence after the train whistle, passengers quieting, "profound quiet." Tone is coherent and modulates gently with the terrace's movement. However, the tone never tightens under pressure or charges the final image with cost—it remains static and ornamental. Coherent but not transformative; mid-5s for lyric consistency without escalation.</comment>
