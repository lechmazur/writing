<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to find his sister is declared but never tested on the page through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. His interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("texture of connection," "rational enchantment") rather than embodied sensation or character-particular perception. The reunion at the end feels unearned because no prior dramatized struggle establishes what he must sacrifice or endure to reach her. The emotional arc is summarized rather than acted through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation adequately (Elias, gallery, dream-weaving work) but the closure unit—the sister appearing in a shared fever dream—arrives without causal preparation; she vanished "years ago" but no prior beat shows Elias discovering a pathway or paying a cost that makes this reunion legible. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration in theory (connection created through weaving), but the cost is asserted ("stronger than ever") rather than shown as a foreclosed option or visible trade-off. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of dream-weaving deepens until eruption), but the final beat does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it declares victory without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The optical illusion gallery is vividly sketched ("walls seemed to bend and shadows played tricks") and the sinew thread receives concrete handling in the weaving beats. However, spatial choreography becomes vague during the eruption sequence—visitors gasp and reach out, but their positions and the gallery's layout dissolve into abstraction. The setting constrains one choice (Elias touching the tapestry triggers the transition), narrowly satisfying the 9+ gate requirement, but the final fever-dream landscape is generic ("ever-shifting landscape of possibility") without sensory anchors or body/tool detail that would charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding his sister—is signaled early but never tightens into a live trade-off or choice that forecloses another path. The eruption of emotions and the tapestry coming alive happen to Elias rather than arising from his agency; he watches in "awe" and then simply touches the thread. No reversal or deepening narrows his options or changes his knowledge in a way that raises cost; the reunion is delivered by coincidence (the sinew thread "absorbed... the collective unconscious") rather than protagonist decision. The ending declares connection "created, nurtured, and cherished" but never dramatizes what Elias must give up or endure to achieve it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of connection-as-creation emerges coherently from the dream-weaving premise, and the phrase "texture of connection" recurs with slight reweighting at the end. However, the final paragraph ("connection wasn't something to be discovered—it was something to be created") is an explicit thematic statement rather than a non-literal image, violating the no-moralizing guideline and triggering a −0.6 penalty. The "rational enchantment" concept remains abstract—never grounded in a specific choice or constraint that tests its validity on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited focalization through Elias without head-hopping. Diction is elevated ("coalescing into forms that defied conventional logic yet felt profoundly true") and consistent, though it occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("realistically imaginary," "rational enchantment") that reads more like thesis than lived perception. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are skipped. The perceptual signature is generic; Elias notices patterns and emotions but his way of seeing lacks character-specific bias or blindness that would distinguish his mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences harm momentum: "Her absence had left a void in his life, a hole he attempted to fill with his art" restates the same idea in adjacent clauses; "Colors that had once were vibrant" is a grammatical slip. Stock metaphors ("infinite tree," "rhythm of two hearts beating as one") appear in the closure beat without fresh inflection. The phrase "as memories altered" recurs as a frame device but without clear causal meaning—does time pass, or do memories literally shift? Applying cumulative artifact penalties (−0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence in peak beats, −0.3 for stock metaphor in closure) and rounding for a total near −1.3 in Q7, landing in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The fever-dream architect premise and sinew-thread material offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc (artist seeking lost sibling through magical craft) follows a well-worn template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The reunion occurs in a dreamscape with no specific constraint or trade-off that would make the outcome feel inevitable in hindsight. Prompt-echo phrases ("rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary," "texture of connection") recur as labels rather than being dramatized through choice, suggesting derivative synthesis. Applying the Derivative Premise Guardrail (−1.0) for the familiar artist-seeking-sibling arc without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his work frames the story, but his key "decision"—touching the tapestry—is reactive rather than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. He constructs dreamscapes and weaves patterns in early beats, satisfying setup and development gates, but at closure he is swept into the fever dream rather than shaping it through agency. Swappable with "artist," "dreamer," or similar archetype with minor edits. Start 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.4 one beat, −0.5 ornamental closure touch = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sinew thread is introduced early, handled in the weaving beat ("manipulated strands," "shimmered with a life of its own"), and appears at closure when Elias touches it to trigger the transition. Three-gate qualification (setup, development, payoff). However, its properties remain vague—does it require skill, ritual, or cost to weave? The touch at the end resolves a problem (reaching his sister) it did not help create earlier. Start 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.8 swappable mechanics, −0.8 resolves problem it didn't create = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Rational enchantment is named twice as a philosophy ("the belief that even the most magical experiences could be understood through logical principles") but never constrains a choice or shapes tactics on the page. Elias does not use logic to decode patterns in a way that alters his approach; the concept functions as thematic decoration. Absent middle development and closure participation; mentioned only in exposition. Start 3.0, −0.5 ornamental, −0.5 late cap for missing middle = 2.4, floored by missing-middle cap at 3.4 → 2.4 after ornamental penalty.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Realistically imaginary is applied to Elias's craft ("dreams that felt both realistically imaginary") but functions purely as a descriptor without enabling or constraining any on-page action. No scene shows the trait creating a trade-off or tactical choice. Setup present; development and closure absent. Start 3.0, −0.5 ornamental, −0.4 label-only = 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The eruption occurs at a clear turn—emotions trapped in the threads manifest as phantom figures, visitors react, and Elias is drawn to touch the tapestry. This beat is signaled early ("emotions trapped within the threads") and drives the transition to the climactic reunion. However, the eruption is passive (happens to Elias) rather than a choice he makes, and "erupt" could swap with "manifest," "burst," "emerge" with minor edits. Start 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats (thread weaving, eruption), +0.7 closure linkage, +1.2 causal pressure (narrows to one path), −0.6 swappable verb = 6.0, round to 6.2 for strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Weaving patterns is introduced early ("By weaving patterns with these threads") and mentioned in the middle beat as Elias constructs dreamscapes. At closure, the concept recurs ("connection... through intentional acts of weaving"), but the mechanics remain abstract—no scene shows him choosing one pattern over another or suffering a cost when the weave goes wrong. Three gates present but causal work is thin. Start 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure mention, −0.4 swappable method (could be "shaping," "molding," "sculpting") = 4.5, raised slightly for three-gate presence to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The optical illusion gallery anchors the setting early and its walls "seemed to breathe" during the eruption, creating atmosphere. However, it does not constrain Elias's choices or supply resources that alter his tactics; he could conduct the same weaving in any magical studio. The gallery's illusions reflect visitors' feelings but do not pressure Elias's decisions at closure. Setup and development present; closure participation weak (he leaves the gallery for the fever dream). Start 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (illusions twist), −0.6 postcard description (no tactical constraint) = 3.6, raised to 4.3 for atmospheric contribution to the eruption beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"As memories altered" appears twice as a timeframe marker but without clear mechanics—does subjective time dilate, or do past events literally change? No scene shows time pressure tightening Elias's decisions or altering his tactics. The phrase functions as atmospheric punctuation rather than a live clock. Setup marginal; development and closure absent. Start 3.0, −0.5 vague mechanics, −0.4 no tactical constraint = 2.1, but two mentions across beats lift slightly to 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the texture of connection is stated early and drives Elias's work throughout. However, it is never dramatized as a friction between want and cost—Elias pursues it without obstacle or trade-off until the eruption delivers the answer. The final beat declares he has found connection but does not show what he sacrificed to achieve it. Three gates present (setup, pursuit, closure claim) but lacks on-page conflict. Start 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.9 two beats (longing, pursuit), +0.7 closure mention, −0.8 told-only (no friction), −1.2 resolves without cost = 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Unsettling calm is achieved in the eruption beat ("the gallery walls seemed to breathe with an unsettling calm") and the phrase directly names the required tone. However, the tone is static—it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image, which shifts to wonder and reunion warmth ("two hearts beating as one"). Setup and development present; closure participation absent (tone shifts away). Start 3.0, +0.8 setup, +0.4 one beat (eruption), −0.5 static mood, −0.6 closure drift = 4.1, raised to 4.6 for direct on-page phrase match.</comment>
