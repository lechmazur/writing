<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is present and her memories of her father's death motivate her work with Lila, but the characterization relies heavily on summary exposition ("softly adaptive, shifting like sand") rather than demonstrated contradictions under pressure. The climactic choice—handing Lila the drum during the eclipse—feels predetermined rather than emerging from internal conflict. Lila's breakthrough ("The sun came back") arrives too smoothly without prior micro-choices that foreground her struggle, reducing the felt cost of her silence breaking.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens with clear before/after stakes: Lila's silence versus speech. Orientation anchors (Maya, Sage Ridge, morning preparation → eclipse afternoon) arrive cleanly. However, the eclipse functions as a convenient external catalyst rather than an earned pressure point; Maya's tactics (showing pictures, leading Lila to the ridge, handing her the drum) proceed without meaningful resistance or narrowing of options. The closure—Lila speaking and hugging Maya—lands on the page with emotional change, but the cost remains abstract; we don't see what Maya or Lila forfeited or risked to achieve this moment, only the result.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sage ridge setting is signaled early and returns at the eclipse, creating spatial coherence. Sensory detail—sage fragrance, cooling air, eerie twilight—filters through Maya's focus and shifts with the eclipse's progression. The drum as a micro-setting object constrains the closure beat: Lila's drumming is the vehicle for her breakthrough, and its tactile presence charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting or tool must affect outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—breaking Lila's silence—is clear from the outset. The eclipse provides one meaningful tightening: the celestial event compresses time and creates urgency. However, escalation is driven more by the external coincidence (the eclipse happening today) than by Maya's agency forcing harder trade-offs. The drumming moment narrows options (Lila must respond now), but the resolution lacks visible cost: neither character pays a price or forecloses a path; the breakthrough simply occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges around resilience, wonder, and the therapeutic power of presence, supported by the locket keepsake and the eclipse metaphor ("darkness makes the light more beautiful"). However, the final lines ("And it will always come back") state the theme rather than earning it through a non-literal image. The eclipse as metaphor is over-determined: Maya explicitly tells Lila "It's like music," preempting the reader's discovery. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5) applies for the closing moral summary that replaces scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled, and Maya's perceptual signature (noticing "quiet spaces between notes," "fragile but real" exuberance) is character-specific. However, diction slips into therapy-speak at peak moments: "cautious exuberance blossoming in her chest," "anchors in the stormy seas of trauma," and "ordinary magic had worked its wonders" flatten immediacy with diagnostic abstraction. The final dialogue ("Just like music comes back when I'm sad") feels over-articulate for a ten-year-old breaking three months of traumatic silence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, but suffers from scaffold artifacts and template cadence. Paraphrase loops: "She had learned that resilience wasn't about strength but flexibility" immediately restates the sagebrush metaphor. Runs of identical stems in the eclipse sequence ("Some days called for… others required…" / "Maya recognized… remembering…") create a mechanical rhythm. Figurative language clusters without payoff: "sanctuary of sound," "symphony of healing," "aromatic sentinels," "hush of dreaming roots" pile up in the opening third without constraining later action. Apply −0.8 for loop and template-cadence issues across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—music therapy breakthrough during a solar eclipse—follows a familiar template: traumatized child + patient caregiver + celestial event = healing moment. The locket keepsake and sage-ridge setting add specificity, but the eclipse as metaphor for trauma/recovery is over-explained ("Sometimes darkness makes the light more beautiful") rather than discovered. The breakthrough itself (Lila's first words) feels engineered by the prompt's celestial convenience rather than earned through character-specific risk. Derivative Premise adjustment (−0.8) applies; transformation through lived detail is present but insufficient to fully escape the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and makes choices (showing pictures, leading Lila to the ridge, handing her the drum), meeting setup and development gates. Her occupation shapes all tactics. However, her choices proceed without visible friction or cost; the "mellow" attribute means she adapts smoothly rather than struggling. The closure hinges on Lila's action (drumming, speaking, hugging), not Maya's final decision. Apply −0.5 for lack of a hard choice at closure and −0.3 for summary-only interiority about her philosophy.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The locket appears in the opening (setup) and Maya touches it at closure ("touched her locket, feeling its familiar shape"), meeting two gates. However, it remains static: she never opens it, shows it to Lila, or uses it to guide a choice. Its meaning is narrated ("a reminder that wonder begins at the very start of life") rather than dramatized through action. The closure touch is passive observation, not causal work. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; small lift for lyric reprise with thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is framed early ("ordinary magic exists in the connections between people") and echoed at closure ("ordinary magic had worked its wonders once more"), meeting setup and payoff gates. However, it functions as thematic label rather than a stake or tactic-shaping force. The concept does not constrain Maya's options or change what she can attempt; it is invoked to describe outcomes, not drive them. Apply −0.5 for ornamental use and −0.3 for label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is introduced early ("Maya's approach was softly adaptive, shifting like sand") and demonstrated through her session planning (drumming versus melodies). However, it remains a descriptive trait rather than a constraint with cost. No beat shows Maya struggling between being adaptive and holding firm, or paying a price for her flexibility. The attribute could be replaced with "patient" or "flexible" without structural change. Cap at 3.8 for swappability; small lift for beat involvement in session description.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Link" appears four times across beats: linking silence with sound, linking the eclipse to music, linking the extraordinary with the everyday, and the threaded notes "threading through." Setup and development gates are met; the action is signaled early and shapes Maya's therapeutic approach. At closure, Lila's breakthrough occurs through drumming that links her rhythm to Maya's guitar and the eclipse to her trauma. However, the action is more thematic gloss than irreplaceable mechanic; "connect" or "join" would serve equally well. Strong beat involvement and closure presence lift the score, but swappability limits the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The solar eclipse is signaled in the opening ("Today felt important, as the solar eclipse would cast its shadow"), structures the entire second half (preparation, ascent, the event itself), and provides the frame for Lila's breakthrough at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. The eclipse's mechanics matter: the dimming light and suspended moment create the pressure under which Lila drums and speaks. Removing the eclipse would require a fundamental redesign of the climax. Apply +0.9 for two-beat involvement, +0.7 for closure linkage, +0.5 for causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sage ridge is introduced early (name, description, fragrance) and houses the climactic eclipse scene, meeting setup and payoff gates. However, the ridge functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Maya's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The sagebrush metaphor ("bending without breaking") is told rather than demonstrated through the setting's pressure on action. The ridge's height matters for eclipse viewing but could be replaced by any elevated outdoor space. Apply −0.4 for swappability and −0.3 for ornamental description in the opening.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears once, late in the eclipse sequence, as atmospheric description ("their notes threading through the hush of dreaming roots that slumbered beneath the sage-covered ridge"). It does not appear in setup or development, fails to constrain any choice, and adds no causal pressure. The phrase is decorative lyricism without structural work. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; further deduction (−0.7) for late ornamental use that could be excised without impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To nurture lifelong wonder" is stated early as Maya's philosophy and demonstrated through her approach with Lila (using the eclipse, the pictures, the drum). Setup and development gates are met. The motivation shapes Maya's tactics throughout and is present at closure when she reflects on passing forward childhood wonder. However, the motivation is more narrated than dramatized: we don't see Maya struggle between competing desires or pay a visible cost for prioritizing wonder over, say, faster clinical results. Apply +0.9 for beat involvement and closure presence, but −0.3 for summary-only interiority and lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" appears explicitly at the eclipse climax ("cautious exuberance blossoming in her chest—this breakthrough felt fragile but real") and colors the ending's emotional texture. The tone is coherent: Maya's hope is tempered by awareness of trauma's non-linearity. However, the phrase arrives late (final third) and is stated rather than embodied through rhythm or image. The story's overall tone reads more as earnest optimism than the contradictory blend "cautious exuberance" promises. Apply −0.4 for late arrival and −0.3 for label-only use at the peak beat.</comment>
