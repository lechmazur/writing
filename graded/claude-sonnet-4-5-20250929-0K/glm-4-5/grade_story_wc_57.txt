<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The seed collector remains largely static through observation rather than choice; his "infinitely patient nature" is asserted but never tested with visible cost. The fisherman shifts from reticent to generous without dramatized pressure—the reversal reads as a timer expiring rather than the protagonist earning trust through risk. Interior life is thin: the collector watches, sits, and accepts with reverence, but no contradictory impulse complicates his stance. Embodied emotion is scarce; the "thrill of understanding" is a label, not a felt experience that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: fog, snow, and knot imagery recur, and the final image reweights the rope as connection to ancient wisdom. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the collector departs with rope and glass, the fog parting to reveal "a path forward." Cost, however, is asserted rather than legible: no prior option is visibly foreclosed, no trade-off surfaces on the page. The fisherman's shift from grunt to gift feels timed rather than caused by the protagonist's patience. The "hours" of silent contemplation compress to a single paragraph without dramatized friction, weakening causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Golden dock, snow, fog, and harbor sounds anchor the setting early and recur to support tone. The fog's thickening and the "oceanic hush" modulate across beats. The fulgurite glass and knotted rope function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is clear (dock, crate, end of dock). Deductions: sensory detail leans heavily visual ("golden," "soft white layer," "distant boats"); tactile and auditory cues are thin during the rope-decoding beat where touch and sound would sharpen immediacy. The "weathered planks" and "driftwood" voice are apt but border on postcard cliché without POV coloring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve ancient methods—is signaled early and held. The piece attempts one tightening: the fisherman's acknowledgment and gift. Yet the escalation is declarative, not pressure-driven: the collector sits silently, and the fisherman volunteers the answer without the protagonist forcing a choice or trade. No live option is narrowed; the collector risks nothing and loses nothing on the page. The "hours" of contemplation occur off-stage in summary, so the reader cannot witness the work that earns the breakthrough. Under Accumulative lens, a single deepening is sufficient, but the cost must be legible—here, it remains conceptual and asserted ("just beginning") rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—ancient wisdom through patient observation, language as encoded knowledge—emerges from knot imagery and the fulgurite/lightning metaphor. The final image (fog parting, path forward) offers mild resonance but leans close to moralizing: "infinitely patient and infinitely grateful" tells rather than shows the protagonist's stance. The "oceanic hush" and "time in their knots" metaphors are apt but approach stock profundity without fresh inflection. The piece does not pose a hard question or resist tidy resolution; the collector's journey is affirmed without friction. Subtext in the fisherman's reticence is present but thin; his lines carry minimal implication beyond their surface.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, though the narration hovers at mid-range rather than inhabiting the collector's perceptual signature. Dialogue is functional and brief; the fisherman's "rough as driftwood" voice is signaled but not sustained—his later lines ("Like the weavers capture time") shift into lyric register without clear motivation. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "knew") are acceptable in the established voice but slightly dull immediacy. The prose has mild rhythmic control ("weathered," "measured," "rhythmic") but leans on repeated participial openers and sentence stems ("The seed collector…" × 4, "The fisherman…" × 3) that flatten momentum. No major POV leakage, but the voice reads as competent template rather than distinct perceptual texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity is high; grammar and tense are clean. Information density is low: many sentences restate atmosphere or assert interiority without advancing situation. Paraphrase loops surface: "the fog thickened" / "fog completely enveloped"; "understanding" / "realized"; "reverence" / "grateful." Recycled stems appear across beats: "The seed collector [verb]" × 4, "The fisherman [verb]" × 3, creating template cadence. Figurative language is functional but borders on stock: "rough as driftwood," "Lightning captured in sand," "oceanic hush." The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("infinitely patient," "infinitely grateful," "ancient wisdom") where concrete image would charge closure. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and stem repetition; −0.3 for closure-beat abstraction: combined −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—ancient knowledge encoded in knots, accessed through patient observation—is not fresh; it echoes familiar mystical-mentor templates. The collector's arc (seek → sit → receive) follows a stock shape without inversion. The fulgurite glass as metaphor for transformation is apt but not surprising. Emotional honesty is present but mild; no risk or contradiction complicates the collector's stance. The fisherman's shift from reticent to generous teacher is a trope executed adequately but not transformed. The "golden dock under snow" and "oceanic hush" are vivid yet lean toward generic picturesque. No proximity echoes to famous works, but the synthesis reads as median safe choices rather than a bold angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The philosophical seed collector is present throughout and drives the approach and final acceptance. He makes one micro-choice (pulling the fulgurite from his pocket) but otherwise observes passively. His patience is asserted rather than tested; no on-page decision narrows options or forecloses a path. The fisherman's revelation arrives without the collector coaxing it through risk or trade. Setup by opening; present in closure (accepts the gift); but middle development lacks causal pressure. Functional but largely passive; the trait "philosophical" does not constrain tactics. Cap for passivity and swappability: a generic seeker could replace him with minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, closure presence +0.5, one minor beat (pulling glass) +0.4, passivity −0.7, swappability −0.5, late causal work −0.3 → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fulgurite glass appears in beat ~40% (pulled from pocket) and again at closure (in hand as he walks away). The object's metaphor—lightning captured in sand, transformation—connects to the weaver theme and softens the fisherman. It enables one turn (the fisherman's recognition) but does not constrain a choice or impose cost. Two beats, purposeful symbolism, and closure presence meet lyric-resonance allowance. Deductions: introduced past the first third (−0.3), static in closure (cameo rather than causally active, −0.4), swappable with any token of heritage (−0.3). Score: two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.7, early setup waived (late penalty −0.3), causal enabler +0.5, swappability −0.3, cameo closure −0.4 → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The secret weavers frame the dominant stake (preserve ancient methods) and are named early. They shape the collector's goal and the fisherman's gift. However, they remain abstract throughout—no on-page weaver appears, no specific method is dramatized. The knot decoding is the mechanism; the weavers are the thematic backdrop. They do not constrain a tactic or impose a cost; the collector's journey toward them is affirmed without friction. Setup in opening, thematic presence throughout, mentioned in closure ("one step closer"). Score: setup +0.6, thematic framing +0.5, closure mention +0.3, abstract only (no on-page pressure) −0.8, swappable with "lost artisans" or similar (−0.4) → 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is asserted in the opening and echoed at closure ("infinitely patient and infinitely grateful"). The trait enables the collector to sit for hours decoding knots, but this occurs in summary without on-page cost or visible tradeoff. No moment tests whether patience conflicts with urgency or exhausts a resource. The attribute is label-only; it does not alter tactics under pressure. Setup +0.5, closure echo +0.3, one summarized beat (sitting silently) +0.3, label-only (no embodied cost) −0.7, summary-only middle use −0.5 → 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Coax" is the assigned action. The collector approaches carefully, praises the rope, and sits in silence—these are coaxing tactics. The fisherman eventually volunteers information, but the breakthrough reads as patience rewarded rather than active persuasion that narrows options. The collector does not escalate coaxing under resistance; he waits, and the fisherman yields. The action shapes the approach but does not drive a turn through visible pressure. Setup (measured steps, careful speech) +0.6, middle development (sitting, waiting) +0.4, closure indirect (gift follows coaxing, but passively) +0.3, passivity (waiting vs. pressing) −0.6, swappable with "wait" or "observe" (−0.4) → 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Decoding knot patterns is the method. The collector observes the rope early, sits for hours decoding (summarized), and the fisherman demonstrates a complex series at closure. The method is signaled, shapes the middle (silent contemplation), and is present in the final gift. Mechanics: the collector reads meaning in knot structure, the fisherman confirms and extends. The method enables the breakthrough but does not impose a trade-off or constrain a prior choice. Setup (notices patterns) +0.6, middle development (hours decoding, summarized) +0.5, closure participation (fisherman ties, hands over knotted rope) +0.9, specificity (knot language is unique) +0.5, summary middle (no on-page decoding struggle) −0.5, no visible cost −0.3 → 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Golden dock under snow is anchored early and recurs (snow dusting planks, blanketing dock, falling throughout). The setting contributes tone (oceanic hush, muffled sounds) and minor micro-setting (crate to sit on). Snow and fog modulate to support the quiet, contemplative mood and charge the final image (fog parting). The dock does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is backdrop. Setup +0.7, tonal contribution throughout +0.6, closure presence (walks away from dock, fog parts) +0.5, postcard quality (vivid but not pressure-driving) −0.5, no causal constraint −0.4 → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As fog rolls across the harbor" names the timeframe. Fog thickens across beats, snow falls continuously, and afternoon light wanes—these cues track time. However, the pace is vague: "for hours" summarizes the decoding with no tension or deadline. The fog's progression supports tone but does not tighten decisions. Setup (fog rolls) +0.5, middle development (fog thickens, light wanes) +0.5, closure presence (fog envelops, then parts) +0.6, vague duration (hours, afternoon → no live clock) −0.6, no tactical pressure from time −0.4 → 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>To preserve ancient methods is the stated motivation, present from the opening (seeking the weavers) to closure ("one step closer to preserving"). The collector explains his grandfather's connection, grounding the desire. Yet the motivation is told and affirmed without friction; no competing want or cost tests it. The fisherman's gift satisfies the goal without the collector sacrificing or risking anything on the page. Setup (seeking the weavers) +0.7, middle development (explains grandfather, shows fulgurite) +0.5, closure (gift advances the goal) +0.7, told rather than dramatized (no micro-choice tests the desire) −0.7, no visible cost or friction −0.5 → 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Oceanic hush is signaled early ("his voice maintaining the oceanic hush") and recurs (harbor sounds muffled, fog thickens, "oceanic hush that had settled over them"). Tone is coherent and modulates with the fog and snow to deepen quietness. The final image (fog parting, quiet gratitude) sustains the hush and charges closure with understated resonance. The tone does not shift under pressure—no contrast or disruption tests it—but the consistency supports the Accumulative lens. Setup +0.7, coherent modulation across beats +0.8, closure charge (parting fog, whispered thanks) +0.9, static (no tonal shift under pressure) −0.5, mild lyricism (not mechanical) +0.4 → 6.3.</comment>
