<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode leaves is established, but her interiority remains at the level of competent performance without internal contradiction or meaningful cost. The transformation attribute is told repeatedly ("always emerges transformed always") without dramatizing resistance or trade-off. Actions align with occupation, but no difficult choice forces competing values into collision; discovery of the moonstone produces "mossy delight" rather than layered, contradictory emotion under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough. Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural—density should build toward a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake. However, the piece loops through description of Elara's process without a meaningful tightening or deepening; the moonstone arrives as confirmation rather than complication, and the ending recaps her cycle without visible cost or foreclosed option. No on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that makes a before/after legible with felt cost; closure reads as summary affirmation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ashen arbor, mossy platform, and sorting tools are vividly rendered and purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent (Elara cross-legged on platform, sorting tray, tweezers, monument placement). The moonstone cabochon dust speck constrains her attention in one beat and is added to the monument, altering its glow—this micro-setting interaction elevates the score slightly, though the environment does not force a difficult choice or charge the final image with trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled (decode the message), but pressure does not escalate or tighten options. The moonstone confirms importance rather than complicating her task; Elara completes her work "with newfound clarity" and "impossible speed" without friction. No on-page reversal, trade-off, or cost that narrows tactics; the ending restates her cycle without consequence. Under Accumulative lens, density should force a cadence shift or pattern break with felt price—none occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and cyclical attunement to the arbor emerges from recurring motifs (seeds, leaves, monuments, transformation). However, the ending offers affirmation rather than a resonant, non-literal answer; "already feeling the first whispers of next year's transformation" restates rather than reweights. Subtext is present in the monument-building method, but no tension between competing values or ambiguity that lingers without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (chlorophyll-stained fingers, focus on seed spirals, attunement to arbor rhythms). Narrative distance is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("bated breath," "mossy delight of discovery") that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue present to judge. Purposeful elision of conflict or cost flattens urgency in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and vivid with varied syntax. Template cadence appears in repetitive "Her [noun]" and "Elara [verb]" stems across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loop: "always emerges transformed" / "each year becoming more attuned" / "always emerges transformed always" restates the same content without added pressure (−0.4). "Mossy delight" and "hush where past meets prophecy" repeat as labels without evolving meaning. Information density is moderate; several lines describe process without advancing stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor setting and seed-sorting folklore offer atmospheric appeal, but the core premise (solitary craftsperson reads omens in nature during sacred time) follows familiar template without transformation. The moonstone's arrival and Elara's effortless success lack friction or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional arc is tidy; no bold risk or earned turn that feels inevitable in hindsight. Specificity in seeds and tools provides texture but does not produce fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs her sorting work, but observation dominates over decision. The moonstone's discovery prompts her to add it to the monument and continue decoding—continuation rather than turn. No choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moonstone cabochon dust speck appears in beat 12 (mid-story), is lifted with tweezers and examined (beat 14), then added to the monument where it causes the glow and her transformation sensation (beat 15–16). Returns with reweighted meaning at closure as "beacon of mossy delight." Two distinct beats plus closure reprise; however, it confirms rather than complicates, and its unique properties (rarest mineral, own universe of light) do not constrain a choice with cost. Swappable with another rare omen object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Regional folklore is mentioned as the source of Elara's grandmother's tune and the belief that seed sorters read the future (beat 5). The moonstone's appearance is folklore-validated (beat 13). However, folklore shapes expectation rather than constraining on-page tactics or forcing a trade-off. It echoes as thematic backdrop without altering options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is stated in beat 8, repeated in beat 17 ("always emerges transformed always"), and restated in beat 22 ("familiar cycle of becoming and unbecoming"). Label-only treatment; no on-page action where transformation constrains a choice or imposes visible cost. The tingling sensation (beat 16) describes effect without dramatizing trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Prod" appears once (beat 7): Elara prods a seed pod with a bone tool to find the hidden embryo and determine cultivation bed. This action is part of her routine sorting rather than a major turn. Easily swappable with "pry" or "split" without structural impact. Does not redefine options or drive closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments is introduced in beat 9 as Elara's unique method and admired by guardians. In beat 15, she adds the moonstone to "her current tiny monument" (the Sky Lily tribute). The monument glows and prompts transformation (beat 16), then is placed at center of collection as beacon (beat 21). Present across three beats and shapes one key turn (monument glow triggers transformation), though the mechanics are told rather than shown constraining a choice with cost. Removal would weaken the moonstone's function but the story's arc (decode message, affirm cycle) remains intact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Ashen skyborne arbor is anchored early (beat 1–2) with mossy platform, branches, and canopy light. The arbor "responds" to Elara's concentration with shimmer (beat 6), and the "ashen light" illuminates the moonstone (beat 14). Setting pressures mood and frames the sacred work; the platform and sorting tray supply immediate micro-setting for tool use. Does not force a difficult choice or alter tactics with consequence, but returns in closure as "ever-changing world above and below." Solid setup and presence; mid-development constraint is light.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is introduced in beat 3 as the sacred sliver when the arbor pauses between seasons. Mentioned again in beat 20 and beat 22 ("next year's transformation"). Time frames expectation but does not create live clock pressure or tighten decisions; Elara completes her work "as the final light of day faded" without urgency or trade-off. Timeframe is thematic marker rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation to decode the message in falling leaves is stated in beat 4 ("her most important work of the year") and acted upon in beats 18–19 where she arranges leaves and records findings. However, the decoding is told as summary ("message revealed itself gradually") without friction, competing wants, or cost. Desire is present and drives action but is not dramatized with conflicted choice or visible trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" appears as phrase in beat 15 ("mossy delight of discovery") and beat 21 ("beacon of mossy delight"). Tone is serene, reverent, and wonder-filled throughout; consistent but static, with no modulation under pressure. The final image recycles "mossy delight" rather than charging it with new cost or tension. Tone supports setting but does not escalate or deepen to charge closure.</comment>
