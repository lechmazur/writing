<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction—genuine cosmic insight masked by feigned foolishness—is present but told more than dramatized. The ending shows her laughing off praise yet we never witness the interior cost of this sustained performance or see contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices exist (needle movements, dialogue deflection) but the peak moment (working through the night) is summarized rather than rendered with embodied tension. The characterization reads competent but lacks the visceral pressure and felt ambivalence that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image reweights Elara's work from decorative to tactically decisive—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. Orientation anchors (cobalt observatory, autumn, Elara at her workspace) land cleanly by ~80 words. The escalation operates through density increase (whispers → alignment revelation → synchronized pattern → coded sabotage), satisfying the accumulative lens, but the ending summarizes outcomes ("The coup would fail") rather than showing a decisive image where pressure crystallizes. One meaningful deepening is present but closure impact is dulled by summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory and autumn setting are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the piece early with prismatic light and crimson leaves. Sensory detail (candle flame, elongated shadows, autumn winds) recurs and charges key beats. However, the observatory itself does not constrain a choice—Elara's embroidery could occur in many locations without altering tactics or outcome. The eternal candle and her workspace pressure the atmosphere but do not materially alter her decisions. Micro-setting qualifies but lacks the causal grip for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stopping the coup through hidden embroidery) is clear early. One tightening occurs when the galaxy alignment reveals the conspiracy's timeline, narrowing Elara's window. However, the escalation lacks protagonist agency at the closure—she completes the chart overnight in a summarized work session, then the ending tells us the coup unravels offstage. No on-page reversal or trade-off that forecloses a visible option with cost. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but the final act does not reweight options through dramatized action; it recounts success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (hidden wisdom, cosmos as story-source, resistance through seeming irrelevance) emerges cleanly from Elara's embroidery and the cosmic alignment imagery. The eternal candle and "adjacent possibilities" recur with shifting weight. However, the ending states the theme overtly: "a foolish-seeming embroiderer had listened to stories the stars wanted to tell." This thematic summary replaces a resonant image and pulls the score down. The piece invites reflection but the final paragraph moralizes rather than trusting the particulars to hold the question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance and perceptual signature (cosmic patterns as narrative, off-key humming, feigned confusion) are consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional, distinguishing Elara's performed foolishness from the official's condescension. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("adjacent possibilities," "synchronized pattern," "echoed silence") that feels more prompt-label than character lexicon. Filter verbs ("appeared oblivious," "failed to recognize") soften immediacy in several beats. Voice is competent but not fully embodied under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clarity and concision are generally strong, but text-artifact patterns accumulate: "echoed silence" appears three times, "eternal candle" five times with near-identical phrasing, and synonym loops ("whispers"/"whispered secrets," "foolish"/"dim-witted"/"foolishness") cluster without progression. Template cadence in the middle third: "Her true motivation…" / "Today, as…" / "Through adjacent possibilities…" runs identical stems. Purple clusters ("prismatic tears," "galaxy-chart embroiderer," "elongated shadows that became her secret accomplices") blur momentum in the opening and middle without pattern-teaching. These artifacts dull closure and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 in Q7, with an additional −0.3 for touching the final third. The summarized overnight work session loses propulsion when dramatization was needed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (embroiderer decoding cosmic conspiracies) is inventive on its surface but reads as a prompt-response assembly: each required element (foolishness disguise, adjacent possibilities, synchronize, unheard stories) appears as a discrete label rather than an integrated whole. The "hidden savant" trope is familiar and not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece commits to its concept but the execution trends toward checklist rather than synthesis. Transformation test: swap Elara for a cartographer or astronomer and the emotional arc remains unchanged; specificity is ornamental rather than structural.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the decision to work through the night encoding sabotage, shaping the final outcome. However, the key choice (working faster, connecting threads) is summarized rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, and her agency at closure is reported rather than shown. She appears in the setup, drives the middle revelation, and is named at closure, meeting all three gates. Causal pressure is present but the culminating choice lacks on-page texture and visible cost tied to her specific actions. Mid-band for presence and functional causality without dramatic weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The eternal candle appears in five beats: workspace introduction, flickering as she works, swelling with revelation, steady at closure, and metaphorically as constancy. However, its role is atmospheric rather than causal—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The flame's steadiness is told to mirror Elara's resolve but this symbolic labor does not alter options on the page. Setup and closure reprise are present but middle development as an active tool is absent. The charged final mention ("continued burning, its flame steady and certain") reweights prior appearances slightly but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies is the dominant stake and drives every major beat: whispers, alignment discovery, synchronized mapping, and coded sabotage messages. The concept shapes Elara's tactics (disguise, embroidery as cipher) and the ending hinges on the conspiracy's offstage unraveling. Setup is early (paragraph 6), middle beats show her decoding the plot, and closure directly names the coup's failure. Causal pressure is strong and the concept is indispensable to plot logic. However, the resolution is summarized rather than shown, which limits felt cost. All three gates met, strong beat involvement, and closure linkage earn mid-6s despite the summary ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The disguise of wisdom as foolishness is seeded early ("carefully crafted reputation of eccentricity"), demonstrated in dialogue with the official ("just a foolish embroiderer"), and explicitly credited at closure ("a foolish-seeming embroiderer"). It enables her to move unseen and gather information, constraining her public behavior and shaping her tactics. However, the trait is largely told—we see her perform it once on the page but do not witness the internal cost or a moment where the disguise nearly fails. Setup, development (dialogue beat), and payoff (closure credit) are all present, and the trait has clear causal work, placing it in mid-5s for solid integration with limited dramatization of cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Synchronize appears as the verb linking celestial patterns to earthly events (paragraph 9) and again as "synchronized pattern" revealing the coup timeline (paragraph 12). The action drives the key revelation that narrows Elara's options and defines her counter-tactic (introducing delays). It is not present in the setup but arrives at the inciting incident and shapes the climax. Middle and closure gates are met; the action is causally load-bearing and not easily swappable—without synchronization, the plot mechanism collapses. Late first appearance (second third) applies a −0.3 penalty, but strong causal pressure and closure linkage support mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Adjacent possibilities is introduced mid-story (paragraph 10) as "slight variations in celestial patterns" that reveal the conspiracy's designs. It is named again in the closure paragraph. However, its mechanics are never demonstrated—we do not see Elara explore alternate timelines or how this differs from ordinary pattern-reading. The method is told as a capability but not shown shaping her attempts or constraining her choices. Setup is absent, middle mention is expository, and closure reference is a label-only callback. Late introduction (past 40% mark) and lack of causal demonstration cap the score at 3.2 despite two mentions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is anchored early (first line) and present throughout: windows catching light, domed ceiling, grand hall for the chart, hallways at night. Autumn is signaled via dying light, crimson leaves, and howling winds. The setting provides spatial coherence and atmospheric pressure but does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara's embroidery could occur in many observatory-like spaces without altering her method or outcome. The observatory's resources (access to astronomers, chart display venue) matter to the plot but are not leveraged in a beat where they narrow her options. Setup and closure presence meet two gates; functional integration without causal grip places it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the coup" is named in the title and implicit in the restless whispers (paragraph 6) and the revealed timeline of scheduled accidents (paragraph 12). Temporal pressure exists: Elara must act before the conspirators do. However, no on-page clock tracks her shrinking window—"That night" and "By morning" compress the climax without showing how urgency alters her choices. The coup remains offstage and its timing is referenced rather than dramatized. Setup (whispers) and middle (timeline discovery) gates are met but closure only alludes to aftermath. Time shapes stakes abstractly but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat, landing it in upper-4s for functional presence without felt pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Listening for unheard stories is seeded early as Elara's self-stated motivation (paragraph 4) and explicitly named as her method ("listen for unheard stories" in the final line). It differentiates her from decorative embroiderers and justifies her cosmic attention. However, the desire is told in exposition ("Her true motivation, however, was never to create merely decorative maps") rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice where this want costs her something else. The motivation frames her actions but does not create friction or a visible trade-off on the page. Setup, thematic middle work, and closure reprise meet all three gates, but the lack of embodied cost or competing want limits it to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Echoed silence appears three times: "echoed silence filled the observatory hallways" (paragraph 11) and twice in the closure paragraph. The tone is consistent (quiet, observational, slightly formal) but does not modulate with pressure—the same register holds through discovery, urgency, and resolution. The phrase itself is more label than lived atmosphere; we do not feel silence as a presence that charges decisions. It recurs as a motif but remains ornamental rather than tonally load-bearing. Setup is weak (first mention at 60%), closure reprise is present, but the tone does not shift to charge the final image. Lyric reprise without causal or atmospheric weight places it in low-4s.</comment>
