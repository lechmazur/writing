<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is signaled early ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") but remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The shift from academic curiosity to "something deeper" is asserted without on-page friction or visible cost in the moment. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed") rather than character-particular perception. The final stance—witness rather than capture—arrives as epiphany without prior micro-choices that foreclose the alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of observations and celestial alignments building toward thematic resonance). Orientation anchors who and where by the second paragraph, but "after the missing return changed everything" remains vague past the 120-word mark, creating mild disorientation debt (−0.3). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "witness rather than capture" realization, but cost is conceptual and diffuse—no on-page action or forfeiture makes the before/after legible with felt pressure. The arrowhead's luminous patterns and celestial connection are intriguing setup but don't constrain a final choice or reweight prior material with undeniable consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The underground garden is vividly rendered with bioluminescent mushrooms, moon-petal flowers, and gremlins that metamorphose stone-to-flesh. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (the "distinctive scent of frostbitten hope," the "gravitationally playful" ceiling roots). The flint arrowhead returns with evolving detail (sharp facets, warmth, luminous patterns), charging the final image. However, the garden does not constrain a key choice—it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The micro-setting (arrowhead on desk, herbalist's study) is mentioned but not leveraged to alter decision-making.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the cryptids' transformations—is signaled early but never faces a credible on-page test. Aris observes, documents, and reflects without a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The shift from "capture to witness" is told as insight rather than earned through a reversal that forecloses the prior path. No visible price is paid; the static-laden confessions and undercover risk are mentioned but never escalate into a concrete dilemma. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or pattern break is expected—here the celestial alignments and arrowhead patterns accumulate detail but don't reweight stakes with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—harmony untamed, coexistence over control—emerges through image (gremlins, moon-petals, the arrowhead's luminous constellations) rather than direct statement, and the "cosmic joke" motif recurs purposefully. However, the final paragraph delivers a mild thematic summary ("Perhaps someday humanity would be ready") that edges toward moralizing. The epiphany about witnessing vs. dissecting is told rather than enacted, reducing resonance. The arrowhead's constellation patterns and the garden's intelligence hint at a non-literal answer but don't land with enough specificity to elevate the question into a charged final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Aris; no head-hopping. The prose has a consistent elevated register ("gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed") that sometimes drifts into abstraction rather than character-particular perception. Diction is controlled but occasionally formulaic ("the static-laden confessions," "the conspiracy of silence"). No dialogue is present, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply. The narrative distance is consistent; Aris's perceptual signature—focused on taxonomy, transformation, celestial patterns—is clear but could be sharper and more embodied under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across paragraphs, but several passages rely on repetitive stems and near-synonym loops: "harmony untamed" recurs five times without meaningful reweighting, "frostbitten hope" appears three times as a stock phrase, and "metamorphose/metamorphosis" cycles without adding pressure. The phrase "the flint arrowhead" opens three sentences with identical structure. Figurative language is dense ("frostbitten hope," "cosmic joke," "gravitationally playful") but some metaphors are strained or abstract rather than sensory. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (arrowhead description + emotional state) but others paraphrase prior content ("witness rather than capture" is restated across two paragraphs). No major causality breaks, but the loops and template cadence lower momentum (−0.8 in Q7 for paraphrase loops and stem repetition).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The cryptid-researcher premise and underground-garden discovery follow familiar template beats (mockery → vindication, lost creatures reappear transformed). The "witness not capture" arc is a well-worn trope in natural-science fiction. The flint arrowhead and celestial alignments add texture but don't transform the core plot into a non-obvious synthesis. Emotional specificity is thin; Aris's "bitterness" and the "cosmic joke" motivation are asserted more than dramatized through lived detail. The gravitationally playful gremlins and stone-to-flesh metamorphosis offer fresh images, but the story does not follow their implications into a bold structural or thematic risk. Derivative premise applies (−0.7 within Q8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aris is present throughout and observes/documents, but key narrative turns (the shift from curiosity to witness-stance, the decision to continue undercover) are told rather than enacted as on-page choices. The character's undercover role is setup but does not constrain a middle beat or pay off at closure with a decision that alters tactics. Present in all three gates (setup, middle documentation, ending stance) but functions primarily as observer rather than agent whose choices create reversals. Swappable with a generic researcher; the "cryptid" specialty adds flavor but does not drive unique tactics. Score: early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two) +0.9, but ornamental use −0.8, summary-only key involvement −0.6. Band ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead appears in four distinct beats: discovery (yesterday, pocket), watering scene (sharp facets reminder), mid-story mention (grows warm), and ending (luminous constellation patterns on desk). It recurs with evolving detail and charges the final image, but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it remains symbolic rather than causally active. Present in setup and payoff but not development in the middle-choice sense. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure linkage (present in final image) +1.0, but ornamental use −0.7, swappability (could be another mysterious artifact) −0.5. Band ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Harmony untamed" is named five times as a thematic label but does not shape on-page stakes or alter Aris's tactics. It functions as abstract commentary rather than a rule or pressure that constrains action. Present as theme claim only; no gate participation in setup choice, middle development, or closure action. Mentioned in first third +0.3, but ornamental −0.8, label-only −0.3, swappable (could be "wild balance" or "untamed equilibrium") −0.5. Band ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" describes the gremlins' ceiling-root dance but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. It is a vivid label for one visual image without tactical consequence. Present in one beat (mid-story observation) but purely ornamental. Late first appearance (second third) −0.3, ornamental −0.8, label-only trait −0.3, swappable −0.6. Band ~2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" (and variants) appears six times describing the cryptids' transformations and Aris's hoped-for human understanding. It is thematically central and recurs across beats, but the transformations are observed backdrop rather than a causal lever that redefines Aris's options at closure. Present in setup (cryptids changed), middle (gremlins stone-to-flesh), and payoff (humanity's future metamorphose of understanding), but summary-only in key moments. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure linkage (final paragraph theme) +0.8, but summary-only −0.7, swappable (could be "transform" or "evolve") −0.6. Band ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The cordless phone appears in two beats: Aris's twice-weekly confessions and the final mention of music from the other end. It is a means of communication but does not shape attempts or constrain tactics—Aris speaks into static without response that alters choices. Present in middle and ending but not in a way that matters causally. Setup mention (second third) +0.4, beat involvement (two) +0.9, but ornamental −0.7, does not shape attempts −0.8, summary-only key involvement −0.5. Band ~3.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The underground garden is vividly present across the story (ferns, moon-petals, star-vine, bioluminescent mushrooms, ceiling roots, central chamber). It supplies the ecosystem Aris studies and is the location for all observation beats, but it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric container. Present in all three gates (setup locale, middle watering/observation, ending constellation view) but does not constrain tactics. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three+) +1.4, but ornamental use −0.6, postcard description rather than tactical pressure −0.7. Band ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed everything" is mentioned in the opening and sets backstory context, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The three-week (later three-month) elapsed time is noted but does not escalate pressure or alter Aris's moves. Present as vague framing only; no gate participation. Mentioned early +0.4, but vague/untracked −0.8, does not tighten tactics −0.7, swappable −0.5. Band ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To turn bitterness into a cosmic joke" is stated explicitly mid-story as Aris's motivation and recurs in the ending reflection. It frames intent but is not dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs on the page. Present in middle and ending but told rather than enacted. Setup (middle mention) +0.5, beat involvement (two) +0.9, closure linkage (final paragraph theme) +0.7, but told-only −0.8, no friction with costs −0.6. Band ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" appears three times as a recurring phrase (scent descriptor, heart metaphor, final perennial image). Tone is consistent across beats but remains static rather than modulating with pressure—it is applied as a label rather than enacted through cadence or image shift. Present in setup, middle, and ending, and it charges the final image (hardy perennial metaphor). Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but static mood rather than modulation −0.7, label-only rather than enacted tone −0.6. Band ~5.1.</comment>
