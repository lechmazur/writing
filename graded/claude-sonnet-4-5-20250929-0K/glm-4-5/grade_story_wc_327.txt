<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist operates entirely in exposition and summary across decades; no on-page micro-choices under pressure. Interior life consists of declarations ("His motivation was singular") rather than embodied contradiction. The final moment ("quietly laughed, tears streaming") relies on stock emotional display without specific thought-texture or conflicting impulses. Decades of work collapse into a single evening's success with no visible struggle, mistake, or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening or cost occurs on the page—thirty years of failure resolve in one convenient bird-pattern without prior setback or trade-off. The closure beat ("his life's work was complete") is asserted, not dramatized; no before/after options are legible. Orientation anchor (who/where/when) arrives cleanly in paragraph one. The diamond's glow and the emerging sentence occur without visible price or foreclosed alternative, reducing closure to wish-fulfillment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Towers of bone, canyon echoes, and the tunnel are vivid and consistently referenced. The birds and diamond interact with setting in the climax, constraining the method enough to lift mid-band. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. However, the environment never blocks a choice or forces a tactical shift; it supplies resources without friction, keeping the score from higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake (preserving the language) is signaled early but never tested on the page. Decades pass with no reversal, adaptation, or visible cost; the protagonist simply continues his ritual until success. The final evening's bird-pattern is coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. No live option is foreclosed, no price paid—escalation under any lens is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (translation of sensory worlds, preservation vs. extinction) emerges clearly from image and action. The flawed-diamond-as-misunderstood and texture-to-sound motifs recur purposefully. However, the ending states its thesis ("bridge between worlds of sensation and sound") rather than letting the final image resonate without summary. The piece avoids platitude but leans toward thematic echo in the closing paragraphs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through the storyteller. Diction remains consistent, though elevated ("quietly articulate," "tactile sensation") without sufficient idiom variation under stress. No dialogue present to judge. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("what he had achieved would echo through eternity") drifts toward narrator-summary rather than character perception, weakening voice integrity at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies adequately; no severe loops or filter-verb stacks. However, multiple paragraphs open with identical "The storyteller" or "His" stems, creating template cadence. Stock phrases ("tears streaming down his face," "the twilight of his years") appear in peak beats. Information density is moderate—many lines describe rather than advance. The climax relies on declarative summary ("was finally revealing") instead of taut sensory unfolding.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Copper veins and tactile language offer fresh texture, and the premise (translating texture to sound via bird-patterns and diamond) is non-obvious. However, the arc follows a familiar template: lone scholar persists for decades, then succeeds via convenient final sign. No transformation or subversion of the preservation-quest trope; the storyteller encounters no friction that would force ingenuity. The ending's certainty ("echo through eternity") avoids ambiguity, defaulting to safe resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that narrow options or alter tactics. His decades-long practice is summarized; the climactic evening unfolds through observation (birds, diamond glow) rather than choice. The trait (copper veins) is decorative, pulsing "with each word" but never constraining action. He is a vessel for the premise, not an agent under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears in setup (paragraph one), development (placed in the tunnel during rituals), and closure (glows, emits sound). Its rumored curse vs. true purpose frames a question. However, its function is static—always a recording vessel—with no evolving use or cost. The glow at the end is cosmetic confirmation, not a reweighted property that alters tactics. Two-gate presence and thematic role lift it to mid-band, but swappability (any recording device) and lack of causal pressure cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is introduced early (paragraph one: "canyon of endless echoes"; paragraph five: "tunnel of echoes") and used in the climax (paragraph nine). It amplifies and preserves sounds, enabling the method. However, it never constrains a choice or complicates the protagonist's work; it is a passive resource. Removing it would require only minor rewrite (another resonant space). Present in three beats but replaceable, fitting mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" appears once in paragraph one as a label ("his words soft yet resonant") and never constrains or enables on-page action. No moment tests whether quiet speech costs him clarity or whether articulation grants tactical advantage. The trait is ornamental, contributing atmosphere but not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Harness" is the story's central verb (paragraph two: "harness the echoes trapped in the diamond"), signaled early and enacted in the climax (paragraph nine: reproducing bird-patterns to activate the diamond). However, the harnessing succeeds on first try without setback, and the mechanics are vague—no tactile detail of how vibration transfers. The action is present but not dramatized with friction or cost, keeping it functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Bird-pattern reading is introduced in paragraph four, recurs in practice (paragraph six: "trace their flight paths"), and triggers closure (paragraph eight: new complex pattern). The method is specific and shapes the climax. However, it arrives conveniently (the birds fly the right pattern) without the protagonist adapting or failing first. One-beat causal role plus closure presence, but coincidence-driven resolution caps it at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Towers of bone and canyon of endless echoes anchor orientation early and recur (paragraphs one, four, eleven). The tunnel supplies the amplification resource. Setting never blocks a choice or forces adaptation, functioning as backdrop. The bones "seemed to resonate" in the final paragraph, a thematic echo rather than causal pressure. Present across beats and in closure image, but passive role limits score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe ("across the death of a language") is signaled in setup (paragraph two) and referenced in development ("decades," "thirty years before"). It frames urgency but never tightens tactics on the page—no moment where fading time forces a choice or trade-off. The timeline is told, not tracked; the protagonist continues his ritual unchanged until success. Functional presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To translate texture into sound" is stated in paragraph two, driving the protagonist's actions (reading fabrics, tracing bird-patterns). It appears in the climax ("glyphs of texture made audible"). However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No on-page moment shows what he sacrifices for this goal. Present and causal at the macro level, but lacking friction or embodied stakes.</comment>
