<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The pruner remains an abstract vessel for mystical operations rather than a person under pressure. Her "insatiably creative" trait and motivation "to preserve the color of wonder" are label-only declarations; no on-page micro-choice tests competing impulses or reveals cost. The grandmother's wisdom and the pruner's "decades mastering the method" are told summaries that flatten urgency. Agency reads as ceremonial performance—pressing the seed, feeling energy, weaving light—without dramatized friction, doubt, or tradeoff that would earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The drive lens remains ambiguous: the piece gestures toward lyric accumulation but delivers a linear ritual sequence without causal pressure or meaningful reversal. The closure unit—placing the transformed seed in a pouch and waiting for others—lacks on-page decisive change or visible cost; the pruner's state and options are identical before and after the ritual. The final paragraphs summarize future possibility rather than landing a felt reconfiguration or repricing in the present moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The verdant parapet and waterfall are vivid and named repeatedly, anchoring space adequately. Sensory detail leans visual and generic (moss, mist, silver hair, gold sunset) without POV-specific filter or constraint on choice. The setting remains postcard backdrop; the waterfall "whispers secrets" and "holds its breath" in stock metaphor without altering the pruner's tactics or shaping the seed transformation. No tool, body limit, or spatial friction pressures the ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder's color—is declared but never tested by opposition, cost, or friction. The ritual proceeds in smooth ceremonial steps: press seed, feel energy, wrap light, place in pouch. No reversal, tightening, or escalation appears; the waterfall quiets cooperatively, the seed transforms on cue, and triumph arrives without obstacle. Agency is absent; the pruner performs a rehearsed method rather than making choices under pressure that foreclose options or exact visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of preserving wonder and weaving between worlds is overtly stated in multiple lines ("To preserve the color of wonder," "between worlds," "canvas only artists of essence can paint") rather than earned through image and action. The final paragraphs moralize the premise instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer. The transformed seed as carrier of "fruits of preserved wonder for generations" reads as direct allegorical claim without ambiguity or cost that would deepen thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Register drifts into elevated fantasy-catalog diction ("verdant parapet," "insatiably creative," "radiant hush," "fruits of preserved wonder") that flattens rather than charges perception. Perceptual signature is generic; the pruner notices in stock poetic phrases without character-specific bias. Dialogue appears twice, both times as portentous wisdom-speak ("Between one world and the next…" and "To preserve the color of wonder…") lacking subtext or goal pursuit.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Prose suffers pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops: "The pruner [verb]" and "The [noun] [metaphor]" dominate sentence openings across the text. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle ("waterfall whispered ancient secrets," "fire within her never truly slept," "radiant hush embraced her like an old friend"). Figurative language in nearly every sentence of the ritual sequence (lines 10–25) without pattern-teaching or payoff. Synonym churn: "weaving between worlds" appears six times; "heirloom seed" eight times; "verdant parapet" four times; "radiant hush" three times. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 10–16 ("felt," "seemed," "thought") dulls immediacy during peak action. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph repeats "between worlds" and "radiant hush" without new charge). Apply −1.4 base for loops and template cadence; escalate to −1.7 for artifact presence in closure beat; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8 per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical artisan performs ritual to imbue object with abstract quality—follows a widely used fantasy template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The pruner's method, motivation, and success are declared rather than discovered through friction. No risk-taking or fresh inflection; the ritual proceeds exactly as announced, and the seed's transformation confirms the opening claim. Proximity check: "weaving between worlds," "preserve the color," and "radiant hush" echo common fantasy idiom without distinct synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The wise orchard pruner is named in the opening line and occupies all beats, but makes no choices that create turns. She performs a pre-rehearsed ritual without obstacle, friction, or tradeoff. Her decision to "attempt her greatest weaving" is told summary; the action itself is ceremonial execution, not a choice under pressure. She appears in the closure (placing the seed in a pouch, sitting to watch the water) but passively; no reversal or cost ties to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The heirloom seed appears early (paragraph 2), is held and transformed in the middle ritual sequence (paragraphs 10–16), and resides in the pouch at closure, touching all three gates. It is handled across multiple beats: cradling, pressing between palms, wrapping with light, transforming, placing in pouch. However, the seed itself does not constrain or enable a choice with cost; it is the passive object of the ritual. Its transformation (casting a rainbow) reweights visually but does not alter the pruner's tactics or foreclose an option. Swappability: any heirloom object could serve the same function with minor edits. Closure linkage is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is named six times as a concept and label but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The pruner's ritual is described as weaving, yet no world-boundary friction, navigation choice, or cost of crossing appears. The concept functions as atmospheric claim rather than a mechanic that alters options or forecloses paths. It echoes thematically in the closure ("between worlds, there were always new colors") but remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative" is declared twice (paragraphs 3 and 32) as a trait label without on-page demonstration. No creative problem-solving, friction between creative impulse and constraint, or visible tradeoff appears. The pruner's actions are methodical and ceremonial, not improvisational or driven by creative hunger. The trait is told-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>"Succor" (to give aid or relief) does not appear as an action in the text. The pruner performs a preservation ritual but does not succor anyone on the page. The element is absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"By capturing essence" is named twice (paragraphs 8 and 14) and described as the pruner's method. She "captures essence of the waterfall" and feels its power in her fingertips. The method is signaled early and used in the middle ritual, touching two gates. However, its mechanics remain vague metaphor; no specific constraint, cost, or technique choice shapes the attempt. The method could be swapped for "channeling energy" or "binding spirit" with negligible edits. It does not participate causally in closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside a waterfall is named in the opening line and repeated in five subsequent paragraphs, touching setup and middle beats. It anchors space adequately. The waterfall's persistence is noted as thematically relevant ("its endless return to source"), and the parapet brightens during the ritual. However, the setting does not constrain the pruner's choices or alter her tactics; it functions as atmospheric stage rather than pressure source. The moss catches a rainbow (a visual detail), but this does not change options. Closure participation is ornamental (the pruner sits on the parapet watching water flow).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Upon the hush of budding hope" appears in the opening line as a poetic time anchor. "Budding hope" evokes spring but remains metaphorical; no season-specific constraint or urgency tightens decisions. The narrative clock is loose; the ritual unfolds in untracked time with no live deadline. The sun descends in the final paragraph, marking passage, but does not pressure tactics. The timeframe is present but does not function as a tightening device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is stated explicitly as motivation in paragraph 4 and repeated in paragraph 12. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No friction appears between preserving wonder and another need or fear; the pruner pursues the goal without obstacle or tradeoff. The motivation frames the ritual but does not create choice points where competing impulses act. It participates in closure as summary claim ("fruits of preserved wonder") but without felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is named in the title placeholder and appears three times in the text (paragraphs 11, 22, 29, 35). The tone balances stillness ("hush," "quiet," "murmur") with luminosity ("radiant," "blue-white light," "gold"). It remains consistent across beats without modulation under pressure; the hush deepens cooperatively rather than breaking or contrasting with rising stakes. The final paragraph uses "radiant hush embraced her" to charge the image, lifting closure participation slightly, but the tone itself does not shift to reflect turn or cost.</comment>
