<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is legible—he invites nuance into certainty—but his interior contradiction never acts in scene; the fisherman's dilemma drives stakes while Elian remains a facilitator rather than an agent under pressure. The "sincerely insincere demeanor" is told three times but never constrains a choice or complicates an interaction. The mirror shard and chimes are handled ritually but do not force Elian to confront his own "protected vulnerability" with visible cost; the ending gesture ("allowed himself to feel the weight") summarizes rather than dramatizes internal shift. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority consists of abstract reflection ("the complexity of human nature") that dulls particularity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early (lighthouse, dawn, fisherman). The accumulative lens is signaled by ritual and reflection but the closure—Elian preparing for the next client with a smile—delivers Earned Stasis without visible cost on the page; the final paragraph states his readiness but does not foreclose a path or reveal price paid. Causality is clean within beats: chime selection leads to advice, fisherman accepts. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elian "thought he saw something different" in the mirror, but the flicker remains abstract and does not alter his stance in the present frame. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence at closure shows Elian forfeiting an option or bearing a felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lighthouse and chimes are vivid and purposeful; the breezy setting creates sensory texture ("morning mist," "wind picked up") and the lantern room functions as workspace. Spatial choreography is clear: spiral stairs, lantern room, fire pit below. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the chimes are consulted but their mechanism does not test Elian or impose difficulty. The hollow mirror shard is handled repeatedly but remains inert; it does not charge the final image beyond metaphorical echo. Micro-setting qualifies (body, tool, object) but does not reach the 9+ gate because no tactile or spatial element forces a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—helping the fisherman navigate moral complexity—is signaled early. Pressure is static: the fisherman arrives troubled, Elian consults chimes, delivers advice, fisherman accepts. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the chime selection is presented as seamless interpretation, not a contested or costly choice. Agency rests with the fisherman's off-page acceptance; Elian's role is passive facilitation. The accumulative lens would require a deepening that reweights cost, but the final image ("prepared to welcome the day") resets to status quo without visible price. One escalation signal—Elian's glimpse of "something different" in the mirror—never develops into friction or constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—doubt as companion to truth, nuance over certainty—emerges through ritual and reflection but relies heavily on stated philosophy ("the complexity of human nature," "doubt was not the enemy of truth"). The wind chimes and mirror shard recur but function as symbolic tokens rather than particulars that constrain or charge closure; the mirror "shows not what was, but what could be" is asserted three times without demonstrating cost. The ending offers no non-literal answer; it loops back to professional readiness ("sincerely insincere smile ready") without reweighting prior material. Subtext is thin; the fisherman's transformation happens off-page and Elian's "protected vulnerability" is named but not tested. The final paragraph moralizes the premise ("doubt was not the enemy…") in place of resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; distance is consistent and the perceptual filter—Elian's professional detachment—colors description. Diction is controlled but leans on abstract register: "welcome nuance into certainty," "sincerely insincere," "protected vulnerability" recur as labels rather than enacted texture. The fisherman's brief dialogue ("I have your answer") advances plot but carries no subtext or goal conflict. Psychic distance remains at summary level throughout; no peak-stress compression or embodied rhythm shifts. Voice is competent but generic—syntax and rhythm do not reflect Elian's particular mind under pressure. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("thought he saw," "knew that") are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no causality breaks or spatial confusion. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "hollow mirror shard" appears six times with near-identical phrasing; "sincerely insincere" repeats three times without variation; "cloak of doubt" and "protected vulnerability" cycle through as interchangeable metaphors. Template cadence dominates reflective passages: "The [noun] had been… a tool she claimed… Elian had never seen…" Figurative density in high-pressure beats is moderate—no mixed metaphors, but stock phrasing ("weight of secrets," "voices joining in a complex melody") reduces specificity. Information density is low: many sentences paraphrase prior content (e.g., paragraphs 10–11 restate Elian's philosophy). Sentence openings vary; no grammar errors. Artifacts touch non-closure beats extensively (−0.8) and appear in the final third, triggering the 9+ disqualification globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Conscience for hire" and wind-chime divination are fresh premises, but the execution follows a template: troubled client, ritual consultation, advice given, client departs satisfied, practitioner reflects on philosophy. The lighthouse and mirror shard add texture but do not transform the arc. Emotional beats are generic—no specific lived detail distinguishes Elian's vulnerability or the fisherman's dilemma beyond abstraction. The transformation test fails: swap chimes for tarot and the story logic is unchanged. No bold risk heightens stakes; the ending loops to readiness without synthesis or inflection. Proximity to "wise counselor" archetypes is high; the final image ("prepared to welcome the day") offers no fresh angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout but his choices are consultative, not transformative. He selects chimes and delivers advice; the fisherman's acceptance happens off-page. Introduced early (setup ✓) and present at closure (payoff ✓), but middle development is passive—no on-page decision by Elian that narrows options or imposes cost. The role could be replaced by any counselor or oracle without altering logic. Causal work is limited to one beat (chime interpretation → advice); no visible price or trade-off. Score: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The hollow mirror shard appears in four beats: pocket (opening), held to light (midpoint glimpse), table (ritual cleaning), picked up (final gesture). Setup ✓, development (one micro-turn: "thought he saw something different") ✓, closure (final pickup) ✓. However, the object remains inert—no choice is constrained by its presence or absence, and the "flicker of possibility" does not alter Elian's tactics or stance. The shard is handled ritually but swappable with any symbolic artifact. Reweighted meaning is asserted ("endless possibilities") but not demonstrated through cost. Score: 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Cloak of doubt" is named three times as Elian's professional tool but never constrains an on-page choice or shapes tactics. It functions as theme label rather than dramatic element. No setup beyond metaphor, no middle complication, and no closure linkage—Elian's final act is to prepare his smile, not to set aside or test the cloak. Swappable with "mantle of skepticism" or similar. Ornamental. Score: 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sincerely insincere" is told three times but never demonstrated in dialogue or action that imposes cost. The fisherman and Elian's brief exchange carries no subtext or tension that would dramatize this trait. Setup ✓ (label), but no middle constraint or closure moment where the trait enables or complicates. Label-only use. Score: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unhook" appears twice: unhooking chimes for the ritual and unhooking the fisherman from rigid position (metaphor). Introduced early (setup ✓), used in the middle beat (chime selection) to enable advice (development ✓), and returned at closure when Elian unhooks and cleans the used chimes (payoff ✓). Two distinct beats; the action is specific to wind-chime divination and not easily swappable. However, no visible cost ties to the unhooking—Elian's ritual is seamless, and the fisherman's shift happens off-page. Causal role in enabling the peak turn but without felt price. Score: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("passed down through generations"), used at midpoint (brass, ceramic, copper sequence), and mentioned at closure (cleaning ritual). Setup ✓, development (one interpretation beat that drives advice) ✓, closure (ritual completion) ✓. The mechanics matter—specific chimes yield specific counsel—but the method is never tested or complicated; Elian's interpretation is frictionless. Swappable with tarot or rune-casting without structural change. Functional but not indispensable. Score: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse and dawn are vividly rendered and anchor every beat (setup ✓, persistent presence throughout ✓, closure image ✓). The breeze animates the chimes, which drives the method; the lantern room functions as workspace. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elian could consult chimes anywhere. The fire pit below and spiral stairs provide spatial texture but do not constrain tactics. Micro-setting (chimes, table) is handled but inert. Score: 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is named in the opening ("after the campfire's last spark dies") but does not tighten decisions. Dawn arrives and Elian continues his ritual at leisure; no clock pressure or urgency shapes the fisherman's departure or Elian's choices. Time passes vaguely ("as dawn broke fully," "sun climbed higher") without tracking elapsed minutes or imposing cost. The spark's death is atmospheric framing, not a causal trigger. Ornamental. Score: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Elian's desire to "welcome nuance into certainty" is stated and demonstrated in his advice to the fisherman (one beat). Setup ✓ (stated purpose), development (advice shaped by this motive) ✓, but closure does not test or complicate the motivation—Elian ends ready for the next client without friction between his desire and any competing want. The motivation is functional but does not generate internal conflict or visible cost. Told more than dramatized. Score: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named twice as Elian's internal state and modulates slightly when he "allowed himself to feel the weight" near the end. Tone is consistent—contemplative, detached—but static; no tonal shift under pressure or at closure. The final image loops back to professional readiness without charging the vulnerability or making it resonate. Coherent but unvaried; does not modulate with stakes. Score: 4.6.</comment>
