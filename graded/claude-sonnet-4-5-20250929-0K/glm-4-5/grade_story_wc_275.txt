<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rhiannon's characterization relies heavily on declarative summary rather than dramatized contradiction. "Senselessly perceptive" is told as a trait with illustrative detail (withered petals, drooping stems) but never creates an on-page cost or complication. The father contrast and hunter-born instincts are backstory exposition that frame her path but don't pressure present choices. The final act—wrapping a cutting—illustrates routine rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a static tableau: Rhiannon tends roses in her dome after societal collapse. No inciting pressure arrives, no reversal occurs, and no on-page decision alters her situation. The ending wraps shears and declares continuation, which is thematic assertion rather than closure with felt cost. Orientation is clear (who/where/when anchored early), but the Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural without a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert heat, and condensation are vivid and coherent. Spatial choreography (moving between rows, central bed) is clean. However, setting remains primarily atmospheric; the dome's humidity and heat don't constrain a choice or alter tactics. The micro-setting (airship scrap fabric) is handled but functions as symbolic vessel rather than a tool that pressures action, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The stated stake—weaving continuity through chaos—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition arises, no tightening occurs, and no choice forecloses a path. The piece describes Rhiannon's method and visitors' reactions without dramatizing conflict. The final act (wrapping a cutting) is routine work, not a decision under pressure. Agency is absent; the narrative summarizes her philosophy rather than forcing her to defend or adapt it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—nurturing versus conquest, continuity through chaos—is coherent and emerges from images (airship scrap repurposed, roses embodying virtues). The roses and dome function as motifs, though they don't constrain choice. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("her greatest achievement was...a thread of meaning woven through the tapestry of chaos") states theme rather than letting the image resonate, triggering a −0.6 deduction for Thematic Echo in the closing lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (noticing withered petals, imperceptible vibrations) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and fits the contemplative register. However, no dialogue appears to test voice distinction, and the narration occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("engraved quiet, a state of being where silence became a tool") that edges out of immediate perception. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong, but template cadence appears in multiple paragraphs: "Her father had been...but Rhiannon had chosen," "The roses responded...By the time she finished," "Rhiannon believed...Rhiannon's visitors." Paraphrase loops occur ("nurture rather than captured" / "nurture life" within two paragraphs). The final third contains expository summary ("her greatest achievement was...a thread of meaning") that replaces scene pressure. Apply −0.8 for template stems and loops touching the closure third, and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The pacifist-daughter-of-bounty-hunter frame and post-collapse horticultural sanctuary are familiar templates executed competently but without a non-obvious twist. "Inculcating plants with values" reads as soft-magic metaphor without causal stakes. The airship scrap and "engraved quiet" are evocative labels but don't transform the arc. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece chooses the median safety of tableau over conflict, and the ending moralizes rather than reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Rhiannon is the POV throughout; her pacifist path is established in backstory contrast to her father but never tested on-page. No antagonist or complication forces her to choose between nurture and capture. She observes, tends, and reflects without a turn. Present in setup and thematically, but no middle choice or closure participation beyond routine work. Swappable with "healer's daughter" or similar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The airship ballast sandbag scrap appears in paragraph 4 (repurposed as seed pouch), paragraph 19 (wrapping a new cutting), and is invoked as symbolic weight-to-renewal transformation. Two beats, but both are illustrative rather than causal. It doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics; removing it would not break the story's logic. The lyric reprise (conquest vessel → renewal vessel) reweights meaning lightly, earning mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is named once in paragraph 13 as "a state of being where silence became a tool." The concept is described rather than dramatized; Rhiannon's method of listening to plants is told, not shown pressuring a choice. It functions as thematic label without mechanics or cost. Late first mention (past midpoint), no middle development, no closure participation. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is declared in paragraph 6 and illustrated with examples (withered petals, humidity shifts). The trait is framed as both invaluable and a burden, but no on-page scene shows the burden constraining her or creating a visible cost. It enables her work but does not force a tradeoff or complicate a choice. Present in setup, but no development beat or closure linkage. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sheathe" appears twice: paragraph 12 ("sheathe her hunter-born instincts") as metaphor, and final line ("sheathed her pruning shears") as literal closure gesture. The verb choice bookends the piece and charges the final image with the instinct-to-tool contrast. However, the act itself is routine maintenance, not a turn that redefines options. Lyric reprise with light thematic weight, no causal pressure. Eligible for ~6.0 range but capped by lack of development beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is introduced paragraph 7 and demonstrated paragraphs 8–9 (touching specimens, embedding courage/patience/hope) and paragraph 19 (focusing intention of resilience on new cutting). The method is central to her identity and shown across three beats. However, it is never constrained by opposition or cost; no scene tests whether it works, fails, or demands sacrifice. Functional but consequences-free, swappable with generic "magic gardening."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is anchored in paragraph 1, provides sensory detail (heat, condensation, humidity), and frames all action. The dome "seemed to breathe with her" (paragraph 15) and offers sanctuary contrast to the harsh desert outside. Visitors feel profound peace (paragraph 17). Setting is coherent and participates in tone/theme, but it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Present across all three gates with thematic charge but no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the tower fell" anchors the story in a post-collapse setting (paragraphs 2, 22) and motivates Rhiannon's mission to weave continuity. However, the timeframe is static backstory; no urgency arises from elapsed time, and no clock tightens her decisions. "Today" marks the present scene, but it is one day indistinguishable from any other in her routine. Setup only, no development or closure participation. Functional context without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To weave continuity through chaos" is stated paragraph 10 and paragraph 25 (final reflection). The motivation is told and thematically consistent, but it is never dramatized through conflicting desires or an on-page cost. Rhiannon pursues it without obstacle or tradeoff. The goal shapes her philosophy but not her choices, since no choice occurs. Present in setup and closure frame, but no middle development beat where competing wants create friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is named once (paragraph 18) and operationalized as the contradiction visitors experience: profound peace amid fierce survival. Tone is coherent throughout—contemplative diction, slow pacing, sensory calm—but it does not modulate with pressure because no pressure arises. The oxymoron charges the thematic center but not the final image, which remains uniformly serene. Setup and middle atmosphere present; closure participation is thematic echo rather than tonal shift.</comment>
