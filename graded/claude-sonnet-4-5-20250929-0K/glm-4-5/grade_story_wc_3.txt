<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is defined almost entirely through exposition—her dedication, intellectual strengths, and approach are told rather than shown through on-page choices under pressure. The alleged "kindly methodical precision" never constrains a decision; no contradictory impulses appear in scene. The final boarding sequence offers no visible cost or trade-off, only summary of prior generations' struggles and a declarative claim that she "felt not ambition but purpose" without embodied tension or micro-choice to earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who (Elara), where (study), and when (after spirit departs) arrive early enough, but the piece is a single unbroken expository block with no scene pressure or causal linkage—pure summary of background, objects, and aspirations. No on-page closure: the story ends mid-setup with Elara boarding a vessel; no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs. The "quest" is announced but never tested, leaving no felt cost or transformed option. Drive lens is indeterminate because no pressure accumulates and no beat turns.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting elements (magnetic arbor, Pamir Mountains, upper atmosphere) remain abstract postcards without sensory grounding or spatial choreography. The study is cluttered but unanchored; no tool, body detail, or environmental constraint shapes a choice. The seed's "subtle vibration" and the arbor's "crackling static energy" are described but never interact with on-page action. Orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding and planting the seed at the magnetic arbor—is signaled early but remains entirely abstract; no on-page beat narrows options or tests commitment. "Haunted ambitions" are attributed to predecessors in summary, not dramatized. The boarding moment offers no reversal, tightening, or visible price paid. Escalation under any lens is absent; the piece is setup without pressure, so no cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of transition (matter to energy, mortality to consciousness) is stated repeatedly in abstract language rather than emerging from particulars. The final sentence's "unbroken continuum" is a thematic declaration, not a resonant image earned by scene work. "Touching distance" as motif appears once mid-text without recurrence or reweighting at closure. No epiphany is earned through on-page experience; all insight is asserted exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent elevated register and third-person distance throughout, with no head-hopping. However, diction often slips into generic academic phrasing ("physics of transition," "cosmic secrets," "intellectual grasp") without POV-specific coloring. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's way of noticing reads as neutral narrator rather than character-particular filter. Psychic distance remains stable but uninflected by pressure since no on-page scene exists.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "haunted ambitions" restated across two sentences, "magnetic arbor" described in three adjacent clauses with synonym churn, and the seed's properties recycled without new information. Template cadence: runs of "The [noun] [past-tense verb]" openings stack across the first half. Register drifts into pseudo-academic abstraction ("physics of transition," "analogical thinking," "electromagnetic anomalies") without voice motivation. Orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) disallows 9+ and caps high-band entries at 8.8 globally; Q7 artifact spread triggers additional line-level penalty (−1.2 for loops, cadence, and register drift combined).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—ancient cuneiform scholar seeks mythical tree via mentor spirit—combines familiar tropes (mystical guide, MacGuffin seed, hidden realm) without fresh synthesis. "Magnetic arbor" and "knowledge fruit" read as high-concept labels rather than organically integrated worldbuilding. No on-page turn or character-specific inflection personalizes the familiar quest setup. The analogical-thinking method is announced but never demonstrated in a concrete beat, leaving the premise generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Cuneiform translator role is present throughout but no on-page translation choice or language puzzle drives a beat. Her profession frames backstory but does not constrain or enable action; she boards a vessel at the end without using her skill.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Knowledge fruit seed appears in setup (cradled, described) and boarding scene (pulsing in pocket) but is never planted, used, or traded. Two static mentions without evolving meaning or cost. No closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Haunted ambitions attributed to predecessors in one expository paragraph; Elara is declared different ("made of different stuff") but no on-page choice dramatizes this distinction or shows ambition constraining her.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" appears once as a label describing her approach; no on-page action embodies kindness or methodical process under pressure, and no cost is tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Reestablish" (the lineage of knowledge) is mentioned in the opening as a task after the spirit departs, but no on-page beat shows her rebuilding, teaching, or transmitting knowledge. Not tied to closure or middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Analogical thinking" is named as her "greatest intellectual strength" and a paragraph lists three analogies (magnetic stones, weather patterns, cylinder seals), but the process is told, not shown in a live problem-solving beat. Appears in middle third; no closure use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor above the clouds is described in setup and referenced at boarding, but remains an off-page destination. No sensory encounter, no constraint on present action, no micro-setting function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the spirit leaves" anchors the opening and establishes the inciting condition (she must now act alone). The timeframe shapes her emotional state and the passing of responsibility, but no on-page clock tightens decisions or alters tactics within the single expository block.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To understand the physics of transition" is stated as the ultimate goal and restated in thematic language, but no on-page choice tests this desire against a conflicting cost or alternative want. Told-only motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Touching distance" is named once mid-text ("always close to understanding, yet maintaining a respectful separation") as a conceptual metaphor but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Static mood; no tonal shift across beats.</comment>
