<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is labeled "dynamically observant" but never makes a micro-choice under pressure; he passively witnesses and then walks toward the construction site without contradiction or cost. His motivation—"to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"—arrives as exposition tied to his brother's rejection but never complicates a present decision. Interiority consists of poetic declarations ("A form of amnesty," "luminous disbelief") rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final vow ("I will recount this impossible journey") performs agency without forfeiting a live option or testing the proclaimed motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who Elias is, what "bridge-song fiddler" means, why he's at this pullout) and never anchors his ordinary world or what he stands to lose; apply −0.4 for orientation debt. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural mode but closure is a passive ascent with no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing—only iterative poetic assertion. No visible cost: Elias loses nothing by stepping onto the scaffold, and the final paragraph's claims ("heal every wound," "pure, unfiltered light of understanding") are told outcomes, not on-page reweightings. The drive lens remains ambiguous (lyric catalog or causal journey?) past midpoint and unresolved at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The mountain scenic pullout, guardrail, and construction site are named but remain postcard backdrops—no spatial constraint affects Elias's walk or choice. The glass flake is handled (warmed, projects an image) and scaffold wrap flutters recur across beats, which lifts the score into functional range. However, the wrap's "secret map" is asserted rather than demonstrated through lived spatial pressure, and the final ascent occurs without altitude, scaffold geometry, or wind affecting his body or decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake is never dramatized: Elias observes a vanishing, hears a declaration of stakes in his own interiority, then walks toward a site without opposition, cost, or a narrowed option. The hitchhiker's request for "a song about second chances" and her pixelated disappearance occur before the story's present action begins, so no on-page reversal or tightening tests commitment. Coincidence (the glass flake projects a bridge, the wrap forms wings) resolves without protagonist agency, and the final "ascent toward where the hitchhiker waited" is asserted rather than earned by prior pressure or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and "pixelated amnesty" is announced in nearly every paragraph ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never,'" "tapestry of redemption encoded in light") rather than emerging from concrete image or action. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "echo of luminous disbelief that would, in time, heal every wound" and "entrusted to the wind, the mountain, and all who climb beyond the visible horizon toward home." Recurrence of "bridge-song," glass flake, and scaffold wrap accumulates texture but does not constrain choice or reweight meaning at closure, remaining ornamental.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited on Elias with no head-hopping. However, diction oscillates between spare action ("fingers still vibrating," "glass flake in palm") and elevated poetic register ("luminous disbelief," "transfiguration," "pure, unfiltered light of understanding") that exceeds a fiddler's plausible lexicon under stress. Free indirect style is clean, but perceptual signature is generic—Elias "catalogues" details like a camera rather than filtering through musician-specific priorities. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The scaffold wrap flutters intensified, their map now undeniable—a pathway to where the hitchhiker had gone" restates what prior lines already claimed without added pressure (apply −0.4). Synonym churn: "luminous disbelief" appears three times, "pixelated amnesty" four times, "bridge-song" five times, "scaffold wrap flutters" six times, often in adjacent paragraphs with decorative variation but no causal advance (apply −0.6). Template cadence: eight sentences open with "The [noun]" in the first half alone (apply −0.4). Stock metaphors: "tapestry of redemption," "lantern illuminating the path," "wings around his frame." Mixed metaphor: scaffold wrap "flutters" form "wings" and simultaneously "map" a "secret"—three vehicles for one unclear effect. Filter-verb stack: "began to recount," "seemed to listen," "began to play" across three lines (apply −0.3). Register drift: "transfiguration," "cognitive," "rendered in pixels" clash with fiddler's voice. Information density is low—most sentences restate prior symbolic claims. Total deductions in Q7: baseline −0.6 (loops), −0.6 (churn), −0.4 (template), −0.3 (filters), capped at −1.7 under artifact penalty pack, plus coherence muddle −0.3; artifacts touch closure (final paragraph repeats "bridge-song," "scaffold wrap," "luminous disbelief"), so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical vanishing at a scenic pullout, magical object guides protagonist to another dimension—follows a fantasy portal template without transformation through specific world logic or earned character cost. "Bridge-song fiddler" and "wet-plate collodion glass flake" offer surface novelty but function as flavor text rather than driving unique choices. Emotional arc (witnessing wonder, accepting invitation) could transfer to any mystical-threshold story with name swaps. No fresh inflection: the final ascent and reunion are asserted conveniences, not surprising inevitabilities rooted in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Bridge-song fiddler (Elias) is present throughout but makes no causal choice—he observes, recounts aloud to no one, walks toward the site, and steps onto the scaffold without resistance or trade-off. His fiddle-playing occurs before the story's present action (he "had finished playing"). The character is a passive observer whose occupation is mentioned but not enacted or constrained on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Wet-plate collodion glass flake appears in beat one (guardrail), beat two (warming in palm, projects image), and beat three (guides him toward the site). It enables his walk by projecting "a faint image—a bridge neither here nor there" and showing "countless moments of vanishing and reappearing." However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; Elias never hesitates, questions the vision, or sacrifices anything to follow it. The flake's return in the penultimate paragraph ("remained on the guardrail, waiting for the next traveler") is a summary assertion, not a dramatized reweighting. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is weak (summary-only). Swappable with any magical scrying object. Cap at 4.6 for missing strong closure participation; adjust to 4.8 for two-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Pixelated amnesty is named and described (the hitchhiker's dissolution, "not an end but an invitation") but never becomes a stake or tactical constraint for Elias. It is referenced four times as thematic decoration ("a symphony of pixelated amnesty," "the pixelated amnesty he had witnessed," "whose heart was open to pixelated amnesty") without altering his options or creating friction. The concept could be removed and replaced with "mysterious vanishing" with no structural change. Ornamental mention across beats; no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Dynamically observant is label-only: Elias "had already catalogued every detail" (told summary) but no on-page moment shows this trait enabling or constraining an action. His observations are passive and do not shape a micro-choice under pressure. No visible trade-off where heightened perception costs him time, energy, or social standing. Mentioned once in the opening paragraph and never tested.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Recount appears twice: Elias "began to recount the morning's events aloud" (middle beat) and vows "I will recount this impossible journey" (ending). The first recounting causes the world to "listen" and the scaffold wrap to shift, but this is asserted effect, not dramatized consequence—no interlocutor, no cost, no resistance. The second is a future intention, not an on-page action. The action does not create a key turn; easily swappable with "reflect on" or "sing about." Setup and weak development present; no closure participation beyond declaration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters is seeded early (construction site in beat one), developed in beat two ("shifted, revealing what could only be a secret mapped by their movements"), and returns in beats three and four ("intensified, their map now undeniable," "formed wings around him"). The mechanics are asserted ("cosmic language composed of construction plastic") but never constrain an attempt—Elias does not decode, navigate, or fail; the wrap simply "embraces him" and "formed wings" as convenient aid. The method enables the final ascent but does not shape tactics or impose a learning cost. Three gates met; swappable with any mystical guide. Cap at 3.8 for swappability; adjust to 3.6 for late-middle introduction and summary-only mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Mountain scenic pullout is named in the opening and closing paragraphs but supplies no constraint or resource—no altitude effects, no guardrail limiting movement, no traffic or witnesses. The construction site below is mentioned but never explored spatially; Elias walks there without physical effort or obstacle. Setting is postcard frame, not pressure. Present in setup and closure, but closure participation is decorative ("The mountain scenic pullout stood empty"). Cap at 4.6 for missing development; adjust to 3.4 for ornamental closure use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>After the hitchhiker vanishes is the story's inciting frame, present throughout. However, time does not tighten: no clock, no urgency, no sense that delay costs Elias an option. The timeframe is a static backdrop rather than a live constraint. The phrase "in time" appears in the penultimate paragraph but refers to abstract future healing, not story pressure. Setup gate met; development and closure gates weak. Adjust to 4.2 for frame presence across all beats without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>To sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never" is told exposition tied to "his brother's rejection of their shared musical legacy" and never dramatized in conflict. Elias does not face a choice between safety and risk, nor does he sacrifice a live option to pursue this desire. The motivation is mentioned once in the middle and echoed in the penultimate vow but does not create friction or constrain an action. Told-only; no cost. Single-beat thematic mention; no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Luminous disbelief appears three times ("gave name to his luminous disbelief," "his luminous disbelief now a lantern," "echo of luminous disbelief that would, in time, heal every wound") and the tone is consistently one of awed acceptance without skepticism or fear. However, tone does not modulate under pressure—Elias experiences no doubt, resistance, or cognitive friction as he witnesses impossibility and steps toward another dimension. The final image asserts that disbelief transforms into "pure, unfiltered light of understanding," which shifts from the original phrase but is told rather than embodied. Coherent but static mood; weak closure charge. Three-beat presence; no pressure-driven modulation. Adjust to 4.7 for consistent presence without tension.</comment>
