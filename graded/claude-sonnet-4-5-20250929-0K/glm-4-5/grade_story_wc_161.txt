<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore her courier service is present but arrives through extended reflection rather than dramatized pressure. The opening establishes her past as a pigeon trainer, but the decision to return lacks contradiction or visible struggle—she smoothly progates from discovery to restoration without embodied cost. Internal conflict is told ("fought to erase") rather than shown through simultaneous impulses in scene. The final choice feels inevitable from page one rather than earned through on-page resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—Elara reclaims her identity and releases the first pigeon. The orientation window extends past 120 words (attic location arrives early, but "who" clarifies slowly through backstory). Cost is present but muted: she signs a new name and sends a bird, but what she forfeits on the page remains abstract. The meteorite functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a constraint that narrows options, and the weeks-long compression flattens escalation into summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The attic setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (aging paper, slow decay, skylight beam, dust motes). The meteorite as paperweight and the dust-mote swirls function as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, spatial choreography occasionally drifts—Elara moves between examining the meteorite, writing, and releasing a bird without clear transitions. The skylight and dust patterns constrain her method of divination, lifting the score toward the middle band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring her courier service and reclaiming her identity—is signaled early but develops through reflection rather than on-page pressure. No meaningful obstacle or tightening occurs; the meteorite discovery leads smoothly to letter-writing to bird release. The "bleak winters" that claimed her pigeons are summarized backstory, not a present threat. Agency exists in the final act (releasing the bird), but the lack of a live cost or complication before closure keeps this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of reclaiming lost identity and honoring past loss emerges through image (dust motes, paper trails, meteorite) rather than statement. The blooming/withering motif recurs purposefully. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("finding balance at last between her past and future") that replaces scene pressure. The meteorite and dust motes function symbolically but the resonance relies on cumulative texture rather than a non-literal reweighting of the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is present in the detailed attention to dust motes and paper texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cosmic timeline," "guidance system," "renewed direction") that feels more authorial than character-bound. The final lines ("the songs echoing once more upon the wind that carried her home") lean into poetic summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Heavy density of figurative language without clear pattern-teaching: "discarded feathers," "bloomed in her senses," "stubborn dust motes," "swirling in patterns that seemed to shift according to her heartbeat," "paper trails unfurling against the ancient blue." Mixed metaphors ("bloomed...even as it withered") and paraphrase loops across adjacent sentences reduce clarity. Template cadence in mid-section: "She discovered... She began using... she whispered... she discovered..." Overwriting in peak beats (final paragraph) with stacked metaphors that blur propulsion. Apply −0.8 for density and coherence issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of pigeon courier + Mars meteorite + divination by dust motes offers surface novelty, but the emotional arc (leaving a calling, rediscovering it through a symbolic object) follows a familiar template. The meteorite functions as a talisman rather than transforming the premise through specific world logic or moral calculus. The particulars (vintage bookshop attic, indigo ink) are vivid but feel selected for texture rather than irreplaceability. No single turn feels inevitable in hindsight; swapping the meteorite for another symbolic object would leave the arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Courier pigeon trainer trait is established early and shapes the closure (releasing the first bird), but the trainer skills are summarized in backstory rather than demonstrated on the page. Her choice to restore the service is announced rather than tested. Meets setup and closure gates; middle development is reflective rather than active.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mars meteorite chip appears early, is handled across multiple beats (paperweight, held to skylight, ceremonial charm), and anchors the final action. However, its unique properties (extraterrestrial origin, warmth) do not constrain a choice or create cost—it functions symbolically. Meets all three gates but lacks causal pressure that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paper trails appear as a recurring image (parchment patterns, paper thickness, ink composition) and shape her divination method. Present in setup and middle, and the final image includes "paper trails unfurling." However, the concept remains metaphorical—it does not alter tactics under pressure or force a trade-off. Lyric resonance without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Reinvents personal history" is stated early ("reinvention of personal history wasn't as tidy as she'd hoped") and frames her arc from fictional bookseller to reclaimed identity. Present in setup and payoff (new signature), but the constraint or cost of reinvention is told rather than shown in a specific on-page action. Middle development is summary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Balance" recurs across beats (balancing the meteorite on pages, measuring weight of decisions, finding balance at closure). Present in setup, middle, and ending. However, the action is largely internal and symbolic—she balances objects rather than weighing a live choice with visible cost. The concept threads through but does not redefine options at a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight" is signaled early and described in the middle ("by mapping these swirls, she could predict which way her thoughts would turn"). However, the method is ornamental—no scene shows her using this divination to alter a tactic or make a difficult choice. Present but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vintage bookshop attic is established early with vivid sensory detail and provides the skylight for dust-mote divination. The setting houses the meteorite discovery and final bird release. It constrains her world (small, isolated) and supplies the resources (books, parchment, skylight). Meets all three gates and participates in closure, though spatial pressure is more textural than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Across learning to trust again" spans weeks ("days that grew into weeks") and culminates in the "seventh Thursday." Time is tracked but does not tighten decisions—the weeks compress into summary without escalating pressure. Present in setup and closure but development is reflective rather than clock-driven.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of lost songs" is stated explicitly ("she needed to preserve the echo of lost songs") and motivates the letter and service restoration. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure (songs "echoing once more"). However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. The friction between preservation and her prior abandonment is told in backstory.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" tone is woven throughout with contrasting images (bloomed/withered, new life/honored what came before, ancient blue/dawn). The motif charges the final image and modulates with her emotional arc. However, the tone occasionally flattens into poetic summary rather than shifting under scene pressure. Purposeful lyric reprise lifts this into the mid-band.</comment>
