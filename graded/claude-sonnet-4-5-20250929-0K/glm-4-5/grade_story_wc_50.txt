<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is largely decorative rather than contradictory; she observes patterns and applies locksmithing metaphors but faces no meaningful internal conflict. The "reflective mind" trait is asserted through narration rather than dramatized through choice. Her father's teaching and the historian's advice are delivered as wisdom blocks without friction or cost. The ending choice—successful repair—feels inevitable rather than earned by visible struggle or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive past 120 words without deliberate pattern payoff (−0.4). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs; Elara maps reflections for weeks in summary, then the timer simply works. Closure lacks visible cost—the "harvest" succeeds without sacrifice, trade-off, or consequence. The "wounded season" remains metaphorical decoration rather than a constraint that shapes tactics. Q3 capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test; Q1 and Q5 capped at 8.3.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The marble cavern's "polished white and gray veins" and reflection angles are described at length but never constrain a choice or alter Elara's tactics. The setting functions as a visual backdrop rather than a pressure source. Spatial choreography is vague—where she stands, how she moves tools, what she manipulates remain abstract. The cavern "growing warmer" is asserted sentiment without causal grounding. Orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the timer—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, complication, or trade-off appears; Elara studies, understands, and succeeds in linear sequence. The "wounded season" lull offers no clock pressure or forced choice. Agency is observation rather than decision; the mechanism "awakens" without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Wonder stored in the cellar of reason" and "echoes preserved against forgetting" are asserted thematically but not earned through specific event or image. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "some locks are meant to be opened across time" (−0.6 for overt theme statement in closure). The timer's function—transforming emotion into durable structure—is told rather than dramatized. No counter-reading or ambiguity exists; the resolution is entirely affirming.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-limited throughout. The prose carries a consistent elevated register with metaphorical density, though diction occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("whispers of voices long gone, melodies half-forgotten"). No dialogue appears; the historian's quoted line and narrator's voice are indistinguishable in register. Perceptual signature is asserted ("peripherally focused mind") but not enacted through distinct noticing patterns under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Days turned to weeks as Elara meticulously mapped…understanding growing not in a rush but in the accumulation of small revelations" recycles prior summary without new pressure. Multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "As [subject] [verb]" across adjacent paragraphs. Stock metaphors cluster: "dust on the ancient cavern floor," "morning mist," "tide of forgetting." Figurative density in non-peak beats (the entire middle) approaches 70% without pattern teaching (−1.2 cumulative in Q7). Artifacts touch closure: "wonder stored where reason could keep it safe" is abstraction replacing image (−1.7 total, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The locksmith-restores-memory-device premise follows a familiar template: patient artisan succeeds through observation where others failed. The "harvest of echoes" metaphor and "wounded season" framing are poetic but do not transform the central arc. No fresh inflection or non-obvious turn emerges; the timer is broken, studied, and fixed in expected sequence. Elara's "reflective" trait and peripheral vision are asserted labels rather than levers that create inevitable consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her profession frames the metaphor system, but her choices are minimal: she accepts the task, observes, and succeeds without complication. Observation dominates; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup present, no middle choice under pressure, closure is passive success. Swappable with another patient artisan archetype. Cap 3.8 for replaceable role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timer appears in beat one (handed over), is studied in summary across the middle, and "awakens" at the end. Three touches across setup/development/closure, but only the final beat dramatizes interaction. The mechanism's function—capturing echoes via crystal and gears—remains abstract; no specific property (weight, gear count, crystal angle) constrains a choice. Mid-band for structural presence without causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Harvest of echoes" is named early and appears in the final paragraph, but its mechanics (how sound is captured, transformed, stored) remain metaphorical. The concept frames theme but does not shape tactics or force a trade-off. Elara's method (mapping reflections) connects only loosely to "harvesting." Functional thematic presence without decision pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused mind" is asserted twice ("saw what they missed," "caught patterns others ignored") but never enacted. No scene shows Elara missing a direct target while noticing an edge detail, or suffering a cost from indirect attention. Label-only trait without visible constraint or tradeoff (−0.6). Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Reverse-engineer" is named by the historian in beat one and mentioned again when Elara "began reconstruction," but the actual reverse-engineering (disassembly, hypothesis, test) is summarized in one sentence. The action is structurally present but not dramatized. Swappable with "repair" or "restore" with minor edits. Mid-functional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara marks reflection angles at dawn/noon/twilight and records geometry changes across weeks. The method appears in setup (paragraph 9-11) and enables the final calibration (paragraph 16). Two beats, but the mechanics (why angles matter, how they map to crystal alignment) remain vague. The method shapes the solution without showing specific constraint or failed attempt. Causal role in two beats lifts it into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The marble cavern is named early and its reflective surfaces enable Elara's method. The setting provides the experiment's medium (walls as mirrors) and appears in the closure image (reflections swirling). Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with one functional middle role (reflection study). The cavern does not constrain movement or force a tactical trade-off; it is a passive resource. Eligible ~6.0 for two gates, slight reduction for passivity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "wounded season" is introduced early and mentioned repeatedly ("lull," "strange progression," "would eventually pass"), but no clock tightens decisions. Days turn to weeks in summary without deadline or urgency. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than mechanical. Setup present, no middle pressure, closure mentions healing passively. Functional background without tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Store wonder in the cellar of reason" appears as a past teaching (beat one) and is paraphrased in the final paragraph, but Elara's desire is never tested or conflicted. She wants to preserve echoes, and she does; no competing want or fear creates friction. The motivation frames the goal without forcing a choice between it and another value. Lyric reprise without mid-scene pressure or trade-off.</comment>
