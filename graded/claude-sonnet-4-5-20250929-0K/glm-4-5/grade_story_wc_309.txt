<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is stated clearly—yearning for the sacred in the simple—but his interior life reads generic and label-driven rather than contradictory or embodied. The journey unfolds through summary ("his journey took him northward") rather than micro-choices under pressure. The final transformation ("not more powerful but more present") is asserted rather than earned through on-page conflict between competing impulses. Emotional states are described from outside ("felt the oppressive weight") without the specificity or irrationality that would make them character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative touches; the keystone discovery and unstrapping sequence offer one meaningful turn. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. However, the climactic moment—unstrapping the regulation pack—is summary-compressed ("with deliberate fingers, he began to unstrap each binding") rather than dramatized beat-by-beat, dulling the cost and agency. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias returns transformed, the spire subtly changes), but the cost is told ("started as an underachieving mage… ended as a pioneer") rather than shown in a specific forfeiture or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The icebound spire and cloud-layer garden folly provide vivid visual anchors. Sensory detail leans heavily on sight ("crystalline window," "brilliant dimness") with minimal tactile or auditory grounding during the mist-walking journey. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment does not constrain a choice at closure; the keystone's location is convenient rather than costly to reach. The body and the regulation pack approach micro-setting status but are described rather than handled in a way that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding wonder beyond automated magic—is signaled early. The unstrapping moment offers one tightening that narrows options, but it arrives without prior escalation or visible trade-off (no failed attempt, no injury, no social cost dramatized on the page). The final image (small group practicing forgotten arts) tells of a new equilibrium rather than showing a persistent price or constraint shaping Elias's next move. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens but does not tighten with a felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—wonder cannot be programmed—emerges from the keystone's lingering luminance and the contrast between automated and raw magic. The final image attempts a non-literal answer but leans toward summary ("a testament to enduring wonder") rather than a charged, specific particular. The brilliant dimness motif recurs but is described more than it constrains or reweights a choice. No diagnostic label-speak or overt moralizing, but the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than dramatized resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not distinct—"crystalline," "brilliant dimness," "paradoxically bright yet lacking true radiance" reads as elevated diction that does not shift under pressure. One instance of untranslated text ("волшебные properties") disrupts voice and clarity without purpose. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he could") appear frequently but do not flatten immediacy enough to require penalty. Diction remains within a consistent register but lacks the rhythmic modulation or compression that would mark mastery under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no ambiguous pronouns or tense slips. However, paraphrase loops appear: "crystalline window… crystalline air formations," "brilliant dimness… brilliantly… bright yet lacking true radiance" within adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence in the climax paragraph: "As he approached… With deliberate fingers… The moment the final clasp…" stacks similar sentence openings without purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate; several beats summarize rather than advance (e.g., "Images flooded his mind" tells rather than shows the vision). The untranslated word "волшебные" (Russian for "magical") is a copy artifact that harms clarity; apply −0.4 in Q7 for this single opacity touching a key object.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—underachieving mage seeks lost magic in an automated age—is a recognizable template (protagonist rejects sterile system, finds ancient power, returns transformed). The garden folly keystone and mist walking offer specific details but do not transform the arc; the journey feels preordained rather than risky. No meaningful subversion or fresh moral calculus; the resolution (return with wisdom, inspire small group) is the expected path. One fresh inflection: "brilliant dimness" as a paradox, but it is described rather than dramatized through a non-obvious choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and the story turns on his choices (performing forbidden ritual, unstrapping the pack). Setup clear in opening; middle development shows him traveling and approaching the keystone; closure participation via his return and transformation. However, the key choices are summarized ("determined to find it," "began to unstrap") rather than shown as micro-decisions under pressure. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is travel rather than conflicted choice. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability (another "seeker" mage could substitute with minor edits) −0.6, and summary-only unstrapping −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.8 + 0.6 − 1.2 = 4.2, round to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The keystone appears in the archive mention (setup), is discovered and lifted (middle/climax), and glows in Elias's chamber at closure (payoff). Three gates met. Handled on the page twice (discovery, lifting) with the final glow as a static reprise. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (lingering luminance property) +0.5, but ornamental final mention (glowing without further action or reweighted meaning) −0.5, and swappable (another magical artifact could serve similar plot function) −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.5 − 0.9 = 4.6, but the keystone drives the climax and appears in the final image; adjust +2.2 for causal centrality = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Lingering luminance is named in the archive text (setup), described at the keystone discovery, and mentioned in the final glow. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle development is descriptive rather than tactical. The concept does not constrain a choice—Elias does not struggle with how to channel or control the luminance; it simply "expanded" when he unstrapped. Early signal +0.4, one beat (discovery description) +0.4, closure mention +0.5, but ornamental (no cost or tactics altered by the luminance's mechanics) −0.8, and theme-only echo in final paragraph −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.3 − 1.2 = 3.1, round to ~4.9 for setup and payoff presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Accommodates impossibilities: named in the opening ("age when creativity got automated… no room for the flawed magic"), demonstrated in mist walking ("clouds beneath his feet solidified… accommodating impossibilities"), and echoed in the garden folly's bloom. Three gates met. Early signal +0.6, two beats (mist walking, folly bloom) +0.9, closure linkage (folly bloom at climax) +0.8, but the trait is descriptive rather than constraining a choice with cost—Elias does not wrestle with the impossibility or pay a price for it; it simply works. Swappable (another world-rule like "bends reality" could substitute) −0.6, and label-only in opening −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.3 − 0.9 = 4.4, adjust +1.2 for mid-scene demonstration = 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Unstrap: signaled via the regulation pack's oppressive weight, performed as the climactic action, and its effect (keystone's luminance expanded) drives the transformation. Three gates met. Early setup (pack mentioned at discovery) +0.5, climax beat +0.4, closure linkage (transformation begins here) +1.2, causal pressure (releases constraint) +0.8, but the action is summarized ("began to unstrap each binding") rather than dramatized with individual clasp or cost −0.7, and the mechanics are convenient (no injury, no failure) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.9 − 1.2 = 4.7, adjust +1.6 for turning-point role = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mist walking: mentioned in archive research (setup), performed ("stepped from the spire, the clouds beneath his feet solidified"), and implied in the return journey. Three gates met. Early signal +0.5, one beat (journey description) +0.4, closure linkage (return journey) +0.4, but the method is summarized in one sentence without mechanics that matter to the outcome—no cost, no difficulty, no choice altered by how it works. Swappable (another transport method could substitute) −0.6, and ornamental (journey is transit, not pressure) −0.7. Base 3.0 + 1.3 − 1.3 = 3.0, adjust +2.1 for setup and payoff presence = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Icebound spire: established in opening paragraph with vivid description, serves as departure and return location. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle is the garden folly, not the spire. Early signal +0.8, two beats (departure, return) +0.9, closure linkage (return and transformation) +0.6, but the spire does not constrain a choice or provide a resource that alters tactics—it is backdrop. Postcard description (crystalline window, automated spells painting clouds) −0.8, and swappable (another high tower or magical academy could substitute) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.3 − 1.4 = 3.9, adjust +0.8 for framing role = 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "when creativity gets automated" is stated in opening paragraph, echoed in "age of automated creativity" at closure. Two gates (setup, payoff); no middle development where the timeframe tightens a decision. Early signal +0.6, closure mention +0.3, but the timeframe does not create urgency or alter tactics—no clock, no deadline, no temporal pressure on Elias's choices. Theme-only echo −0.7, and ornamental (a static backdrop label) −0.8. Base 3.0 + 0.9 − 1.5 = 2.4, adjust +1.4 for setup and conceptual framing = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Motivation to find the sacred in the simple: stated in opening, drives archive research and mist-walking choice, and is fulfilled in the closing realization. Three gates met. Early signal +0.8, two beats (archive, journey) +0.9, closure linkage (realization "sacred in the simple act of being present") +1.0, but the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices—no scene where Elias weighs this desire against a cost or competing want. Told-only −0.8, and no visible friction between want and cost on the page −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.7 − 1.4 = 4.3, adjust +1.6 for driving the arc = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Brilliant dimness: named and described in opening ("ice glistened with a brilliant dimness, paradoxically bright yet lacking true radiance"), appears at keystone discovery ("brilliant dimness intensified"), and recurs in final paragraph ("small corners exhibiting the brilliant dimness"). Three gates met. Early signal +0.7, two beats (opening, keystone) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, specificity (paradox anchors tone) +0.4, but the tone is static—the prose does not modulate between opening and climax; descriptions remain elevated and similar throughout. No cadence shift under pressure −0.7, and the final mention is ornamental (tells rather than charges the image) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.8 − 1.2 = 4.6, adjust +0.8 for thematic coherence = 5.4.</comment>
