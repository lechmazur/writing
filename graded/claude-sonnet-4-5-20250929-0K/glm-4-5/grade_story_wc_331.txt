<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Margaret's interior is presented through abstract poeticism rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Her "mission" and methods are asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal genuine stakes or flaws. The interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("sanely eccentric," "analog memories") and stock gestures (traced invisible patterns, whispered verses) without demonstrating what she risks or loses if she fails. No meaningful change or credible endurance forecloses a path with visible cost—she completes her work and returns to her desk, satisfied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early enough, though "three in the morning" anchors time while "patrons browse" creates mild temporal confusion. Under an Accumulative lens, the hyperbolic geometry configuration builds toward a RR (Margaret connects permanently to the stories), but the cost is conceptual and heavily asserted ("scarf dissolved into particles," "purpose fulfilled") rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The link between arranging books and the "reawakening" relies on telling ("stories took physical form") rather than motivated causality, and the final image—returning to her desk with the scarf "stitched into her very soul"—is metaphorical summary rather than a legible before/after with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library setting is anchored and recurs across beats, providing atmosphere and framing the hyperbolic book arrangement. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—Margaret's actions are not meaningfully limited by the space, and patrons browsing (the timeframe element) never pressure her work. The hyperbolic configuration charges the final third, but the library itself does not alter tactics or supply resources that affect outcome; it remains a vivid container rather than an active force.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening dormant stories—is signaled early but remains abstract and unchallenged throughout. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; Margaret proceeds smoothly from arranging books to witnessing the result. The "approach of what she had long sought" and the scarf's dissolution are presented as fulfillment rather than a trade-off with visible cost. Patrons browsing never impose urgency, and the hyperbolic geometry resolves the problem it was introduced to solve without testing Margaret's commitment or forcing a sacrifice scaled to the story's length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the library-as-living-organism conceit and the tension between scientific principle and poetic truth, supported by the recurring scarf and hyperbolic geometry motif. The final image—"the place where stories live"—reprises the opening question with some resonance, though it tilts toward abstract philosophizing ("not a location... the space between") rather than a non-literal answer grounded in particulars. The ending avoids overt moralizing but edges close to thematic echo when Margaret articulates her life's purpose. Subtext operates in the invisible work and observed solitude, but the piece privileges statement over implication at key turns.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable, and perceptual filtering through Margaret's bibliophilic lens is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("emotional resonance," "analog memories," "narrative manifestations") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The prose carries a uniform poetic texture across all beats, reducing urgency differentiation. Narrative distance remains controlled, though the final paragraph's summary tone ("her life's purpose fulfilled through mathematics and metaphor") shifts into retrospective telling that flattens immediacy at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Sentence openings show variety, but the prose exhibits clear template cadence: "The [noun] [verbed]" and "Margaret [verbed]" structures recur heavily, with paraphrase loops around "tattered silk scarf" (five near-identical descriptors across the story) and "hyperbolic geometry" mentions. Stock metaphors—"long-lost lovers," "roots seeking water," "synapses firing"—accumulate in mid-beats without fresh specificity. Filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("she believed," "she felt," "she understood") without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy. The closure beat uses figurative summary ("stitched into her very soul") rather than concrete image, and the final paragraph loops conceptually over prior claims about purpose and secrets. Loop and scaffold penalties apply; −0.8 cumulative in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The fusion of scientific principle and poetic truth within a library setting offers a conceptual premise with some freshness, and hyperbolic geometry as method is less common. However, the emotional arc—dedicated librarian completes life's work and finds fulfillment—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Key images (scarf dissolving, invisible patterns, stories as threads) are metaphorically coherent but not surprising in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not risk bold perspectival or structural choices that would heighten stakes beyond the allegorical frame. Specificity in occupational detail (library science, geometry) is present but underutilized in shaping on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Margaret is present throughout and her action (arranging books) triggers the climax, but her role is largely observational and declarative rather than decision-driven. She executes a long-planned method without facing a meaningful dilemma or altering tactics under pressure. The odd-hour schedule frames the setting but does not constrain her work. Present in setup, middle action, and ending, but swappable with any devoted specialist; no unique property of being an "odd-hour librarian" drives a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tattered silk scarf appears in at least four beats: early description, trembling in response to the configuration, warming and conducting memories, unraveling and dissolving, then metaphorically transferring to Margaret's soul. It reprises with reweighted meaning at closure and is tied to the analog memories concept. However, its function is largely symbolic—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic Margaret could not perform otherwise. The dissolution carries conceptual cost but no visible trade-off that alters her options. Present across setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure is modest; specificity (grandmother's scarf, analog memories) is noted but not irreplaceable in narrative logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Analog memories" is introduced early as a descriptor for the scarf and recurs in thematic statements, but it remains abstract—never dramatized in a way that shapes on-page stakes or tactics. The concept does not change Margaret's options or methods; the scarf's role could function identically if framed as "family history" or "emotional connection." It echoes as theme but does not constrain action or enable a beat-level turn. Present in setup and ending; no middle development beat where it alters a choice; primarily ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is applied as a label twice and used to justify Margaret's organizational method ("emotional resonance"), but the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Her eccentricity is asserted rather than demonstrated through a trade-off or mistake that stems from the trait. The attribute could be removed and the plot would proceed unchanged. Label-only mention without functional pressure; no middle or closure beat where it matters causally.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Reawaken" frames Margaret's mission from the opening and the hyperbolic configuration is explicitly intended to reawaken dormant stories. The action drives the middle escalation (arranging books, witnessing manifestations) and the ending celebrates its success. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—stories "took physical form" and "pulsed with recognition"—and the action resolves a problem it was introduced to solve without testing Margaret's commitment. Present in setup (mission statement), middle (configuration glows), and ending (reawakening complete); causal pressure is moderate; not easily swappable but could be replaced with "unlock" or "restore" without restructuring. Specificity tied to the library context lifts it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced midway as the method Margaret has "found" and the book arrangement is described as "a shape that shouldn't exist in normal space." It appears in the escalation (configuration glows, curves reality) and ending (stable configuration, impossible equations), but its mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated—how it differs from other geometries or why it matters is told, not shown. The method enables the climax but is introduced late and resolves the problem it creates. Present in middle development and payoff; no setup beat. Late arrival and summary-only use cap at ~4.6; causal involvement at closure and specificity (not generic "magic") lift within that band to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is anchored early, recurs across beats (shelves, stacks, volumes of Shakespeare and Schrödinger), and the unique fusion of science and poetry supports the thematic premise. The setting supplies the books Margaret arranges and frames her odd-hour work. However, it does not pressure choices—Margaret's actions would proceed similarly in any library—and the spatial details (aisles, desk, window) remain static. Present in setup, middle, and ending; beat involvement is modest; no moment where the setting's constraints alter tactics. The scientific poetry fusion is specific but underutilized in shaping on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" is mentioned three times but functions as backdrop rather than timeframe constraint. The patrons never notice Margaret, never interrupt, and their browsing does not tighten her window or force a tactical choice. The story opens at "three in the morning" yet patrons are present, creating mild temporal confusion rather than urgency. Present as flavor but does not shape decisions or tactics; no live clock that alters moves. Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Margaret's desire "to find the place where stories live" is stated early and recurs as her "mission" and "life's purpose." The motivation drives her decades-long work and the climactic configuration, and the ending celebrates its fulfillment. However, the desire is asserted and summarized rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible costs—Margaret proceeds without doubt, sacrifice, or friction. No on-page moment where this want conflicts with another need or fear. Present in setup, middle pursuit, and ending resolution; told rather than enacted under pressure; no visible trade-off or foreclosed path tied to the motivation itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is invoked three times and frames Margaret's relationship to the library—she works while others sleep, patrons move past without seeing her invisible work. The tone is coherent and melancholic, supporting the theme of unacknowledged labor. However, it remains static; the tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image in a way that reweights prior material. The ending shifts to fulfillment and exhilaration, diluting the solitude motif rather than deepening it. Present in setup and middle; mentioned at closure but not decisively charged; specificity is modest; swappable with "quiet dedication" or "hidden devotion."</comment>
