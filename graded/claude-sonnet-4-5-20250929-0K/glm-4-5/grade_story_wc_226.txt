<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a labeled construct rather than a felt presence. Her "innocently mischievous" nature is asserted but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final sacrifice is declared but not earned through prior causality—no on-page moment forces her to weigh competing goods or pay a visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal experience is flattened into abstract philosophizing ("I am truth's reflection, not its container") rather than embodied emotion degrading under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive immediately, but no decisive change occurs on the page. The story recounts Elara's preparation and declares her success in the final paragraph without dramatizing the moment her actions narrow options or impose cost. The ending summarizes theme ("Whether she would be forgiven...mattered less") rather than landing a closure beat with felt consequence. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain stalls; under Accumulative, no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon echoes are vividly sketched and recur across beats, but they remain atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. No choice depends on spatial access, acoustic properties, or resource scarcity; Elara climbs the highest tower without friction. The pale spire is sighted repeatedly but never touched or navigated, leaving it a symbolic marker rather than a pressure point. Micro-setting (body, tool, or recurring object) does not shape the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—refracting singular truth—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening choice narrows Elara's options; the Overseers shadow her yet never force a trade-off or impose cost. The ending declares success ("she had succeeded") without dramatizing the turn that forecloses a path or the visible price paid. Escalation reads as repetition (she holds sessions across multiple dawns) rather than a meaningful deepening under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—truth as refracted light—is articulated clearly and recurs through imagery (echoes, spectrum, prism). Yet the ending states the theme outright ("truth, like light, only gained power when allowed to refract") rather than letting a final image or action offer a non-literal answer. The bone towers as memento mori are present but do not reweight the closure. Subtext is thin; Elara's declarations to her circle feel like thesis statements rather than lived particulars that accumulate pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("тайное mission," "forged hush") carries some idiosyncrasy. However, perceptual signature is weak—Elara's way of noticing does not shift under rising pressure. Dialogue, when present, sounds like manifesto rather than goal-driven speech with subtext. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") dull immediacy in several beats. Narrative distance remains uniform; no modulation for emotional intensity at the peak.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn accumulate: "challenge—like art daring convention," "refract a single truth / refract for others / refracted it into endless echoes." Template cadence appears in stacked participial openers ("As a rebellious artist," "As the day approached"). Stock metaphors ("truth as light") and abstract philosophizing replace concrete embodiment. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image and action, flattening momentum at closure. Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—artist defies absolutist ritual through poetry—leans on familiar rebellion-against-conformity templates without a fresh synthesis. The pale spire, bone towers, and ritual timeframe are vivid but archetypal rather than transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Elara's final whisper and the canyon's amplification read as metaphor-delivery rather than inevitable outcome rooted in prior particulars. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the story hedges toward median execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is named immediately and her defiance frames the premise, but her choices do not create key turns on the page. She gathers followers and whispers verse across multiple beats, yet no single decision alters tactics or imposes visible cost. The final climb is recounted, not dramatized as a moment of agency. Present and functional but does not drive escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in three beats (paragraphs 3, 14, 20) but remains a sighted symbol. Elara never approaches, touches, or uses it; its meaning does not evolve. Static description without causal pressure or charged reprise at closure. Introduced early but never integrated into action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"The price of forgiveness" is stated in paragraph 10 and echoed in paragraph 18, framing Elara's awareness of sacrifice. However, the concept is not dramatized through on-page cost—no moment where she weighs competing goods or pays a legible price that forecloses a path. Theme claim without tactical or escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Innocently mischievous" is asserted in paragraph 2 and restated in paragraph 13 but never embodied in action. No on-page choice shows Elara using playfulness to evade, provoke, or reframe a constraint. Label-only attribute without visible trade-offs or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Refract" appears across eight paragraphs (4, 8, 15, 18, 22, 23, 24) and anchors the thematic logic. The canyon echoes literalize refraction, and the final image invokes "countless beautiful forms." However, the action itself—splitting one truth into many—is recounted rather than dramatized in a peak beat where it alters options or imposes cost. Present throughout but does not turn the plot; replaceable with "scatter" or "multiply" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Impromptu poetry sessions are signaled in paragraph 5, recur across paragraphs 7, 8, 17, and shape the middle by gathering disenchanted followers. The method is named and its mechanics (echoing alcoves, reverberation) matter to the premise. However, no single session is dramatized in a beat where the method constrains choice or imposes cost. Functional across beats but does not participate in closure beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Bone towers and canyon echoes anchor the setting from paragraph 1 and recur throughout. The echoes literalize the refraction premise and the towers provide staging for the final climb. However, spatial choreography does not constrain tactics—Elara moves freely without friction. The canyon amplifies her voice but does not alter her choices under pressure. Shapes atmosphere and one beat (the climb) but does not pressure the closure decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Before the ritual" frames the premise in paragraph 4 and recurs in paragraphs 17, 23, 24. The approaching deadline signals urgency but does not tighten decisions on the page—no moment where the shrinking window forces Elara to choose between options or pay a cost. Clock present but vague; does not alter tactics beat by beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The desire to refract singular truth is stated in paragraph 4 and drives Elara's actions across multiple beats (paragraphs 7, 8, 15). However, motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs. No on-page moment where she weighs this goal against a competing need or pays a visible price. Present and causal but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Forged hush" is named in paragraph 6 and echoed in paragraph 17, anchoring a mood of oppressive quiet broken by whispers. Tone remains static across beats without modulation for pressure shifts. The final image invokes chorus and echoes but does not charge the hush with new meaning. Present as atmosphere but does not deepen or reconfigure at closure.</comment>
