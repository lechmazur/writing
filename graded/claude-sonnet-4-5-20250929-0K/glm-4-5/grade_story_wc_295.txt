<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to decode inscriptions is declared but never tested by competing wants or internal friction. Her "ability to heal with words" remains a label without on-page cost or contradiction—she never chooses between healing and another desire, nor does the gift exact a price. Dr. Thorne enters as a convenience solver rather than a source of pressure. The collaboration feels frictionless; no foreclosed path or visible sacrifice registers at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The closure unit—unlocking healing formulas through shared translation—lands on the page, but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no specific loss, renunciation, or altered relationship is visible in the final image. The causal chain from telegram to star-pattern to collaboration proceeds without obstacle or reversal, reading as and-then sequencing. The ending summarizes satisfaction and preparation for future dreams instead of showing a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observatory's telescopes and celestial charts ground the opening, and the variable stars constrain Elara's method of decoding. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop during the collaboration beat; no environmental feature pressures the final choice or charges the closure image beyond general atmosphere. The daylily telegram introduces tactile detail but does not evolve causally with events.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding temple inscriptions—is signaled early but never tightened by a live obstacle or competing priority. The telegram and Dr. Thorne's arrival solve rather than complicate; coincidence (his "complementary findings") resolves the problem it did not help create. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The collaboration proceeds without friction, and the ending distributes emotional payoff without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of shared burdens emerges through the collaboration, but it is stated outright ("By sharing this burden…") rather than discovered through conflicting choices. The final paragraph moralizes the lesson ("some knowledge was meant to be discovered not in isolation but together"), replacing scene pressure with thesis. The variable-star-to-glyph transformation offers a fresh conceptual link, but the ending's explain-everything mode flattens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (dreams, celestial patterns) is character-specific. Dialogue between Elara and Dr. Thorne is functional but generic; no subtext or distinct idiom separates their voices. The final paragraph's register ("midnight solace of completion," "peaceful certainty") drifts into elevated summary that abstracts rather than embodies her state. No head-hopping, but voice lacks rhythmic control under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "understanding was dawning" / "As understanding dawned completely" and "burden" repeated five times across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She had witnessed… deciphered… received") cluster in the final third. Stock metaphors ("slipping away like sand through fingers," "silent dance") and the thesaurus phrase "daylily-pressed telegram" (repeated identically three times) dull specificity. Clarity remains intact, but density and propulsion suffer from scaffold and synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The lucid-dream-chronicler premise and celestial-mapping setting combine familiar tropes (ancient temple inscriptions, lost healing wisdom) without a fresh moral calculus or lived detail that would transform them. The variable-stars-as-glyphs link is inventive, but the collaboration resolves frictionlessly, and the ending's "wisdom preserved" conclusion follows a predictable template. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the arc; the transformation test fails—swap names and the emotional beats remain generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as lucid dream chronicler supplies the recurring vision but does not drive a key turn. The dreams deliver information; her choices (adjusting the telescope, explaining to Dr. Thorne) are reactive observations rather than decisions that narrow options. Present throughout but replaceable with "researcher" or "astronomer" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram appears in three beats (arrival, placement on table, final mention), but its function is static: it delivers a cryptic message and is later cited as "a guidepost." The pressed flowers and yellowed paper are described but never handled or reweighted; removing the telegram and delivering the hint via another medium would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Shared burdens frames the collaboration beat and is stated explicitly ("By sharing this burden…"). The concept shapes the ending's thematic claim but does not constrain a middle choice or exact a visible cost—Elara and Dr. Thorne pool notes without sacrifice or friction. Present at setup and payoff; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The ability to "heal with words" is mentioned three times as a label but never demonstrated on the page with cost or consequence. No scene shows Elara using the gift, choosing whether to heal, or paying a price for the power. Swappable with "translate ancient texts" without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Witness" appears in the middle beat (watching star patterns transform into glyphs) and is echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("witnessed the connection"). The action enables decoding but is passive observation; Elara does not make a sacrificial choice to witness, and the verb could be replaced with "observe" or "discover" with minimal impact. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Variable stars are signaled early, constrain the decoding method (their patterns match temple symbols), and appear in the ending as "continued their silent dance." The mechanics matter: fluctuating brightness forms legible glyphs. However, the stars could be replaced with another astronomical phenomenon without breaking the logic. Two-beat involvement and causal pressure, but specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The celestial mapping observatory anchors the opening and provides the primary telescope Elara uses to decode the stars. Spatial details (glass dome, observation table) are present but do not pressure the collaboration or alter tactics. The setting supplies resources but could be swapped for another research facility without structural loss. Functional across setup and middle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" is echoed throughout ("understanding was dawning," "As understanding dawned completely," "understanding dawning") but functions as metaphorical theme rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. The dawn light arrives descriptively in two beats but does not constrain Elara's choices or pace. Present but not mechanically active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to decode temple inscriptions is stated early and sustained across all major beats. Elara's urgency is declared ("never been more urgent") and drives her to seek the telescope and collaborate with Dr. Thorne. However, the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—no scene shows her choosing decoding over another need. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" appears twice: once describing Dr. Thorne's voice and once in the final paragraph as "midnight solace of completion." The phrase labels a mood but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through rhythm or sensory texture. Tone remains soft and declarative throughout without tonal shift that would reweight the stake. Present but ornamental.</comment>
