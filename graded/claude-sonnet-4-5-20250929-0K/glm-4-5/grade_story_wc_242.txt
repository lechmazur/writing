<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to "teach endings how to begin" remains abstract and never converts into concrete micro-choices under pressure. The Meredith call shows him listening, but his internal contradiction (melodically haunted man fleeing music vs. suddenly creating "a new score") feels asserted rather than earned through prior struggle. Embodied emotion is sparse—grief and transformation are labeled ("melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement") without physical cost or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final shift from "resistance" to "patience" lacks visible forfeiture or a choice that closes off a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening paragraphs. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias moves from isolation to curated connection, reweighting "cultivated estrangement" as "a curated space for new beginnings." However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page sentence shows what he forfeits or what live option he forecloses. The causal lens wobbles: the glass disc "calling out" to Meredith and the line working after thirty-seven years read as magical convenience rather than motivated causality, undercutting the because/therefore linkage at the inciting beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel receives vivid, selective detail (pipes as "metallic intestines," condensation dripping "rhythmic punctuation") that establishes atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a tactical choice or alters the outcome—Elias could conduct the same conversation anywhere. The glass harmonica disc sits on a shelf and vibrates; spatial choreography (booth location, switchboard layout, distance to pipes) remains vague and does not pressure the protagonist's options. Under the micro-setting allowance, the booth and disc qualify for presence but not for 7.0+ necessity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: Elias's isolation and desire to transform endings. The Meredith call provides a single tightening moment, but escalation is minimal—she shares grief, he listens, they part with mutual gratitude. No reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the resolution ("ready" to await more calls) lacks a forfeited path or a price paid on the page. Coincidence (the impossible call, the disc's unexplained hum) initiates rather than complicates, weakening causal pressure. The final stance shift feels thematic rather than tactical, sidestepping the agency test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through unexpected connection—emerges from the Meredith call and the motif of "endings learning to begin." The glass harmonica disc recurs with shifting valence (haunting → hope), but the shift is told rather than demonstrated through a concrete choice or image that reweights prior cost. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("even in the deepest underground, one could still help teach endings") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext is thin; the conversation with Meredith operates at face value without implication or silence charging the exchange.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (melodic metaphors, solitary diction) fits the character's musicianship and isolation. Psychic distance remains consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cultivated estrangement," "curated space," "conductor of change") that reads more authorial than character-lived. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Meredith's lines pursue a goal (grief processing) and Elias's responses feel natural. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the execution, but the prose lacks rhythmic pressure variation at the peak Meredith beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences mar momentum: "Between the hum of streetlamps" repeats as a stem five times; "melodically haunted" and "glass harmonica disc" recur as synonym-churn anchors without added information. The final third stacks expository summary ("His cultivated estrangement had become...," "The subway utility tunnel, once a prison, now felt...") that restates theme rather than advancing image or action. Stock metaphors ("fortress of solitude," "loop," "sanctuary") appear without fresh particulars. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops and template cadence across multiple beats, baseline −0.8; artifacts touch the closure summary, escalating to −1.2 total in Q7. Additionally, the final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The underground phone operator premise and "wrong number as connection" trope are familiar writing-exercise templates without fresh transformation. Elias's backstory (wife's departure, failed musical career) and the glass harmonica disc read as convenient genre furniture rather than specific, lived-in detail. The moral calculus—isolation heals through service—resolves predictably without a non-obvious inflection. Applying the Derivative Premise Guardrail: the core premise closely matches widely used templates (operator in liminal space, magical object, grief counseling via misdial) and the story does not transform it through occupational rigor, world logic constraint, or an unexpected moral price; deduct −1.0 in Q8 for template reliance without synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes one key choice (to listen patiently to Meredith rather than disconnect), but the decision does not narrow options or impose visible cost. His shift from "resistance" to "patience" is told in summary rather than dramatized through a tactical fork. The character enables the closure thematically but does not drive a causal turn through on-page agency. Present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) but functional role is passive observation. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.4 + one beat involvement +0.4 + closure linkage (thematic, not causal) +0.4 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc appears in setup (opening paragraphs), vibrates during the Meredith call (middle beat), and shifts meaning at closure ("no longer just an object of haunting but a conductor of change"). However, its function is ornamental—Elias never uses it tactically, and removing it would not break causality; the call and conversation proceed identically. The disc's "calling out" to signals is asserted but never tested or constrained. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats (vibration, final reprise) +0.9 + closure linkage (thematic) +0.5 − swappability (could be any talismanic object) −0.6 − ornamental use −0.8 = 4.5, round down 4.5 → but lyric-resonance allowance lifts seed-to-reprise use slightly to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Cultivated estrangement is named repeatedly and frames Elias's seventeen-year isolation, but it operates as theme rather than tactical constraint. The concept does not narrow his choices on the page—he listens to Meredith with immediate openness, contradicting the "carefully maintained fortress" claim. The ending restates estrangement as "a curated space" without demonstrating on-page cost or friction. Present in setup and payoff; no middle development test. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + closure linkage (thematic restatement) +0.5 + theme claim without action pressure −0.4 − swappability −0.5 − missing middle development cap at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Melodically haunted is a recurring label attached to Elias and the disc's hum, but it never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told ("they said," "melodically haunted man") without embodied consequence—his musicianship does not shape his listening technique, word choice, or tactical response to Meredith. Removing the label would not alter plot or closure. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.3 + closure linkage (label repeated) +0.3 − label-only trait −0.3 − swappability −0.5 = 2.8, but present in all three gates lifts slightly to 3.8 under two-of-three minimum.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Loop appears in multiple contexts: the glass disc's looping melodies, "wrong numbers that loop through his switchboard," and "a loop starting to form" with Meredith. The action shapes the story's recursive structure and charges the closure image of "wrong number friendships continued to loop." However, looping does not impose a visible cost or narrow options in a key beat—it functions as motif rather than tactical constraint. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats (disc loop, first call, closure statement) +1.4 + closure linkage (reprise) +0.9 − swappability (could be "cycle" or "pattern") −0.5 − ornamental use (thematic, not causal) −0.6 = 4.8, but lyric-resonance and closure charge lift to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Wrong number friendships is introduced via the supervisor's backstory, enacted in the Meredith call, and reappears at closure as "wrong number friendships continued to loop." The method is signaled, used once with purpose (Meredith's grief call), and its mechanics matter: the call enables the transformation even if the disc's "calling" mechanism is unexplained. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats (first call, closure statement) +0.9 + closure linkage +1.0 + causal pressure (enables key turn) +0.8 − swappability (could be any misdirected contact) −0.4 − one use only (no second wrong number tested) −0.3 = 5.3, but the method's direct shaping of the dominant stake lifts to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel is vividly described (pipes, condensation, abandoned B line) and frames the setting throughout. However, it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—Elias's conversation with Meredith is location-independent. The tunnel functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + closure linkage (sanctuary reframe) +0.5 − postcard description without choice constraint −0.8 − swappability −0.6 = 1.8, but presence across all three gates and vivid anchoring lifts to 4.8 under micro-setting allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Between the hum of streetlamps recurs as a time marker but remains vague—no clock tightens decisions, and the phrase functions as lyric refrain rather than temporal constraint. The Meredith call lasts "hours" without urgency or a deadline affecting tactics. Time does not escalate pressure or alter moves. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.4 + closure linkage (phrase reprised) +0.3 − vague/untracked −0.6 − ornamental use −0.5 − swappability −0.4 = 1.2, but lyric-pattern use across three gates lifts slightly to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>To teach endings how to begin is Elias's stated motivation, introduced early and reprised at closure. However, the desire is abstract and never tested in a conflicted choice—he listens to Meredith with immediate accord, no friction between his want (transformation) and a competing cost (e.g., reopening his own wound, risking another connection). The motivation frames theme but does not drive tactical pressure. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.7 + closure linkage (restated) +0.7 + one beat (Meredith call) +0.4 − told-only, no friction −0.8 − swappability −0.6 = 3.4, but presence in all three gates and thematic coherence lifts to 5.4.</comment>
