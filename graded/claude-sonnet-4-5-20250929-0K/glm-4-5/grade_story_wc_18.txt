<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mirror maker remains an abstract figure throughout, defined by his craft rather than contradictory impulses or genuine interiority. His thirty-year backstory and transformation ability are asserted rather than tested under pressure—no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values or visible cost. The synchronized breathing and "firm grounding" read as label-only attributes; the final whisper to the dream ("I will not capture you") lacks the tension of a foreclosed alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~140 words) without functional disorientation that pays off at closure; apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (fog, twilight, synchronized breathing build toward transformation), but the closure unit—sextant repaired, dream freed—lands as summary rather than a decisive image with legible cost. The mirror maker's internal choice to "recreate freedom" is told, not shown in a moment where renunciation forecloses a path. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ruined orchard and runaway dream exist in parallel without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cap applied at 7.0 per Orientation Test. The ruined orchard, fog, and twilight frost are vivid and recurring, but they remain atmospheric rather than constraining choice—removing them would not break the repair logic. The sextant's brass arm and mirror are described, yet spatial choreography of the workshop and the mirror maker's hands stays generic. Sensory detail leans visual; the workshop perches "on the edge" but does not pressure the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repairing the sextant to capture/free the dream—is signaled early but never tightens options or forces a trade-off. The synchronized breathing and boundary-erasing proceed without obstacle or reversal; the sextant "clicks into place" as if assembly were inevitability rather than agency. The final whisper ("I will not capture you") reframes capture as freedom, but no prior beat establishes capture as a live option with visible cost, so the renunciation feels decorative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "erasing boundaries" theme is stated four times but remains abstract; it does not shape on-page choices or accumulate pressure. The final image—mirrors as "windows that showed not just reflections but possibilities"—summarizes rather than charges prior particulars. The glass mountains metaphor recurs without reweighting; "beautiful fragility" and "boundaries exist only to be transcended" read as thematic echo rather than earned from the mirror maker's struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and aims for lyric register, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("synchronized breathing," "the method passed down through seven generations") that flattens urgency. The mirror maker's interiority—"boundaries are merely reflections we believe to be real"—reads declarative rather than perceptual. Single brief dialogue to the dream feels ceremonial rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Figurative language ("glass mountains," "luminous butterfly of starlight and mathematics") appears frequently without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Template cadence in the middle third: "The mirror maker smiled…" "The mirror maker's eyes closed…" "The mirror maker opened his eyes…" triggers −0.4. Paraphrase loops: "erasing boundaries" recurs four times without added pressure; "firmly grounded" appears twice as scaffold. Stock metaphors ("glass mountains caught in the sun's first rays," "luminous butterfly") accumulate without coherent vehicle logic. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood or concept rather than advance action. The final paragraph summarizes outcomes rather than dramatizing a closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—artisan repairs broken instrument, frees captured dream—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The synchronized breathing method and boundary-erasing concept read as prompt labels rather than discoveries with visible cost. The ruined orchard and twilight frost are evocative but generic; removing them and substituting another liminal space would not alter the arc. No bold risk-taking; the story hedges toward the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mirror maker is present throughout and the repair is his project, but his choices remain abstract (synchronized breathing, intention, "focused will") rather than decisions that alter tactics. The final whisper to the dream reframes the goal but without visible cost or a foreclosed alternative. Introduced early, involved across beats, but agency reads as summary rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sextant is introduced early (~180 words), handled in two beats (examination, repair), and present in the final image as the dream's vessel. Its broken state and transformation matter causally, yet the repair itself—pieces merging "with intention"—lacks mechanical friction or cost. The sextant's new function (mapping pathways between worlds) is told rather than shown constraining a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries is stated four times but remains thematic claim rather than on-page tactic. The mirror maker's process of merging broken pieces "as if they had never been separate" gestures at the concept, yet no choice is constrained or enabled by boundary-erasure as a method. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears twice as label and metaphor ("His workshop perched…his calloused hands firmly grounded"; "firmly grounded in his purpose"). No on-page action is constrained or enabled by groundedness; it reads as symbolic reassurance rather than a trade-off with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Recreate" appears in the astronomer's directive, the mirror maker's thirty-year study, and the final resolution ("I will recreate your freedom in every mirror"). It frames the story's logic, yet the act of recreation itself—polishing, aligning, breathing—proceeds without reversal or visible cost. Present across beats and at closure, but swappable with "restore" or "transform" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Synchronized breathing is introduced early (~370 words) and described across two beats (matching twilight's expansion/contraction, aligning with the dream's rhythm). It shapes the repair process, yet the mechanics remain abstract; removing it would not break the plot if replaced with "focused will." Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The ruined orchard appears in the opening, mid-story vision, and final image. Its fog and withered trees set atmosphere and the dream's location, yet the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the mirror maker works in his workshop, not the orchard. Present across beats and at closure, but postcard-descriptive rather than pressure-inducing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Upon the shimmer of twilight frost" appears in the opening and final paragraph. Evening creeps, twilight deepens, but no clock tightens the mirror maker's decisions or forecloses a path. Time reads as mood rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Capturing the runaway dream is the stated goal, introduced via the astronomer's directive and pursued through the repair. The final reframe—"I will not capture you"—shifts motive to liberation, yet the friction between capture and freedom is asserted rather than dramatized in a choice with visible cost. Present across beats and at closure, but the conflict remains told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Glass mountains" appears twice (quartz fragments "like glass mountains caught in the sun's first rays"; final paragraph "glass mountains of his craft"). The phrase gestures at fragile grandeur but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—it reads as decorative metaphor rather than tonal anchor.</comment>
