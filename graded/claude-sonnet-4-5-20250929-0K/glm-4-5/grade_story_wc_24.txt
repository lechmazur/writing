<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation to understand clocks is told rather than earned through on-page contradiction or struggle. His interior contains stock phrasing ("years of listening to clocks without truly hearing them") and the final transformation—from isolation to wisdom—occurs off-page across unshown years. The peak moment (reversing water, counting backwards) reads more as mechanical curiosity than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is sparse; his "heart quicken[ed]" is the only physical marker during the key reversal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early and attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration via conceptual repricing: Arlo's realization that "clocks measure what we give them" reweights his lifelong question. However, the closure lacks on-page cost—he simply "vow[s] never to use [the key] conventionally again" without dramatized consequence or foreclosed option. The escalation (water reversal, counting backwards 1–5) proceeds without opposition or tightening; the fjord remains static. The final paragraph summarizes years of wisdom rather than landing a decisive image, softening the closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station and hydraulic clock mechanics are vivid and specific, grounding the early beats with clear spatial anchors (workshop, window, clock chambers). Sensory detail is selective—razor edges refracting light, fjord quiet deepening—and filtered through Arlo's professional lens. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it remains backdrop. The timepiece's reversed water is the story's most active setting element but functions more as spectacle than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The water-reversal moment introduces no opposition, cost, or tactical constraint; Arlo simply "noticed" and "felt" shifts without forfeiting or risking anything on the page. Counting backwards 1–5 reads as observation rather than escalation. The resolution summarizes decades of teaching rather than showing a single choice that narrows options or pays a price. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal conflict materially tightens the question.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme—time as cycle vs. commodity, presence vs. measurement—emerges through hydraulic imagery and the reversed-flow conceit. The closing insight ("clocks measure what we give them") restates the premise rather than reweighting it through a non-literal image or earned cost. The "eminently peculiar" tag appears three times but does not accumulate pressure; it labels rather than constrains. The final paragraph ("give them silence, and they will teach you the language of stillness") tips into overt moralizing. Motifs (razor edges, fjord quiet, mantle key) recur but do not charge the ending with new meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Arlo with consistent psychic distance. The perceptual signature (fjord quiet, razor edges, hydraulic precision) is character-specific and maintained under light pressure. Dialogue is minimal—two brief lines that advance theme without subtext. However, the prose drifts toward essay register in reflective beats ("eminently peculiar fact remained," "treating it as a commodity to be managed") and the final teaching ("give them silence") reads as authorial summary rather than Arlo's voice under stress. No head-hopping or POV leakage, but the narrative modulates little across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the opening anchors voice cleanly. However, paraphrase loops appear: "what clocks really measure" recurs three times without added pressure; "eminently peculiar" is planted mechanically across paragraphs. Template cadence in the counting sequence ("One. The horizon…Two. The shepherd…Three. Through counting") reads decorative rather than propulsive. "The hydra" fragment at story's end is an unresolved typo or artifact. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("neither beginning nor end, much like the tides") during peak beats. Information density is moderate; many lines do single jobs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The hydraulic-clock shepherd and reversed water-flow premise offer initial freshness, and the horizon measurement station is a vivid, specific choice. However, the emotional arc—solitary craftsman discovers wisdom through mystical object—follows a familiar template. The mantle key's hidden aperture and backward water are conceptually clever but resolve into platitude ("clocks measure what we give them") without a non-obvious moral calculus or earned irony. The final decades-summary and teaching role are stock resolutions. Risk-taking is limited to the conceit; character and conflict play out predictably.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arlo is present throughout and his occupation (hydraulic clock shepherd) frames the setting and tools. He makes two micro-choices: inserting the key and vowing never to use it conventionally. However, neither choice creates a turn or cost on the page; the first triggers observation, the second is summarized intent. His arc occurs off-page across unshown years. Present in setup, middle, and ending summary, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mantle clock key appears in three beats: removal from velvet case (tactile), insertion into aperture (causal trigger), and final placement on chain (vow). It enables the water reversal and is reweighted at closure as a symbol of non-conventional use. However, the key does not constrain a choice or incur visible cost; Arlo's vow is told, not tested. Early signal, middle use, closure reprise, but swappable with any mystical tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Razor edges" appears four times: brass fittings (hazard), refracting light (observation), microscopic patterns (detail), vibrations (summary). It functions as recurring texture but does not shape stakes, narrow options, or charge the final image causally. Mentioned across beats but remains ornamental; the story's logic would hold if replaced with "intricate gears" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" is applied three times as a label: the station's purpose, the fact of human time-capture, and Arlo's wisdom. It describes rather than constrains; no choice depends on peculiarity, and it incurs no cost. Present in setup, middle summary, and ending summary, but purely thematic decoration without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Arlo squints twice: at the clock's hydraulics early and later at microscopic patterns in brass. The action signals close attention and enables him to "notice" the patterns, but it does not create a turn or redefine options. Swappable with "peered," "examined," or "studied." Present in two beats with slight differentiation, but not indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Through counting backwards" is signaled in Arlo's interior musing, enacted in the numbered beat sequence (One through Five), and revisited in the resolution summary ("through counting backwards, he had discovered…"). The method structures the middle beats and ties to the theme of reversed time. However, the counting itself does not constrain tactics or incur cost; it is observational framing. Present in setup, middle enactment, and closure echo, but mechanically integrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station is named early, described (workshop, window, thirty-seven years), and provides spatial anchor for the water-reversal scene. It houses the tools and establishes Arlo's expertise. However, it does not pressure choices or supply a resource that alters outcome; the station could be any clockmaker's shop. Present in setup and middle, mentioned in closure summary, but functionally generic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle" anchors the inciting moment (midday signal), recurs when others ask "what had changed after he blew the whistle that day," and bookends the ending ("after blowing the whistle at sunset"). The timeframe establishes a before/after but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the reversal and reflection proceed without time pressure. Present in setup, middle callback, and closure, but the clock is not live.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Arlo's motivation "to understand what clocks really measure" is stated early, echoed in his whispered question to the mechanism, and answered in the resolution. It drives the key insertion and frames the thematic arc. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The desire shapes setup and closure but is not tested by friction or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" appears in the opening (grown too loud), deepens during the counting sequence, and becomes "a companion rather than an absence of sound" at closure, modulating with Arlo's internal shift. The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the reflective register. However, it does not charge the final image with new pressure; the shift is thematic rather than causal. Present across all beats with evolution, but the tonal work is gentle rather than essential.</comment>
