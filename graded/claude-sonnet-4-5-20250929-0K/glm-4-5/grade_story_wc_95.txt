<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The mechanical arm is described but functions primarily as an ornamental marker of identity rather than forcing choices under pressure. Aris's interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("dignified chaos," "turn questions into destinations") repeated without internal contradiction or embodied cost. The student interaction offers a moment of potential complexity but dissolves into exposition; no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The protagonist's competence is asserted through labels ("dueling philosopher," "intellectual rigor") without dramatized struggle or earned mistake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation adequately (glass atrium, sundial, waiting for symposium) within the first third. Drive lens reads as Causal initially (decoding the sundial coordinates) but dissolves into an explanatory encounter with the student that summarizes philosophy rather than escalating pressure. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the student's "perfect comprehension" and Aris's final motto, but the cost is absent—no path is foreclosed, no option narrowed. The coordinates revelation mid-story functions as a micro turn but does not tighten stakes or alter tactics in the final third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are vividly described with sensory specificity (prismatic light, water murmur, gold numerals). However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the sundial constrains the decoding action but does not shape the encounter with the student or charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The recurring phrase "dignified chaos" labels the atmosphere without allowing environmental pressure to alter a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the hidden overture—is signaled early but resolves at midpoint with minimal cost (Aris simply records coordinates). The secondary engagement (teaching the student) introduces no meaningful opposition or trade-off; the student poses questions, Aris answers, comprehension follows. No reversal or tightening narrows options in the final third. Agency is present in the decoding and teaching choices, but neither forecloses a path or imposes visible cost. The symposium remains off-page, eliminating potential pressure from the waiting frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of "questions into destinations" is stated repeatedly ("his life's motto," final paragraph restatement) rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The mechanical arm as symbol is told ("it symbolizes how questions can be reconstructed") instead of dramatized through constraint or cost. The Danish tin needle card returns at closure but without reweighted meaning—it simply rests in his pocket. Subtext in the student interaction is minimal; her comprehension is declared ("eyes showed perfect comprehension") rather than implied through gesture or silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited to Aris throughout. Distance control is consistent but lacks perceptual signature; diction often slips into elevated abstraction ("dimensional fencing," "philosophical positions as both attack and defense") that reads generic rather than character-particular. The student's brief dialogue is functional but lacks distinct idiom. Free indirect style is clean. Filter verbs are minimal. The prose reads competent but without rhythmic control under pressure or distinct syntactic texture that reflects Aris's mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across adjacent beats: "dignified chaos" appears three times with near-identical framing; "turn questions into destinations" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The" + noun subject across the opening and mid-section ("The brook's gentle counterpoint," "The needles in their tin arrangement," "The dignified chaos continued"). Stock metaphors ("prismatic chaos," "intellectual battlegrounds") appear in most early sentences without payoff. Figurative density in the opening paragraph (fractured sun, prismatic chaos, water's endless question, coded angles) muddles rather than propels. Information density is low; several beats restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (philosopher-duelist decodes sundial coordinates while teaching) reads as a stitched response to prompt elements rather than an organic synthesis. The mechanical arm, Danish tin card, and half-painted sundial feel ornamental—each could be replaced with minor edits without structural impact. The "hidden overture" as coordinates is literal rather than offering conceptual transformation. Emotional calculus is absent; Aris encounters no genuine friction or trade-off. The student interaction echoes familiar mentor-epiphany templates without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aris is present throughout but his mechanical arm does not create a key turn. He decodes the sundial and teaches the student; both are choices, but neither is constrained by the arm or by his dueling-philosopher identity in a way that alters tactics. The arm "clicks with satisfaction" when recording coordinates—a decorative moment. Mid-band at best due to swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The Danish tin sewing needle card appears in three beats: pocket mention (opening), alignment with sundial (decoding), and return to pocket (closure). However, its function is static—it holds a pattern that matches the sundial. The needles' arrangement is described but not handled or used differently across beats; no reweighted meaning emerges at closure. Present in setup and ending but lacks causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The "hidden overture" is mentioned twice (opening and mid-section) and revealed as coordinates rather than shaped into a stake that alters tactics. It does not constrain later choices or charge the closure image. The concept is told ("the hidden overture revealed itself") rather than dramatized through a decision with cost. Ornamental use; easily swappable with "hidden message" or "coded invitation."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is asserted once ("being diplomatically fierce was the only way to navigate intellectual battlegrounds") but never demonstrated through an on-page action with visible cost or trade-off. The student encounter shows warmth and patience, not fierceness. Label-only mention without constraint or enabling choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Fencing appears in two beats: Aris explains "dimensional fencing" and offers to demonstrate "mentally" using philosophical positions. The action is summarized ("twenty minutes of sparring") rather than dramatized, and no turn or escalation traces to it. The mechanical arm "capable of holding a rapier" remains at his side. Present but non-causal; the story would function identically if the method were "debate" or "Socratic dialogue."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial and its coded angles appear in setup (Aris approaches it, traces gold numerals) and middle (alignment with needle card reveals coordinates). The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter for one beat. However, it does not shape the student encounter or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Functional in one key turn but absent from the ending, capping score below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The glass atrium beside the quiet brook is anchored early and maintained throughout. The setting provides sensory texture (prismatic light, water murmur, café tables) but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The sundial is within the atrium and is used once. The brook's "counterpoint" is described as sharpening perception but this effect is told, not shown through a micro-choice. Present across beats but postcard-level integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"While waiting" frames the opening and closing ("While waiting is never wasted time") and the symposium announcement provides a nominal endpoint. However, no clock tightens Aris's decisions; he decodes at leisure and teaches for "twenty minutes" without urgency. Time is present but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Functional mention, replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"To turn questions into destinations" is stated as Aris's "life's motto" and repeated in the final paragraph. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Aris decodes coordinates (turning a question into a destination literally) but faces no friction or cost in doing so. The student interaction shows teaching, not a struggle between wants and obstacles. Label-only motivation without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" is named three times (opening, middle, closing) and described through sensory contrasts (fractured light, murmuring brook, rising conversations). Tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure; the sundial decoding and student teaching occur within the same atmospheric register. Present as a label across beats but does not charge the final image or shift with escalation. Functional but one-note.</comment>
