<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is labeled "logically emotional" but never demonstrates contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—he moves through the sequence with textbook competence and no genuine struggle. His engineering knowledge and family duty align perfectly; there's no choice where competence fails or values conflict. The intruders are introduced as threat but vanish via convenient off-page resolution (screaming, then gone), removing any test of his renunciation or endurance. Motivation remains declarative rather than embodied through micro-choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal with attempts at mystical-technical fusion. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (engineer, marina, lighthouse). The closure unit—artifact protected, intruders expelled—occurs on the page, but cost is absent: Elias completes the ritual, the bad guys scream and drift away, and he ascends "forever changed" without specifying what path was foreclosed or what price he paid. The tuning fork/vibrational frequency mechanism arrives late and resolves a problem it didn't help create. Because/therefore linkage is present in the approach sequence but the climax delivers a convenient sonic weapon with no dramatized tradeoff or failure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina, azure coat, and lighthouse foundation are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (crunch of frozen seaweed, blood-red horizon, dust motes). The tuning fork and crypt keeper's key function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual choice. Spatial choreography across marina, tower, and foundation chamber remains clear. The setting does not materially alter tactics—Elias has uncontested access and the intruders pose no spatial obstacle—so it stops short of the high band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the artifact) is signaled early. However, escalation is weak: Elias races to the lighthouse, descends, performs the ritual, and wins without adaptation, setback, or visible tradeoff. The intruders are introduced as urgent threat but never appear on-screen; their defeat is summarized in a single sentence. No on-page reversal tests his commitment, and no price is paid—he retains duty, key, and artifact with no path foreclosed. The ritual success feels like outline convenience rather than earned causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of heritage/duty and mystical-technical synthesis emerges from the orb, key, and ritual particulars rather than assertion. The "fleshly ethereal" motif and "logically emotional" label recur but remain decorative—they don't constrain choice or charge the closure image with non-literal resonance. The final paragraph's "forever changed" and touching key to forehead gesture at epiphany without showing what was reweighted or renounced. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the ending resolves into affirmation without cost or complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is engineer-specific (sonar equipment, vibrational frequencies, tuning fork calibration). Diction is consistent and legible, though elevated phrasing like "fleshly ethereal" and "numinous yet deeply physical" reads as imposed descriptor rather than Elias's interior idiom under stress. No dialogue. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose occasionally slips into explanatory mode ("a trait that served him well") that flattens immediacy. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Syntax varies purposefully and rhythm accelerates during the approach sequence. Clarity is high; no pronoun drift or tense errors. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "logically emotional" appears twice in similar framing, "crypt keeper's key" is repeated in near-identical descriptive clauses across paragraphs, and "azure coat" recurs four times as a visual tag without functional variation. Template cadence in the ritual climax (orb pulsed, tuning fork resonated, key glowed, tone echoed) stacks actions without advancing tension. These artifacts don't obscure causality but dull line-level propulsion. Information density is moderate; several sentences serve only as scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper-as-mystic-engineer setup and sonic-frequency ritual offer mild freshness, but the core arc—lone guardian races to perform protective rite before intruders arrive—follows a familiar template without transformation. The intruders are stock antagonists with no characterization or tactical challenge; the ritual succeeds on first attempt without cost, risk, or adaptation. Emotional truth is absent; Elias's "forever changed" claim is asserted rather than earned through specific, grounded struggle. The "fleshly ethereal" and "logically emotional" labels gesture at complexity but remain ornamental. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the piece chooses median safety at every turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias (azure-coat lighthouse engineer) is present across the full arc and his decision to perform the ritual drives the climax. However, his choices are not tested—he encounters no obstacle, makes no tradeoff, and adapts to nothing. The engineer trait enables the ritual but never constrains or costs him. Present and functional, but swappable with "lone guardian" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key appears in beats across setup (inheritance, vibrates with purpose), middle (warms in pocket), and climax (glows during ritual). It signals family legacy and responds to the artifact, creating a charged reprise. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it simply works when needed. Hits all three gates with modest causal pressure, reaching mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is named and the ritual is performed on-page via tuning fork and vibrational matching. It shapes the climax beat but arrives late (final third) and resolves a problem it did not help create—no earlier beat establishes vibrational danger or tests the method. The concept is functional but replaceable with any mystical protection rite. Late setup and weak causal spread cap it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is mentioned twice as a label but never constrains or enables a visible on-page action. Elias's decisions are purely rational (use tuning fork, perform ritual); no moment shows emotional impulse conflicting with logic or vice versa. The trait is ornamental exposition with no beat involvement or cost. Swappable with "determined" or "dutiful."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Adapt" is declared in narration ("He must adapt quickly") but not dramatized—Elias executes his plan without setback, revision, or forced improvisation. The intruders never confront him; the ritual proceeds as designed. The action is label-only, replaceable with "act" or "protect" without altering the sequence. No causal pressure or closure shaping.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is signaled in setup (sonar sensitivity, decades maintaining fog warning system), used in the climax (tuning fork, frequency matching), and mentioned in the denouement. It appears in two distinct beats and provides tactical specificity to the ritual. However, it does not constrain—Elias succeeds on first attempt with no friction. Functional and somewhat specific, but not indispensable; "mystical attunement" could swap in.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina anchors the opening and provides vivid atmospheric detail (crunch of seaweed, cracking ice, rotting dock). It frames the urgency (intruders' boat tied to dock) but does not pressure Elias's choices—he crosses it unopposed and the intruders never use it tactically. Present in setup and closure framing, but the setting could be any isolated lighthouse approach. Functional but replaceable; no micro-setting constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Fleeting golden sunset" is mentioned in the opening and middle ("last rays of sun disappeared") to mark time's passage, but it imposes no urgency or deadline on Elias's actions. He completes the ritual at his own pace; darkness is atmospheric rather than tactical. The timeframe is present but does not tighten decisions or shape the ending. Swappable with "dusk" or "nightfall."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Protecting the sacred artifact is established early (emergency broadcast, artifact's storm-protection role) and drives the full arc from marina to ritual. The motivation is clear and sustained across beats. However, it is never conflicted—Elias has no competing desire, no cost to accepting the duty, and no friction between personal want and obligation. The artifact itself is dramatized in the climax (orb pulses, responds to ritual). Functional and sustained, but lacks the friction or visible tradeoff needed for high scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" is introduced as a descriptor for the lock mechanism, mentioned during the ritual ("numinous yet deeply physical"), and echoed in the final line. The tone gesture is present across setup and closure, creating a lyric reprise. However, it remains label-only—diction does not modulate with pressure, and the effect is asserted rather than embodied in syntax or image. The tone is static and ornamental rather than a charged tonal shift that reweights the ending.</comment>
