<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Martin's guilt and professional compromise are established early, and his internal conflict between deception and truth drives the arc. However, key interiority relies on abstract formulations ("weight of unspoken words," "hollow inside") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic realization—that his grandfather's love was unconditional—arrives through discovered object rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The final decision to close his business feels declared rather than enacted with visible cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Martin placing watch hand and carving together, then resolving to close his business—qualifies as Decisive Change, but the cost is primarily told in future tense ("Tomorrow, he would close") rather than felt in the present moment. The causality is clean but the final beat summarizes transformation instead of dramatizing the foreclosed path, weakening the on-page cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are vividly anchored with sensory detail (moonlight on carvings, cool metal, weathered stone steps). The watch hand and driftwood carvings function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and beach sequence. The setting constrains Martin's nightly ritual and the shore supplies the discovery that triggers closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Martin's need to reconcile his erasure of family history—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when he discovers his grandfather's carving with his own initials, narrowing options from abstract guilt to concrete reconciliation. However, the escalation relies on object discovery rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The resolution is emotionally clear but the cost (closing his business) is declared for tomorrow rather than paid on the page, softening the immediacy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of self-deception and the value of acknowledging truth—emerges organically from Martin's profession and discovered carving. The watch hand/carving pairing effectively reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The final line ("sometimes the most valuable inheritance is not what we acquire, but what we finally choose to acknowledge") edges toward thematic summary but remains grounded in the particulars of Martin's journey. Subtext operates cleanly in the grandfather's silent message through craft.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—Martin filters the world through his guilt and genealogist's eye ("practiced eye could distinguish his own work," "deliberate sanding patterns"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider reflection. Some diction ("tempered regret," "sieved hush") feels slightly elevated for the moment but remains within an educated narrator's register. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and clear action sequence. However, several passages loop conceptually: "weight of unspoken words" appears twice in similar phrasing, and "manufactured memories/fabricated family trees/fictional legacies" cycles through near-synonyms without adding pressure. The phrase "sieved hush" appears three times with decorative rather than functional variation. Template stems ("he had," "Martin [verb]") recur but don't quite reach the three-line penalty threshold. Information density is solid in the discovery beat but softer in the reflective middle section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The black-market genealogist premise offers a fresh professional angle, and the watch hand/carving doubling creates a specific rather than generic symbol. However, the emotional arc—guilt over erasure leading to tearful reconciliation—follows a familiar template of manufactured-versus-real memory. The beach ritual and driftwood carvings add texture but the core turn (discovering grandfather's acceptance through object) doesn't fully escape well-worn redemption patterns. Specificity in the genealogy trade elevates but doesn't transform the underlying structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Martin appears in every beat and his profession (black market genealogist) shapes both the conflict and his nightly ritual. His guilt drives the search and his choice to close the business provides closure. However, the final decision is declared rather than enacted on the page, and his role tilts more toward discovery than active decision-making under pressure in the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in paragraph one (Martin tracing its contours), paragraph four (feeling the cool metal), paragraph nine (belonged to grandfather), paragraph twenty-two (burns against his skin), and paragraph twenty-four (placed with carving). It returns with reweighted meaning when paired with the carved replica, directly shaping the closure image. Strong causal participation and specificity; irreplaceable to the reconciliation logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" appears three times as atmospheric descriptor (paragraph six, seventeen, twenty-seven) but never constrains choice or alters tactics. It functions as tonal motif rather than shaping stakes. The concept remains ornamental—beautiful phrasing that could be removed without breaking story logic. Late reprise in final paragraph does not reweight prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Martin's profession—manufacturing false memories for clients—is introduced in paragraph three and returns in paragraphs seven, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty-six. The attribute enables his expertise (recognizing his own work versus others' carvings) and provides the moral weight that drives his guilt and final choice to close the business. The trait constrains his peace of mind and shapes the thematic stakes throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quell" appears explicitly in paragraph two ("tried to quell the rising bile") and implicitly in paragraph twenty-three ("what he had been quelling all these years"). The action captures Martin's suppression but doesn't drive major turns—the discovery of the carving, not an act of quelling, triggers the climax. Swappable with "suppress" or "repress" without structural impact. Present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is signaled early (paragraph five: "descend to the forgotten shore, sifting through driftwood carvings") and dramatized in paragraphs thirteen through twenty, where Martin examines carvings, distinguishes his own work, and discovers the grandfather's piece. The method supplies the mechanism for discovery and shapes multiple beats. Removal would require fundamental rewrite of the search and revelation sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace appears in paragraphs one, eight, twelve, and twenty-five as the starting point for Martin's descent and a lyric anchor. It frames the journey but doesn't constrain choices—Martin could begin anywhere elevated. The shore does more causal work (supplies the carvings). The terrace functions as atmospheric bookend rather than pressure point, though the early-and-late reprise ("cobalt terrace faded into darkness") reweights the opening mood.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" appears in paragraph two and twenty-four. The timeframe is more thematic than mechanical—it describes Martin's decades-long burden rather than tightening a present decision window. Dusk and "tomorrow" bracket the action but don't create a live clock. The phrase charges the theme but doesn't alter tactics or escalate pressure through time scarcity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover the weight of a withheld truth"—is stated in paragraph eleven and drives Martin's nightly ritual, his examination of carvings, and his realization about his grandfather's acceptance. The desire is dramatized through repeated shore visits and the moment of recognition. Friction exists between his guilt (cost of truth) and his need for reconciliation. The motivation shapes the arc and closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Tempered regret" appears explicitly in paragraphs twenty and twenty-five, and the tone permeates Martin's reflections throughout—measured sorrow without melodrama. The tone modulates appropriately: heavier in the guilt-laden middle, lighter ("a lightness within that tempered regret could not diminish") at closure. The final image of balanced "falsehood and truth" embodies the tone. Coherent, purposeful, and integral to the emotional register.</comment>
