<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established early (preserve the violin against the Empire) and her telepathic trait creates embodied pressure through the desert rose's psychic pricks. The choice to propagate rather than hide is earned by her documented harmonic frequency discovery. However, the final act—playing the violin to shed crystalline dust—feels more like executing a plan than wrestling with contradictory impulses; the internal conflict between preservation and destruction needed one visible micro-hesitation to charge the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph and operates under a Causal lens: coffee-reading → decision to propagate → harmonic playing → ice-violin budding in the plant. The closure lands on the page with visible cost (the original violin becomes a "silent shell" with "deep scars") and the empire gets a hollow trophy while the essence survives in the plant. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coffee stains show destruction unless she acts now, narrowing her options to the propagation tactic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer supplies a tactile, sensory anchor: mulberry drapes absorbing arctic light, heat-exhausted magnolias, moss on ancient stones. The ice violin's microscopic fractures and the desert rose's pot near the workbench constrain Elara's choices—she uses the audio array, the greenhouse plants' proximity, and the violin's resonant frequency. The setting participates directly in the closure: the plants lean in, the crystalline dust settles on thorns, and the new violin buds at the root.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the violin's essence before the Empire claims it tomorrow—is signaled early and tightens when the coffee-reading shows destruction. Elara's agency drives the turn: she chooses to propagate rather than hide, using documented harmonic science. The cost is legible in the final image: the original violin lies "inert" with "deep scars," its destiny "fulfilled by perforation." However, the escalation feels more procedural than pressured; one micro-obstacle (a hesitation, a false note, a plant's resistance) would have deepened the tension in the harmonic-playing beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of perforated destiny emerges through concrete particulars: the violin's microscopic fractures become conduits, not weaknesses, and Elara's choice to propagate rather than hoard transforms destruction into legacy. The final image—a tiny ice violin budding from the desert rose—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (how to preserve a dream against empire) without stating a moral. "A quiet victory etched not in stone, but in cold, living crystal" charges the closure without sermonizing. The mulberry ache carries through as embodied cost rather than abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The POV remains stable third-limited, and Elara's perceptual signature—provenance researcher's eye for whispered histories, telepathic reception of plant anxiety—is distinct. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with urgent moments: "水下摄影 she'd perfected" (untranslated mid-sentence), "propagate" as a psychic concept from the rose, and "cellular growth" in her thought during the climax drift into clinical register. The final paragraph's "perforation" metaphor and "thrum of new life captured in ice" feel over-wrought for a researcher under deadline pressure, blunting immediacy at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "fruit left too long on the branch," "perforated destiny," "fragile seedling," "dream propagated," "velvet dark," "cold vacancy." In the climax, stacked metaphors—"frozen constellations," "cold harmonics," "dream propagated," "echo blooming"—compete for attention without adding distinct information. The penultimate sentence runs a template cadence: "The empire would claim X, a Y. But the true Z, the dream…" Paraphrase loops appear: "silent, cold harmonics" echoes "pure, so cold" from two paragraphs prior. Applying −0.6 for figurative density in peak beats, −0.4 for template cadence, and −0.2 for paraphrase loop totals −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ice-crystal violin + plant telepathy + harmonic propagation is non-obvious and specific to this premise. The reversal—using the violin's fragility (perforation) as a conduit rather than a flaw—feels earned in hindsight. However, the "save the artifact from the evil empire" frame is template-familiar, and the resolution (duplicate the thing, give them a shell) echoes common heist or resistance plots. The tactile science (harmonic frequency encouraging cellular growth) and the budding ice violin add freshness, but the moral calculus (preserve vs. hoard) lacks a difficult trade-off that would elevate the premise beyond a clever trick.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's research role is signaled early ("provenance researcher," documented harmonic frequency) and her choice to propagate rather than hide drives the major turn. She appears in setup, middle (coffee-reading decision), and ending (playing the violin, observing the budding crystal), satisfying all three gates. However, her decisions feel more like executing a discovered solution than wrestling with competing goods; one visible micro-hesitation or cost (risking the violin's destruction, doubting the science) would tighten causal pressure and push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The transparent ice-crystal violin is present in setup (opening paragraph description), middle (coffee-reading shows it shattering, Elara plays it to propagate), and ending (lies inert with deep scars; a new one buds from the plant). Its unique properties—microscopic fractures, harmonic frequency, ice structure—enable the propagation tactic and constrain her choice (she cannot simply hide it). The violin's transformation into a "silent shell" and its rebirth as a budding crystal charge the closure image. The element is indispensable: removing it would collapse the plot, stakes, and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is seeded early ("a silence suggesting a perforated destiny, its lineage riddled with inexplicable gaps") and returns at closure ("its core destiny finally fulfilled by perforation"). The concept shapes Elara's stake—she needs to fill the holes in the violin's provenance—and the metaphor charges the ending when perforation becomes the mechanism of propagation. However, the middle beats treat it primarily as thematic texture rather than a constraint that alters tactics; one micro-choice where she confronts an actual gap in the violin's history that changes her approach would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's plant telepathy is present in setup ("accidentally telepathic with plants since childhood," magnolias drooping, desert rose pulsing anxiety), middle (the desert rose shrieks "propagate," plants lean in during the playing), and ending (guided by "plants' shared consciousness," the desert rose grows the new violin). The trait enables the propagation tactic—she directs the crystalline dust via plant focus—and the cost is embodied (psychic pricks against her temples). The specificity (telepathy with plants, not general ESP) matters; without it, she couldn't execute the harmonic transfer or receive the "propagate" command.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The action "propagate" is signaled via the desert rose's psychic command in the middle and executed in the climax when Elara plays the violin to shed crystalline dust that the plants absorb. The ending hinges on propagation: a new ice violin buds from the desert rose, and "the dream Elara had fought to weigh against their empire now lived within the plant." The action is irreplaceable—hiding, destroying, or simply refusing the Empire would not generate the budding-crystal closure. The cost (original violin becomes inert) and the causal chain (harmonic frequency → cellular growth → budding violin) are tight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Coffee-reading is present in setup (mentioned as "a chaotic 水下摄影 she'd perfected during fieldwork") and used in one middle beat to reveal the future (violin shattering, verdant shoot emerging). The method shapes her decision to act now rather than wait, satisfying Development. However, it does not reappear at closure and could be swapped for any divinatory method (tarot, scrying) with minor edits; the harmonic science, not the coffee stains, drives the final tactic. The method's mechanics (pouring, swirling, interpreting dregs) are shown but not constrained by cost or failure risk.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer is anchored in the opening sentence and supplies concrete resources: mulberry drapes that absorb arctic light, greenhouse plants (magnolias, desert rose, moss), the audio array, and the spatial proximity that enables Elara to direct crystalline dust to the plants. Midsummer's relentless light and encroaching dark create urgency ("before midsummer waned"). The setting participates in closure: plants lean in, frost settles on thorns, and the new violin buds "in the velvet dark." The observatory's velvet and arctic-light contradiction charges the "mulberry ache" tone throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Before the promise loses its glow" is seeded early ("before the promise of its undiscovered past lost its glow beneath the encroaching dark") and the Empire's agents arriving "tomorrow" create a live clock. The timeframe tightens Elara's decision to act immediately after the coffee-reading rather than wait. However, the midsummer window and "before the promise fades" remain slightly abstract; the final paragraph's "as the last arctic light bled into twilight" anchors elapsed time but doesn't show tactics altered by the clock's pressure (e.g., rushing, skipping a step, accepting a half-measure).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to preserve this singular dream against the crushing weight of the Expansionist Empire"—is present in setup and dramatized in her choice to propagate rather than surrender or hide. The friction between preserving knowledge and defying imperial dominion is embodied in the coffee-reading (destruction vs. propagation) and paid off at closure (Empire gets a shell, the dream lives in the plant). However, the "weigh a dream against an empire" phrasing is slightly abstract; one micro-beat where she considers the personal cost of defiance (exile, punishment, loss of standing) would sharpen the conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" is seeded in the opening ("The heavy, mulberry-hued drapes absorbed the relentless arctic light, deepening the ache that settled in her bones") and returns at closure ("The mulberry ache remained, a familiar weight, but mingled now with the thrum of new life"). The tone—melancholy, embodied heaviness, sensory richness—modulates with pressure: anxiety during the coffee-reading, cold purity during the violin-playing, and layered relief-with-cost in the final image. The tone charges the ending by refusing tidy resolution; the ache persists even in victory, cohering with "quiet victory" and "fragile, resonant echo."</comment>
