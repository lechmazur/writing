<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation exists only as abstract declaration ("preserve wonder in routine") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Internal experience remains static across the entire moon cycle; the identity migration is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The piece offers label-only interiority ("watched the waxing and waning of identity's tide within themselves") without concrete embodiment or genuine struggle. No meaningful choice forecloses a path with visible cost—the librarian performs a ritual without resistance or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words (who/where anchored, but "after tomorrow disappears" remains unexplained and non-functional). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but delivers no decisive tightening or cost: the cycle completes as it always does, the librarian emerges "entirely new" without dramatized friction, and the final paragraph summarizes theme rather than landing a closure image with felt price. The smelting ritual and tidal immersion occur without complication, opposition, or stakes-testing. No before/after is legible—the librarian's stance and situation are unchanged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vividly rendered (crystalline ceiling, water rippling, transparent dome) and establishes contradiction (library floor that submerges texts). The titan-gear and water cycle provide sensory specificity, and the forge's "cold fire" offers a purposeful detail. However, the environment never constrains a choice or shapes the closure image—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The bamboo creel is handled across beats but does not alter tactics or charge the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("preserve wonder in routine") is declared but never tested on the page. The monthly ritual proceeds without complication, reversal, or tightening—water rises, identity migrates, librarian emerges unchanged in practice. No choice narrows options or incurs visible cost; the cycle is static repetition rather than escalation. The piece gestures at internal conflict ("no longer fighting the changes") but dramatizes no struggle, trade-off, or consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (identity flux, preservation through acceptance) emerges from imagery (tides, moon phases, story-silver) rather than statement, and the forge/creel motifs recur with purpose. However, the final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("contradiction...resolved nothing yet explained everything") instead of a resonant image. The librarian's whispered epiphany ("Each story preserved...adds another layer") tells rather than shows. The piece avoids a non-literal answer, opting for explicit philosophizing that undercuts earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct lyric-formal register ("titan-gear," "wintersun serenity," "story-silver"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, creating textural specificity. However, the voice flattens under what should be peak pressure (identity migration)—syntax and rhythm remain uniform rather than modulating with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue feels ornamental rather than goal-driven. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping, but the perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and purposeful word choice ("titan-gear," "story-silver," "liquid story-silver"). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops in the final third: "identities migrating like tides, preserved through acceptance" echoes "accepting contradictions" and "synthesis of all previous selves" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the opening ("Each heavy step caused..."; "The librarian's massive mechanical armor...") and the closing summary paragraph stacks abstract claims without propulsion. These artifacts dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal library with migrating-identity keeper offers a fresh synthesis, and details like "cold fire that only consumed paper and ink" and the story-smelting forge provide specificity. The bamboo creel links fishermen's history to narrative recasting in a non-obvious way. However, the core emotional arc (acceptance of flux) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction. The lyric-formal voice and moon-phase structure feel carefully designed but do not take structural risks that heighten stakes. The piece commits fully to its premise but retreats into abstract philosophizing at closure rather than embodying cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian is present throughout and performs the smelting ritual, but makes no choice that alters tactics or creates a turn. The character observes and enacts a predetermined cycle without decision-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bamboo creel appears in three beats (carried at opening, filled with story-plates mid-ritual, held at closure) and links fishermen's histories to narrative recasting. However, it does not constrain a choice or visibly reweight meaning at the ending—it remains a functional container without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Migrating identities frame the premise and recur throughout (archivist/story-weaver/synthesis), but the migration is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or tactical shifts. The concept decorates theme without shaping on-page stakes or choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Moon phases are mentioned repeatedly and tied to identity labels (full/new/half), but the attribute does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost. The half-moon triggers the ritual but does not create friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Smelting is the ritual's centerpiece, occupies three beats (approach, ladling story-silver, placing plates), and produces the solidified essence that fills the creel. It enables the cycle's completion but does not redefine options or create a turn—the outcome is predetermined. Removing it would require moderate edits but not structural redesign.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Accepting contradictions is declared as the method ("key to maintaining the Great Collection") and the atrium itself embodies it (water submerging texts that reappear). However, the method is not signaled early or tested through attempts—it appears as thematic assertion rather than dramatized mechanics that shape choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vividly established, its water cycle structures the ritual's timing, and its contradictions (library floor that floods) anchor the theme. The setting's rising tide triggers identity migration, giving it causal presence. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost or charge the final image beyond atmospheric resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" is mentioned twice but remains unexplained and non-functional. It does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or alter tactics—time in the piece is cyclical and unthreatening. The phrase decorates the premise without narrative pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Preserving wonder in routine is declared as motivation and recurs in the librarian's recitation ("Come to hear stories...stay to become part of them"). However, it is never dramatized through conflicting choices or tested against cost—no visitor appears, no friction arises. The desire remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Wintersun serenity is signaled early ("wintersun serenity of the early hours") and reprised at closure ("gentle clarity of winter sun"). The tone remains coherent and calm throughout, modulating subtly during the immersion beat. However, the static mood does not charge the final image with additional pressure or reweight prior material—it maintains atmospheric consistency without dramatic deepening.</comment>
