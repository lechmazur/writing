<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marcus's transformation from resentment to reconciliation arrives without internal contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The "cellular memory" epiphany is delivered wholesale rather than earned through dramatized struggle; his motivation shifts because Elara tells him to close his eyes, not because competing impulses force a costly choice. Elara remains a label—"scheming pacifist"—without embodied cunning or visible tactical adjustments. The brother's manifestation at the end bypasses any agency test for Marcus, rendering the protagonist passive at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, avoiding debt. However, the closure unit—Marcus's reconciliation with his brother—depends on the brother's unexplained manifestation "through one of reality's shifting pathways," a coincidence that resolves the dominant stake without Marcus's causal agency. The inferred lens is Causal (because/therefore linkage), but the final image (brothers touching, music boxes "made whole") does not trace to a decision Marcus made; it traces to Elara's instruction and a convenient appearance. Cost is asserted ("broken and made whole") but not legible as a choice that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary's soundless quality and shifting walls are vividly rendered ("walls breathing slowly like living tissue," "starlight given solid form"). These details create atmosphere but do not constrain a choice or charge the final image; Marcus's decisions are unaffected by spatial layout or sensory pressure. The music boxes—objects that could serve as micro-setting—remain symbolic props rather than tools that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the "ethereal halls" anchor the reader, pushing the score into mid-band despite the lack of choice-shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—releasing resentment toward the brother—is signaled early. Escalation under the Causal lens requires Marcus's agency to narrow options, but the key reversal (his broken music box repairing itself) is an external manifestation triggered by Elara's guided vision, not a choice Marcus makes under pressure. The brother's arrival resolves the conflict without Marcus having to risk or forfeit anything on the page. No visible price is paid; the "dark aura" dissolving is asserted transformation, not a dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme—transformation through releasing resentment—is stated overtly ("some resentments need only shift their form") rather than emerging through particulars. The music box motif recurs but is awarded symbolic credit without constraining a choice or accumulating pressure across beats. "Cellular memory" and "shifting grace" function as prompt labels rather than lived realization. The final image (brothers touching, melody only their hearts can hear) gestures toward resonance but remains abstract, lacking the concrete cost or ironic reweighting that would charge it with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Marcus, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Distance control is consistent, and the perceptual signature (Marcus's unease with shifting reality) is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("cellular memory," "shifting grace," "ethereal halls") without voice-motivated grounding, and dialogue carries exposition ("I will convince you through cellular memory") rather than subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance flattens rather than modulates under pressure, and the prose does not vary rhythm to match emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear across multiple beats: "the sanctuary's perfect stillness" / "the sanctuary's profound quiet" / "the sanctuary's ambient light" recycles stems without adding pressure. Stock metaphors ("dark aura," "shimmering light," "starlight given solid form") cluster in the closure beat, dulling the final image. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "appeared to") dull immediacy during high-pressure moments. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−1.2 for spread across closure) and loop check (−0.4) results in a score capped below mid-band. Clarity remains intact, preventing further collapse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The sanctuary-as-therapy-space premise and the broken-object-as-metaphor structure are familiar workshop templates. "Cellular memory" and "shifting reality" function as stock supernatural devices without fresh synthesis or lived specificity. The reconciliation arc (estranged brothers heal through guided meditation) follows a predictable emotional template without a non-obvious turn or moral calculus. The music box repair as external manifestation of internal change is a transparent symbolic convenience. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges toward safety at every choice point.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara the "scheming pacifist" is present across beats but her scheming is label-only; she retrieves a music box, instructs Marcus to close his eyes, and watches the resolution. No tactical adjustment or manipulation is dramatized. Her role is guide, not decision-maker whose choices create turns. Present in closure but passive, trending toward functional-but-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The music box cylinder pin broken is signaled early (Marcus "clutching a small music box with a cylinder pin broken"), handled in two beats (Elara retrieves an intact box, Marcus's box repairs at the transformation moment), and participates in closure (the two boxes "fused into perfect harmony"). The repair is an external manifestation rather than a choice Marcus makes, capping the score; the object enables the ending but does not constrain tactics or shape a middle choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Shifting grace" is named in dialogue ("experiencing shifting grace as reality transforms") and echoed in the final paragraph ("transforming grace"), but it does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. Reality shifts around Marcus, but he does not navigate or adapt to it; the concept remains thematic decoration without causal pressure. Present as label, absent as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "reappears when needed" is described ("The box had the attribute that it reappears when needed throughout the sanctuary") and demonstrated once (Elara retrieves the intact box). It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost; the reappearance is convenient rather than costly. Setup gate met, development and closure gates weak, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Convince" is the action Elara takes ("I will convince you through cellular memory") and the transformation hinges on her guided vision. However, the convincing is told ("visions not his own flooded his consciousness") rather than dramatized as a struggled exchange, and Marcus's agency is passive receipt. The action shapes the middle beat and participates in closure, but its execution is summary-only, capping the score at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through cellular memory" is signaled in dialogue ("I will convince you through cellular memory") and its mechanics appear in the vision sequence ("cellular memory showed his body itself remembered"). The method matters to the transformation but is delivered as exposition rather than a constrained attempt; Marcus does not struggle with the method or adapt tactics. Setup and development gates met weakly, payoff present but summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" is vividly described and present across beats ("soundless sanctuary," "profound quiet," "ethereal halls"). However, the soundlessness does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Marcus's transformation occurs via vision, not via navigating the sanctuary's constraints. Setting is postcard backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Setup gate strong, development and closure gates weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" is signaled early ("Reality had begun to shift around them") and recurs ("reality shifted more radically," "reality's shifting pathways"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; Marcus's transformation unfolds at the pace of Elara's instruction without a live clock or urgency. The shifts are atmospheric rather than tactical pressure. Setup gate met, development and closure gates absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To teach resentment to release" is Elara's stated goal ("His motivation to teach resentment to release had been Elara's goal") and the story's arc centers on this desire. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; Elara faces no friction or cost in achieving it, and Marcus's release is delivered rather than struggled toward. Setup and payoff gates met, but friction between wants and costs is absent, capping the score at functional.</comment>
