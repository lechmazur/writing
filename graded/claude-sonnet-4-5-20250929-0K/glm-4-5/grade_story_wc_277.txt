<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to honor her father's work is clear, but her interiority consists largely of abstract declarations ("devotedly observant eyes," "the weight of family legacy") rather than embodied contradiction. The investigation unfolds through summary rather than pressured choices—she spreads documents, taps a pen, works "hours," then arrives at answers off-page. No visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies her decision to call the journalist; the ending declares triumph without dramatizing struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece orients who and where by the second paragraph, but causality remains vague: the journalist's "allegations" and Eleanor's counter-theory are summarized, not dramatized. The climax—"Eleanor finally had it"—occurs off-page between paragraphs, replacing scene pressure with a told resolution. No on-page reversal or tightening constrains her options; she moves from documents to phone call without visible cost, yielding a closure assertion rather than a legible Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The echoing observatory is vividly sketched (curved walls, star-filled dome, clouds below) and anchors the setting early. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; no environmental detail constrains Eleanor's investigative choices or charges the final image. The rosewood pen nib is handled repeatedly but remains a symbolic token rather than a tool that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—clearing Davies and exposing the real culprit—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens on the page. Eleanor encounters no reversals, dead ends, or costs; she simply works "hours" and arrives at the answer. The resolution is declared ("Eleanor finally had it") rather than earned through a dramatized choice that forecloses options, leaving escalation absent and agency invisible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of truth-seeking and honoring legacy emerges through action and image, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's "Sometimes the most powerful intervention is showing people what they've refused to see" borders on thesis statement. The recurring "orbits of regret" motif shifts meaning (regret → determination → justice) but remains more decorative than causally integrated. The proof-by-contradiction method is mentioned but not dramatized, weakening thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable, and Eleanor's voice carries a consistent register. However, phrases like "devotedly observant eyes," "playful solemnity," "solemn playfulness," and "formidable truth-seeker" read as external narration rather than character-specific perception. Dialogue to the empty room ("Father always said…") feels expository. Diction remains clean but lacks the perceptual signature that would distinguish Eleanor's way of noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and rhythmically varied, but suffers from paraphrase loops and template phrasing: "rosewood pen nib" appears six times with minimal functional variance; "devotedly observant" is recycled across paragraphs; "orbits of regret" recurs without reweighting. Key beats are summarized ("Hours passed," "she finally had it") rather than dramatized, flattening momentum. Figurative language ("orbits of regret," "echoing observatory seemed to lean in") remains decorative rather than propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The detective-heir-in-observatory setup and proof-by-contradiction framing are familiar templates executed without fresh transformation. The journalist call, document review, and triumphant phone-back sequence follow predictable mechanics. No specific detail—investigative method, family history, or Davies's predicament—is rendered with enough particularity to distinguish this from genre baseline. The emotional arc (regret → determination → justice) proceeds without irony or complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eleanor is present throughout and her role as newsprint heiress frames her legacy motivation, but her choices do not create turns. She decides to investigate and later to call the journalist, yet both decisions are foregone conclusions without visible alternatives or costs. The heiress identity is mentioned but does not constrain tactics or shape the closure image causally.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in six distinct moments: traced between fingers (opening), placed in holder, scratched across paper (twice), tapped against chin, picked up at dawn, and picked up "one last time." However, it functions as a static symbol of legacy rather than a tool that enables or constrains action. Its meaning does not shift; each mention recycles the same associative link without causal pressure or closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" appears three times with shifting labels (regret → determination → justice) but remains thematic decoration. The concept does not shape Eleanor's investigative tactics or force a trade-off on the page. Removing it would leave the plot and closure intact, indicating ornamental rather than structural integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is mentioned three times as a trait Eleanor and her parents share, but it never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. She catalogs "facts" and notices contradictions in summary, yet no scene dramatizes a moment where acute observation forces a difficult choice or reveals a blind spot. The attribute remains label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Intervene" is signaled early ("the responsibility to intervene where her father could not") and returns at the end ("the most powerful intervention is showing people what they've refused to see"). However, the intervention itself—calling the journalist with findings—is declared rather than dramatized. The action does not generate reversals or redefine options; Eleanor's plan succeeds off-page without friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Proof by contradiction is mentioned twice: Eleanor reminds herself to "assume the opposite" and applies the method to Davies's innocence. Yet the mechanics are summarized, not shown. No on-page beat dramatizes a failed assumption, a logical dead end, or the cost of rigorous method. The method is claimed but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The echoing observatory is vividly described (curved walls, star-filled dome, clouds below at dawn) and provides "perfect isolation" for Eleanor's work. However, it does not pressure her choices or supply resources that alter the investigation's outcome. The setting functions as atmospheric container rather than constraint or tactical enabler, and its presence in the closure image is decorative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the journalist called" anchors the opening and Eleanor works through the night until dawn, but elapsed time does not tighten decisions. No deadline, fatigue cost, or racing clock alters her tactics. The temporal frame provides sequence but not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation to "discover hidden truths" and honor her father's unfinished work is stated early and drives her decision to investigate. However, the desire faces no on-page friction—no competing want, no moment where truth-seeking costs her safety, relationship, or certainty. The motivation is declared and pursued without dramatized conflict between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" and "playful solemnity" are named twice, and Eleanor's approach is described as "treating this serious investigation like a delightful puzzle." Yet the tone on the page reads earnest and declarative rather than paradoxically light. No sentence rhythm, image choice, or beat modulation embodies the tonal contrast through pressure. The tone is asserted, not enacted.</comment>
