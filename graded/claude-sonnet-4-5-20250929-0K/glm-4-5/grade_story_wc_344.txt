<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains abstract throughout, pursuing "the rhythm of repair" without embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. The grandfather's journal and prophecy fragments are told rather than dramatized into choices under pressure. Interior life consists of stock gestures ("breath forming ephemeral clouds," "fingers trembling") and label-only feelings. The clockwork heart repair happens smoothly without struggle, blind spots, or flaws that complicate the resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: lyric fragments accumulate toward a final restoration image. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elias completes the repair without forfeiture, and the ending ("he had found his place") is asserted rather than earned through on-page pressure. The box opening and heart repair proceed without reversal or tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frozen library and hall of mirrors supply vivid sensory anchors ("ice crystallized on ancient bookshelves," "reflections multiplied infinitely"). Spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Elias's tactics or the final choice. The clockwork heart and tools are handled on the page, qualifying as micro-setting, but they enable rather than constrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early but never tested. Elias encounters no meaningful obstacle: the library yields, the box opens, the heart repairs. No reversal, tightening, or visible price narrows his options. The mirrors distort geometry momentarily but do not block progress. Pressure remains static from entry to completion.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of restoration and belonging emerges organically from the repair action and ancestor reflections. The clockwork heart metaphor and "driftwood" recurrence carry weight. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("broken things made whole," "place in the everlasting dance") rather than letting the image resonate. The epiphany arrives without struggle, reducing ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Elias notices "hauntingly bright" tools and "driftwood nostalgia" in ways that could belong to any contemplative protagonist. Diction elevates consistently ("ephemeral clouds," "reverence of a priest") but lacks character-specific idiom. The single line of whispered dialogue ("This way") does not test voice distinction. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy template cadence pervades: "Under the soft hush of..." appears three times, "hauntingly bright clockmaker's gear assortment" twice, "through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" twice, "like driftwood" twice, and "hall of mirrors" nine times. Paraphrase loops cluster around the tools and mirror descriptions. These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure beat ("hauntingly bright clockmaker's gear assortment clicked closed"). Register remains elevated but uniform throughout; no modulation under pressure. One stray character (精密) in "springs and精密 tools" breaks proofreading.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith and frozen library above clouds offer fresh surface details. However, the core structure—journeying to a hidden place, unlocking a legendary artifact, repairing a symbolic heart to join ancestors—follows template beats without transformation. Emotional truth is generic (belonging, reverence). The ending's "eternal rhythm" and "everlasting dance" lean into abstraction rather than specific lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith is present throughout and performs the central repair. However, Elias makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path; he simply executes the task as planned. His profession is mentioned repeatedly but does not constrain or enable a decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The clockmaker's gear assortment is handled in at least three beats: unpacking at the pedestal, selecting the smallest pick, and clicking closed at the end. It enables the repair but does not impose a cost or constraint. The final reprise recharges the opening image but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors distorts geometry and hosts the pedestal, appearing in nine mentions. However, it does not constrain Elias's approach or alter his tactics; he "finally spotted" the pedestal without navigating a puzzle. It functions as atmospheric setting rather than shaping stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" appears three times to describe the tools, twice in identical phrases. It labels appearance without constraining or enabling action. The brightness scatters "rainbow reflections" at the end, a visual detail that does not change options or carry cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Uncap" appears twice: once as metaphor ("uncap the meaning") and once as literal action ("uncap the mechanism"). The literal use occurs during the box-opening beat but is swappable with "unlock" or "open" without structural change. It does not define a unique tactic or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" appears in three beats: discovery of the hall's location, guidance on empathy over force, and synchronization at closure. The method is told rather than shown; we never see the scraps or learn their mechanics. It frames backstory but does not shape on-page attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is established early and supplies the ice-melting closure image. It provides atmosphere and houses the essential pedestal and scrolls. However, the environment does not pressure Elias's choices; the doors yield, the hall is navigable, and temperature does not constrain his work. The setting enables rather than tests.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Under the soft hush of a distant morning" appears three times as refrain but imposes no temporal pressure. Time is untracked; we do not know if Elias works for minutes or hours, and no clock tightens his decisions. The morning light is atmospheric, not a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of repair" is stated early and drives Elias's pilgrimage. It reappears in "feeling the rhythm of repair synchronize with his own heartbeat" at closure. However, the desire is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. He pursues it smoothly without friction or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" appears twice: washing over Elias at entry and transforming to belonging at the end. The tone is coherent but static; reverent and contemplative throughout without modulation under pressure. It charges the final image lightly but does not deepen through the turns.</comment>
