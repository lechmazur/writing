<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ayla's jitteriness is asserted but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her final transformation ("confidence replacing the jitters") is told rather than earned through dramatized cost. The absent mentor remains a static backstory prop rather than a present pressure that forces conflicted choices. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("wonder grows," "coax wonder from the routine") without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece presents a journey-plus-delivery structure but the closure—handing off the pendant and discovering internal confidence—arrives through summary rather than on-page reversal. The stated cost ("hollow space against her chest") is asserted, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a live option. Orientation is adequate (courier, ridgeway, pendant by ~100 words), but the drive lens wavers between causal (delivery mission) and thematic-accumulative (wonder awakening) without committing, and the final paragraph's abstract philosophizing replaces scene pressure. Applying lens-ambiguity penalty and cost-proof deficit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway and dragonfly-wing pendant supply vivid sensory anchors, and the ground responding to the pendant's vibration offers purposeful detail. However, the ridgeway itself does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear (ridge marker, valley, village gates) but the setting never pressures a decision at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—deliver the pendant by solstice—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page obstacle that forces a trade-off. The elderly traveler encounter offers information but no cost or reversal. The final handoff occurs without friction, and the stated internal shift (jitters to confidence) is summarized rather than earned through a choice that narrows options. One tightening is present (learning the shortcut) but it eases rather than escalates pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of awakening wonder is stated repeatedly ("wonder grows," "coax wonder from the routine," "delivering wonder itself") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final two paragraphs shift into overt meta-commentary and thesis summary, replacing scene pressure with moralizing. The dragonfly-wing pendant recurs but does not reweight prior material at closure; its absence is told, not felt through image or action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narration maintains consistent third-person limited distance and offers some character-specific perceptual coloring ("jittery," "fingers instinctively touched"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("across the fade from memory to myth," "eternal stories") that sit uneasily with a courier's practical voice. The elderly traveler's single line of dialogue is the only on-page speech; it feels more like thematic prompt than naturalistic exchange. No head-hopping, but voice texture remains generic under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs weaken propulsion: "The pendant had been created across the fade from memory to myth" echoes "Across the fade from memory to myth, her journey would continue" without added meaning; "vibrating sympathetically" appears five times as a refrain without evolving pressure; "absent mentor" is used three times in identical constructions. The final two paragraphs stack abstract summary ("wonder wasn't delivered to people—it was awakened within them") that stalls closure momentum. Filter-verb clusters ("began vibrating," "started to") and stock metaphors ("windows like fireflies") further dull immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core premise—magical courier delivering an artifact that extends encounters—sits squarely within familiar quest-delivery templates. The dragonfly-wing pendant's specific attribute (extending brief encounters) is mentioned but not dramatically tested in a way that transforms the trope. The elderly traveler scene and the village handoff unfold without friction or non-obvious turns. The "absent mentor" and "jittery courier gains confidence" arc follow well-worn paths without synthesis or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ayla appears throughout and makes the delivery decision, but her choices do not create key turns; she accepts the shortcut without cost and hands off the pendant without on-page conflict. The "jittery" trait is asserted in the opening but does not constrain or enable a tactic under pressure. She is present in three beats (ridgeway encounter, descent, handoff) but her agency is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pendant is introduced early, handled in the traveler encounter (vibrating sympathetically to share knowledge), and appears at closure (handoff to elder). It enables the shortcut and the germination effect, shaping two beats with causal pressure. However, its departure is told rather than shown through a choice with visible cost, and its closure participation is mechanical (plot function) rather than charged or reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The absent mentor is mentioned in four reflective beats (opening, workshop memory, letter, final smile) but never constrains a present choice or alters Ayla's tactics on the page. The mentor's teachings frame backstory but do not create friction or enable a turn. The letter at closure is summary exposition rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The attribute "extends brief encounters" is demonstrated once (traveler scene, allowing knowledge-share) with a functional outcome (shortcut learned). It is mentioned again at closure via abstract summary but does not impose a cost or constrain a second choice. The trait shapes one beat causally but remains replaceable; another magical effect could enable the same shortcut.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Germination appears in three beats: shoots at Ayla's feet during descent, the mission goal (germinate dormant seeds), and the final paragraph's metaphorical "germinating within her own spirit." The village garden germination is the stated mission but occurs off-page post-handoff. The green shoots during descent are vivid but do not redefine options or create a turn; they are effect, not cause. The closure metaphor is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The method "vibrating sympathetically" is named five times across the text (traveler encounter, workshop memory, earth response, kind hearts, final sentence) but its mechanics do not shape a tactical choice or constrain an attempt under pressure. The workshop flashback tells rather than shows how it works. The method is present and consistent but ornamental; another mechanism could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway is established early and supplies vivid sensory grounding (blue-green lights, ridge marker, valley view). Ayla descends it in two beats and the auroras "paint her path" at closure. However, the ridgeway itself does not pressure a choice, supply a resource, or alter tactics; it is scenic backdrop. The earth's response (green shoots) occurs on the ridgeway but is effect of the pendant, not the ridgeway's own constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase "across the fade from memory to myth" appears three times (pendant's creation, Ayla's continued journey, evaluator summary) but functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than a dramatized clock or temporal constraint. No on-page tightening arises from time pressure; the solstice deadline is mentioned but never tested. The phrase is ornamental and swappable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to coax wonder from the routine" is stated explicitly in dialogue and narration (mentor's teaching, "coax wonder from daily survival," "delivering wonder itself") but never dramatized through a choice where wonder conflicts with another want or cost. Ayla's actions (accept shortcut, complete delivery) align with the goal without friction. The motivation is told and thematic rather than tested on the page.</comment>
