<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains a label-only construct throughout; "uncommonly serene" is asserted repeatedly but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The heated argument with the mentor is pure backstory exposition with no on-page dramatization. Interior life consists entirely of abstract philosophical claims about storytelling ethics rather than embodied emotion or character-particular perception. No visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from any choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story operates as a static tableau rather than a causal sequence: Elias reflects on his art, performs a show (summarized), then reflects again the next morning with no meaningful change in options or knowledge. Orientation is delayed past 120 words—we cycle through calligrapher, radar dome, and puppet shows before anchoring who/where/when. The "closure" is Elias smiling and planning his next project, identical to his opening state; no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) fails because no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The radar dome appears early and recurs, constraining Elias's workshop space, which lifts the score into functional range. Sensory detail is generic ("twilight painted the dome's interior in shades of indigo") and filtered through no particular POV bias. Spatial choreography is loose—puppets, story stick, and stage move without clear tracking. The setting never forces a choice or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exploring ethical storytelling—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-offs. The performance is summarized in one sentence ("presented stories...with dignity and complexity"), eliding the beat that should carry pressure. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the audience's skepticism melts without dramatized cause. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated directly and repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars: "ethical storytelling required acknowledging multiple perspectives," "power of storytelling to humanize or dehumanize." The campfire story stick is introduced as symbolic cargo with no earned weight. "Half-lit epiphanies" recur as a phrase but carry no conceptual cost or specific insight tied to scene pressure. The final image—Elias smiling, the stick glowing, planning his next project—offers no non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but the perceptual signature is generic literary prose ("meteor hush," "urbane calligrapher") with no character-particular filtering. Repeated phrases ("uncommonly serene," "half-lit epiphany," "campfire story stick") function as template placeholders rather than earned motifs. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("interconnectedness of all narratives") that sits outside the on-page action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "uncommonly serene" appears six times, "half-lit epiphany" four times, "campfire story stick" nine times, "heated argument" three times—all without functional variation. Template cadence dominates: "Elias [verb]" opens fourteen sentences. The performance beat—the story's climax—is summarized in two sentences, a catastrophic elision of the moment that should carry weight. Figurative language is stock: "meteor hush," "pulse with potential." Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 for loops and templates, escalated to −1.4 because artifacts touch what should be the closure beat (the performance summary).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist uses subversive puppet shows to challenge narratives—is functional but not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The radar dome and calligraphy are ornamental quirks unconnected to the storytelling conflict. The performance itself, the story's supposed center, is withheld from the page, leaving only abstract claims about its impact. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, and the emotional arc (none) and plot (static) remain unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but makes no on-page choices that alter tactics or create turns. His "calligrapher" trait is mentioned in the opening and closing frame but disconnected from the puppet-show action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in setup, is "placed prominently at center stage," serves as "narrator and character," and "holds new stories" after the performance. Two gates (setup, middle) are met; it is present in the ending paragraph but does not causally shape the closure image—it "seemed to glow" in passive approval. Swappable with any heirloom prop. Cap at 4.6 for missing causal closure linkage; small lift to 4.8 for recurrence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" recur as a phrase (four times) but function as label-only theme claims with no on-page change to options or tactics. The concept never shapes stakes or constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is asserted six times but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. It remains a decorative label with no behavioral consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Reverse" appears in setup and method descriptions ("reverse the narrative power dynamics," "reverse harmful narratives," "reverse another dominant narrative"), but no major turn traces to this action on the page. The performance—where reversal should be dramatized—is summarized. Swappable with "challenge" or "subvert."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled early, shapes the middle beat (the performance at The Whispering Tankard), and appears in the closing reflection. Two gates met (setup, middle); it does not causally shape the ending beyond being mentioned. The mechanics are summarized rather than shown, lowering causal pressure. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, but swappability and summary-only use −0.8 total.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The radar dome is present in setup, houses the workshop in the middle, and frames the closing reflection. Two gates met; it provides spatial constraint (a sanctuary) but does not alter tactics or charge the final image. Functional but replaceable with any unconventional studio space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" appears in setup and closing reflection, but the timeframe exerts no pressure on decisions. The argument is backstory; the "hush" is static mood rather than a live clock. Missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"To explore ethical storytelling" is declared in setup and closing, but the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction between wants and costs. The motivation is told-only exposition. Missing middle development where the want should be tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears three times as a decorative phrase ("meteor hush of anticipation," "meteor hush...settled over the dome," "meteor hush of the dome embraced him") with no modulation under pressure or coherent tonal charge. It functions as a stock mood marker rather than a tone that evolves with stakes.</comment>
