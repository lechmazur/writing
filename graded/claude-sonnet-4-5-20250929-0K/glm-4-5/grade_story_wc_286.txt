<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear—to understand resilience—and his potter's movements supply a consistent behavioral signature. However, his interiority remains largely observational; we see him kneel, brush, smile, but few contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure that test his values. The ending gesture (resolve to return and teach) feels declared rather than earned by an on-page cost that forecloses a competing want. Embodied emotion is thin; the "sharp gentleness" remains a label more than a dramatized contradiction in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The piece establishes who (Kael), where (oasis), and stakes (understanding resistance to decay) by the fourth paragraph, satisfying orientation. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and recurring images (lantern glass, smoke, wildflowers) layer toward a conceptual repricing of "resistance" as love's memory. However, no on-page cost is legible at closure—Kael's resolve to return is aspirational, not a decision that forecloses a path or exacts a visible price. The final paragraph summarizes intent ("resolved to return") rather than dramatizing a choice or renunciation. Without felt or conceptual cost anchoring the closure unit, Q2 cannot rise above mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scorched wasteland, thriving wildflowers, dead hives, and stone cottage anchor the oasis vividly. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting: Kael holds it up, follows sun patterns through it, and uses it to witness fractured timelines—this constrains his choices and charges the final sequence. Sensory selection (shimmering heat, thrum in bones, smoke bending light) supports atmosphere without catalog excess. The micro-setting gate is met cleanly, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the oasis's resilience—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sensory discoveries (glass reveals timelines, flowers tilt toward kindness, bees stir), but no on-page reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off. Kael's work (centering earth, offering attention) proceeds unobstructed; no failure, resistance, or competing cost tests his commitment. The ending declares his intention to teach without dramatizing what he sacrifices or forecloses. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase, but the final image lacks the cadence shift or visible price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—resilience as love's patient memory—emerges from the oasis's response to kindness rather than abstract statement. The lantern glass and wildflowers recur with shifting meaning: first as curiosities, then as witnesses to Kael's nurturing gesture. However, the final paragraph tips into thematic summarizing ("resistance to change not as stubbornness…but as the loyal memory of love") that articulates rather than enacts the concept. A more implicit close would strengthen resonance; the current ending hovers between earned image and authorial thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and consistent: "zen-minded," "sharp gentleness," "fractures within it revealed fractured timelines" all fit the contemplative register. Perceptual signature is visible in phrases like "hands forming circles of air as if centering clay" and "each movement an offering of attention." The final lines drift toward elevated summary ("the sharp gentleness of his vigil") that feels slightly detached from lived experience. Filter verbs ("he noticed," "he realized") appear but do not dominate. The voice is distinct and legible, supporting the textural lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Several passages loop or paraphrase without advancing pressure: "The careful precision of his movements belied the sharp gentleness…" echoes description already woven into action; "by following sun patterns" repeats three times without functional variation. Template cadence appears in stacked "he [verb]" stems across middle paragraphs. "Sharp gentleness" recurs as a label rather than being shown through contradictory action. Metaphor density is high but not incoherent; the figurative language remains legible. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (wildflowers tilt, bees stir), but scaffold sentences like "With the setting sun came another moment when chimney smoke rose again…" slow momentum. Apply loop/scaffold deductions: −0.6 for paraphrase and template runs, capping Q7 in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of pottery craft, fractured timelines, and phototropic wildflowers is specific and non-obvious. The premise—a place nourished by kindness rather than light—transforms the post-apocalyptic oasis trope. However, execution leans on familiar beats: the wanderer arrives, discovers a wonder, resolves to share it. The ending's epiphany ("resistance to change…as the loyal memory of love") feels slightly generic in phrasing despite the fresh setup. Risk-taking is modest; the piece plays safely within its lyric-contemplative register. Within-band placement reflects solid originality diminished by conventional closure rhetoric.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and named early (Setup ✓). His potter's movements shape his approach to the hives and earth (Development partial: one beat of work, not a constrained choice). He resolves to return and teach (Payoff: present in ending but not causally decisive). His observation drives the narrative, but few on-page choices narrow options or impose cost. Two gates met loosely; score ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lantern glass appears in paragraph 6 (Setup ✓), Kael holds it up to reveal fractured timelines (Development: one key beat ✓), and he uses it again in evening to follow sun patterns (Payoff: present and shaping final action ✓). Three gates met; the object enables perception and guides his work. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it facilitates without friction. Score ~6.8 for solid involvement across beats without escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are revealed through the lantern glass in paragraph 9 (Setup late but vivid) and shape Kael's understanding of the oasis existing in multiple moments (Development: conceptual stake ✓). The ending refers to "connection between past, present, and future" (Payoff thematic). Two-plus gates met; the concept colors perception but does not constrain a live choice or alter tactics under pressure. Swappable with "temporal overlay" or similar. Score ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Wildflowers tilt toward Kael, responding to compassion rather than light (Setup and Development in paragraph 16 ✓). This attribute is observed and explained but does not force a trade-off or enable a blocked action. Kael's work proceeds; the flowers' response confirms theme rather than complicating his path. One gate (Development) met with thematic presence. No visible cost tied to the trait. Score ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Thrum" appears in paragraph 8 ("the air began to thrum"), intensifies in paragraph 20 ("the ground thrummed more strongly"), and signals the timelines resolving (Development and Payoff ✓). Early signal ✓. The thrum does not constrain choice but marks escalation in the accumulative design—sensory cue that anchors each deepening. Three gates met; causal role is atmospheric rather than tactical. Score ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"By following sun patterns" is named in paragraph 9 (Setup ✓), repeated in paragraph 25 as the method by which Kael continues his work in evening (Payoff ✓). The method is signaled and used but not developed with mechanical detail or constraint—Kael follows patterns he studied since childhood without on-page friction. Two gates; functional but generic. Score ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis in scorched wasteland anchors the entire narrative from paragraph 4 onward (Setup ✓). The contrast (thriving wildflowers amid decay) pressures Kael's inquiry (Development ✓), and the setting supplies the hives, earth, and cottage that Kael works with in the ending (Payoff ✓). Three gates met strongly; the setting is indispensable to the stake and supplies resources that shape his final gesture. Score ~7.2 for necessity across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Chimney smoke rises and flattens in paragraph 12 (Setup ✓) and again "with the setting sun" near the end (Payoff mention). The timeframe is poetic rather than pressuring; no clock tightens Kael's decisions. Days of travel are summarized; the vigil "continued through the night" without tactical consequence. Two gates loosely; the image recurs but does not constrain. Score ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—to understand why some places resist decay—is stated in paragraph 3 (Setup ✓) and fulfilled by his realization in paragraph 27 (Payoff ✓). The desire drives his journey and observation (Development: shapes stake). However, it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; Kael pursues understanding without friction. Three gates met; motivation is functional and resolved but not tested. Score ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Sharp gentleness" is named in paragraph 11 and repeated in paragraphs 24 and 29 (Setup and Payoff ✓). The tone is signaled and recurs, but it remains a label more than a modulating atmosphere under pressure. The prose is consistently contemplative; no tonal shift heightens the final image. Two gates with thematic presence; the tone is coherent but static. Score ~5.1.</comment>
