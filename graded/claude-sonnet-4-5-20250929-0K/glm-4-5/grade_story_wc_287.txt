<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "reflect light into dark corners" is stated but never truly tested by competing impulses or genuine cost. The encounter with Jim unfolds without friction—she simply executes her plan while he explains backstory. The final "purpose crystallize" moment is asserted rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. Embodied emotion is sparse; we get "wistfully pragmatic heart ache" but little contradictory impulse acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~200 words before "Down at the docks"), and the disorientation does not charge closure. The closure unit—Mara continuing her grandmother's work—lacks visible cost; she gains wisdom and peaceful communion with Jim, but no path is foreclosed and no trade-off materializes on the page. The encounter with Jim is pure coincidence that resolves rather than complicates, violating situational-lens rules. Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into convenient backstory exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The harbor and alcove provide atmospheric staging, and the bitting gauge tool's light-reflection mechanics constrain Mara's physical action in the final third. However, the fire escape and rosebush (opening anchors) vanish without spatial transition, creating a floating-room effect mid-story. The rowboat and alcove rock remain static backdrops; neither pressures a choice or alters tactics before the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's desire to reflect light—is declared but never encounters opposition or cost. Jim's appearance supplies backstory rather than complication, and the climactic light-reflection proceeds without obstacle, failed attempt, or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara does exactly what she set out to do with no price paid on the page. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The light/darkness motif recurs but remains abstract; the final image offers a pleasant tableau ("alcove glowed") without reweighting prior material or imposing conceptual cost. The grandmother's legacy is delivered via Jim's exposition rather than earned through Mara's struggle with inherited expectations. "Protected vulnerability" and "wistfully pragmatic" remain prompt labels never embodied in contradictory on-page choices. Theme is stated ("what we need has been there all along") rather than discovered through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("quivering hush," "liquid mercury"), though some phrases veer into generic poetry ("luminous harbor by moonlight"). Jim's dialogue and Mara's internal voice are not sufficiently distinct; both speak in the same elevated, aphoristic register. Perceptual signature is thin—Mara's noticing does not reflect her gardener's expertise or her grandmother's lockmaster lineage in specific, biased ways.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "wistfully pragmatic" appears twice in identical phrasing; "quivering hush" is repeated without reweighting; "luminous harbor by moonlight" recurs as a label. Stock metaphors ("liquid mercury," "urban jungle") and therapy-speak ("protected vulnerability") appear in peak beats without transformation. Template cadence: "She [verb], her [noun]" pattern runs across multiple sentences. Information density is low in the middle third, which summarizes backstory rather than advancing pressure. Deduction: −1.0 for loops and template stems touching the closure section.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—using a lockmaster's tool to reflect light as therapy or metaphor—reads as a writing-prompt assembly rather than an organic synthesis. The coincidental meeting with Jim, who knew the grandmother and supplies all needed context, is narratively convenient. The fire-escape gardener frame is abandoned without transformation. Emotional specificity is absent; the ending's "peaceful" glow offers no fresh inflection or risk. The bitting gauge's mechanics are mentioned but never constrain a failed attempt or force a tactical choice, reducing freshness to ornament.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and makes the decision to row to the alcove, but her gardener identity does not constrain or enable key turns. The fire escape garden appears only in setup and a brief memory; it does not shape middle choices or return at closure. Her actions are logically consistent but swappable with any introspective character seeking solace.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bitting gauge appears in paragraph 1 (setup), is handled in memory (middle), and used to reflect light in the ending (payoff). However, its mechanics are described rather than dramatized—no failed angle, no struggle with moonlight intensity, no trade-off in how she positions it. It enables the ending action but does not narrow options or impose cost; a flashlight or mirror could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" appears twice as atmospheric description ("the quivering hush of the evening," "that moment of quivering hush") but does not shape stakes or alter tactics. It functions as a mood label rather than a constraint or turning point. Removing it would not change plot, choice, or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is applied to Mara's heart in paragraph 1 and Jim's smile near the end, but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice where wistfulness and pragmatism pull in opposite directions. It remains a descriptor without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Instill" is referenced in "instilling not just light but also the memory" during the climax, but the action itself is passive reflection, not active instillation with resistance or cost. The verb could be replaced with "reflect," "project," or "cast" without structural change. It does not drive a turn or redefine options; it summarizes the ending tableau.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"The rhythm of oars in water" appears twice: once as Mara rows to the alcove, once as a simile for her methodical light-work. The rowing mechanics do not matter; no current resists, no coordination challenge arises, no fatigue or timing constraint affects outcome. The phrase is ornamental rather than a method that shapes attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" frames the story (paragraph 2) and provides the light source Mara uses at the alcove (ending). It supplies a necessary resource (moonlight) but does not pressure choices or create micro-tactical problems. The harbor's luminosity is static backdrop; removing the "luminous" modifier or substituting any moonlit water would not alter plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the final petal drops from the old rosebush" anchors the story's start and motivates Mara's departure, but time remains vague thereafter ("hours passed"). No clock tightens decisions during the alcove scene; Mara has "all night and no time at all," which neutralizes urgency. The rosebush does not return or reweight meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to reflect light into dark corners" is stated in paragraph 2 and executed in the ending, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Mara encounters no obstacle to her desire; Jim affirms rather than challenges it. The motivation drives the plot's direction but lacks friction or visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named once in paragraph 3 and echoed in "that moment of quivering hush" when Mara meets Jim, but the tone does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with new emotional weight. The ending remains uniformly serene; no tonal shift marks escalation or cost. The phrase functions as a thematic label rather than a dynamic tonal force.</comment>
