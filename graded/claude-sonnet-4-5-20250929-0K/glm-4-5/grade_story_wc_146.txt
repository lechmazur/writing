<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation remains abstract ("restore shared balance") and is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. His "infinitely patient" trait is asserted repeatedly but never constrains a choice or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The protagonist functions as a competent craftsman executing a predetermined ritual without internal contradiction, blind spots, or mistakes that compound—he simply walks, strikes the fork, and succeeds. No embodied emotion or micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Silas walks methodically, the town repairs incrementally, and the final sustained note delivers closure as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when by paragraph two. However, the cost remains conceptual and vague—what did Silas forfeit or risk to achieve this restoration? The "threat of collapse receded" and "hours bled into one another" tell us pressure existed, but no on-page moment shows a tightening that narrows options or forces a visible price. The closure image reweights the town's state but lacks the felt or visible cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Silverwood is vividly rendered with skeletal buildings, moss-furred stones, and cracked cobblestones that Silas tests underfoot. The ebony tuning fork and cobblestones function as micro-setting elements that constrain his method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the archway, bell tower, and pathways. Sensory hierarchy reflects Silas's professional focus on resonance and vibration, creating purposeful specificity that supports the accumulative design and participates in the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the town's harmonic balance before collapse—is signaled early and persists. However, escalation is minimal: Silas encounters discord, then methodically corrects it without reversals, complications, or visible constraints that narrow options. The "threat of collapse" remains abstract and never materializes as on-page pressure. No persistent loss (time, stamina, tool wear) alters tactics. The accumulative design delivers steady progress but lacks a tightening moment where agency forecloses a path or forces a trade-off with legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the interplay of decay/restoration, silence/sound, and the metaphor of tuning as healing. The ebony fork and cobblestones recur with shifting valence, charging the final image. However, the ending's "wild hush...serene and whole" risks tidy resolution without friction. The "shared balance" concept remains somewhat abstract and prompt-visible. Subtext operates in the image of the bell tower "longing for its voice," but the protagonist's internal arc—cryptic patience rewarded—lacks the ambiguity or non-literal reweighting that would elevate thematic resonance into the high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through Silas's professional sensitivity to resonance and vibration. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "infinitely patient," "wild hush," "ebony tuning fork" recur with purposeful rhythm. However, several phrases drift toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-particular: "a tapestry of sound and pressure," "skeleton of the old bell tower...longing for its voice." Perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with controlled rhythm, though some figurative language verges on overwriting: "dusk bled into the wild hush," "bruised sky," "star-choked sky." Template cadence appears in repeated "He [verb]. Another [noun]." constructions (paragraph three). Paraphrase loop: "The wild hush settled again, deeper now, expectant" and later "The wild hush deepened, no longer empty" restate similar content. No major loops obscure causality, but these artifacts prevent entry to the high band. Information density is adequate; no scaffolding or synonym churn mars the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—restoring a ghost town via sound and rhythm rather than physical labor—offers a fresh angle on revival narratives. Silas's method (tuning fork + footsteps on cobblestones) is specific and non-obvious. However, the "cryptic craftsman with mystical tool" and "dying town on the brink" are familiar templates, transformed only partially by the sonic mechanics. The story commits fully to its premise but avoids bold risk; Silas's competence proceeds without complication or friction. Emotional specificity and concrete world logic elevate the concept above generic, but the arc remains predictable: problem identified, method applied, balance restored.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and his walking/tuning actions drive all visible change. However, his choices do not create key turns—he follows a single predetermined method from start to finish without adaptation, hesitation, or cost. Observation and execution dominate; no decision alters tactics mid-stream. Missing middle development (no choice that constrains options) and no visible cost tied to his agency cap the score despite setup and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork appears in setup (paragraph two), is struck repeatedly in paragraphs three and four to channel vibration, and delivers the final sustained note that completes the restoration. It constrains Silas's method (the fork is his "scalpel, his baton, his conduit") and charges the closure image. Three-gate presence, causal pressure across multiple beats, and closure linkage support a high score. Slight swappability (another mystical tool could serve similar function with edits) prevents entry to the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the story's dominant stake, signaled early and resolved in the ending when Silverwood breathes again. The concept shapes Silas's entire sequence of actions and the accumulative pressure. However, it functions more as premise and outcome than a constraint that forces tactical choices—Silas's method never fails or requires adaptation. The concept is present across all three gates and drives the closure image, earning mid-band placement, but lacks the specificity and visible cost required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is asserted in the opening and invoked twice more ("infinitely patient rhythm," "enduring patience"). However, it never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost—Silas simply has all the time he needs. No moment shows patience tested, traded off against urgency, or forfeited. The trait is present and thematically consistent but remains label-only without dramatized tradeoff, capping the score below functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rebuild" drives the story's dominant action: Silas's walking and tuning cause the town's incremental repair (windowpane fuses, beam lifts, rust flakes away). The rebuild is signaled early, shapes multiple beats, and delivers the closure image of a town "no longer a ghost town waiting to fall." However, the action is not quite irreplaceable—"restore" or "repair" could substitute with minimal reframing. Strong three-gate presence and causal work support 7+ placement; modest swappability prevents 8.5+ entry.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method (rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones) is signaled in paragraph one, dramatized across paragraphs three through six as Silas places each step precisely to channel vibration, and charges the closure when "every cobblestone...answered in perfect chord." The mechanics shape his entire approach and constrain his movement. Three-gate presence, causal pressure across multiple beats, specificity (cobblestones glow where he tread most), and closure linkage justify high integration. Slight abstraction (how exactly do footsteps restore structures?) keeps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ancient archway frames the story's opening and closing, serves as the "fulcrum of the revival," and is the first stone transformed. It supplies a spatial anchor and symbolic charge. However, the archway does not constrain Silas's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—it is primarily a frame and recurring image. Three-gate presence (setup, return at closure) and lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake support mid-6s placement. Missing middle development (no choice shaped by the archway's properties) caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" is mentioned in paragraph one and invoked again when "the threat of collapse receded" in the final paragraph. However, time never tightens decisions or alters tactics—Silas works "hours bled into one another" without urgency or deadline pressure. The timeframe is present thematically but does not function as a live clock that constrains moves. Missing middle development and no causal pressure keep the score in the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Restore shared balance" is stated in paragraph one as Silas's purpose and resolved when "the shared balance returning" in paragraph six. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No moment shows Silas weighing this desire against another goal or paying a price to achieve it. Setup and closure presence without middle friction or cost legibility place the score in the mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is introduced in the opening line, recurs across paragraphs two, four, and six with shifting valence (heavy, expectant, deepened, serene), and charges the final image: "The wild hush embraced the town again, serene and whole." The tone modulates from oppressive silence to peaceful restoration, supporting the accumulative design. Three-gate presence, pattern taught early, and closure linkage that reweights the dominant stake justify 7+ placement. The tone is slightly abstract and could be replaced with "profound silence" without breaking logic, preventing 8.5+ entry.</comment>
