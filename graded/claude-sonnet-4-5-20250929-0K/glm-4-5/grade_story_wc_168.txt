<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The firefighter's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("translate pain into a universal language," "bargained innocence") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to "enlighten not others, but himself" is stated directly rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting in scene. The scarring and grief are told through summary reflection; no micro-choices under present pressure reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final "peace" arrives through extended meditation without a foreclosed path or felt sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—extended reflection and recurring porcelain-box imagery build toward a reweighted stance. Orientation is clear by the opening sentence. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the box shifts from "accusation" to "companion"), but the cost is asserted ("hard-won, gentle wisdom") rather than dramatically legible; no specific option is foreclosed or tactic altered in the final beat. The piece teaches its reflective mode early, yet the ending reconfiguration lacks undeniable pressure—peace is declared, not earned through a visible renunciation or choice that changes what comes next.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge, pines, and night sky anchor who/where/when cleanly in the opening. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (gravel crunch, cool porcelain, moonlight silvering the crack). The box functions as micro-setting: handled twice, its crack examined under moonlight, and it constrains the firefighter's reflective stance at the apex. The final image—moonlight making the fracture "seem less like damage, more like a deliberate stroke"—charges the closure moment, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating private pain into something universally resonant—is signaled early and clear. Pressure remains static: the firefighter walks, pauses, reflects, and finds peace without any reversal, complication, or choice that narrows options. No live cost or trade-off appears; the box's meaning is simply reframed through sustained meditation. The ending declares resolution ("peace," "wisdom") without an on-page act of renunciation or a tactic shift that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of survival leaving marks and "hard softness" emerges from the cracked box and scars, not direct moralizing, until the final paragraph where "enduring, quiet beauty of survival, marked but unbroken" becomes overtly stated. The box accumulates meaning across beats (accusation → testament → companion), which is purposeful. However, the ending summarizes the thematic answer ("he began to translate his own granite-hard grief into something soft") rather than offering a non-literal final image that reweights prior material. The stars-as-witnesses trope and "cosmic indifference" lean toward generic abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent—firefighter's tactile attention to the box, scars, and night details. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("bargained innocence," "hard softness defined him," "granite-hard grief") that sits uneasily alongside the concrete sensory beats. The final paragraph's phrase "translate his own granite-hard grief into something soft, something universally resonant" reads as thematic summary rather than voice-driven perception under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles across adjacent lines: "bargained innocence" appears three times with slight rewording; "scarred/scars" and "cracked/crack/fracture" recur in near-adjacent beats without new pressure; "gentle/gently skilled" and "hard softness" are restated. Template-cadence runs: "He didn't need to find answers; he needed to..." and "he needed to enlighten not others, but himself" follow mechanical parallel stems. The final two paragraphs summarize the arc in overlapping terms ("translate," "honor," "understand," "resonant"). Figurative density in peak beats ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "velvet darkness pricked by distant lights," "dark vein against milky porcelain") blurs immediacy without taught pattern. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The scarred-hero-finds-redemptive-object-in-ashes premise follows a familiar template without fresh inflection. The firefighter's epiphany—that survival leaves marks and flawed things hold beauty—is earnest but arrives through extended internal monologue rather than a non-obvious turn. The cosmic-indifference framing and the box-as-metaphor-for-self are clearly signaled but lack surprise or specificity that would make them feel inevitable rather than assigned. The piece commits to its reflective mode, yet the resolution into "peace" and "wisdom" reads as the safety middle, avoiding a bolder choice that might fracture or complicate the thematic answer.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The firefighter walks, pauses, reflects, and descends; no choice on the page alters tactics or forecloses an option. His decision to hold the box up to moonlight and later pocket it again are gestures that accompany meditation, not turns that shift stakes. The character is present across all beats but passive—observation and narration dominate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cracked porcelain box is handled in three beats: lifted from pocket, held to moonlight with crack examined, returned to pocket. It appears in the opening (setup), middle examination (development), and final image (closure participation). The crack's meaning shifts from "silent accusation" to "testament to endurance" to "companion," reweighting across the arc. However, the box does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure—it remains a reflective anchor rather than an agent of narrative causality. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement, but no causal cost tied to its presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Bargained innocence" is named three times and explained in backstory (firefighter's lost belief that courage prevails; the box as survivor of fire). It shapes the thematic stakes but does not alter on-page options or create a choice under pressure—it exists as label and retrospective explanation rather than a live constraint or tactical force in the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Gently skilled" appears twice as a descriptor of the firefighter's hands tracing the box. It signals his dual nature (toughness + tenderness) but does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost. The attribute is label-only; no trade-off or tactical consequence follows from being "gently skilled" rather than simply careful or calloused.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Enlighten" is stated as motivation ("to enlighten not others, but himself") and the final paragraph declares "he began to translate" as a realized act. However, the enlightenment occurs through sustained reflection without a distinct on-page turn or choice that pivots the narrative. The action could be swapped with "understand," "accept," or "honor" with minor edits; it does not uniquely define the ending's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"By reflecting deeply" is signaled early ("needed to enlighten...by reflecting deeply") and executed across the entire piece—long introspective passages dominate. The method shapes the story's structure and pacing. However, reflection does not alter attempts or create friction; it is the sole tactic from start to finish, never tested or complicated. The method is present and coherent but does not generate causal pressure or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path is named in the opening and closing and used at the apex pause. Moonlight filters through branches to illuminate the box's crack, a micro-setting detail that charges one visual beat. The path itself supplies no resource, obstacle, or choice that alters the firefighter's options—he walks up, pauses, and walks down without the terrain affecting his stance. Present in setup and closure; contributes atmosphere but not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"During the slow dance of celestial bodies" is invoked twice as poetic framing ("the stars wheeled slowly," "slow, majestic turn of the cosmos," "The stars watched his descent"). It describes backdrop but does not tighten decisions or impose a temporal constraint. The timeframe is untracked and does not alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric metaphor for indifference rather than a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To translate pain into a universal language" is stated explicitly as the firefighter's motivation and repeated in varied forms ("translate his pain," "translate his own granite-hard grief"). It drives the reflective arc and frames the ending realization. However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted choice—no friction between wanting translation and fearing exposure, or between private grief and public meaning. The motivation is told and fulfilled through monologue without on-page cost or resistance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Hard softness" is named directly ("Hard softness defined him") and illustrated through juxtapositions: toughness vs. gentle skill, granite grief vs. fragile porcelain, searing loss vs. quiet beauty. The tone is coherent and modulates with the reflective deepening from ache to peace. However, it remains a single static mood—melancholic contemplation—rather than shifting under pressure. The final image repeats the established tone without a tonal turn or charge that reweights prior beats.</comment>
