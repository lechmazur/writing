<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to become "the voice of the unknown" is stated rather than enacted through contradictory impulses. Her interior reads as competent observer without genuine struggle or blind spots that complicate her choices. The sequence of descending, discovering, and accepting the fossil unfolds without visible cost or internal friction—she simply receives knowledge rather than forfeiting something to gain it. Embodied emotion is sparse; "fingers tingled" and equipment readings replace visceral reactions under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-adjacent but lacks because/therefore linkage; Maya's discovery of the fossil occurs through exploration rather than narrowed options or prior choices. Orientation anchors who and where by ~120 words, avoiding the penalty. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding her role), but cost is asserted ("renewed purpose") rather than demonstrated through a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice. The fossil "choosing" her and settling into her pouch reads as convenient bestowal, not earned agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The coastal cave network provides vivid spatial grounding—rope descent, seventh chamber, rock altar—and the darkness constrains movement. Thermal mapping equipment and the floating fossil charge the final chamber scene. However, sensory detail is unevenly distributed: the descent is vividly tactile, but the crucial discovery beat leans on the mystical phenomenon rather than embodied perception. The fossil's hover and the cave's role satisfy the micro-setting test by constraining access and shaping the reveal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the hibernation—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or tightening. Maya descends, finds the object, learns its message, and exits without a reversal or choice that narrows options. The fossil responds to her touch with visions, a passive reception rather than agency-driven escalation. No visible price is paid; the "hours" spent learning are summarized, and the retrieval occurs without cost or complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "transitional object" concept and the theme of bridging past/future are stated directly rather than arising from concrete particulars. The elm leaf fossil as guardian and teacher reads as symbolic convenience. The final image—fossil in her pouch, warmth as reminder—attempts resonance but relies on the declared metaphor rather than reweighting prior material. The piece avoids overt moralizing but substitutes thematic echo: "factually mystical" and "voice of the unknown" are prompt labels rather than emergent insights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Maya. Diction is mostly controlled, though "factually mystical phenomenon" and "transitional object" drift toward editorial labeling. Perceptual signature is present in heat-mapping and sensory sensitivity, but interior texture flattens under pressure—discovery moments lack rhythmic variation or compression. No dialogue to assess. Reflection dominates the middle third but anchors to present stimuli (equipment readings, visions) and avoids head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and rhythm supports pacing through the descent. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: "The fossil didn't answer... The fossil had chosen... The elm leaf fossil had been waiting..." creates a loop. Figurative density is low, but "defied gravity, hovering silently" and "threads" are stock rather than specific. Information density is adequate; no major scaffolding. Clarity and momentum are serviceable but without propulsive compression at peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The post-hibernation setting and sensory map maker offer initial freshness, but the central discovery—mystical object waits in cave for chosen one—follows template structure without transformation. "Factually mystical" attempts oxymoron but lands as contradiction rather than synthesis. The heat-mapping method is specific but underused in the climax, where visions replace the tool's tactical role. Emotional specificity is minimal; the arc could function unchanged with different names and props.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and makes the choice to descend and retrieve the fossil, but these are linear observations rather than constrained decisions. Her role as interpreter is stated in exposition and confirmed by the fossil's response, not tested through conflicting options. She appears in the closure but as recipient rather than agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil is introduced at midpoint (~50%), touched when it doubles in brightness, and returns in the closure when it "settled" in her pouch. Three beats: discovery, contact/vision, retrieval. Causal role is present—it delivers knowledge and accompanies her—but it does not narrow options or impose cost. Specificity (elm, fossil, floating) distinguishes it from generic artifacts.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Transitional objects" is named explicitly in exposition ("The elm leaf fossil was a transitional object") but does not constrain tactics or complicate choices. It functions as thematic label rather than pressure mechanism. The concept is closure-adjacent (bridging knowledge) but operates as explanation, not dramatized stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears once as descriptor for the floating phenomenon. The contradiction between "factual" and "mystical" is declared but not dramatized—no scene tests whether the fossil obeys rules or defies them with cost. Label-only mention without causal work or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Floating is central to the fossil's discovery and establishes its anomalous nature. It appears in the key beat (discovery) and charges the image when Maya questions it. However, the action does not create a turn—Maya approaches, touches, and retrieves without the float altering her options. Early signal, one strong beat, closure mention, but swappable with "glowing" or similar mystical marker.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is introduced early (thermal equipment, spectrum colors) and used during descent to detect imprints. In the climax, the equipment "registered" the fossil's heat and "told a story," but the visions bypass the method—contact delivers knowledge directly. Present across two beats (descent detection, fossil reading) but not the decisive means at closure. Functional but underutilized when it matters most.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The coastal cave network frames the entire action: descent, seventh chamber, and return. It provides access control (dangerous, few visitors) and houses the discovery. The setting's spiritual history and ancient rituals prime the fossil's significance. Appears in setup, middle exploration, and closure departure. Essential structure but does not alter Maya's tactics—she descends, finds, exits without environmental complication.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Post-hibernation timeframe is established in the opening and motivates Maya's early awakening and the civilization-rebuilding context. It underpins the mystery (what happened during sleep) but does not create time pressure or narrow her choices in the cave sequence. Present in setup and thematic closure but does not constrain the action beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To become the voice of the unknown" is stated in paragraph six and recurs in the final paragraphs as confirmed purpose. The motivation explains why Maya explores but is not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. She pursues it, achieves it, and exits with "renewed purpose"—linear fulfillment without friction. Told rather than tested.</comment>
