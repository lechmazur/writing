<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("to become visible to those who needed you most") is asserted but never tested through conflicting impulses in scene. The thirty-year backstory arrives as exposition rather than anchored memory that alters present choice. Interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("their calling to become visible guided them") rather than embodied contradiction. The final plan to "intervene" without "revealing their full existence" lacks visible cost or genuine foreclosure of options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when emerges piecemeal across the first 200+ words, creating drift (−0.4 penalty; Q3 capped at 7.0). The tape fragment discovery occurs past midpoint and the ending describes future intention rather than delivering on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The stated plan to place the fragment "through a series of small interventions" is told, not dramatized, leaving closure unclear. Drive lens reads hybrid-accumulative but never crystallizes into a legible before/after with cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pipe-chase setting and crawl-space architecture supply vivid micro-geography ("wedged between a copper water pipe and the plaster wall") and the power outage creates temporal pressure. However, the library itself remains generic—no room names, no spatial anchors beyond "east wall." The fragment's warmth and catalog number offer specificity, but the ending diffuses into vague future action rather than using the environment to constrain the final choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten knowledge—is signaled early but never tightens into a live dilemma with competing costs. The tape fragment arrives late (past midpoint) and the protagonist's plan to "lead the right person to discover it" defers agency off the page. No on-page reversal narrows options; the "sapphire hush of dawn" arrival functions as a timer that expires without forcing a trade-off. Escalation remains conceptual rather than dramatized through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme of invisible guardianship and knowledge preservation emerges clearly through recurring imagery (shadows, hidden spaces, forgotten archives). However, the ending articulates the theme directly ("secret keeper, kindly methodical in their approach") rather than delivering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The fragment as bridge between "hidden world and the library's future" is told rather than shown through a concrete non-literal payoff. Subtext is present in the protagonist's solitary routine but the final paragraph moralizes instead of charging silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (tactile focus on pipes, darkness, catalog numbers). The phrase "to become visible to those who needed you most" slips into second person without clear motivation, creating brief distance wobble. Diction is controlled and purpose-driven ("sapphire hush," "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment") but the final paragraph's summary tone ("they were the library's secret keeper") diffuses the intimate focalization established earlier. No dialogue present; evaluation limited to narrative voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear throughout: "Their motivation, born from years of watching…" echoes "Their technical knowledge had made them custodian…"; multiple paragraphs open with "They had…" or "With…" creating rhythmic monotony (−0.6). The phrase "sense memory" appears three times without evolving meaning. Stock constructions like "flood of sense memory washed over them" and "With reverence, they removed the fragment" flatten momentum. Figurative language ("delicate as a butterfly wing," "highways through the building's infrastructure") is clear but the density of metaphor in descriptive beats occasionally slows propulsion without payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—secret library dweller as knowledge guardian—follows a familiar template (hidden caretaker preserving what others overlook) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 derivative premise adjustment). The tape fragment and preservation backstory add occupational texture but the emotional arc (solitary protector contemplating emergence) proceeds predictably. The power outage and engineer's great-granddaughter are convenient rather than inevitable, and the ending's promise of future revelation defers the bold choice that would elevate the concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The crawl space dweller is present throughout and makes the decision to retrieve and cache the fragment, but most action is routine movement rather than pressure-driven choice. The ending describes intention to intervene rather than showing a decisive turn. Present in setup, middle retrieval, and ending plan, but the final beat summarizes future action instead of dramatizing a choice that alters present options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ferromagnetic tape fragment appears past midpoint (around 50% mark, −0.3 late penalty), triggers sense memory, and is cached in the ending. It shapes two beats (discovery/memory flood and caching decision) and carries catalog specificity that makes it irreplaceable. However, the ending describes future placement rather than showing the fragment's consequence on the page, limiting closure participation to conceptual presence rather than causal action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sense memory is named three times and triggers the protagonist's flood of recollection when touching the fragment. However, it functions as a theme echo rather than a mechanism that changes on-page options or tactics. The memory recalls childhood smells and archive sounds but does not constrain or enable the present choice; it ornaments rather than drives causality.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" appears twice as a label and describes the protagonist's routine inspection of the tape. The trait is shown in careful cataloging but never tested against an opposing impulse or used to foreclose a faster, riskier option. Present in setup routine and middle inspection but does not create visible cost or enable a turn; largely decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Cache" appears in setup (morning routine preparation), middle (caching valuable information), and ending (caching the fragment with others). It establishes the protagonist's method but the final caching is part of routine rather than a climactic decision that redefines options. Functional and consistent but swappable with "store" or "hide" without structural change; the action does not narrow stakes or charge the closure image with new cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Uncovering in pipe chases is signaled early ("preferred method of travel") and the discovery of the tape fragment occurs in a pipe chase behind the east wall. The method supplies spatial specificity and enables the find, shaping one major beat. However, the mechanics (narrow passages, trailing fingers) are described rather than pressured; the method could be replaced with "searching hidden archive rooms" without altering closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn provides temporal and atmospheric frame throughout. Pre-dawn darkness and the power outage create "deeper shadows than usual" and "perfect sapphire hush," pressuring the protagonist's movement window. The setting supplies the pipe chases and hidden spaces essential to discovery. Dawn's approach functions as a time constraint that shapes the final caching decision, though the story summarizes future action rather than showing dawn's arrival force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The power outage is introduced in the opening and creates the "deeper shadows" that enable safer movement. However, the outage does not tighten decisions after setup; by midpoint it becomes static backdrop. The text does not track elapsed time or use the outage's end as a ticking constraint that alters tactics. Present in setup but underdeveloped in middle and absent from closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To become visible to those who need you" is stated early and reprised in the ending summary. The motivation explains the protagonist's preservation work and final plan to place the fragment. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants (visibility versus safety, immediate help versus long-term secrecy). The ending describes the desire without showing friction or cost tied to stepping from shadows; motivation remains assertion rather than lived dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears three times, anchoring the pre-dawn atmosphere and the protagonist's comfort in darkness. The tone is consistent and modulates slightly as dawn approaches ("enveloped them, deepening their resolve"). However, the phrase functions as decorative mood rather than charging the final image with reweighted pressure. Tone supports but does not constrain choice or reconfigure meaning at closure; stable but static.</comment>
