<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation ("map empathy onto action") reads as a theme claim rather than embodied want under pressure. Her shadow-peacekeeper abilities function as convenient tools with no visible cost or tradeoff: the crystal simply reconstitutes when she focuses, with no genuine struggle or failure. Internal contradiction is absent—she moves smoothly from challenge to success without any competing impulse or blind spot. The "weighted breath before reply" device appears three times as a stock phrase without dramatizing what specific doubt or fear she must overcome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Elena is and what immediate problem she faces doesn't anchor until ~180 words into the orchard scene. The closure unit (crystal reconstitution) occurs on the page, but the cost is conceptual only: "courageously anomalous" is asserted rather than felt as a social or relational price. Causality is threadbare: the mirrors are mentioned as having been visited "three times that week," but their glimpses never constrain her present tactics; the crystal simply reforms "as if pulled from between moments in time." The drive lens appears Causal by default but the because/therefore linkage is soft—motivation ("save their settlement from the coming storm") → method (shadow magic + mirror glimpses) → success, with no earned reversal or narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse, orchard, and ice floes are visually vivid but remain postcard elements: none constrain a choice or alter Elena's tactics. The crystal fragment's "sharp edges biting into her palm even through the leather" is concrete, yet the glove negates the physical cost and the fragment itself becomes passive once the reconstitution begins. Spatial choreography is coherent (orchard → lighthouse beam → ice below), but the setting does not pressure the outcome—Elena could perform the same magic in any location. The vintage shop mirrors are told-only ("she had been to the vintage shop three times") without on-page handling or sensory anchoring in the present scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("save their settlement from the coming storm") is declared but never tested—no obstacle or reversal complicates the reconstitution. Elena faces no genuine trade-off: she visualizes the pieces, the shadows respond, the crystal reforms in a smooth escalation without a narrowing of options or a visible price. The "elders' challenge" and "elders' skepticism" are mentioned twice as external pressure, but no elder appears on the page and no social cost is dramatized. Coincidence does not resolve (her magic does), but agency is passive—her hands "moved with practiced grace" and the crystal "began to grow" without a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme "map empathy onto action" is stated three times, including in the penultimate paragraph, rather than emerging from particulars. The crystal reconstitution functions as a literalized metaphor for "making broken things whole," but the connection to empathy is asserted, not dramatized—Elena's understanding of "the language of darkness" never shows her interpreting another's need or making a choice shaped by that understanding. The final image ("a testament to mapping empathy onto action") is a direct thematic statement rather than a resonant non-literal answer. No plausible counter-reading exists; the piece declares its meaning rather than inviting reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with the established voice: "the weighted breath before reply to the elders' challenge," "courageously anomalous act of reconstitution," and "some broken things could be made whole when one possessed the courage" read as essay phrasing rather than Elena's lived perception. The phrase "the weighted breath" recurs three times with identical construction, creating a template cadence. Psychic distance is consistent but the narrative certainty exceeds what Elena can know—"as if pulled from between moments in time" and "the quiet power of a shadow-laced peacekeeper" are narrator-assured rather than character-grounded. No dialogue appears; Elena is alone on the page.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "understanding into tangible results" / "empathy could indeed manifest as action, that understanding could transform the physical world"; "the crystal reconstituted" / "reconstitution"; "the weighted breath before reply" appears three times with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "Each reflective surface offered…" "Each reflection had shown…" "Each glimpse contributing…" Stock metaphors stack without fresh inflection: "like nets capturing fireflies," "like ink in water," "as if it had a mind of its own." Filter verbs ("she knew," "she pictured," "she focused") cluster in the reconstitution beat, dulling immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes rather than closes with image: "a testament to mapping empathy onto action" is a thesis statement, not a concrete ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—shadow-magic peacekeeper repairs a scrying crystal via vintage mirrors—assembles genre tokens (lighthouse keeper, magical artifact, elemental magic) without a non-obvious synthesis. The mirrors' mechanics are declared but never specified: what exactly did Elena see in each reflection, and how did those glimpses teach her the reconstitution method? The "courageous anomaly" framing and "map empathy onto action" thesis read as prompt echoes rather than lived particulars. The emotional arc (challenge → visualization → success) follows a convenience template with no transformation through specific detail or moral calculus. The final image (glowing crystal in hand, lighthouse beam, ice floes) is visually competent but not surprising—every setup pays off exactly as announced.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout and her decision to reconstitute the crystal is the story's single action, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, her choices do not create key turns—she encounters no obstacle, makes no tactical adjustment, and faces no cost for her shadow-peacekeeper abilities. The role is ornamental: "shadow-laced" functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than a trait that constrains or enables a beat. Her agency is passive: "her hands moved with practiced grace" and "the crystal began to grow" are narrator-driven outcomes, not dramatized decisions. The "peacekeeper" title is never tested by a conflict that requires peacekeeping.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment appears in setup (Elena clutches it, "its sharp edges biting into her palm"), development (she focuses energy on the shard), and payoff (the fragment reconstitutes into the whole crystal). It is handled on the page across three beats, satisfying the Object requirement for spaced use. However, its properties are static: the "soft, internal light" and "sharp edges" do not evolve or impose cost—Elena wears gloves, so the edges never actually wound. The fragment enables the central action (reconstitution) but does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off. The reconstituted crystal "glowing with the captured light of a thousand moments" reweights meaning only at the thematic level; no tactical or relational consequence follows from its completion.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is present as a label: Elena is "a courageous anomaly among the wardens" and performs "this courageously anomalous act of reconstitution." The concept does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—no scene dramatizes how her anomalous status creates friction with peers, limits her options, or charges the closure. The "elders' challenge" and "elders' skepticism" are mentioned but no elder appears, so the social cost of being an anomaly remains abstract. The adjective "courageous" is asserted twice without on-page evidence of fear overcome or risk accepted. The concept reads as thematic decoration rather than a force that alters choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" appears once as a label: "Elena closed her eyes and reached out with her calmly intuitive senses." The attribute does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost—her intuition smoothly guides the reconstitution without a moment where calmness must be chosen over urgency or where intuition leads her astray. No tradeoff exists: the shadows "always" comfort her "when she needed guidance," so the trait functions as reliable convenience. The attribute is mentioned in setup and implied at closure (she "gently, almost reverently" guides the threads), satisfying two gates, but it never forces a tactical adjustment or imposes a price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is the story's central action: signaled in setup ("she knew she must reconstitute the crystal"), developed across the middle third (she visualizes the pieces, guides the shadowy threads, the crystal begins to grow), and completed at closure ("the crystal reconstituted until it floated before her, whole and complete"). The action is specific and irreplaceable—substituting "repair" or "restore" would require altering the mystical mechanics. However, the reconstitution does not face a reversal or force a visible cost on the page—Elena succeeds in a smooth escalation without sacrifice, error, or tactical pivot. Major turns trace to this action (it is the story's sole plot event), but the action itself is not pressured by competing options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The method "via glimpses in vintage store mirrors" is signaled in setup ("Elena had discovered a method that defied convention: via glimpses in vintage store mirrors") and referenced in development ("she had been to the vintage shop three times that week," listing three mirrors and their properties). However, the mechanics are summary-only: the text never shows what Elena saw in the mirrors or how those glimpses taught her the reconstitution technique. At closure, she "guided the shadowy threads that connected her to the images within the vintage store mirrors," but this is asserted connection, not dramatized use—the mirrors are invoked but not handled or tested. The method does not constrain her present attempt; she could succeed without referencing them in the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes" is anchored in the opening paragraph and recurs across beats: Elena moves among the apple trees, the lighthouse beam sweeps the scene, the ice floes groan below. Setup, development, and payoff gates are satisfied. However, the setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical constraint—none of its elements (orchard, lighthouse, ice) pressures Elena's choices or supplies a resource that affects the outcome. The "trees would grow hard as the ice itself" during winters is vivid but inert; the present action occurs at night with no winter-hardness in play. The ice floes "groaned as the tide shifted, matching the ancient rhythm of the peacekeepers' magic," but this is poetic correspondence, not causal participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"During the weighted breath before reply" appears three times: in the premise paragraph, at the midpoint decision ("during the weighted breath before the final reply"), and near closure ("the weighted breath had been exhaled"). The timeframe is metaphorical rather than a live clock—no urgency derives from it, and Elena's actions are not compressed or shaped by countdown pressure. The phrase functions as stylistic refrain, not tactical constraint. The "coming storm" is mentioned as future threat but never approaches on the page, so the timeframe does not tighten decisions. The element is present in setup and closure but does not alter tactics or narrow options in between.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To map empathy onto action" is stated explicitly as Elena's motivation ("her motivation was simple yet profound: to map empathy onto action") and echoed at closure ("a testament to mapping empathy onto action"). The motivation is present in setup and payoff but is not dramatized through choice—no beat shows Elena interpreting another's need, making a trade-off between empathy and pragmatism, or confronting friction between her understanding and her people's expectations. The "elders' skepticism" is mentioned but no elder appears, so the empathy claim remains abstract. The desire is told rather than enacted, and no cost (time, energy, relationship) is visible on the page. The motivation reads as thematic claim rather than lived stake.</comment>
