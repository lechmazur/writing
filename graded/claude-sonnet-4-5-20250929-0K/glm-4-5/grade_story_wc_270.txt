<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's telepathy with plants is label-only for most beats; the ferns "hum approval" and "guide" but never impose a visible cost or force a contradictory choice. Her final decision to bring the embryo into the light feels unearned—no dramatized struggle between honoring heritage and her vision appears on the page. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("implanted destiny," "evolve tradition with intent") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "insurgent grandmother" trait exists as backstory decoration without shaping a single micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: attempted Causal, but linkage is weak. The kite appears coincidentally, the script decodes off-page in summary ("For three days, Maya worked"), and the chamber opens with spoken words—no on-page obstacle or reversal tests her agency. Closure reads as Decisive Change (embryo retrieved), but the cost is asserted thematically ("to honor both her heritage and her vision") rather than felt through forfeited paths or visible sacrifice. Orientation is clear early. The three-day decoding montage compresses the pivotal turn into summary, flattening causality at the story's hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Volcanic rock, steam, obsidian chamber, and hot springs anchor the setting with sensory specificity. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Maya moves freely through caverns without navigating hazards, and the geothermal power remains thematic backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The kite and amber embryo are props without micro-setting function. Spatial choreography is clear but static; the reconstruction village exists only as mentioned context.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("evolve tradition") is declared but never tested on the page. No council member challenges Maya, no choice forces a trade-off between heritage and progress, and the embryo unlocks without complication. The kite discovery is coincidental; the decoding happens off-page; the chamber opens on command. One micro-deepening occurs when she cross-references texts, but it imposes no cost and alters no tactic. Agency is passive receipt of plant guidance rather than decision under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("evolve tradition with intent") is stated directly multiple times rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The final paragraph moralizes: "to honor both her heritage and her vision" and "a deliberate step toward what could be." The plants, kite, and embryo function as convenient symbols rather than particulars that force moral calculus. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the story presents a thesis and illustrates it without friction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual signature is consistent (Maya notices volcanic energy, plant whispers, cryptic script). However, diction drifts into prompt-like abstraction ("implanted destiny," "evolve tradition with intent," "map of consciousness itself") that no seventy-three-year-old insurgent would articulate mid-crisis. The single line of dialogue—"The script is a map... A map of consciousness itself"—reads as thematic summary rather than embodied speech. Psychic distance is controlled, but voice lacks idiosyncrasy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "Maya had accidentally discovered... Maya had always dismissed... Maya understood... Maya smiled." Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening (volcanic rock energy / hot springs solace, telepathy / visions, destiny awakened / prophecies glimpsed). Stock metaphors ("ancient energy pulse," "burning in her mind") and therapy-speak ("implanted destiny," "evolve tradition with intent") flatten peak beats. The three-day decoding montage is pure summary. Sentence openings repeat "Maya [verb]" or "The [noun]" across most paragraphs. Figurative language is sparse, but what appears is generic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise (telepathic grandmother decodes kite to unseal mystical embryo during reconstruction) assembles five prompt elements without synthesis. The insurgent stance, volcanic setting, and cryptic script remain decorative; none transforms the others. Emotional arc (frustration → discovery → fulfillment) is template-generic. The kite's coincidental arrival and the plants' convenient guidance remove friction. No bold risk or fresh angle; the story executes a checklist.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout but makes no key turn-driving choice. She receives plant guidance, catches a falling kite, decodes off-page, speaks ancient words, and retrieves the embryo—all without on-page conflict or cost. Her "insurgent" label is backstory; no council opposition appears. Swappable with any telepathic decoder.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Embryo appears in paragraph 6 (setup), glows in paragraph 19 (middle signal), floats into Maya's hands in paragraph 23, and is held at closure. However, it imposes no cost and enables no choice—Maya simply retrieves it after decoding. Its "purpose" is told thematically rather than demonstrated. Handles in two beats (glow, retrieval) but remains passive object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Implanted destiny" is mentioned twice as theme (paragraphs 7, 27) but never shapes an on-page stake or tactic. Maya does not struggle with or resist this destiny; she accepts and fulfills it without friction. Could be removed with minor edits to thematic language. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Telepathy appears in paragraphs 4, 5, 12, 16, 18, 20, 26—early and recurrent. It guides Maya to the cave and confirms the kite's importance, enabling two middle beats. However, it imposes no cost (no drain, no misunderstanding, no unwanted intrusion) and does not constrain a choice. The plants always agree and assist. Functional but one-directional; no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unsealing occurs in paragraph 22 and directly enables closure (embryo retrieval). Setup exists (chamber introduced paragraph 10, key sought paragraph 11). However, the act itself is frictionless—Maya speaks words and the chamber cracks open. No failed attempt, no cost, no alternative considered. Central to the ending but mechanically executed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Kite appears in paragraph 13 (past midpoint, −0.3), is decoded across paragraphs 17–19 (off-page summary, −0.5), and the decoded message enables the unsealing in paragraph 22. It shapes two beats (discovery, unsealing) and contributes to closure. However, decoding is summarized ("For three days, Maya worked") rather than dramatized, and the kite could be replaced with any cryptic artifact. Functional but late and generic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Hot springs appear in paragraph 2 (setup), provide the cave location (paragraph 5), and frame the final descent (paragraph 21). Geothermal power is mentioned but never used. The volcanic setting supplies atmosphere and the obsidian chamber but does not constrain Maya's movement or alter a tactic. Present in three beats but postcard-descriptive; no micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Reconstruction" is mentioned in paragraphs 2, 12, 25, 27 as thematic backdrop but never tightens a decision. No clock, no urgency, no competing demand on Maya's time. The three-day decoding happens off-page without consequence. Time is vague and untethered to tactics. Ornamental context.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Evolve tradition with intent" is stated in paragraphs 9, 24, 27 but never dramatized as conflicted choice. Maya does not face a council elder, does not forfeit a relationship, does not choose between heritage and innovation on the page. The motivation is told thematically and fulfilled without friction. Label-only desire; no cost.</comment>
