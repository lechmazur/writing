<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mage's motivation is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. His "earnestly naive" belief and "lukewarm powers" are label-only traits that never constrain a visible choice with cost. The transformation from lukewarm to warming at the end is asserted but not earned through prior struggle or foreclosed options. Interior experience remains generic ("obsession," "devotion") without character-particular embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The closure unit—bell rebuilt, balance restored—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual only and not viscerally felt; the mage simply succeeds without a visible price or foreclosed path. The drive lens reads as Causal (problem → solution), but the link between understanding dripping rates and reconstructing the bell with "intention" is asserted rather than dramatized with tactical narrowing. The final image of warming powers and returning fish offers mild resonance but lacks the undeniable pressure required for RR or the felt sacrifice required for DC.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct and dawn light are vivid and return at closure, charging the final image. However, the viaduct functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain the mage's choices or supply tactical resources that alter his approach. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the dripping water serves as a recurring sensory anchor, but the setting remains postcard-picturesque rather than exerting pressure on the action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance—is signaled early. However, the mage's work proceeds without meaningful reversal, trade-off, or narrowing of options; he simply kneels, focuses, and succeeds. The "impossible but plausible" method is named but not tested under pressure. No visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies the resolution; luck and assertion replace protagonist agency at the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (lukewarm as sufficient, devotion over power) emerges from the premise and final image. The bell's tone "neither too hot nor too cold" and the closing line about the lukewarm having their place offer a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the insight reads as stated platitude ("most plausible impossibility is simply believing") rather than earned from specific struggle. The thematic echo in the final paragraph—"even the lukewarm have their place"—borders on moralizing and lowers resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the mage; no head-hopping. The prose carries a faint fairy-tale register ("fallen giant," "liquid sky," "settling stars") that is consistent but lacks a character-particular perceptual signature. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated or generic phrasing ("cosmic imbalance," "profound quiet") that feels authored rather than filtered through the mage's idiom. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is generally maintained, but several paraphrase loops and stock metaphors appear: "fractured bronze ship's bell that lay at his feet like a fallen giant," "casting the once-broken ship's bell anew," "the profound quiet" followed by "this profound quiet." Template cadence in the final two paragraphs ("As the sun finished... the mage walked away... he felt for the first time") and thesaurus-itis ("earnestly naive," "brittle devotion" recur as labels). Figurative density in the climax ("sound like settling stars," "liquid sky") muddies rather than sharpens the image. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template runs; −0.3 for stock metaphor strings.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—underdog mage repairs cosmic balance through humble devotion—is a familiar template (underestimated hero, broken artifact, mystical restoration). The "lukewarm" angle offers mild freshness, but the emotional and plot arc could swap names and settings without structural change. The dripping-water mechanism is mentioned but not developed into a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The final wisdom ("believing in something enough to see it through") reads as platitude rather than earned originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lukewarm mage is present throughout and makes the key decision to rebuild the bell. However, his choices do not create on-page turns; he proceeds from broken bell to obsession to success without reversal or tactical shift. Setup gate met; development gate weak (no mid-story choice that narrows options); payoff gate met (he completes the rebuild). Causal pressure is low; the element is functional but not indispensable. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, minus swappability −0.6, minus summary-only key action −0.5 = base ~5.0, round to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken ship's bell appears in the opening, is handled/observed in the middle ("focusing... on the rhythm"), and is rebuilt/rings at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. It drives two beats (initial problem, final solution) and is present in the ending. However, the bell's mechanics are told rather than shown, and the rebuild happens off-camera ("worked tirelessly... casting... anew"). Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, minus summary-only rebuild −0.6, minus replaceable mechanics −0.3 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Brittle devotion is mentioned three times as a phrase but never constrains an on-page choice or alters tactics. It functions as thematic label rather than shaping stakes. Setup gate met (mentioned early); development and payoff gates missed (no middle choice tied to it, final image does not hinge on it). Score: early signal +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, label-only −0.3, no closure participation cap at 2.8, micro adjustment for thematic presence +0.4 = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Earnestly naive appears once as a label in paragraph 2 and is echoed in the final paragraph. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost; the mage's belief is asserted but not tested. Setup gate met; development and payoff gates missed. Score: early signal +0.3, ornamental use −0.7, label-only −0.3, no closure participation cap at 2.8, round to 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rebuild is the story's central action: the mage's goal from the start, the method occupies the middle, and the completed bell rings at closure. All three gates met. The action drives escalation and shapes the ending. However, the rebuild itself is summarized ("worked tirelessly... casting... anew") rather than dramatized with tactical choices. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.5, minus summary-only execution −0.7, minus swappability with generic repair −0.4 = ~7.4, capped slightly for lack of specificity → 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Understanding dripping rates is introduced in paragraph 3 as the mage's obsession and method. Setup gate met; development gate weak (rates are observed but do not narrow options); payoff gate met (rates "had been counting down to this moment"). It appears in two beats and is mentioned at closure, but the mechanics remain opaque—how dripping rates enable the rebuild is asserted, not shown. Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, minus opacity/swappability −0.8, minus summary-only use −0.6 = ~4.9, adjusted down for lack of causal specificity → 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sapphire viaduct at dawn is anchored early, returns in the middle ("smooth sapphire stones"), and charges the final image ("liquid sky"). All three gates met. It provides a vivid backdrop and the dripping water, but it does not constrain the mage's choices or supply tactical resources. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, minus postcard description −0.7, minus no tactical constraint −0.5 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>After the last fish is caught (three moons ago) is mentioned early as backstory and echoed in the final paragraph. Setup gate met; development gate missed (time does not tighten mid-story decisions); payoff gate weak (fish return but the timeframe itself is not reweighted). It establishes stakes but does not create live pressure. Score: early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.6, minus vague tracking −0.5, minus no tactical constraint −0.7, no development cap at 3.4, micro adjustment for thematic callback +0.2 = 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>To right a cosmic imbalance is stated as the mage's goal in paragraph 2 and drives the rebuild action. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (desire is not tested or conflicted in a middle choice). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction between want and cost. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus told-only friction −0.7, minus no visible trade-off −0.4 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Plausible impossibility is named once ("impossible but plausible weaving") and echoed in the final paragraph. The tone—fairy-tale wonder mixed with concrete detail—is consistent and modulates slightly at the climax (wonder intensifies). Setup gate met; development gate weak (tone does not shift under pressure); payoff gate met (final line crystallizes the tone). Score: early signal +0.5, coherent modulation +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4, minus static middle −0.4, minus label-only introduction −0.3 = ~6.7, adjusted down for thematic echo rather than tonal charge → 6.1.</comment>
