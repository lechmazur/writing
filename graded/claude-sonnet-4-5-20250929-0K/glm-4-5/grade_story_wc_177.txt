<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's condition is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Her interior reads as abstract philosophical musing ("Why do some paths choose their walkers?") without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The breakthrough moment—achieving presence—is asserted through summary ("began to transcend her condition") rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. The character exists primarily as a vehicle for the concept rather than a person making choices that narrow options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation establishes who/where/when by paragraph two, avoiding the test penalty. The story follows an accumulative/lyric lens through dream-state fragments, but the closure—Elara achieving tri-temporal presence—is told in summary rather than shown through a concrete image or action with visible cost. The phrase "boundaries between past, present, and future dissolving like sugar in water" is metaphorical assertion, not dramatized closure. No meaningful tightening or choice forecloses a path; the protagonist simply achieves what she sought without obstacle or price made legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest establish atmosphere but function as backdrop rather than constraint. The storm amplifies her ability without dramatized mechanics or tactical cost. Spatial choreography is vague—wafer seal positions, symbol circles, and bunker layout remain abstract. The micro-setting (body, seal, symbols) does not constrain choice or charge the final image; sunlight filtering through vines is decorative rather than functional. Setting detail serves concept illustration over scene pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—bridging past-sight and future-sight to experience present—is signaled early but never tested. No obstacle complicates the ritual; the storm simply "intensifies" in parallel to her success. The protagonist's agency is passive reception rather than decision under pressure. The resolution is handed to her through the dream state without visible cost, trade-off, or path foreclosed. The understanding arrives as epiphany-by-assertion ("realized," "began to transcend") rather than through a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of paths choosing walkers emerges clearly but is stated directly in the opening question and final thought rather than earned through particulars. The wafer seal as "map of possibilities" is told, not shown through how it constrains or enables choices. The piece concludes with explicit thesis: "walkers also choose their paths, and in that reciprocal relationship lies the true nature of destiny"—a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure. The breakthrough moment offers philosophical summary rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material without stating the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but trends toward abstract philosophical register ("transcend her limitations," "dynamic interplay between fate and free will") that distances rather than grounds. The perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—observations could belong to any mystic protagonist. Psychic distance stays far throughout, preventing embodied immediacy. "Precisely playful" as a trait appears in action descriptions but reads as authorial annotation rather than emerging from her choices or speech patterns.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear frequently: paragraphs 7 and 13 both describe her condition as seeing only past/future, never present. Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs with identical "The [noun]" or "As [noun]" sentence stems. Stock metaphors ("dissolving like sugar in water," "tiny spirits celebrating") replace concrete imagery at peak beats. Filter verbs ("seemed to breathe," "began to transcend") stack in the closure sequence, dulling immediacy. Information density is low—multiple sentences restate the storm/consciousness link without advancing pressure. The final third contains scaffold phrasing and synonym churn ("precisely playful" repeated without evolving function), triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a protagonist who sees only past and future seeking to experience the present—is a familiar mystical-quest template executed without transformation. The storm-as-catalyst, ritual circle, and dream-state breakthrough follow predictable beats. "Precisely playful" as an attribute is asserted but never materialized in unexpected choices or tactics. The wafer seal and decaying directive could be swapped with any mystical artifact/text without altering the arc. The resolution offers no surprising synthesis or non-obvious angle; the discovery that "paths are responsive" is stated rather than earned through a specific, irreplaceable turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara's foresight/hindsight condition is present throughout but functions as setting/constraint rather than driving choices. She observes and reflects on her state but does not make decisions that alter tactics based on this specific perceptual mode. The condition is told repeatedly but never shown constraining a live choice with cost. No key turn traces to how she navigates dual temporality; the breakthrough is asserted, not earned through her using the condition to solve a problem it helped create.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The wafer seal appears in three beats: discovery (paragraph 3), tracing its patterns (paragraph 5), and placement in the ritual circle (paragraph 10). However, its function remains static—decorative object that "glows" in the dream without mechanical consequence. The seal does not constrain choices, enable tactics, or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Its "intricate patterns" are mentioned but never specified or used. Swappable with any mystical artifact. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The decaying directive appears in paragraphs 4, 12, and 18, guiding her to the location and then making "perfect sense" in the dream as a "map of possibilities." It frames the quest but does not shape on-page tactics or constrain choices. The directive's content is never specified, making its "perfect sense" moment unverifiable. It functions as backstory prompt rather than live pressure. The final mention (paragraph 18) notes its purpose is "fulfilled" but this occurs off-stage in summary. Functional setup but replaceable development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Precisely playful" appears as a label in paragraphs 5 and 18 describing her movements and understanding, but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait does not create a trade-off, complicate a choice, or differentiate her tactics from any other character's approach. It reads as authorial annotation rather than embodied characteristic. No beat depends on this specific quality; removing it would not alter the plot or stakes. Label-only mention without functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Transcend" is the stated goal (paragraph 8) and claimed achievement (paragraphs 15–16), shaping the dominant stake. However, the action itself is told in summary ("began to transcend her condition," "boundaries...dissolving") rather than dramatized through concrete steps with cost. The transcendence does not redefine options through a visible choice; it simply happens during the dream state. Integral to the concept but executed as assertion rather than causal turn. Shapes one key moment (the breakthrough) but remains abstract rather than irreplaceable in mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Interpreted dreams as method is signaled in paragraph 9 and executed in paragraphs 11–14 when she enters the dream state. The mechanics are vague—"fragments" led her to the method, and the storm "amplifies" without clear how. In the dream, the seal glows and the directive makes sense, but these are passive receptions rather than active interpretation choices. The method shapes the middle sequence but lacks specificity: any meditative/trance state could serve the same function. Functional presence across two gates (setup, development) but swappable mechanics trend mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The vine-draped bunker in rewilded forest is established early (paragraph 2) and provides atmosphere, but does not constrain choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The vines filter sunlight at the end (paragraph 17), a decorative detail without tactical consequence. The bunker's "walls seemed to breathe" (paragraph 11) is metaphorical rather than physical pressure. Setting functions as backdrop for the ritual rather than shaping how she must approach the problem. Present in setup and closure image but ornamental in both, never altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The approaching storm is signaled in paragraph 3, amplifies her ability (paragraph 8), intensifies during the dream (paragraph 13), and passes by the ending (paragraph 17). It provides a ticking clock and heightens atmosphere, but does not tighten decisions—Elara simply waits for it, performs the ritual, and succeeds. No moment shows her adjusting tactics because the storm is early/late or stronger/weaker than expected. The timeframe shapes the ritual's timing but not the protagonist's choices under pressure. Functional across all three gates but lacks causal grip on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "why some paths choose their walkers" is stated directly (paragraph 6), drives her quest to the bunker, and is answered in the final thought (paragraph 19). However, the want is never conflicted on the page—no moment shows her hesitating, weighing costs, or fearing the answer. The desire is told as backstory ("had consumed half her life") rather than dramatized through a choice where pursuing it forecloses another path. The motivation frames the stakes but lacks friction between want and cost. Present in setup and closure but told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" as tone is attempted through juxtaposition: mystical elements (foresight, dream-state transcendence) against physical decay (crumbling concrete, fading words, "ethereal grit...settling into her bones" in paragraph 11). However, the tone remains static—neither aspect intensifies under pressure or modulates to charge the closure. The ending resolves to pure ethereal (sunlight, dust motes as "tiny spirits") without grit's friction. Tone is coherent but does not tighten with escalation or reweight the final image through its duality. Functional presence without dynamic use.</comment>
