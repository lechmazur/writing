<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established (brother's disappearance, gifts surfaced after), but her interior life reads as summary rather than embodied contradiction. The claustrophobia is told and then dismissed without visible cost shaping her moves. Peak moments rely on recited Codex lines and gesture ("hand outstretched") rather than micro-choices that reveal competing impulses under pressure. The final choice to return tomorrow feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear by the end of the first paragraph (who, where). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers atmosphere, fragments of backstory, and ritual gestures toward a final image of sacred silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara completes the ritual and commits to return—but the cost is asserted ("claustrophobia had subsided," "profound sense of purpose") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible price. The tidal window provides a structural constraint, yet no on-page moment dramatizes what she risks or loses by staying.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The facility is vividly rendered (salt-stained concrete, rusted cabinet, concrete cylinder), and the tidal window constrains the mission clock. The Codex and the undersea cables anchor the ritual space. However, the setting does not alter Elara's tactics or constrain a choice—she moves through the space as planned, and no environmental friction forces adaptation. The final image (waves, cliffs, sacred silence) charges the ending but remains lyric backdrop rather than a micro-setting element that shapes action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early: guide shadows through phase transitions before the tide returns. The tidal clock provides urgency, and the piece mentions "seven shadows that night," but the guiding process is summarized in a single sentence without on-page friction or a visible cost that narrows options. The "crashing hush" and the closing of the Codex suggest completion, but no reversal or tightening forces Elara to trade one option for another. Escalation reads as atmospheric density rather than pressure that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: standing by the unremembered, the cost of gifts, the liminal space between tides. The final image ("sacred silence between") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. However, the piece edges toward thematic declaration ("her motivation to stand by the unremembered had cost her friends and career") and the Codex recitation ("Return to what you were, or continue to what comes next") reads as prompt-like articulation of the story's thesis. Subtext in gesture and image is present but not fully trusted to carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited. The prose has texture ("damp air licked," "fibrous veins pulsing"), but perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—Elara's noticing does not reflect spelunker expertise or psychic sensitivity in specific, idiosyncratic ways. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("profound sense of purpose," "sacred silence") in a way that feels authorial rather than voice-motivated. The single line of dialogue ("Follow me") is functional but offers no subtext or character-specific idiom. Filter verbs ("she sensed," "she had come to anticipate") appear frequently without voice payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates: nine consecutive paragraphs in the middle third begin with "The" or a noun subject, flattening rhythm. Paraphrase loops recur ("phase transitions" appears six times; "undersea cables" five times without evolving meaning). Stock metaphors ("tired giant," "fibrous veins," "sacred silence") accumulate without fresh inflection. Information density is low—scaffolding like "Tonight's mission was one of return" and "This was the crashing hush she had come to anticipate" tell rather than advance. The final third sustains momentum better, but artifacts in the middle third measurably dull propulsion. Applying −0.6 for template cadence, −0.3 for paraphrase loops, and −0.3 for stock phrasing totaling −1.2, plus minor filter-verb stacking.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of claustrophobic spelunker, psychic ability, undersea cables as conduits for the dead, and tidal timing offers conceptual freshness. However, execution leans on familiar genre furniture: the lone guide with a tragic past, the abandoned facility, the ancient Codex, the mysterious predecessor (Dr. Thorne). Emotional specificity is thin—Elara's brother and lost career are told rather than dramatized through memory friction. The tidal constraint and the cable network are inventive but underused; they function as backdrop rather than shaping unique tactical choices. Transformation test: the arc (isolation, ritual, recommitment) would survive intact with different proper nouns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role (guide shadows, wield Codex, endure claustrophobia) is established early. However, her choices are minimal: she descends, opens the Codex, recites, extends her hand, and departs. No on-page moment shows her deciding between competing options or adapting tactics under pressure. The work happens to her or around her rather than through contested agency. Present by setup, mentioned in development, implied at closure, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Codex appears in four distinct beats: withdrawal from pack, gold flecks glow in response to cables, symbols sketched, and the sigh as it closes. Early signal is strong. It enables the ritual (gold flecks respond to electromagnetic field, pages contain instructions) and brackets the mission. However, the Codex is not contested or constrained—it functions as a prop that works as designed. The closing sigh charges the final image but does not reweight prior meaning. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is functional but passive. Swappability is moderate—any magical text could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Undersea cables are seeded early ("monitored undersea cables," "fibrous veins"), explained in the middle third (psychic energy travels through cables during tidal conditions), and implicit at closure (shadows depart "through the ocean floor, traveling through the network of cables"). The concept shapes the facility's purpose and the tidal timing constraint. However, the cables remain backdrop—they do not force a choice, create friction, or impose a visible cost. The mechanics (electromagnetic field triggers Codex glow, cables carry shadows) are told rather than tested. All three gates present but causal pressure is moderate; the concept frames the world without altering Elara's tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute is introduced in paragraph 4 ("she alone had developed the ability to track invisible things") and tied to her brother's disappearance. The gift enables her to sense the shadows gathering and to perceive the first whisper. However, the tracking is asserted rather than dramatized—no moment shows her using the ability under constraint, choosing which shadow to follow, or paying a cost (fatigue, sensory overload) for maintaining focus. Setup and development are present as labels; closure linkage is implied but not active. Swappable with "psychic sensitivity" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Return is signaled early ("Tonight's mission was one of return"), contextualized in the middle ("she would return, always to stand by the unremembered"), and enacted at closure ("Tomorrow she would return"). The action defines Elara's purpose and brackets the narrative—she completes one cycle and commits to the next. The ending's charge depends on this commitment ("until her own time came to be guided through the transitions"). However, the return is not contested; no on-page friction forces her to choose return over departure. Causal role in setup and closure is strong; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Two gates firmly met, third (middle choice constrained by return) is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Phase transitions appear in the title concept, are explained midway ("psychic energy could travel through undersea cables during specific tidal conditions," "Beyond countless phase transitions, the unremembered waited"), recited from the Codex, and enacted: "Elara guided seven shadows that night, each through their own phase transitions." The means shapes the ritual's structure and ties to the tidal window. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—no beat demonstrates how a transition succeeds or fails, what Elara must do differently for each shadow, or what cost she pays when guiding. Setup and payoff present; middle development is summary. Functional but largely ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility is introduced in the opening line, anchors spatial choreography (curved stairwell, central monitoring room, rusted cabinet, concrete cylinder), and provides the access point to the cables. The facility's history (Great Quake of '68, Dr. Thorne's disappearance) adds texture, and the tidal threat creates urgency ("Thirty minutes remained until the tide returned, claiming this portal"). The entrance is reclaimed by tide at closure, completing the cycle. The facility constrains the mission window and supplies the ritual space. Three gates met; causal pressure is moderate—setting shapes when and where but not how Elara adapts tactics. Irreplaceability is high (the cables and tidal access are unique to this location).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tidal timeframe is seeded early ("the gap between tides when the connection was strongest," "forty-two minutes between this tide's retreat and the next's advance"), tracked in the middle ("Thirty minutes remained"), and lands at closure ("just as the tide began to creep up the rocky shore, reclaiming the entrance for another cycle"). The clock tightens the mission and brackets the narrative. However, the time constraint does not force Elara to make a trade-off or alter her approach—she completes the ritual within the window as planned. All three gates present; causal pressure is moderate. The timeframe functions as a structural frame rather than a tactical friction that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Standing by the unremembered is declared early (paragraph 4: "she alone could still sense his presence"), contextualized (paragraph 20: "Her motivation to stand by the unremembered had cost her friends and career"), enacted in the ritual, and reaffirmed at closure ("always to stand by the unremembered until her own time came"). The motivation drives the mission and charges the ending. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page moment shows Elara choosing this duty over a competing want or paying a visible cost in the present scene. The friction (lost friends, career) is summary. Setup and closure strong; middle development is thematic assertion without conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Crashing hush is introduced as "the crashing hush she had come to anticipate—the moment when worlds nearly collided without touching," recurs when "The crashing hush intensified, waves reducing the facility's foundations to trembling stone," and closes the piece: "her heart knew only the sacred silence between." The tone is coherent and modulates with the ritual's progression from anticipation to intensity to resolution. The final image depends on this tonal register. However, the phrase itself is somewhat forced ("crashing hush" as oxymoron) and the effect leans decorative in the middle mentions. Setup, development, and payoff all present; tone charges the ending but does not constrain a choice. Specificity is moderate—"liminal quiet" or "threshold silence" could substitute with minor tonal shift.</comment>
