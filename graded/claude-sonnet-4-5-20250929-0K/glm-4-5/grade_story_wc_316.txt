<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's ego-death survivor status is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her "slice through pretense" skill is asserted but never shown making a difficult choice with visible cost. The final shift from numb to purposeful reads as declared epiphany rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("hollow," "numb," "new purpose") instead of embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is severely delayed: who Maya is, where the dojo floats, and what "rewrite of history" means remain abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure unit—Maya finding purpose as a "bridge between opposites"—is asserted in the penultimate paragraph without on-page cost or a legible before/after in her options. The "vivify" action succeeds because the text declares it does ("the jar glowed"), not because prior causality narrows her choices or forecloses a path. Drive lens is ambiguous: the story gestures at Causal (Maya channels vitality) but resolves via summary statement, undermining closure validity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and brain-in-jar are vivid images, but the dojo functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraining choice. Spatial choreography is weak: Maya "stood at the edge," then "approached the jar," with no legible distance or obstacle. The "shimmer in the sky" and "rewrite of history" remain abstract; no sensory hierarchy filters these through Maya's professional or personal priorities. The brain's glow is generic; the jar does not shape tactics or charge the final image beyond declaration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the duplicate consciousness has rights—is declared but never tested through Maya's on-page choices. The "vivify" task is set up as impossible, yet Maya succeeds in a single beat without visible trade-off or failed attempt. No tightening or deepening narrows her options; the history rewrite creates ambient urgency without altering her tactics. Coincidence (the jar glows because she "allowed herself to feel") resolves the conflict, violating agency requirements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of "complementary opposites" and duplicate consciousness rights is stated rather than dramatized through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a future where duplicates could be individuals too, where consciousness was not zero-sum." No recurring image reweights prior material; the brain's awakening is asserted, not shown through evolving perception or micro-choice. The "bridge between opposites" conclusion reads as prompt echo rather than earned insight from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds, but psychic distance wavers: "she knew the only method that might work" tells what Maya knows without showing discovery. Perceptual signature is weak; her "slice through pretense" skill is described but never filters on-page observation. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("fundamental dualities that underpinned reality itself") that exceeds the POV's voice under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn across adjacent sentences: "she had been running from since her ego's dissolution during the Great Unraveling two years prior, when she had witnessed the collapse of her former reality and self" restates the same content without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the middle: "She could see the lies… and unravel them… She placed her hands… She closed her eyes…" Figurative language clutters peak beats: "kaleidoscope of genuine emotion," "fortress against feeling," "bridge between opposites" stack without specificity. Filter-verb reliance ("she could see," "she realized") dulls immediacy. Multiple text artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalties and 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—consciousness custody battle resolved through complementary opposites—follows a template plot (impossible task succeeds through emotional breakthrough). The "ego death survivor" and "history rewriting itself" are stock sci-fi/fantasy elements without fresh synthesis. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the vivification succeeds because declared, not through established causal chains. Middle-ground hedging avoids bold stakes: the custody battle "continued beyond the dojo" without on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maya as ego-death survivor is present throughout but creates no key turns through her choices. Her survivor status is told context; decisions (approach jar, channel vitality, allow herself to feel) are linear steps without visible cost or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Brain in jar appears early (setup gate met), is central to the vivify action (development gate met), and glows in the closure beat (payoff gate met). However, its labeled "DUPLICATE" status does not constrain Maya's tactics; the jar is handled in one extended beat rather than evolving across distinct moves. Swappable with another "dormant consciousness" vessel with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Clone custody battle frames the scenario but does not shape on-page stakes. The conflict between megacorp and rebels is summarized exposition; Maya's task is to vivify, not to adjudicate ownership. The battle "continued beyond the dojo" after her action, suggesting it did not hinge on her choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is labeled as Maya's skill in the setup but never demonstrated. She does not unravel a lie or cut through a facade on the page; the trait is invoked to explain why rebels value her, not shown constraining or enabling a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Vivify" is the central action and shapes the dominant beat. Signaled early as the impossible task, executed in the climax, and resolved in the ending. However, the mechanics are vague (she "channeled her limited vitality" by feeling), and success is declared rather than earned through prior failed attempts or visible trade-off. Removing "vivify" would collapse the plot, but the action itself is summarized rather than dramatically unfolded.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Complementary opposites" is named explicitly ("emptiness and fullness, nothingness and being") in the climax beat but not signaled earlier or shown shaping Maya's attempts. The method is asserted as the reason for success without mechanics that constrain her tactics. It appears primarily as thematic decoration rather than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is described early but does not constrain choice or supply resources. It "trembled" during the rewrite, adding ambient urgency without altering Maya's actions. The setting is ornamental backdrop; replacing it with a grounded lab or temple would require only minor descriptive edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"History rewriting itself" is mentioned in the opening and climax as ambient pressure but does not impose a tracked deadline or force Maya to alter tactics. The temporal wave "threatened to erase everything" yet does not race Maya's action or create visible time-cost trade-offs. Functional as background urgency but not causally integrated.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is stated as Maya's inner conflict and referenced across beats ("allowing herself to feel again"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; her shift from numb to feeling occurs in a single declared moment ("she closed her eyes, allowing herself to feel") without prior friction or cost. The motivation frames the arc but does not drive on-page choice-pressure.</comment>
