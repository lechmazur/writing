<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Anu remains largely passive through most of the narrative, observing rather than making meaningful choices under pressure. His motivations are told ("encrypted devotion," "frugal nature") rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The climactic moment—pressing hands to the tile—arrives without prior internal conflict or visible cost that would make the transformation earned. Interiority relies heavily on exposition and label-speak ("empirically ironic," "dusky harmony") rather than embodied thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late and remain vague: the exact historical moment, spatial layout, and immediate stakes don't cohere until well past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The ending offers a decisive change (Anu transforms, gains marks), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed on the page. Causality is weak: the tile "begins rearranging" and lifts without prior agency from Anu; the climax feels coincidental rather than earned by protagonist action. Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into passive witnessing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The Babylonian palace setting provides atmospheric detail (clay tablets, ziggurats, celestial maps) but remains largely decorative postcard description. Spatial choreography is unclear—where exactly is Anu within the palace-observatory, and how do objects like the tile, candle, and papyrus relate physically? The magic square tile does constrain the final beat (hovering, unfolding), lifting the score slightly, but most environmental details do not alter tactics or choices. Sensory hierarchy and POV-filtered perception are absent; details read generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unsealing the tile's secret to commune with cosmic forces—is signaled early but never tightens through protagonist agency. Nebuchadnezzar's approach is mentioned but applies no pressure to Anu's actions; the equinox timing is declared but not dramatized as a ticking clock. The tile's transformation occurs passively (it lifts, unfolds, projects) without Anu making a high-stakes choice or paying a visible price. No meaningful escalation or deepening under any lens; the resolution is granted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A coherent theme—faith and science as complementary languages—emerges from the premise, but it's stated directly ("empirically ironic faith," "languages of the same truth") rather than earned through specific action and ambiguity. The final image (glowing marks on palms, smile of security) offers mild resonance but tips into tidy moral satisfaction without complexity or counter-reading. Subtext is minimal; most thematic work is explicit. The dusky harmony motif recurs but feels ornamental rather than charged with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Anu, but perceptual signature is generic—no character-particular way of noticing. Diction drifts into elevated register ("amethyst and indigo," "covenant with the unknown") that feels authorial rather than voice-motivated. The single line of dialogue ("Show yourself") is inert and doesn't pursue a goal or carry subtext. Filter verbs and expository interiority ("understanding at last what he must do") flatten immediacy. Distance control is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops damage momentum: "Between regimes" appears twice as a paragraph opener, "encrypted devotion" recurs without variation, and several beats restate the same content ("the tile's final secret" / "unlock the tile's power"). Figurative density is high without payoff—"dusky harmony," "cooled honey," "light like amethyst"—creating ornamental drag rather than propulsion. Pronoun "無數次" (Chinese characters) mid-paragraph is a generation artifact. Sentence openings are repetitive ("Anu [verb]," "The [noun]"), and the climax relies on vague gestures ("light engulfed," "something vast") instead of concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—astronomer uses ancient math to commune with cosmic forces—is a recognizable template (scholar decodes mystical artifact during regime change). Execution leans heavily on stock mystical imagery (glowing symbols, levitating objects, light engulfing the chamber) without fresh inflection. The frugal astronomer trait is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction. Transformation test fails: swap Babylon for any ancient culture and the emotional arc remains unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis evident.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The frugal astronomer trait is mentioned in the opening and middle ("saving even the smallest shard," "perfected his methods through necessity") but never constrains a choice or creates a turn. Anu's decisions are passive witnessing rather than active trade-offs. Present in setup and briefly in development, but absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears in setup (described with "encrypted devotion"), is handled in the middle (Anu completes a schematic to unlock it), and drives the climax (lifts, unfolds, projects light, conveys marks). Present across all three gates and causally active in the ending. However, its specific properties (9×9, Marduk ciphers) don't shape tactics—any mystical artifact could substitute. Scores solidly but not indispensably.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion is mentioned as a label ("each numeral a prayer to Marduk disguised as mere mathematics") but never dramatized as a stake or tactic. It doesn't constrain choices or shape the ending's cost. Present ornamentally in setup, absent from development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Empirically ironic is stated twice ("the scientist employing mathematics to reach beyond the scientific realm," "empirically ironic methods had proven") but remains a label without on-page demonstration. No visible trade-off or constrained action arises from this attribute. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Uncloak appears in the middle ("time had come to uncloak the tile's final secret," "beginning the ritual to uncloak the invisible threads") and is thematically tied to the ending revelation. However, the actual uncloaking action (ritual steps, schematic completion) is vague and could be swapped for any generic mystical procedure. Present in setup and closure but mechanically replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Schematic representations appear in setup (Anu draws constellations on papyrus) and are mentioned in the middle ("completing the final spiral on his schematic"). They enable the tile's activation, providing one causal link, but the mechanics remain opaque—how does drawing the Pleiades unlock the tile? Functional but not irreplaceable; any ritual gesture could serve the same purpose.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The ancient Babylonian palace reimagined as observatory is established early (celestial maps replacing war tapestries, sealed chamber) and supplies the sealed environment for the climax. The setting's transformation from war to knowledge mirrors Anu's theme but doesn't constrain his tactics—the ritual could occur in any private space. Present across all three gates with thematic weight but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Between regimes is signaled in the opening ("power shifted from Assyrian to Babylonian," "Nebuchadnezzar's forces approaching") and mentioned in the closing ("Between regimes, Anu had bridged greater divides"). However, the timeframe applies no ticking-clock pressure—Anu's ritual proceeds uninterrupted regardless of the political shift. Present in setup and closure but not functional in shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>To seal a covenant with the unknown is stated as Anu's goal ("understanding at last what he must do to seal a covenant," "marks of the covenant he had sought"). It frames the ritual and appears in the ending when he receives the glowing marks. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction between want and cost. Present across all gates but with minimal on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dusky harmony appears explicitly ("twilight painted his study in shades of amethyst and indigo, Anu felt the familiar pull... creating a dusky harmony in his soul," "sky deepened to dusky harmony") and recurs as a tonal anchor. The phrase coheres thematically but remains static—tone doesn't modulate with escalating pressure or charge the final image. Present in setup and middle, weakly reprised at closure.</comment>
