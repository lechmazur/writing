<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to learn is stated but never tested; she accepts instruction without visible internal conflict or cost. Elien's "backwards aging researcher" trait appears ornamental—his skin tightening is mentioned but never constrains a choice or creates friction with his teaching goal. The final moment where Maya "seemed to fade, her presence intensifying" reads as abstract assertion rather than embodied transformation, and the "decade return to his body" feels like mechanical payoff disconnected from prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elien is, where the floating platform sits relative to the grotto, and what "backwards aging" means remain vague past the opening third, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure—Maya mastering "vanishing to appear" and Elien receiving a decade—lands on the page but the cost is abstract; no prior option is visibly foreclosed, and the "payment for wisdom shared" mechanism is introduced only in the final line without setup. Under a Causal lens (inferred from the teaching structure and stone demonstration), the because/therefore chain breaks: the stone-and-ripples demonstration does not causally enable Maya's transformation; she simply "understands" after the blindfold is removed and the grotto glows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The floating rock platform and magnetic grotto are named repeatedly but their spatial relationship and physical properties remain unclear—does the platform drift on water, levitate magnetically, or float by other means? The sycamore leaves and starlight provide atmosphere but do not constrain any choice. The stone Maya throws and the pond's rings are central to the method (Q9F) but the pond's location relative to the platform is never anchored, creating spatial incoherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching Maya to "vanish to appear"—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity; Maya simply listens and then succeeds. No reversal or tightening occurs; the blindfold removal and grotto's glow are external reveals, not turns driven by protagonist choice. The "decade return" at the end introduces a cost mechanism with no prior setup, so the price feels arbitrary rather than earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "vanishing to appear" paradox is stated overtly multiple times ("To appear... first I must vanish," "shedding false layers of identity"), replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The ripples-as-layers-of-existence metaphor is explained rather than discovered through Maya's choices, and the final paragraph moralizes ("To teach vanishing to appear was to teach the ultimate paradox of existence") instead of letting the image resonate. Elien's backwards aging could offer thematic weight but remains disconnected from the lesson's stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable and the diction generally fits a meditative fantastical register, but Elien's interiority is sparse—"Elien weaves truth carefully, he thought" is the only direct interior access, and it reads as meta-commentary rather than character-specific perception. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Maya's "Show me" and Elien's guidance lack subtext or tension. The prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("Through the trance, Maya's perception heightened") that tells rather than dramatizes the shift in awareness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Maya nodded slowly... Maya's lips pursed... Maya nodded again... Maya's eyes snapped open... Maya closed her eyes once more." Multiple lines restate the vanishing-to-appear concept without added pressure ("It doesn't disappear... It merely transforms its state of being" / "vanishing to appear wasn't about physical disappearance but about shedding false layers"). The metaphor "his chronological paradox mirroring the lesson at hand" is abstract and adds no concrete image. Combined, these trigger −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template stems, and the artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical teaching via symbolic object and delayed revelation—follows familiar mentor-student templates without transformation. The "backwards aging researcher" detail could provide a fresh angle but remains ornamental set-dressing. The floating rock, magnetic grotto, and starlight are named but not integrated into a unique logical system; swapping them for other mystical props would leave the emotional arc unchanged, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elien is present throughout and his role as teacher frames the story, but "backwards aging researcher" does not constrain or enable any on-page decision. His skin tightening is mentioned twice as observation; the final "decade return" is payoff without prior setup. The trait is swappable—any mystical mentor could deliver the same lesson.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto appears in three beats: described as beneath the platform, mentioned as "which exists but remains unseen," and revealed glowing at the end. However, it does not constrain Maya's learning or Elien's teaching; the glow is a visual reveal, not a causal enabler. Removing it would require only minor edits to the starlight moment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Delayed revelation structures the entire lesson: Elien withholds the grotto's visibility and the full meaning of the stone demonstration until Maya is ready. The concept shapes tactics (blindfolding Maya, timing the starlight) and the closure hinges on the reveal moment. However, the revelation itself is externally triggered (starlight penetrates) rather than earned by Maya's internal shift, weakening causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is stated once in Elien's thought ("Elien weaves truth carefully, he thought, knowing he must withhold certain details") but never demonstrated through a specific on-page choice with visible cost. The trait could be inferred from his delayed revelation, but the story does not dramatize a moment where careful truth-weaving constrains his speech or creates friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Withhold" drives the structure: Elien withholds the grotto's visibility, the full explanation, and Maya's blindfold until the right moment. The action appears in the opening third ("knowing he must withhold certain details") and is paid off when Maya realizes "You've withheld this knowledge until I could perceive it directly." The middle demonstration (stone, ripples) is enabled by this withholding. However, the resolution is externally triggered (starlight), not fully earned by Elien's prior withholding choices.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The method—stone thrown into pond, watching ripple patterns—is signaled early, demonstrated in the middle beat, and verbally recalled at closure ("The patterns in the pond's rings had shown her the path"). However, the mechanics remain vague; Maya "sees" the ripples "in her mind's eye" via trance, and the lesson is explained rather than enacted through the patterns themselves. The method shapes one key turn (the demonstration) but does not constrain later attempts or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The floating rock platform is named in the opening line and mentioned five times, but it never constrains movement or choices. We learn it "drifted gently" and "trembled slightly," but these are passive observations. The platform could be replaced with any meditation space without altering the lesson's logic or Maya's transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Through the trance" appears in three beats: Maya sinking into the state, perceiving ripples via trance, and Elien watching her transform "through the trance." However, the trance does not function as a live clock or pressure device; time is untracked, and the trance merely labels Maya's receptive state rather than shaping her attempts or creating urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elien's motivation "to teach vanishing to appear" is stated early, frames every beat, and is fulfilled at closure when Maya masters the lesson. However, the motivation is never conflicted—Elien encounters no friction, doubt, or cost in the teaching itself. The "decade return" could imply a price, but it arrives as reward, not sacrifice, and is introduced only in the final line without prior setup.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Sycamore hush" is named three times and establishes a quiet, meditative atmosphere. The tone remains consistent but static; it does not modulate with pressure (Maya's confusion, the starlight revelation) or charge the final image with new weight. The phrase functions as ambient description rather than a dynamic tonal constraint that shapes choices or intensifies at closure.</comment>
