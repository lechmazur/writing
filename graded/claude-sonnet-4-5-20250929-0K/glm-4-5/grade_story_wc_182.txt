<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (finding the library, rescuing the colleague) is declared but largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The key "rescue" unfolds in summary ("began the delicate process of extraction") without embodied struggle or visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("her mind already calculating," "racing heart") and the final promise reads as an unearned epiphany rather than a change driven by on-page causality. The "carefully resourceful" trait is asserted but not tested through competing goods or flaws that complicate her choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Elara is, where she stands, and what immediate problem she faces remain abstract past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The closure ("she made a silent promise") is a character declaration rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the rescue succeeds off-page and no path is foreclosed. The lens is ambiguous (elements of causal and thematic accumulation compete without a clear dominant mode at the ending). The time traveler's setup and the colleague's plight are recounted rather than dramatized, severing because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain receive vivid description ("shelves twisted like climbing vines," "books whispered their contents") but function as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara navigates without spatial friction or choice shaped by access. The botanical diary glows and guides without material cost or tactical trade-off. Spatial choreography is loose (the guardians "swirl," the cavern "holds," but distances and thresholds remain vague). Sensory detail leans visual and metaphorical without anchoring touch, sound, or proximity that would pressure a micro-decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (rescuing the mentor's colleague) is signaled early but remains abstract—no on-page tightening where a live option is foreclosed or a trade-off made visible. The renegotiation with the guardians succeeds without cost or adaptation; the extraction occurs off-page in summary. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive escalation: Elara's "carefully resourceful" trait is label-only and the diary solves problems it did not help create. A single pressure point (the guardians' consideration) offers a micro-turn but no meaningful narrowing of options or deepening that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme ("gaps in understanding" as "opportunities both sacred and urgent") is stated rather than earned through particulars. The botanical diary and "unheard symphony" recur as motifs but do not constrain choice or charge the closure—they remain ornamental. The final promise is sermonized ("made a silent promise to continue her work") rather than resonant, and the closing image ("unheard symphony of learning played on") offers abstraction instead of a non-literal answer grounded in scene. Subtext is minimal; dialogue and gesture carry little implication beyond surface meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mercurial library spaces," "cosmic order of knowledge") without clear POV motivation. Dialogue is present and functional but carries minimal subtext; the guardians' inquiry and Elara's reply advance plot mechanically. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("felt the weight," "seemed to sigh") dull immediacy in peak beats. The prose reads competent but lacks rhythmic control or a singular idiom that would anchor voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and scaffold clutter appear throughout: "library of unlearned lessons" is repeated across four paragraphs without reweighting; "unheard symphony" opens and closes as bookend without causal work. Template cadence runs in the final third ("As they emerged," "As she returned," "forever changing and yet always waiting") flatten propulsion. Stock metaphors ("whispered their contents," "breathing as if in response") blur clarity. Figurative density in descriptive passages (ink entities as "floral and textual patterns," diary "glowing with soft green light") layered without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers overwriting penalties. Information density is low—many lines decorate rather than advance stakes or character.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise (arcane linguist rescues consciousness trapped in unlearned lessons via botanical diary and linguistic negotiation) assembles fantasy-romance template elements without fresh synthesis. The time traveler arrives as plot catalyst and vanishes; the guardians test Elara once without adaptation; the rescue succeeds off-page. Emotional specificity is absent—stakes remain abstract and the closure promise feels generic. The labyrinthine bookstore and "unheard symphony" motifs are vivid but not transformed through character-specific choice or world logic. The proximity to wish-fulfillment templates (arcane expert with special artifact succeeds without meaningful loss) and the lack of a non-obvious moral calculus lower originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her key choices (negotiating with guardians, extracting the colleague) occur off-page or in summary. She observes, calculates, and announces but does not face on-page decisions that alter tactics with visible cost. Her agency is asserted ("carefully resourceful," "linguistic brilliance") rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or trade-offs. Setup is early; middle and closure participation are summary-only, capping the score and preventing credit for causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears early, is held during the negotiation, glows to guide the rescue, and is shelved at the end—spanning setup, middle, and closure. However, its use is largely passive (it glows, it contains "key language") rather than constraining a choice or requiring a trade-off. The diary's "notes in seventeen forgotten dialects" enable the renegotiation, but the mechanics are told rather than shown. It shapes two beats (negotiation, extraction) but without visible cost or irreplaceable specificity that would elevate the score into high bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Rescue missions" frame the plot and recur in dialogue and Elara's final reflection. The core action (extracting the colleague) is the story's climax, meeting setup and payoff gates. However, the rescue itself is summarized ("began the delicate process of extraction") without on-page tactics, friction, or cost, reducing causal pressure. The concept is functional and drives the ending but remains swappable with minor edits (a "retrieval quest" or "liberation mission" would work identically). Middle development is present but thin, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is asserted twice (by the time traveler and in the final paragraph) but never demonstrated through on-page action that constrains or enables a choice. Elara's navigation, negotiation, and extraction succeed without visible trade-offs, scarcity, or improvisation that would embody the trait. Setup is present (time traveler's dialogue), but middle and closure participation are label-only. The trait is swappable with any competence descriptor, and no specific cost ties to its use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" is signaled early ("stood ready to renegotiate their original agreement"), executed in the middle beat (dialogue with guardians), and opens the path to the rescue. The action shapes a key turn but without visible cost—the guardians agree after brief consultation, and no prior agreement or consequence of failure is dramatized. The action is specific enough to resist easy substitution but lacks the friction or trade-off needed to reach higher bands. All three gates are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is stated in Elara's explanation to the guardians ("By researching gaps between known lexicons") and referenced in the diary's notes. Setup occurs in the opening (the diary's "gaps in commonly accepted history"), and the method enables the middle negotiation. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—no on-page scene of research, no visible attempt or failure. The method is swappable (any scholarly discovery could substitute). Middle participation is thin; closure does not return to the method, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain is vividly described and houses the action, meeting setup and closure gates (Elara returns to "her quarters" within it). The setting supplies the guardians as obstacles and the library as goal. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara navigates without friction, and the "endless corridors" and "twisted shelves" remain decorative. The mountain itself is mentioned but never pressures movement or resources. Middle development is present (guardians appear) but without tactical cost, capping the score in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" anchors the opening ("The time traveler had arrived exactly three days ago") and the timeframe recurs at closure (he waits outside). The three-day gap is noted but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline—Elara's actions unfold without visible urgency or time pressure. The timeframe is present at setup and closure but does not shape middle tactics or escalation. Swappability is high (any framing arrival would work), and no live clock alters moves, capping the score in the functional-but-ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To find the library of unlearned lessons" is stated as Elara's motivation in the opening and recurs in the middle (negotiation) and closure (silent promise). The desire drives the plot but is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between this want and a competing need, cost, or fear. The motivation is present across all three gates but without embodied conflict or visible trade-off that would demonstrate it under pressure. It shapes the action but remains abstract, landing in the functional band without causal richness.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" appears in the opening ("echoes of unheard symphony"), the middle ("unheard symphony of motion and meaning"), and the closing paragraph ("unheard symphony of learning"). The tone recurs but remains static—a lyrical flourish rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image with cost. The phrase is ornamental and swappable (any poetic motif could substitute). Setup and closure are met but without middle development that ties the tone to stakes or choice, capping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>
