<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clara's motivation to understand building language is declared but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The relationship with Mr. Abernathy unfolds through summary ("weekly ritual," "following week") rather than embodied moments that test commitment. The genealogical reveal arrives through exposition ("They were distant relatives") without prior interiority or contradiction to earn the shift. "Mysterious familiarity" is asserted twice but never shown through specific perception or misrecognition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal but wobbles between interpersonal discovery and architectural mystery without clear escalation. Orientation anchors who/where by the second paragraph (acceptable). The closure—Clara receives the seal and gains "fluency"—is declared rather than demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a path; no visible cost appears on the page. The "agreed upon lies" setup promises tension but resolves off-page ("some truths need protection") without altering tactics or stakes in the rooftop scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden and meteor shower provide vivid sensory anchors ("meteors streaked across the darkness, ephemeral as forgotten words"), and the desk seal recurs with charged imagery ("glowing faintly in the meteoric light"). However, the setting does not constrain a choice: the rooftop could be any private space for the reveal. Spatial choreography is clean, and the historic district is seeded early but remains generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning building language—is signaled early but never tightened by a reversal or cost. The rooftop interrogation ("What does the language of buildings mean to you?") invites deepening but Clara's answer is abstract and Mr. Abernathy simply affirms it. The genealogical reveal is coincidental (they are relatives) rather than driven by Clara's agency. No on-page trade-off or forfeited option is visible; the seal transfers without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance and lost languages emerges through the seal and genealogy, but the rooftop dialogue states rather than enacts it ("It's inheritance—of stories, of people"). The desk seal recurs but does not shift meaning; it remains a static key throughout. "Agreed upon lies" is introduced but never complicates trust or forces a choice, undermining thematic tension. The final line ("old friends with stories finally ready to be told") summarizes rather than offering a resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Clara with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in early building observations ("stones settled, timbers creaked") but fades in the rooftop scene. Dialogue is functional but characters share similar register ("You're closer than you know" / "Why the agreed upon lies?"); no distinct idiom differentiates Mr. Abernathy's eighty-year-old tutor voice from Clara's younger perspective under pressure. Diction remains consistent without experimental deviation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied sentence openings and no grammatical errors. Minor paraphrase loop: "mysterious familiarity" is restated as "they were distant relatives, connected by a lineage" without additional pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in the middle: "Each Tuesday, they'd sit… Mr. Abernathy would demonstrate… Clara would share…" cycles through three parallel stems without variation (−0.4). Figurative language ("meteors… ephemeral as forgotten words") is apt but sparse. Information density is moderate; several transit summaries ("following week found her returning") compress efficiently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "buildings speak a language" premise is familiar and not transformed through specific world logic or fresh angle; the seal functions as a generic magical key. The genealogical twist (distant relatives) is coincidental rather than arising from prior character choice. Emotional arc (loneliness to connection) fits a common template and could swap Clara/Mr. Abernathy with other mentor-seeker pairs without structural change. "Agreed upon lies" promises complexity but delivers minimal friction, defaulting to safe middle ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mr. Abernathy is present across beats (sugar, weekly tea, rooftop) and delivers the genealogical reveal, but his choices do not drive turns. He affirms Clara's answers rather than challenging or complicating them. Introduced early with distinct attribute ("patiently nimble"), he remains static; the tutor role is declared but not enacted through on-page instruction that alters Clara's understanding or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears in three beats: Mr. Abernathy produces it ("key to understanding"), it lies between them on the rooftop ("glowing faintly"), and Clara receives it at closure. However, its function remains constant (symbol of heritage); no evolving use or reweighted meaning. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. Early signal and closure presence meet two gates, but causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "agreed upon lies" concept is introduced late (midpoint: "They agreed upon lies to explain her frequent visits") and never constrains a choice or generates on-page conflict. It is mentioned once more at the rooftop ("Why the agreed upon lies?") but resolved with abstract justification ("Some truths need protection") rather than dramatized cost. Ornamental use only; swappable with any secrecy trope.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is applied once to Mr. Abernathy in physical description ("moving with a grace that belied his eighty-some years") and never constrains or enables an action with cost. It does not recur or shape a beat. Label-only mention without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Interrogate" appears in the rooftop scene ("Now, I must interrogate you") but the ensuing exchange is gentle questioning without pressure or resistance. Clara answers abstractly; Mr. Abernathy affirms without challenge. The action does not redefine options or force a cost. Present in setup and middle, but functionally replaceable with "ask" or "discuss."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (Clara borrows sugar, returns it, stays for tea) and the "weekly ritual" is established in the first third. It enables the middle beat (tea sessions where they share knowledge) and primes the rooftop closure. The mechanics (recurring visits building trust) shape Clara's access to the reveal. However, the ritual itself does not constrain a tactic or impose cost; it functions as transit rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the meteor shower is introduced in the final third and provides vivid sensory detail ("meteors streaked across the darkness"). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the genealogical reveal could occur in any private setting. The meteor shower is decorative (metaphor for ephemerality) rather than causal. Late arrival and ornamental use limit the score despite atmospheric specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Clara's desire to "understand this architectural dialect" is seeded in the opening and drives her initial approach to Mr. Abernathy. It recurs in her rooftop answer ("It's inheritance"). However, no on-page friction tests the motivation; she never weighs the cost of pursuing this knowledge or faces a trade-off. Desire is told more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is established early ("His eyes held a mysterious familiarity") and named again at the rooftop reveal ("they understood their mysterious familiarity"). The tone coheres across beats and modulates from curiosity to recognition. However, the final naming restates rather than reweights the opening; no tonal deepening or charged shift at closure. Functional reprise without intensification.</comment>
