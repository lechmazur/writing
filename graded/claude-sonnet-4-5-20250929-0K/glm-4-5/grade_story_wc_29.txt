<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("obsession that consumed every waking hour") but her interior life reads as exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The final paragraph's "cautiously hopeful expression" and "smiled wanly" are stock gestures that label emotion without showing contradictory impulses in scene. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure; the transmitter activation is narrated as inevitable rather than a decision with visible trade-offs. The piece tells us she is driven but does not dramatize the cost of that drive through embodied action or genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story delivers a clear Decisive Change (the signal stops, tensions ease) with some felt cost (Elara's isolation, the risk of trickster retaliation). However, the closure arrives through off-page effects reported a week later rather than an on-page crystallization of pressure. The causal lens is attempted but weakened by gaps: we are told the tricksters manipulate through frequency, but the mechanics of Elara's interference and its success are asserted rather than dramatized. The final image defaults to summary ("new power plays had just begun") instead of a resonant reconfiguration tied to specific prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The radio station setting is anchored early with "cramped studio," "vintage equipment," and "blinking monitor," and it constrains Elara's choice by providing the modified transmitter. The astronomical charts appear in multiple beats and are described as trembling during the interference, creating a tactile link to the stakes. However, the university campus and town divisions remain abstract; we see no bodies, distances, or spatial choreography that would ground the escalation. The subsonic waves and their physical effects (blue light, crackling air, static electricity) are vivid but lack specificity that ties them to the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (stopping the transmissions) is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Elara's activation of the transmitter is presented as the first and only attempt, with immediate success and no meaningful reversal or complication. The weeks of recalibration are summarized rather than shown, so the reader has no sense of rising cost or narrowing options. The final week's community healing is reported, not dramatized, and Merrick's sheepish approach arrives without friction. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the resolution feels convenient rather than earned by protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of perception manipulation and cosmic power plays emerges from the premise, but it remains largely abstract. The story tells us the tricksters "exploited human weaknesses with cosmic precision" and "played humanity against itself," yet these ideas are asserted rather than shown through specific, grounded choices. The final image ("new power plays had just begun—with humanity finally aware") is a thematic statement rather than a resonant reconfiguration. The astronomical charts and frequency manipulation offer concrete anchors, but the piece does not translate these particulars into a non-literal answer to the central question. Elara's "ethereal grit" and the phrase "cosmic game" risk abstraction without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable, and diction remains largely consistent with Elara's role as a scientist. However, the narrative voice frequently slips into expository summary ("The tricksters' ability to manipulate human perception," "These weren't advanced conquerors with weapons but rather subtle manipulators") that tells rather than shows through Elara's filtered perception. Phrases like "ethereal grit" and "cosmic tricksters playing humanity against itself" feel imposed rather than voiced. No dialogue appears, so distinction tests are not applicable. Filter verbs are minimal, and the POV does not withhold known facts for false suspense, but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The tricksters' ability to manipulate human perception through subtle frequency manipulation had turned society against itself" is immediately restated as "these weren't benevolent messages from distant stars but cosmic tricksters playing humanity against itself." Runs of identical sentence stems appear throughout ("The faculty had dismissed," "Professor Merrick, once her mentor," "He had published"). Stock metaphors ("invisible fingers," "elongated shadows," "whispers in between signals") dilute specificity. The final third contains template cadence and synonym churn ("cautiously hopeful nature," "cautiously hopeful expression," "cautious optimism"), triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—celestial signals as manipulation tools, defeated by subsonic interference—is functional but derivative of familiar "hidden invasion" templates. The astronomical charts and subsonic frequencies offer specificity, but the story does not transform the trope through unexpected moral calculus or lived detail. Elara's success is convenient rather than earned through risky synthesis, and the community healing is reported as a simple reversal. No bold structural or perspectival choices heighten stakes; the linear narrative follows a predictable arc from discovery to interference to resolution. The final image ("new power plays had just begun") gestures toward complexity but remains abstract rather than particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as signal interpreter frames the premise, but her choices are minimal. The decision to activate the transmitter is narrated as inevitable rather than a dilemma with visible trade-offs. The weeks of preparation are summarized, and the final week's observation is passive. She appears in the closure unit (documentation, collaboration with Merrick) but does not make a key turn there; the resolution arrives through off-page community effects. Setup and development gates are met, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The astronomical charts appear in the opening beat ("fingers traced the edges"), are used mid-story to reveal the tricksters' pattern ("One astronomical chart in particular, showing constellation alignments"), and return during the interference ("The astronomical charts began to tremble"). This spans setup, development, and payoff, with the trembling detail offering a tactile link to the climax. However, the charts do not constrain a choice or charge the final image; they function as evidence rather than a pivot. Their specificity (constellations not visible from Earth) adds texture but does not make them irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Power plays are mentioned four times as a thematic label ("power plays extending across galactic space," "cosmic power struggle," "new power plays had just begun") but are not dramatized through on-page choices or tactics. The concept does not shape the protagonist's decision-making or constrain her options; it remains an abstract frame rather than a force that alters the story's escalation. The closure references it ("new power plays"), but the reference is ornamental rather than causal. The concept is present and logically consistent but swappable with "manipulation" or "conflict" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is assigned as a trait in one sentence ("Her cautiously hopeful nature had prevented hasty action") and repeated as a label in the closure ("Her cautiously hopeful expression returned," "cautious optimism"). It is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or a visible trade-off. The trait does not constrain a key on-page action; the weeks of preparation are summarized, so we do not see caution shaping her moves. The closure mentions cite the label but do not dramatize its cost. Setup and a weak payoff are present, but middle development is missing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the story's central action: Elara's activation of the transmitter to disrupt the alien signals drives the climax and produces the Decisive Change (signals stop, community heals). The action is prepared through prior research and executed in the story's most vivid beat (blue light, crackling air, trembling charts). It appears in the closure unit indirectly (the signals have stopped, Elara documents the result). However, the interference itself is narrated rather than dramatized through tactical choices under pressure, and no complication tests its success. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met with strong causal pressure, but the lack of reversal or friction caps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are signaled early ("analyzing the patterns," "subsonic realm"), prepared in the middle ("subsonic frequencies exactly as her research suggested," "generating waves below human hearing"), and executed at the climax ("subsonic waves she'd generated began to interfere"). The method shapes the protagonist's weeks of recalibration and is indispensable to the interference beat. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than shown affecting tactics; we are told the waves are risky but do not see Elara navigate that risk through micro-choices. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, and the method's specificity (subsonic vs. other frequencies) matters, but its causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The university radio station is anchored early ("cramped studio," "vintage equipment"), provides the modified transmitter that enables the interference, and houses the climax beat. The setting's resources (antenna, transmitter) are essential to Elara's action, and the "blinking monitor" returns to show the signal's cessation. However, the station does not constrain Elara's choice or create friction; it functions as an enabling location rather than a pressure that shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is minimal (Elara at desk, equipment around her), and the setting does not charge the final image. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met with functional causal role across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"As the community divides" is referenced repeatedly ("the brewing tension," "community divides grew deeper each day," "fault lines forming beneath the surface"), and the timeframe of "six months" since the broadcasts began is stated. The final week's easing of tensions gestures toward time-based resolution. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; Elara's action occurs "tonight" but could occur any night without consequence. The community divisions are backdrop rather than a temporal constraint that alters her tactics. Setup and weak payoff are present, but middle development (a deadline or escalating urgency) is missing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to outwit cosmic tricksters" is declared early ("Her motivation to outwit these extraterrestrial manipulators had become an obsession") and drives Elara's weeks of preparation and the interference action. It appears in the closure unit ("humanity's fight to preserve its own perception of reality"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; we do not see Elara weigh the cost of her obsession (lost sleep, faculty dismissal) against a competing want. The desire is consistent but uncontested, reducing friction. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met with causal linkage, but visible trade-offs are minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is named once ("Elara allowed herself a moment of ethereal grit, feeling both the cosmic significance and the earthly terror") and gestured toward in the opening's "weathered astronomical charts" and the climax's "ancient and alien" energy. The tone attempts a blend of cosmic scale and grounded determination, but the execution is inconsistent: much of the story reads as expository summary rather than charged imagery. The phrase "ethereal grit" itself is abstract and label-like, not embodied. The tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image, which defaults to thematic summary. Setup (opening mood) and a weak payoff (the named phrase) are present, but the tone is not coherent through turns.</comment>
