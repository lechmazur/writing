<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet lacks agency; their characterization remains static across centuries—they write, watch, and eventually die without meaningful internal contradiction or choice under pressure. The transformation (blossoms appearing) happens *to* the shell in response to the poet's activity, not through a decision the poet wrestles with. Interiority is delivered through elevated, abstract phrasing ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "ocean of sorrow beneath") that reads as thematic declaration rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The final "closing their eyes for the last time" is passive rather than a renunciation or stance crystallization with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when are unclear past 120 words; the "gargantuan shell" and "sleeping world" anchor setting vaguely, and the poet's actual situation (alone? tending others? inside a literal shell?) remains ambiguous well into the piece. No meaningful escalation or causal tightening occurs—centuries pass, blossoms spread, the poet dies, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a choice. The closure (poet dies, lullabies continue) offers atmospheric continuity but no decisive change, felt cost, or reweighted meaning; it reads as descriptive summary rather than a resonant reconfiguration. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no cadence shift or density break recharges the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The shell is described vividly ("pearlescent walls," "spiraling chambers") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a backdrop. The galaxy postcard is handled twice (arrival, final resting place) but does not enable or block an action. Spatial choreography is vague—where the poet sits, how inhabitants are arranged, how blossoms "spread" physically—leaving the reader to imagine logistics rather than tracking them on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake is tested on the page. The poet's goal (to compose lullabies that transform pain into beauty) succeeds without opposition, complication, or cost; blossoms appear and flourish across centuries without resistance. No reversal or tightening occurs—visitors marvel, blossoms persist, the poet dies peacefully. Agency is absent: the transformation is passive (blossoms emerge "in answer"), and no choice forecloses a path or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme ("pain into beauty," isolation into connection) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars: "photosynthesize pain into beauty" appears three times, "centuries of longing" bookends the piece, and "reef-shadow joy" is explained rather than enacted. The galaxy postcard and blossoms function as symbolic tokens without dramatized cost or friction. The ending summarizes the theme ("connection exists even in isolation") instead of offering a non-literal answer through image or action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice remains elevated and uniform throughout, with no modulation under pressure or shift in psychic distance. Diction consistently exceeds the poet's plausible lexicon during peak moments: "ensconce themselves within its mysteries," "bioluminescence," "micro-verse," "transmuted into community." No perceptual signature distinguishes the poet's way of noticing; the prose reads as omniscient summary rather than filtered through a singular focalization. Multi-paragraph spans of past-tense summary flatten immediacy without strategic compression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "pain into beauty" appears in three variations across the piece; "shyly unstoppable" is repeated identically twice; "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" recurs verbatim three times without reweighting. Template cadence dominates the opening four paragraphs, each beginning with a similar noun-phrase structure. Figurative language stacks without coherence: "galaxy postcard...pulse with understanding" and "photosynthesize pain" mix metaphors that do not cohere physically. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats: "The poet observed how," "felt how it ensconced," "wondered if this was their purpose."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core premise (cosmic postcard inspires healing garden across centuries) is rendered through familiar fantasy elements without fresh inflection. The emotional arc (lonely artist creates beauty that outlasts them) follows a well-worn template, and key images (blossoms = transformation, lullabies = comfort) remain symbolic without specific mechanics or cost. The poet's insomnia is declared but not dramatized—no scene shows the struggle or trade-off of sleeplessness. The ending (artist dies, work persists) offers comfort rather than a non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The insomniac poet is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or stakes. Their insomnia is stated ("Long had they sought") but does not constrain a choice. The poet observes, composes, and eventually dies without agency-driven turns. Present by setup, absent in middle development (no choice under pressure), and passive at closure (dies peacefully).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The galaxy postcard arrives early, is traced by the poet once ("hands trembled as they traced"), and appears at closure ("remained pinned to the shell's highest point"). It does not enable or constrain a middle choice; its function is atmospheric inspiration rather than causal pressure. Two beats (arrival, final resting place) with thematic reprise but no mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The blossom armistice is described extensively but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Blossoms appear passively ("emerged...in answer") and spread without opposition or cost. The concept is thematic (truce between suffering and serenity) rather than a problem or constraint the poet navigates. Present by the second third, but only as outcome, not driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is applied twice to the blossoms' spread and once to the lullabies' continuation. It describes rather than constrains; no scene shows the trait enabling or blocking an action. Label-only, no visible tradeoff or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears once in the poet's desire to "ensconce themselves within its mysteries" (the postcard) and once describing how the creation "ensconced the sleeping ones." It is a verb of wrapping/sheltering but does not drive a turn; easily swappable with "immerse" or "surround." Present in middle reflection and closure description, but not causally pivotal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind are mentioned in the poet's composition, their wrapping around the shell, and their continuation after death. The method is signaled early and returns at closure, but its mechanics do not matter—no scene shows why "half-sung" or "off-key" enables the transformation versus any other song. Reprise with thematic weight but no causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell frames the entire story and provides the space where blossoms grow. It does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; inhabitants sleep inside it, but no scene shows the shell's structure enabling or blocking an action. Consistent presence, atmospheric function, but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" bookends the piece (opening sea stories, closing reminder). Time is declared but not tracked—no on-page moment shows centuries passing with a live clock or decision point. The phrase is thematic rather than a constraint that tightens tactics. Present in setup and closure as motif, absent in middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The desire "to photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated three times and shapes the poet's activity (composing lullabies, creating blossoms). It is told rather than dramatized—no scene shows friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. The motivation is consistent and present across beats, but without conflicted choice it remains declarative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" appears once to describe the blossoms' scent: "a complex happiness that acknowledged the ocean of sorrow beneath it." The phrase is evocative but the tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. The overall register (elevated, lyric, static) does not shift across centuries or at the poet's death. Label-only, single mention, no tonal arc.</comment>
