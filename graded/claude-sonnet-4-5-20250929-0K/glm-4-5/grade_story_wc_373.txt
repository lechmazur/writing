<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eliza's motivation—capturing "the sound of trust breaking"—is conceptually striking but remains abstract; her manipulations are competent yet she never confronts a genuine obstacle or internal contradiction that tests her commitment. The piece tells us she is "curiously steadfast" but shows no moment where that steadfastness costs her anything or where competing impulses act simultaneously. Malachi and the lieutenant are functional props rather than pressure sources, and the watch fob's mechanism is asserted rather than embodied through her attention or micro-choices under stress. The ending delivers tactical success without visible forfeit or deepening—Eliza simply leaves with her prize, unscathed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation cleanly (pirate market, daughter of a runner, watch fob key) and pursues a causal chain: Eliza plants lies, Malachi's note exposes the traitor, trust shatters. The closure unit—trust breaking captured in the fob—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and abstract rather than felt; Eliza risks nothing and gains her prize without forfeit, so the "before/after" is more a task completed than a transformation with price. One meaningful tightening occurs (the note reveal), satisfying minimum escalation for this length, but the design leans causal without the pressure or trade-off that would elevate closure into the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rotting pier, rum barrels, tavern corner, and back room are present and spatially coherent; the watch fob recurs and charges the final image by capturing the sound. However, the environment remains backdrop—none of the physical details (creaking wood, damp air, barrels) constrain Eliza's movement or alter her tactics; she navigates freely without friction. The time constraint ("until sunrise") is declared but never tightens her choices on the page; the sky "showing signs" arrives as scene dressing rather than forcing urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking before sunrise—is signaled early, and Eliza's three approaches (burly pirate, second-in-command, Malachi directly) form a causal escalation that narrows to the note gambit. Yet each step succeeds easily; the "false starts" label in the text describes her first two moves, but no genuine obstacle forces her to adapt or pay a price. The truce and sunrise are declared constraints that never materialize as pressure; coincidence (the lieutenant being the actual betrayer) resolves the final turn rather than Eliza's insight or trade-off, lowering agency and felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—recording the sound of trust breaking—offers conceptual intrigue, but the piece articulates it through direct exposition ("a silence that screams") rather than letting the final image resonate without gloss. The watch fob motif recurs, yet its thematic charge is told ("forever hers to study," "comforting unease of her unique collection") rather than shown through scene pressure or a reweighted choice. The ending flattens into a satisfied exit with no ambiguity or lived complexity; Eliza's "curiously steadfast" pursuit lands as quirky rather than morally fraught, and the "unique collection" mention in the final line reads as theme summary rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Eliza's perceptual signature (observing from shadows, clutching the fob, tracking reactions) is consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("Word is, Malachi's hired a new runner"), carrying subtext and goal pursuit without caricature. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated summary ("the comforting unease of the market settled around her like a familiar cloak," "curiously steadfast in her pursuit of the uncatchable") that reads as authorial gloss rather than Eliza's lived idiom under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Syntax varies purposefully and clarity is high; spatial choreography (tavern corner, barrels, back room, door) tracks cleanly. The piece suffers from mild paraphrase loops: "curiously steadfast in her mission" echoes "curiously steadfast in her pursuit"; "the sound of betrayal was safely contained within the antique watch fob" repeats the capture already shown. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she observed," "she watched") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent and do not obscure immediacy. The final paragraph stacks summary ("succeeded where others would have failed," "the uncatchable," "comforting unease of her unique collection") where a concrete image would sharpen closure, triggering a minor line-level deduction for thematic echo and summary opacity at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—capturing trust's sound with a magical fob in a pirate market—offers a fresh, lyric angle, but the emotional and plot mechanics follow a familiar "trickster outsmarts rivals" template without transformation. The three-approach structure (easy failure, middling success, final trick) reads as checklist execution rather than an earned synthesis; the lieutenant's betrayal is coincidentally convenient, not Eliza's insight. The watch fob's mechanism and the "sound of trust breaking" remain abstract rather than grounded in lived sensory or moral specificity, and the ending's self-congratulatory tone ("succeeded where others would have failed") undercuts any risky ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Eliza is present throughout and her choices (whisper to pirate, plant suspicion, deliver false message) create the key turns; she drives all three beats and the ending. Introduced in the opening, she shapes middle tactics and closure participation is direct (extends the fob, captures the sound, slips away). However, her decisions are competent rather than conflicted—no visible cost or trade-off ties her choices to forfeit, so causal pressure is moderate rather than indispensable. Swappability is low (the role fits the moonshiner heritage anchor), but the lack of on-page struggle or price holds the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in the opening ("clutched," "gears clicking"), returns at mid-story ("gripping the watch fob tighter"), and is extended at closure to capture the sound—three distinct beats with lyric reprise. Its "key to the market's inner sanctum" and sound-recording properties are unique, not generic, and the final image depends on it. However, the fob's mechanics are asserted rather than shown constraining her tactics (she never tunes it, tests it, or risks its failure), so causal pressure and cost connection remain moderate. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, earning mid-6 range, but the lack of visible trade-off or failure risk prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Truce of hush" is named in the opening ("no blood will be spilled on these planks") and Eliza "intended to break that truce," but her actions never visibly fracture the agreement on the page—she departs "before the first shot was fired," so the breaking occurs off-stage after her exit. The concept frames stakes thematically but does not constrain her choices or alter tactics; it could be removed with minor edits (generic "tense market" would function identically). Functional but replaceable, trending mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" appears twice as a label ("curiously steadfast in her mission," "curiously steadfast in her pursuit") but never manifests as a trait that enables or constrains action with cost. Eliza's persistence is shown through her three approaches, yet the attribute itself remains ornamental—no moment where steadfastness conflicts with caution, forces a price, or narrows options. Present but without mechanical weight, scoring low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Thwart" is realized through Eliza's deception campaign: she thwarts Malachi by exposing his lieutenant's betrayal, forcing the alliance to shatter. This action drives the middle beats (whispers, note) and the closure turn (trust captured). Setup and payoff are clear, and the mechanics are specific to her goal. However, the thwarting is solved via coincidence (the lieutenant happened to be the betrayer), lowering irreplaceability slightly; a different betrayal vector could achieve similar results. Two-beat involvement and closure linkage push into low-7s, but the convenience friction and moderate cost prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"False starts" is named in paragraph nine and demonstrated on the page: Eliza's first approach (burly pirate) is "her first false start," and her second (Malachi's second-in-command) is partial success, setting up the final successful gambit. The method is signaled by name, shapes her tactics across two distinct attempts, and the structure (fail, seed, succeed) is taught and followed. However, each start succeeds or advances her goal without real cost or obstacle—"false" reads as planned increments rather than genuine failures, reducing causal pressure. Setup and development are met; closure linkage is indirect (the final move completes the sequence but does not reprise the method). Lyric echo and two-beat involvement place it in mid-5s, capped by swappability (generic "trial and error" would function similarly).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is introduced immediately, anchors all action, and provides spatial beats (tavern corner, barrels, back room, door). The setting's hidden, illicit nature frames stakes (truce, smugglers) and the final image includes "emerged from beneath the pier" as she exits at sunrise, so setup and closure participation are met. However, the environment never constrains Eliza's movement or supplies resources that alter tactics—she navigates freely without physical or social friction. Micro-setting (watch fob, body) charges closure more than the pier itself. Two-beat involvement and closure presence earn mid-6s, but lack of causal pressure or tactical constraint prevents higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is declared in paragraph five and the ending notes "first rays of sunrise painted the sky," bracketing the action. However, time never tightens Eliza's choices on the page—no moment where the approaching deadline forces haste, error, or trade-off. The phrase "time was slipping through her fingers" is told but not dramatized through urgency or cost. Setup and payoff gates are met (named early, present at closure), but the element remains ornamental rather than causal. Functional but replaceable, trending high-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation—capture the sound of trust breaking—is introduced early, explained ("a silence that screams"), and drives all three tactical beats (whispers, note). Eliza extends the fob at closure to record the sound, so setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested by a competing want; she pursues it without friction, cost, or doubt. The motivation shapes tactics but lacks the internal trade-off or visible price that would demonstrate "friction between wants and costs." Two-beat involvement and closure linkage place it in low-6s, but absence of dramatized conflict caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named twice ("the comforting unease of the market settled around her," "the comforting unease of her unique collection") but functions as label rather than modulated atmosphere. The tone remains stable—observant, controlled—without shifting under pressure or charging the final image with fresh emotional texture. The phrase recurs at closure, meeting setup and payoff, but the emotional effect is told rather than embodied through rhythm, diction, or sensory contradiction. Lyric reprise without development or causal pressure trends mid-4s.</comment>
