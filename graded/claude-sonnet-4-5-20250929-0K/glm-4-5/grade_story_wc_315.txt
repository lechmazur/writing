<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The pattern seeker remains abstract throughout—we get labels ("attentively inventive") but few contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Interiority leans on stock phrases ("heart quicken with dread," "mind raced with possibilities") rather than character-particular embodiment. The choice to transmit at the end feels inevitable from role rather than earned by internal conflict with visible cost. Muscle-memory and parachute-buckle details gesture toward embodiment but never constrain a difficult micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive slowly and remain vague past 120 words; "nocturnal arbor above the clouds" and "pattern seeker" are high-concept labels without spatial grounding. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative phrasing ("another night," "timeless echo," recurrent buckle mentions) suggests textural mode, yet no cadence shift or density break reweights the stake at closure. The ending transmission is declared urgent but we never see the cost paid or a tactical option foreclosed on the page; closure reads as duty fulfilled rather than a resonant reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The arbor-above-clouds premise is evocative but remains postcard-level; we get "thin atmosphere," "hanging homes," and "cloud sea" without tactile constraints that alter the watcher's choices. The parachute buckle appears repeatedly but functions as symbol rather than tool—it never limits movement or enables a tactic under pressure. Spatial choreography within the observation nest is unclear (receiver, keypad, tether positions never cohere into a legible workspace). The setting charges the final image thematically but does not constrain the protagonist's agency in a way that would push this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("preserve trust under pressure") is signaled early but remains abstract; we see atmospheric anomalies and an emergency protocol yet no on-page reversal that narrows live options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The emergency tether reach and transmission represent competent response rather than escalation driven by protagonist agency. Coincidence (the anomaly arriving tonight) complicates but the watcher's action—transmitting the message—feels like role execution rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No credible loss (time, trust, safety margin) alters later tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Watcher's burden" and "trust under pressure" recur frequently but remain thematic assertions rather than emergent particulars. The piece avoids overt moralizing at the end, which helps, yet the final transmission offers no non-literal answer to the central question—it completes the duty cycle without reweighting prior material through image or irony. The parachute buckle and muscle-memory motifs gesture toward embodied meaning but their recurrence feels decorative (token symbolic object) rather than a pattern that constrains choice or charges closure. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; most pressure is told through abstract stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is generic "watcher" voice rather than character-particular—diction like "catastrophic consequences," "irrefutable data," "inescapable conclusions" feels elevated and interchangeable across any sentinel role. Under peak stress (emergency protocol recognized) the prose does not compress or shift rhythm in a voice-motivated way; template cadence and synonym loops ("pattern seeker," "midnight pattern seeker," "watcher") flatten urgency. Free-indirect phrasing is clean but the narrative certainty exceeds what one isolated observer can know ("community below slept soundly," "civilization remained precariously balanced") without dramatized inference cues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "parachute buckle" recurs across seven paragraphs with decorative rephrasing; "attentively inventive" and "remembering through muscle memory" are restated almost identically; "after the radio static cleared" bookends without added pressure. Sentence stems repeat mechanically ("The watcher's burden," "The parachute buckle," "Remembering through muscle memory"). Figurative language in most beats without payoff: "soundless echo," "silent language of celestial patterns," "infinite puzzle scattered across eternity" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen sense. Information density is low—adjacent paragraphs restate the same vigilance/trust/burden concept without advancing situation or choice. These artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph includes another "parachute buckle" mention and "watcher's burden" restatement), triggering the −1.7 band and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The lone-watcher-in-perilous-sky-station premise is familiar (orbital-station or lighthouse-keeper templates); the story does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or specific lived detail that would make removal of setting impossible. Emotional specificity is limited—"heart quicken with dread," "trust rested on shoulders" are generic beats. The parachute buckle and muscle-memory elements hint at fresh inflection but remain ornamental rather than causally indispensable. No bold structural risk; the piece follows a linear vigilance → anomaly → transmission arc without complication or turn that grows from character flaw.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present throughout by role label; makes the final transmission decision but that choice feels inevitable from duty rather than a turn driven by internal conflict. Observes and decodes but does not face a dilemma where one path is foreclosed with visible cost. Swappable with "sentinel" or "watcher" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mentioned in six beats but handled only once ("tightened"); other appearances are static description or metaphor ("caught moonlight," "weight against palm"). Returns at closure but as decorative anchor rather than reweighted tool. Does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; no evolving use across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Frames the stake early and recurs across multiple beats; the concept of burden shapes the watcher's sense of duty. However, it never narrows options on the page—no moment where burden conflicts with safety or forces a trade-off. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure mention, satisfying two gates and reaching the lyric-reprise threshold, but lacks causal pressure that would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Label appears twice ("attentively inventive by nature," "Attentively inventive, they sketched...") but neither instance shows the trait constraining or enabling action with cost. The sketching and arranging of evidence read as competent watcher tasks, not inventive problem-solving under pressure. Easily removable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: sketching diagrams, arranging celestial evidence, and preparing the transmission. These actions fit the role but are not decisive turns—swappable with "analyze," "interpret," or "update" without altering the arc. The revision of expectations is told rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a prior plan. Present across beats but lacks irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Signaled in two beats: encrypted keypad use and emergency tether reach. The mechanic (body recalls under pressure) is described but does not shape a choice or reveal a cost—fingers "flew" and hands "reached instinctively" without friction or trade-off. Present in setup and middle, contributing to one key action, but the method's automaticity prevents it from driving tension or altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Framed early and returns across beats; "thin atmosphere," "hanging homes," "cloud sea" establish the elevated realm. However, the arbor never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome—no moment where altitude, wind, or limited oxygen alters the watcher's options. Functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure mention, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The phrase appears twice (title-like opening and final beat) but does not function as a ticking clock. Time remains vague—"another night," "stretched before them"—and the clearing of static does not tighten decisions or force faster action. The timeframe is present but does not alter tactics or escalate pressure; easily replaceable with "at midnight" or "when dawn neared."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stated explicitly in the decoded message and reflected across vigilance beats. The motivation frames the watcher's duty and recurs in closure ("making others believe"). However, it is told more than dramatized—no on-page moment where preserving trust conflicts with safety or another value, forcing a visible trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and closure, contributing to one key choice (transmitting despite uncertainty), which satisfies two gates and reaches the lower edge of essential participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The phrase "soundless echo" appears twice and the story maintains a quiet, atmospheric register ("whispering secrets," "silent language"). However, tone does not modulate with pressure—the prose remains at the same elevated, abstract pitch when the emergency protocol arrives as during routine observation. The tone charges the setting thematically but does not tighten or shift cadence at closure to reweight the final image. Present across beats but static.</comment>
