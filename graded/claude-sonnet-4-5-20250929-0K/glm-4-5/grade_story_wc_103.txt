<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to discover the texture of time") but never tested by a concrete on-page choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstractions ("quaking reverie," "liminal space") and thesaurus labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final "merge with the garden" reads as event-happening-to-her rather than agency; no foreclosed path or earned transformation appears. Emotional states are asserted ("terrifying yet intoxicating") without physiological grounding or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece opens without anchoring who, where, or when by ~120 words—"hedge maze designer" and "living bridge garden" appear but remain abstract placeholders; apply Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and cap Q3 at 7.0. Drive lens remains ambiguous throughout: the halo fragment introduces accumulative imagery (fading photographs, time texture) but no pattern is taught by midpoint, and the ending "disintegrate as she merged" lacks legible cost or a before/after stance shift—neither DC, RR, nor CR lands on the page. Causality is ruptured by the fragment's second appearance ("glinting in the moonlight, though none could say where it had come from") and the garden's unexplained response to Elara's "altered state." No meaningful tightening occurs; scenes loop through similar acts of discovery without narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Spatial anchors appear late and remain vague—"center of her creation," "living bridge garden"—without concrete texture until paragraph three. Sensory detail is largely visual and generic ("vibrant green tendrils," "iridescent properties"); the garden's "breathing" movements and hyperbolic geometry are declared but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final "disintegrate" image involves the body but does not charge the closure with environmental cost. Because the Orientation Test penalty was applied in Q2, Q3 is capped at 7.0 per the global rule; however, the piece does not approach that ceiling due to thin grounding and ornamental use of the setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is declared in paragraph ten but never narrows options or forces a trade-off. The halo fragment's first touch causes retrocognitive visions, but Elara experiences them passively; no reversal or tightening choice appears on the page. The second encounter repeats the pattern without escalation: she "placed the fragment at the center" and "activated it through hyperbolic geometry principles" (summary-only agency), then merges without visible cost or a crystallized stance. Coincidence (the fragment's reappearance) resolves rather than complicates. No price is legible at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in multiple places: "time wasn't linear but a complex tapestry," "the living bridge garden was more than plants and structure—it was a physical manifestation of time itself." The fading photographs and halo fragment are labeled as meaningful rather than dramatized through choice. The final merge offers no resonant reweighting or non-literal answer—only abstract dissolution. No earned wisdom arises from specific struggle; instead, the text tells us "its wisdom remained, changing forever how she would design." Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5) for prompt-like thesis statements replacing scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is held, but psychic distance drifts: "none could say where it had come from" injects omniscient commentary mid-scene without voice justification. Diction toggles between academic ("hyperbolic geometry," "retrocognitively") and generic fantasy ("otherworldly light," "iridescent properties") without a consistent perceptual signature. Filter-verb clusters in high-pressure beats ("she could almost touch," "she felt as if") dull immediacy. Paragraph twenty-seven's "Elara felt herself being pulled" summarizes the climax rather than dramatizing it. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs seven and fourteen both describe fading photographs/memories; paragraphs six and twenty-seven both narrate "retrocognitively trapped." Template cadence runs appear in the early garden description ("Each bridge seemed… responding… with subtle movements") and the vision sequence ("She reached out… only for it to disintegrate… The experience was terrifying yet intoxicating"). Stock metaphors ("tapestry woven from infinite possibilities," "threads that connected yesterday to tomorrow") cluster without fresh inflection. Figurative density in the halo-touch beat (paragraphs 5–9) lacks coherent vehicle: light "bends," time has "texture," consciousness "floats"—mixed registers that reduce clarity. Apply patterned-artifact penalty (−1.0) for loops, template stems, and stock strings; total deduction ~−1.4 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (mystical-time-artifact + maze-designer) closely matches widely used fantasy templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; apply Derivative Premise adjustment (−0.8). Hyperbolic geometry and living bridges are mentioned but never operationalized in choice or constraint—they remain ornamental jargon. The ending "merge with the garden" echoes dissolution tropes without a fresh angle. No bold risk-taking or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight; the arc is interchangeable with generic mystical-vision plots.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara is named and her profession frames the setting, but her choices do not create key turns. She touches the fragment (passive consequence follows), walks paths, sketches designs off-page, and returns to place the fragment—all reactive or summary moves. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Present in setup and ending, absent from middle causal beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in three beats: initial discovery (paragraph 5), post-vision reflection (paragraph 22, "was gone"), second appearance (paragraph 33, "appeared again"), and final placement (paragraph 36). However, its mechanics remain unexplained and its use is summary-only ("activated it through hyperbolic geometry principles"). It enables visions but does not constrain choice or carry visible cost. Functional presence across beats but swappable with any mystical artifact; no irreplaceable specificity charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Fading photographs appear as imagery in the retrocognitive visions (paragraphs 7, 14, 26) and in Elara's documentation (paragraph 29: "The photographs themselves began to fade"). They illustrate the theme but do not shape stakes or tactics—Elara never chooses between preserving/losing a photograph, nor does their fading alter her approach. Present in setup and middle as ornament; closure focuses on the garden merge, not the photographs. Logically consistent but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is named twice (paragraphs 6, 27) and describes the visions, but the trait does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. Elara passively experiences the state; no on-page choice exploits or resists it. The second mention is a paraphrase loop rather than a causal reprise. Label-only use without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Disintegrate" appears three times: the memory dissolving (paragraph 8), the present threatening to disintegrate (paragraph 16), and Elara's body beginning to disintegrate at closure (paragraph 37). The final instance is pivotal to the ending image and could not be easily swapped. However, it arrives as event-happening-to-her rather than driven by her agency, and no cost is articulated—does she resist, accept, transcend? The closure beat lacks felt consequence. Shapes the final image but without causal pressure or visible price; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned in four paragraphs (3, 13, 25, 36) but never operationalized. Paragraph thirteen claims she "began to navigate the temporal landscape, walking paths that folded time" (summary-only), and paragraph thirty-six states she "activated it through hyperbolic geometry principles" without showing how. The method remains jargon without mechanics that shape attempts or constrain tactics. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is present throughout: opening paragraphs establish it, middle paragraphs note it "responded to her altered state" and changed post-encounter (paragraphs 12, 28), and the ending places the fragment "at the center of her maze design" within the garden (paragraph 36). However, the garden does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—it is a backdrop that reacts rather than a constraint. The plant patterns (paragraph 28) are described but do not alter Elara's tactics. Functional across beats but does not drive turns; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated explicitly in paragraph ten and restated in paragraph twenty-three ("her own obsession with understanding time's texture"). The motivation frames her study and return to the garden, but no on-page choice dramatizes conflict between this desire and a competing cost—does she risk safety, relationships, sanity? The piece tells us she was "motivated" but never stages friction. Setup and middle mention; absent from closure as a dramatized stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is named twice (paragraphs 9, 32) to describe the vision state. Tone remains static—mystical and abstract—across beats without modulation tied to escalating pressure. The final paragraph maintains the same register as the opening; no cadence shift or intensification charges the closure image. The phrase itself is ornamental label-speak rather than embodied texture. Present as tag, not as enacted atmosphere that evolves with stakes.</comment>
