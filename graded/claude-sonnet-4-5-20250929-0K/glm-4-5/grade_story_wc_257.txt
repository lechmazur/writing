<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena is rendered entirely through summary and abstraction—"her hands ceasing their work," "grief consumed her entirely"—without a single embodied choice or contradictory impulse dramatized in scene. The entire narrative operates as retrospective exposition; no present-tense pressure tests motivation. Internal conflict is claimed ("once stilled by grief, now moved constantly") but never shown acting simultaneously. The transformation from broken to healer is asserted across paragraphs without visible cost or micro-choices that reveal competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure: the piece summarizes Elena's past transformation and ongoing work without a decisive change, stance crystallization, or conceptual repricing occurring in narrative present. The entire text is retrospective telling—"had been," "had found," "would sit"—with no forward pressure or tightening. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (we learn "Elena" and "mourning jewelry maker" late in paragraph one, location vague until paragraph three). The piece reads as character sketch rather than story with a legible before/after.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory is described with vivid metaphoric texture ("dome revealed...pathways of souls," "curtains of intention"), but remains conceptual decoration rather than a constraint that shapes choice. No spatial choreography: Elena's movements through alcoves, workbench, and dome are told in habitual summary without concrete navigation. The phoenix stencil and origami are mentioned as objects but never handled or used to alter a present tactic. Sensory detail is generic ("soft, warm glow," "ancient, starlit walls").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>No escalation: the piece recounts Elena's past grief and current routine without on-page pressure or a tightening choice. Stakes are declared ("to teach withering to bloom again") but never tested; visitors arrive and leave in summary. No reversal, deepening, or meaningful consequence occurs in narrative present. Agency is absent—Elena's actions are habitual rituals described in iterative past/conditional tense ("would sit," "would fold") rather than singular decisions with visible cost. The retrospective frame forecloses dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("teaching withering to bloom") is stated overtly multiple times rather than emerging from concrete beats: "to teach withering to bloom again," "proving that even the most withered souls could find renewal." The final paragraph summarizes the moral ("she was no longer just...a beacon") instead of landing a resonant image. Subtext is absent—every thematic claim is narrated directly. The phoenix motif is mentioned but not causally linked to a present choice or reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but psychic distance remains static and summarizing throughout—no modulation under pressure because no present pressure exists. Diction is elevated and uniform ("subdued ardor," "reverent, steady hands"), reading as authorial commentary rather than character-particular perception. The narrative reports Elena's internal state ("her heart still carried the weight") without embodied texture or perceptual signature. Retrospective telling dominates; no moment of close focalization reveals how Elena notices or prioritizes in real time.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "genuinely artificial—crafted from metals and stones rather than organic matter" restates the modifier; "subdued ardor—a quiet passion" immediately glosses itself; "ancient and modern...ancient, starlit walls" recycles descriptors. Template cadence runs across paragraphs (nine sentences begin with "The/Her/Elena's/She"). Stock metaphors: "hollow and adrift," "rock bottom," "beacon...in a world of darkness." Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("teach withering to bloom," "curtains of intention") inconsistent with scene-grounded POV. Information density is low—most sentences elaborate a single abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (grief counselor in mystical observatory making symbolic jewelry) assembles familiar comfort-fantasy tropes without transformation. Phoenix-from-ashes symbolism is overt and unearned. "Curtains of intention" and "timeless observatory" read as prompt scaffolding rather than world logic with stakes. The piece avoids risk: Elena's arc is wholly retrospective, conflict is abstract, and the ending summarizes triumph without testing it. No specific synthesis or inflection distinguishes this from template grief-recovery narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Elena is the named character, but she makes no on-page choices. All action is summarized in habitual or past tense; no present decision alters tactics or options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The stencil appears in paragraph six as backstory ("had belonged to her daughter") and is mentioned again in paragraph fourteen ("etched into her memory"), but it is never handled, consulted during a choice, or visibly incorporated into a piece of jewelry on the page. Description only.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" appears twice as atmospheric description (paragraphs four and eleven) without shaping a decision or revealing mechanics. No character thins a curtain or navigates one in scene; the concept remains metaphorical set-dressing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" is glossed in paragraph eight ("crafted from metals and stones rather than organic matter") but does not constrain or enable any action. The phrase is ornamental; the jewelry could be "handmade" or "artisan" with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears in paragraphs nine and fifteen (the telescope's beam, the origami glow). Both instances are summary description; no character performs the action to solve a problem or shift stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Origami figures with coordinates are introduced in paragraph ten and recur in paragraphs eleven, fifteen, and twenty. The method is explained but never enacted in a singular beat—Elena "would fold" and "would place" in habitual summary. Functional across mentions but not dramatized with stakes or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The observatory is present throughout and described with metaphoric detail. It "responds" to Elena's work (paragraph eighteen) and provides alcoves for origami (paragraph fifteen), but no scene shows it constraining a choice or altering outcome. The setting supplies atmosphere more than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"After hitting rock bottom" is stated in paragraph two but the entire narrative operates in retrospective summary. No clock or urgent present decision arises from the timeframe; it functions as backstory label only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach withering to bloom again" is named in paragraph twelve and echoed in the final paragraph. It is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between Elena's desire and a conflicting cost or choice. Present but not enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" is named in paragraph thirteen and the prose maintains a consistent quiet, elevated register throughout. Tone is coherent but static—it does not modulate with pressure because no present pressure exists. The final image recycles the tone without charging it with new stakes.</comment>
