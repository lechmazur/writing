<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is present but often told through high-level summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The borrowed memories arrive as abstract images ("a woman's laughter in a mountain meadow") without visceral sensory grounding or micro-choices that reveal character hierarchy. His final gesture mimics the stranger's but the choice carries no visible cost or foreclosed path—he simply repeats the action. Mrs. Gable's brief appearance reads functional rather than as a crucible forcing stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens (stranger's signal → investigation → understanding) with clear anchors by the third paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias mimics the gesture, transforming isolation into connection), but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture, no tactic altered, only a felt shift. The borrowed memories resolve into narrative exposition rather than dramatized pressure that narrows options. The ending image reconfigures the premise but the price is conceptual, not legible in action or consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Nautical twilight, opal dock, and mist are rendered with vivid specificity and consistent sensory detail. The Edelweiss glows at the dock's edge and returns to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. The lighthouse interior and town remain underdeveloped but the dock setting constrains Elias's investigation and the mist supplies the stranger's dissolution, shaping both middle and closure beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (decode the gesture) is signaled early and persists, but escalation reads as accumulation of borrowed memories rather than a tightening choice or narrowed option. Elias experiences visions, investigates gaps, and reaches understanding—yet no live alternative is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The café owner and library records provide clues but do not oppose or complicate; the resolution arrives through passive reception rather than protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (isolation transformed by witnessed encounter, memory as shared burden) emerges from the Edelweiss, borrowed visions, and the mirrored gesture without overt moralizing. The final image—hand raised, mist curling—offers a resonant answer to connection versus solitude. The borrowed memories risk becoming a device rather than lived experience, but the ending reconfigures the lighthouse keeper's eccentric isolation into a conduit for another's suffering, avoiding platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; diction ("moon-bleached bone," "restless spirits") is distinctive and controlled. The borrowed memories are filtered through Elias's lens without head-hopping. Mrs. Gable's brief exchange feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance is consistent, though some passages ("fragments of another life that settled within his consciousness like dust on forgotten shelfs") drift toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the lighthouse keeper's established idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with varied rhythm and strong opening/closing images. Minor template cadence in the borrowed-memory sequence ("images appeared: a woman's laughter… the sharp scent… the taste of…") and one paraphrase loop ("These memories arrived without invitation, fragments of another life" echoes the prior sentence's structure). "Shelfs" is a typo for "shelves." Information density is solid; no major loops or scaffolding obscure causality, but figurative language occasionally clusters without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The borrowed-memories premise and the glowing Edelweiss offer a fresh angle on lighthouse-keeper isolation, but the execution leans toward familiar mystical-encounter templates. The stranger's dissolution into mist and the memories arriving "softly persistent" read as stock supernatural motifs. The final gesture's transformation of isolation into connection is thematically coherent but the emotional arc (eccentric keeper witnesses stranger, receives visions, understands, repeats gesture) follows predictable beats without bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias observes the stranger, investigates the dock, experiences borrowed memories, and mimics the final gesture. He appears in setup, drives the middle investigation, and performs the closure action. His choices shape the arc but remain reactive—he receives visions and decodes rather than facing a trade-off. The keeper's eccentric habits (meticulous records, star conversations) are noted but do not constrain or enable a key beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Edelweiss appears where the stranger stood, is picked up and examined, noted as originating from distant mountains, and placed on the dock's edge in the final image where it glows and is encircled by mist. It touches three beats (discovery, investigation clue, closure reprise) and its alpine origin matters to the borrowed-memory narrative. Removing it would break the physical link to the stranger and the final image's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Borrowed memories flood Elias's mind, provide investigation clues (café coffee, ship cracking, mountain meadow), and resolve into the stranger's complete narrative. They shape the middle investigation and prime the closure understanding. However, they arrive passively and do not force a tactical choice or visible cost—Elias sorts them in "silent pauses" but his duties and actions continue unchanged. The concept drives knowledge rather than altering options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" describes the borrowed memories' arrival but remains a label without on-page constraint or tradeoff. The trait does not enable or foreclose an action; Elias experiences the visions while "continuing his duties" without visible friction. The attribute is mentioned once and does not recur or shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Investigation (observing gaps, library records, café inquiry) occupies the middle sequence and leads to the closure understanding. Elias's choice to investigate is signaled early ("determined to decode") and his findings assemble the stranger's story. The action is essential to knowledge progression, but could be swapped for other detective methods (asking townsfolk, examining records) without structural loss. It drives one major turn but not the final gesture itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is signaled ("determined to investigate by observing gaps") and demonstrated through three specific absences: no town recognition of Edelweiss, no ship-loss records, café silence about strangers. The method shapes the middle investigation and its mechanics matter to the borrowed-memory assembly. It appears in setup and middle development but does not directly constrain the closure gesture—understanding arrives, then Elias acts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal dock in mist is the site of the stranger's appearance, Elias's investigation, and the final gesture. It appears in the opening, middle descent, and closure placement of the Edelweiss. The mist enables the stranger's dissolution and curls around the flower at the end, charging the final image. The dock's edge and the fog's iridescence are specific and irreplaceable, though the setting does not constrain a tactical choice—it stages rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Nautical twilight frames both the stranger's appearance and the final gesture three days later, creating a symmetry that charges the closure. Time is noted but not tracked as a tightening constraint—the "three days later" gap is announced but does not pressure Elias's investigation. The timeframe anchors tone and recurs at closure but does not alter tactics or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>To decode the gesture is stated ("determined to decode the stranger's final gesture"), drives the investigation across beats, and resolves in the final understanding and mirrored action. The motivation is present in setup, middle, and closure. However, it reads as a puzzle to solve rather than a conflicted want versus need—no friction between costs, no visible sacrifice to pursue it. The desire shapes the arc but lacks dramatized internal opposition.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Witnessed isolation is coherent throughout: Elias's "isolation had never felt more pronounced," the stranger as "solitary figure," the final "isolation… transform into connection." Tone modulates from unsettled intrigue to "profound human encounter" as pressure deepens. The mist, twilight, and eccentric keeper's voice sustain the mood without static repetition, and the final image ("witnessed only by the sea, the mist, and the stars") charges closure with the tonal stakes intact.</comment>
