<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aris is portrayed through label-only interiority ("mechanically warm," "icy warmth") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. Her motivation to prove sideways time is declared but never faces a credible internal or external pressure that forces a trade-off. The avian specimen's "subdued awakenings" and the final eye-contact moment read as convenient symbolic gestures rather than earned character work. No visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening lines. The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure ("sideways time" demonstrated), but the cost remains abstract—no decision, renunciation, or visible price alters Aris's options or stance on the page. The lever sequence describes procedural steps without a meaningful turn or deepening that narrows choices or reweights the dominant stake. Closure lacks the felt or conceptual cost required under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station and magnetic nexus supply atmospheric detail, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image—they function as backdrop. The "violet skies" bird and twilight cycle are mentioned but do not pressure Aris's actions. Spatial choreography (containment unit, console, levers) remains generic and does not evolve causally with events. Micro-setting potential (tools, console) is untapped; no object or environmental feature forces a tactical shift or stakes recalibration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early (prove sideways time), but no on-page reversal, complication, or tightening tests it. The lever sequence proceeds without opposition, error, or visible price. Aris succeeds without struggle or trade-off; the bird's reaction is passive observation rather than a constraint. No agency-driven escalation or cost legibility appears; the resolution feels declarative rather than earned under the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "sideways time" concept emerges from action and imagery, not overt thesis. However, the final paragraph mechanically summarizes theme ("time moves sideways was only the beginning") rather than letting the image resonate. The recurring "mechanically warm" and "icy warmth" phrases gesture toward thematic integration but remain decorative without constraining Aris's choices or reweighting prior material. The bird's "otherworldly understanding" is asserted, not dramatized with earned friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and free of head-hopping. Narrative distance remains consistent, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("profound connection," "graceful compliance") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Aris's perceptual signature is generic scientist-voice without a distinctive rhythm or bias. No dialogue is present. Purposeful compression is attempted via recurring phrases, but the effect reads as template cadence rather than voice-driven pattern.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "mechanically warm" appears four times, "subdued awakenings" thrice, "magnetic nexus at twilight" four times, "within the hush of beating wings at rest" twice, and "through holographic principles" thrice—each often in adjacent or nearby sentences without added pressure or detail. Template-cadence runs dominate ("Aris [verb], her [noun]..."; "The [ordinal] lever [verb]..."). Stock metaphors ("doors yet unopened," "velocity of discovery") and label-only interiority ("icy warmth coursing through her veins") dull line-level momentum. These artifacts appear throughout, including in the closure paragraph, triggering the high-end artifact penalty (−1.7 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise (consciousness perceiving across parallel timelines via magnetic distortion) resembles widely used soft-SF templates without fresh transformation. Specific lived detail, world logic, or non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate the synthesis is absent. The lever-console-hologram apparatus and the bird's multidimensional awareness are described but not grounded in verifiable or distinctive procedural texture. No bold risk or surprising inflection emerges; the arc follows a predictable proof-of-concept path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aris is present throughout and performs the experimental sequence, but her actions are procedural description rather than choices that create turns. She faces no opposition or complication; the levers respond "with graceful compliance." Removing her obliging trait would not alter the plot. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus at twilight is mentioned in the opening third, manipulated via three lever actions (multiple beats), and returns in the final lines. It enables Aris's experiment and charges the ending image, satisfying all three gates. However, it does not constrain her choices or impose a cost—she succeeds without friction. Functional across beats but without irreplaceability or visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrase "subdued awakenings" recurs three times, framing the bird's behavior as echoes of parallel timelines. It appears in setup and in the protagonist's final realization, but it does not shape on-page tactics or force a choice. The concept remains thematic echo rather than causal driver. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" appears four times as a descriptive label (fingers, hands, glow, reverence) without enabling or constraining any action. No visible trade-off or cost is tied to this attribute on the page. Ornamental use that could be removed without altering causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lever actions structure the experimental sequence across three beats (first adjusts field, second stabilizes matrix, third returns nexus to dormancy). Each lever controls a phase of the demonstration. Removing the lever mechanism would require rewriting the procedure, but the actions themselves do not create reversals or costs—they succeed linearly. Essential to the sequence but not to conflict or closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Through holographic principles" is mentioned in the opening third as Aris's approach and recurs twice more. The method is named but its mechanics do not matter—how holography enables temporal interface manipulation is never specified or tested. The means could be replaced with another technobabble term without altering the plot. Present but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station provides the containment unit, console, and rotating light cycle. These elements are present in setup and used during the experiment, but the setting does not pressure choices or supply constraints that affect outcome. The station functions as neutral backdrop rather than active force. Functional but generic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" bookends the story (opening and late reprise), framing the experiment during the quiet shift when avian specimens sleep. The timeframe provides atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Aris works undisturbed throughout. Lyric reprise without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The desire "to prove that time moves sideways" is signaled in the opening third and drives the experimental sequence. Aris's actions (lever manipulations, data recording) all serve this goal. However, no friction between want and cost appears—she achieves the proof without obstacle or sacrifice. The motivation is clear and sustained but uncontested. Shapes one extended beat without conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" appears twice as a descriptor of Aris's emotional state (mixture of detachment and excitement; moment of connection with the bird). The tone label does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—it remains a static oxymoron. Present but ornamental.</comment>
