<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marina's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("drifting and moored," "periodically eternal") rather than embodied contradiction. The tapping rhythm is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or reveals character under pressure—it remains ornamental. Her realization in the third night arrives through summary ("the realization came suddenly") without dramatized resistance or visible cost that forecloses a path. Motivation is declared ("discover the truth of these disappearances") but never tested by an on-page dilemma where competing goods force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear late: "who" is clear by name, but "where" (monitoring station's relation to land/shelf) and "when" (post-ban timeline) remain vague until deep into the piece. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—Marina observes, taps, cross-references—but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the "realization" is told, not earned by prior pressure. Closure offers a Conceptual Repricing (Earth returning to pre-industrial state) but the cost is abstract and societal, not felt or visible in Marina's choices on the page. The final image of logging data lacks the charge needed to reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The monitoring station provides concrete anchors (concrete wall, railing, floorboards, computer screens) and the moored position at the continental shelf shapes Marina's observational role. Sensory detail is selective—saltwater tears, crashing waves, digital coastlines bleeding—but remains descriptive rather than constraining a choice. The torn atlas page and satellite data guide her research but do not alter tactics or charge the final image; the station functions as backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"why some paths disappear"—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that narrows options. Marina's work is observational; she cross-references, taps, assembles clues, but no reversal or complication forces her to trade one value for another. The "delayed revelation" functions as theme rather than pressure; the realization arrives through summary in paragraph five without visible cost. Escalation is absent under the Accumulative lens: density does not increase, no pattern breaks, and the final act of logging data carries no felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of planetary cycles reclaiming territory emerges clearly from Marina's observations and the contrast between the torn atlas and current coastlines. "Periodically eternal" and "delayed revelation" operate as prompt-label echoes rather than discoveries earned by concrete particulars. The final paragraph risks moralizing ("their time had passed in the great cycle of planetary existence") and over-explains rather than trusting the image to resonate. The piece engages complexity—nature's resilience versus human intervention—but the resolution is told, not embodied in a final image that reweights prior stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature is consistent—Marina's rhythm-tapping, her coral-bleaching lens—but diction drifts into elevated register ("the great cycle of planetary existence," "archive of change") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled except in the final paragraph, where narrative certainty oversteps Marina's knowledge ("the sea, periodically eternal, held its secrets"). Filter verbs ("feeling," "knowing," "watching") occasionally dull immediacy but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue appears; internal voice is coherent but lacks the rhythmic compression or specificity needed for high-band scores.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Multiple template-cadence runs flatten momentum: "Her fingers paused… Her fingers resumed… Marina's fingers continued… Marina's fingers continued… her fingers rhythmically one last time." Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent sentences (e.g., "observation and study" / "patient observation," "slowly returning" / "reclaiming"). Stock metaphors ("schools of fish," "watercolors left in the rain") and the phrase "periodically eternal" recurs four times without evolving meaning. Sanctuary phrasing ("whispered of deeper changes," "ancient rhythm of change") elevates register without adding pressure. These artifacts combine for baseline −1.0 in Q7; no single issue touches closure directly but the accumulation dulls line-level propulsion throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—scientist at a monitoring station after a fossil fuel ban observes ongoing planetary change—is functional but not fresh; the environmental-witness frame is widely used. The piece transforms the template through specific coral-bleaching history and the torn atlas device, but the realization (Earth returning to pre-industrial state) arrives as exposition rather than a non-obvious synthesis earned in scene. The tapping rhythm and "periodically eternal" refrain feel ornamental rather than integrated into a bold structural or perspectival choice. Marina's passivity and the lack of a dilemma that tests her values keep the story in safe, observational territory without meaningful risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marina is present throughout and her coral-bleaching observations anchor her expertise, but her role is purely observational—no on-page decision alters tactics or stakes. The character's choices do not create key turns; the realization is told in summary rather than dramatized through choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The torn atlas page appears in paragraph two (setup), is cross-referenced with satellite data in paragraph four (development), and is folded into her journal in paragraph six (payoff), touching three beats. However, it remains a prop for observation; Marina does not handle it in a way that constrains choice or charges the final image. The object is functional but swappable with any visual comparison device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Delayed revelation" is named explicitly by Professor Aris and frames Marina's realization, but it operates as theme rather than shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics. The concept is echoed rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options; it remains label-level rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears four times as a descriptor for coral cycles, tides, and planetary rhythms, but it never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. The attribute is thematic decoration rather than a trait that forces a trade-off or shapes tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Marina assembles clues from the torn map and satellite data across paragraphs three and four, and the action is tied to her realization in paragraph five. However, the assembling is told in summary ("began to assemble the clues," "cross-referenced") rather than dramatized beat-by-beat; no major turn traces specifically to this action. It could be replaced with "analyze" or "compare" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The tapping rhythm appears in five paragraphs (setup, development, payoff), but its mechanics never matter—Marina taps to calm thoughts, match wave rhythms, or form patterns, yet the practice does not enable a tactic or constrain a choice. It remains a gestural tic without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The monitoring station provides the concrete setting (concrete wall, railing, floorboards, computer screens) and its moored position at the continental shelf frames Marina's observational role. It supplies the equipment and data that drive her realization, touching setup, development, and payoff. However, the station does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is essential context but not a crucible that pressures decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The post-ban timeframe is established in paragraph one and motivates the contrast between past and present coastlines, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Time operates as backdrop—"two decades," "since childhood," "third night without sleep"—without shaping Marina's tactics or imposing a deadline that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Marina's desire "to discover why some paths disappear" is stated explicitly in paragraph three and drives her assembly of clues, but the motivation is never dramatized through a choice that forces friction between wants and costs. The realization arrives through observation rather than a dilemma that tests her values; told-only dominates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" is stated explicitly in paragraph five ("feeling both drifting and moored") and the tone of observational melancholy is coherent throughout. However, the tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure; no escalation charges the final image. The closing lines maintain the same reflective register without a cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>
