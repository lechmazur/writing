<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"the prism-song bell ringer" is a title, not a person with embodied emotion or contradictory impulses. Interiority consists of generic philosophical musings ("texture of connection," "acoustic landscape of human history") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. No micro-choices with visible cost appear; she places a lens, activates a device, and smiles—actions without stakes or internal friction. The final paragraph loops back to initial abstractions without earned change or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test waiver does not apply: who/where/when are present but stakes remain vague well past 120 words. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs—the protagonist begins curious and ends curious with no foreclosed path or visible cost. The piece reads as a static meditation rather than a narrative arc; the miner's song discovery produces no tightening of options or reweighting of her quest. Drive lens is ambiguous (accumulative texture is suggested but no cadence shift or density break materializes at closure); applying −0.4 in Q2 and capping at 7.2 per the lens-ambiguity rule, though the deeper issue is absence of closure, which pulls the score lower.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The laboratory is described vividly (cavernous space, golden shadows, high windows, dust motes) and the carbide lamp lens functions as a micro-setting object. However, setting does not constrain choice or alter tactics—the protagonist moves freely without spatial friction. The lens is placed on a resonator plate, but proximity and access are never in question. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, filtered through a generic elevated register rather than the protagonist's professional or personal priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—"to discover the texture of connection"—is abstract and never tested by on-page pressure. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the protagonist's quest proceeds without obstacle, sacrifice, or trade-off. The miner's song discovery is presented as a revelation but costs nothing and forecloses no option. Coincidence does not complicate; the device simply works, delivering an acoustic memory that requires no agency or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("connection across time," "questioning assumptions") is stated overtly rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The final image—picking up another artifact—gestures toward continuation but does not reweight prior material with cost or offer a non-literal answer to the central question. The carbide lens hums as a token motif but does not constrain choice or charge the closure. Subtext is minimal; ideas are declared ("What if the cacophony of industrial progress contained melodies...") rather than embodied in gesture or implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent but generic-elevated, lacking perceptual signature or character-particular diction. Phrases like "acoustic landscape of human history" and "tapestry of human experience" read as thesaurus-driven rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is stable but uniform; no modulation under emotional pressure occurs because no pressure is dramatized. The prose carries a committee texture—smoothed, explanatory, and interchangeable—rather than reflecting a singular mind under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "prism-song bell ringer" appears seven times, "artificial pilgrimage" five times, "texture of connection" four times, "powerfully gentle" three times, "golden shadows" recurs without functional shift. Sentences follow repetitive stem patterns ("The prism-song bell ringer [verb]..." × 4 instances; "There were still so many [noun] to [verb]..." closes with a list). Figurative density is high without payoff—"cathedral of resonance," "tapestry of human experience," "tiny spirits"—muddling clarity in what should be a moment of discovery. Applying −1.4 for template cadence, paraphrase loops, and stock metaphor strings across multiple beats; final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (sound archaeologist retrieves lost acoustic memories) is familiar and executed without fresh angle or transformation. Emotional arc and plot would function identically with different names and setting (transformation test fails). The miner's carbide lamp lens is introduced but not leveraged for unique properties—any artifact would serve. Turns feel procedural rather than arising from character-driven causality. Risk-averse choices throughout: no moral calculus, no bold structural deviation, no counter-intuitive synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The prism-song bell ringer is present throughout but makes no key choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She places a lens, activates a device, listens, smiles, and picks up another artifact—observation and procedural action without decision pressure. Setup is present (first paragraph) but middle development and closure participation are ornamental; she does not wrestle with competing options or pay a visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The miner's carbide lamp lens appears in setup (paragraph 4), is placed on the resonator (paragraph 13), vibrates and releases sound (paragraph 15), and hums at the end (paragraph 23). Two beats involve handling, but the lens's unique properties (clouded surface, ability to focus light, crystalline structure) do not constrain choice or enable tactics under stress. It functions as a trigger for acoustic playback rather than a causal agent. Swappable with any artifact containing residual sound; no specific cost is tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Artificial pilgrimage" is labeled five times but never dramatized as shaping stakes or tactics. The concept appears in summary ("This quest had become an artificial pilgrimage," "her artificial pilgrimage continued") without altering on-page options or imposing friction. It echoes as theme rather than driving conflict; removing the phrase would not change the protagonist's actions or the story's arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" appears three times as a descriptor ("powerfully gentle touch" × 2, "powerfully gentle nature of discovery") but does not constrain or enable action with cost. No on-page moment shows the attribute creating a trade-off—e.g., gentleness preventing force when speed is needed, or power risking damage when delicacy is required. Label-only mentions without visible friction or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Propel" appears twice in late-stage summary ("propel herself into deeper understanding," "propelled by curiosity") but does not define a major turn. The action is metaphorical rather than physical or causal; it could be replaced with "driven" or "motivated" with no structural change. No beat hinges on propulsion as a method or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"By questioning assumptions" is introduced early (paragraph 7: "questioning assumptions about what constituted 'music' or 'noise'") and recurs in paragraph 17 ("by questioning the assumption that objects were merely silent witnesses"). The method is signaled and tied to her discovery that objects hold acoustic memories. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—no scene dramatizes her testing and discarding a prior belief under pressure. Middle development is present (lens placement follows from the assumption-questioning frame) but the method does not shape a climactic choice or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "laboratory of lost sounds" is named in the title and opening, described across multiple beats (cavernous space, devices, high windows, golden light), and returns in the final paragraphs as a "cathedral of resonance." Setup, middle presence, and closure participation are all present. The setting provides the resonator plate that enables the lens experiment, so it supplies a resource that affects outcome. However, the laboratory does not pressure choices—access is unrestricted, tools function without constraint, and no spatial or resource friction arises. The setting decorates rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilizes" appears once in the opening sentence and is never revisited or used to constrain action. No on-page moment shows electrical reliability enabling her work or threatening to fail. The timeframe is ornamental; removing it would not alter any beat. No setup payoff, no middle constraint, no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of connection" is stated in paragraph 5 and echoed in summary throughout (paragraphs 17, 25). The motivation is present but told rather than dramatized—no scene shows her wrestling with competing desires or paying a cost to pursue this discovery. She experiences no friction between the want and other needs (rest, safety, doubt). The lens discovery satisfies the stated motivation without complication, so the desire does not generate conflict or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The tone "golden shadows" is named in the title and appears in paragraphs 11, 19, and 24, modulating from afternoon light to lengthening evening shadows. The imagery coheres and returns at closure, charging the final scene with a sense of time passing and continuity. However, tone does not shift under pressure—the piece maintains a single static mood (contemplative, reverent) without modulation as stakes rise or fall, because no stakes materialize. The tone decorates rather than responds to conflict.</comment>
