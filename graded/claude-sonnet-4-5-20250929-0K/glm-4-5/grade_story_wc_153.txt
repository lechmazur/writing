<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout ("fierce and tender," "cryptic medium"). Her motivation—to evoke unwritten messages—is stated but never tested by opposing impulses or choices; she moves through the labyrinth without internal friction or cost. The final "I forgive" is declared, not earned through on-page contradiction or renunciation. Embodied emotion is scarce; most feeling is summarized rather than shown through gesture or perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens (shard → warmth → condensation messages) but escalation is shallow; each revelation arrives without narrowing options or raising cost. Orientation is clear by the opening. The closure unit—"I forgive"—lands as a Decisive Change, but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the forgiveness viscerally expensive. The repeated condensation messages feel iterative rather than causally tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, and moonlight are vividly sketched and anchor the single scene well. However, the environment remains scenic; it does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The gargoyle shard and window function as props without spatial friction. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but does not pressure the protagonist's movement through the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the unspoken apology—is signaled early but never narrows options or forces trade-offs. Each condensation message adds information without complication; Elara's path is smooth and unopposed. The final forgiveness occurs without visible cost or a prior choice that forecloses another path. Pressure remains static; no reversal or tightening alters her tactics or stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—communication beyond words, the cost of fear—emerges through the condensation messages and the gargoyle shard's healing arc. The final "I forgive" offers a resonant answer, but the thematic work is somewhat literal and stated ("fierce tenderness," "space between them"). The singing spirits and moonlight motifs recur with purpose, yet the piece skirts explicit moralizing in the penultimate lines ("by understanding, by finding that moment"). No overt label-speak in the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the fierce tenderness of the revelation," "the space between them had been bridged") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's way of noticing does not show distinctive bias. Internal voice and external narration converge under pressure rather than creating friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, but several beats rely on template stems ("The singing spirits circled closer," "The gargoyle shard pulsed"). Figurative language is dense in the final third without pattern-teaching ("fierce tenderness," "moment before deciding" repeated). A paraphrase loop appears: "space between them had been bridged" echoes "communicate beyond words" without added pressure. Information density is moderate; some lines restate rather than advance. The final paragraph summarizes the journey rather than dramatizing a closing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—medium seeks closure through mystical objects and messages—follows familiar paranormal-romance templates without meaningful transformation. The gargoyle shard, singing spirits, and condensation messages function as ornamental magic rather than constraints that shape choices. The "moment before deciding" concept is intriguing but remains abstract; no specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus grounds it. The emotional arc could be transposed to a mundane setting with minor edits, suggesting surface novelty over deep originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal (finding the apology) frames the story. However, she makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or narrow options; she observes messages and reacts without agency. Her final "I forgive" is a realization, not a choice with cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but observation-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shard appears in the opening, is placed on the windowsill mid-story, and returns healed at the end with reweighted meaning (physical healing → emotional healing). It enables the condensation messages indirectly (warmth triggers the moon's magic). However, it does not constrain a choice or create a trade-off; Elara uses it without friction. Three-beat presence with thematic reprise, but lacks causal pressure on protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Unsent letters are the story's conceptual center and shape Elara's motivation. The singing spirits "translate the unsent letters her heart was unable to send," linking the concept to the condensation messages. However, the letters themselves are not dramatized—no scene of writing, withholding, or discovering them. The concept frames stakes but does not alter on-page tactics. Present in setup (told), middle (spirits' song), and ending (delivered in her heart), but mostly thematic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The shard "heals in moonlight" is stated and shown once (cracks repair under moonlight). The healing enables the condensation messages indirectly but does not constrain Elara's choices or create a visible trade-off. No cost or limitation tied to moonlight dependence (e.g., needing to wait, or the moon failing). Present in setup (warmth begins) and ending (fully healed), but label-only in the middle. One causal beat, no cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Evoke" is Elara's stated goal ("to evoke the message she so desperately needed") and describes her action at the heart of the labyrinth ("attempting to evoke not just any message but the truth"). However, the evocation itself is passive—she focuses energy and the messages appear without resistance or technique. The action frames her motivation and recurs at the climax, but it does not drive a reversal or force a choice. Present in setup, middle, and ending; causally relevant but replaceable with "summon" or "call forth."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Condensation messages appear three times: "I'm sorry," "I was afraid," and the imagined "I forgive." The method is signaled early ("condensation began to form"), shapes the middle revelation, and anchors the ending's thematic closure. However, the mechanics are vague—no constraint or cost tied to how the messages form or why they are brief. The method delivers information but does not alter Elara's tactics. Present across all three gates with thematic payoff, but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth is vividly described and houses the spirits and the window. It provides atmosphere and the "heart of the labyrinth" as a goal location. However, the labyrinth does not constrain Elara's choices—no wrong turns, no navigation cost, no disorientation that pressures her. The singing spirits inhabit it but do not oppose or test her. Present in setup, middle (reaching the heart), and ending (exit at dawn); scenic but not tactically essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"The space where an apology waits unspoken" is a conceptual timeframe, not a clock. The story spans one night (moonlight to dawn), but no urgency tightens decisions—Elara could return any night. The temporal frame is poetic and thematically apt but does not alter tactics or escalate pressure. Present as thematic framing throughout, but not a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to find the moment before deciding—the exact instant when everything could have changed" is stated early and returns in the middle and ending. The motivation is conceptually rich and drives her journey into the labyrinth. However, it is never dramatized as a conflicted choice; no friction between this want and another cost or fear. Told motivation present across all gates, but lacks on-page contradiction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" is invoked by name three times and attempts to fuse sorrow with compassion. The tone is consistent through the turns—Elara's grief and hope remain balanced. However, the phrase itself is abstract and asserted rather than embodied in diction or rhythm. The final image (gargoyle warm in her hand, possibility blooming) gestures toward it, but the tone does not modulate under pressure or sharpen the closure. Present and coherent, but label-driven.</comment>
