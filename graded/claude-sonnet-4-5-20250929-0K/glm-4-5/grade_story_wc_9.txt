<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's interior state is heavily labeled rather than embodied—"willingly perplexed," "choking beauty" appear as assertions without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The central realization about lost time is delivered via summary ("she realized") rather than through a dramatized choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final vow to "meet each moment fully" reads as therapeutic self-awareness without the messy irrationality or visible trade-off that would earn the shift. Motives remain abstract throughout; no on-page micro-choice tests competing goods or forces a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous—mixes accumulative/textural (pattern of time imagery) with causal intention (quest structure) but delivers closure via thematic summary rather than a decisive on-page change or charged reconfiguration. The "repentance" and discovery that "lost time accumulates... in the present moment" are told insights, not dramatized reversals that narrow options or impose felt cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early, but the narrative unfolds as a series of summarized revelations rather than because/therefore linkage or cadence shift that reweights stakes. The ending offers wisdom without visible forfeiture or a final image that reconfigures prior material under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The midnight glade above clouds is vividly established with purposeful sensory detail (onyx ink drinking moonlight, mist, clouds beneath). The dolls' tea set saucer crack functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning at closure (repaired with gold leaf). However, the glade itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it serves as backdrop for internal epiphany rather than pressuring the protagonist's options. Spatial choreography is clean, and the body-level interaction with the saucer grounds one key beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete obstacle or trade-off. The cartomancer's journey proceeds without meaningful reversal; she arrives, performs a ritual, and receives the answer without narrowing options or paying a visible price. The "repentance" and vow to be present are asserted rather than dramatized as a choice that forecloses an alternative path. No escalation under any lens—pressure remains static as the narrative delivers thematic wisdom without dramatized consequence or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Theme of time's passage and presence emerges from recurring imagery (saucer crack, traced hands, choking beauty) rather than direct statement. However, the final paragraph moralizes the central question explicitly: "where lost time accumulates is exactly where we choose not to look for it—in the present moment." This thematic echo deflates resonance by stating what the images could have shown. The particulars (dolls' tea set, gold-leaf repair, traced hands) carry potential but are undercut by the explain-everything close that resolves ambiguity into a tidy lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and filter throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—elevated diction (onyx-ink, cloudbound, choking beauty) reflects a lyric sensibility. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("willingly perplexed state transforming into willing surrender") that sits uneasily with scene action. Psychic distance remains appropriate, and the voice carries a distinct texture, but the uniformity of ornate phrasing across emotional peaks flattens urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose carries a consistent lyric register with purposeful vocabulary (onyx-ink, cloudbound, choking beauty) but suffers from ornamental density—most sentences layer figurative language without variation in sentence openings or rhythm ("The cartomancer...," "She...," "Her..."). Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs restate the theme of lost time and presence without advancing pressure. The phrase "choking beauty" recurs four times as a label without evolving specificity. Stock constructions ("heart pounding with... awe and dread," "tears welled in her eyes") replace embodied sensation. Template cadence and repetitive stems dull momentum, especially in the reflective middle third. Grammar and clarity are clean, but information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—a cartomancer seeking lost time in a mystical glade—combines familiar fantasy tropes (mystic quest, ritual revelation) without transformation through specific world logic or character pressure. The resolution (lost time exists in the present moment) echoes widely taught mindfulness wisdom without a fresh angle grounded in the cartomancer's particular expertise or cost. The dolls' tea set and gold-leaf repair carry potential specificity, but the narrative arc itself (journey → ritual → epiphany → return) follows a template structure. Details like "onyx-ink" and "cloudbound repentance" add surface texture without altering the predictable emotional or thematic trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and identified as the protagonist, but her role is largely observational and reactive. She performs a ritual and receives insights, but no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. The vow at the end is asserted, not enacted in a moment that tests competing goods.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears in multiple beats: carried to the glade, handled during the ritual (her fingers connect with the porcelain), returns at closure repaired with gold leaf. The crack's thematic resonance (fragility/resilience) is clear, and the gold-leaf repair reweights its meaning. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—it functions as a charged motif rather than a tactical pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mentioned by name once ("cloudbound repentance had taught her") and echoed thematically (accepting time's passage), but the concept does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The repentance is delivered as a summary insight rather than a choice with visible cost. Functional as theme label, but replaceable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Mentioned three times as a label ("willingly perplexed," "willingly perplexed wonder," "willingly perplexed state") but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. The attribute is asserted rather than shown through a micro-choice under pressure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Central to the ritual beat: "She... must trace hands on birthday tablecloths to unlock the memories compressed within the saucer's fracture." The action is performed and the family custom returns at closure when the daughter's print is added. However, the unfastening occurs passively (cards scatter in the wind; the glade dissolves "as she completed the ritual") without a dramatized choice that alters options. The action shapes two beats and closure participation, but its mechanics are told rather than shown as a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Introduced early ("According to family custom, she must trace hands on birthday tablecloths") and returns at closure when the daughter's hand is traced. The method frames the ritual and gains "new meaning" at the end. However, its mechanics do not constrain or complicate the attempt—it is performed successfully without friction. Two-beat presence and closure linkage, but no causal pressure or visible cost tied to the method itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Established vividly in the opening ("midnight glade above the clouds") and returns at closure ("The midnight glade faded"). The setting provides atmosphere and frames the ritual, but it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—the cartomancer's journey proceeds unimpeded. Early signal, closure participation, but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("After the birth of her daughter, time had grown slippery") and drives the quest motive. The timeframe returns at closure ("Years later, when her daughter celebrated her first birthday") to bookend the arc. However, the birth itself does not tighten on-page decisions or impose a live deadline—it motivates the journey but does not constrain tactics. Early signal, thematic through-line, closure presence, but no felt urgency that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stated early ("She had come to find where lost time accumulates") and sustained as the dominant quest motive. The discovery is delivered on the page ("this was where lost time accumulates—not destroyed, merely compressed"). However, the desire is never conflicted by an on-page trade-off or obstacle that forces a hierarchy of values. Early signal, sustained presence, closure answer provided, but no dramatized friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The phrase "choking beauty" appears four times, anchoring tone across the arc (first in the ritual beat, last in the daughter's first birthday scene). The tone modulates from awe/dread at opening to acceptance at closure. However, the repeated label functions as assertion rather than embodied texture that shifts under pressure—each instance restates rather than deepens the tonal charge. Early signal, recurrence, closure linkage, but static rather than evolving resonance.</comment>
