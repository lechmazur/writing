<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Silas's social perceptiveness is asserted but never demonstrated through concrete misreading or micro-choice under pressure. His motivation ("discover meaning in the mess") remains abstract—the mandala work happens off-stage in summary ("Day after day, he worked"), and the key turn where he "adjusts a spiral of blue sand" to defeat the zealots is told rather than dramatized. The closing collective mandala collapses agency entirely: Silas becomes a passive observer while "new visitors" and "exhaustion" drive events, leaving no visible cost or foreclosed path at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with abstract labels ("the unlearning," "emergent hush," "lilac unease") that remain unanchored in concrete who/where/when past the 120-word gate, triggering orientation debt. The climactic "interject" beat is summarized—"he adjusted a spiral of blue sand… suddenly his creation resonated"—without showing *how* the adjustment works or what Silas risks. Closure disperses into collective activity ("they lay back… whispering gallery tile flakes passed between them") with no single protagonist choice or visible cost; the final paragraph asserts "deep contentment" but offers no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The grotto's mist and stone are mentioned but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—Silas works "with his back to the entrance," yet we never see how the crowd's position or the grotto's acoustics shape his sand-pattern work. The "whispering gallery tile flake" is handled twice (opening, closing) but remains a prop rather than a micro-setting element that pressures the protagonist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess"—is declared but never tested on the page with a visible trade-off. The zealots "loudly announced they would restore order," yet Silas's sand adjustment deflates their anger instantly without escalation or cost: "their anger dissolving into wonder" is a soft reset. The final third devolves into collective mandala-building with no protagonist agency, and the story ends in "deep contentment," a tidy emotional resolution that forecloses nothing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The piece asserts theme repeatedly—"meanings are temporary," "wisdom emerges… from finding patterns within chaos"—rather than letting it arise from concrete events. The closing paragraph moralizes explicitly: "embracing chaos as the beginning of wisdom" and "coexistence between what was known and what remained beautifully mysterious." The mandala motif is introduced mid-story and recurs, but its meaning is explained rather than reweighted by a charged final image; the ending dissolves into abstract "deep contentment" without cost or irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but the voice defaults to elevated abstraction—"emergent hush," "lilac unease," "respectful coexistence"—rather than Silas's concrete perception. The POV withholds how the sand mandala "amplifies the grotto's whispers" and what Silas risks, a purposeless elision that flattens pressure. Diction remains generic literary ("mist-shrouded," "weathered walls") without idiosyncratic texture, and the final collective beats blur focalization without clear head-hop signals, leaving unclear whose "deep contentment" we share.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "old certainties dissolved" / "traditional methods… failed to reveal answers"; "the unlearning continued, but now with a collective acceptance of its purpose" restates the prior beat without new pressure. Template cadence runs stack in the final third: "When exhaustion finally claimed… they lay back… whispering gallery tile flakes passed… each hearing messages…" The closing lines loop thematic summaries—"no longer a lilac unease, but rather a deep contentment born of embracing chaos"—with therapy-speak labels ("deep contentment," "beautiful mysteriously") that dull the image. Figurative language is generic: "dissolved like sugar in rain," "twilight on the verge of something momentous."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—artist uses sand mandala to reveal hidden meaning and convert zealots—is a familiar template (artist-as-healer, chaos-to-order arc) executed without fresh inflection. The "unlearning" and "whispering grotto" are abstract placeholders rather than specific world logic. The zealots' instant conversion ("anger dissolving into wonder") is a stock beat, and the collective mandala ending retreats into safe, tidy resolution. No bold risk-taking; the piece hedges every turn with abstraction and consensus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and shapes the climactic mandala adjustment, but his key choice—altering "a spiral of blue sand" to convert the zealots—is summarized rather than dramatized, and he becomes a passive observer in the final third as "new visitors" take over. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but his agency is ornamental at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tile flake appears in the opening ("carried with him") and closing ("whispering gallery tile flakes passed between them"), framing the story, but it is never handled or used to constrain a choice in the middle beats. Its mechanics—"betrayed secrets when pressed against one's ear"—are described but not deployed under pressure. Lyric reprise without mid-story causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Emergent hush" is mentioned repeatedly but remains abstract: the grotto "perpetually exhaled an emergent hush," and the final line shifts it from "lilac unease" to "deep contentment," yet the concept never changes Silas's options or tactics on the page. Present in setup and ending, but its mechanics are theme-only, not stake-driven.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Socially perceptive in ways that defied ordinary understanding" is a label asserted once in exposition without demonstration. Silas never misreads the zealots, adjusts his approach based on their micro-reactions, or pays a price for over-reading; the trait does not constrain or enable any visible action. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Interject" drives the climactic beat where Silas responds to the zealots, but the action is summarized—"He adjusted a spiral of blue sand… and suddenly his creation resonated"—without showing the mechanics or cost. Present in setup (motivation), middle turn (the adjustment), and ending (collective acceptance), meeting all three gates, but the key moment is told rather than dramatized, capping causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sand mandala is introduced in the second paragraph ("began creating intricate sand mandalas"), used in the climactic adjustment, and recurs in the collective building at the end. It shapes two beats (Silas's solo work, the zealot conversion) and contributes to closure, but the mechanics—*how* the pattern "amplifies the grotto's whispers"—are never shown, leaving the method functionally abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The grotto is present in setup, middle, and ending, but it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The mist and acoustics are described, yet Silas's sand work could occur in any resonant space with minor edits. Setting is backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"During the unlearning" appears in the opening and closing, framing the story, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. "Day after day" suggests duration without urgency, and the final morning's collective work has no deadline. Present but replaceable with any era of cultural flux.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Motivated to discover meaning in the mess" is stated early and drives Silas to the grotto and the mandala work, meeting setup and middle gates. The motivation is present in the ending as theme ("meaning reveals itself… in what we allow the world to show us"), but it is never tested with friction—no cost, no competing want. Desire is declared, not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Lilac unease—a beautiful but unsettling sensation" is named once early and returns in the final line ("no longer a lilac unease, but rather a deep contentment"), a lyric reprise that reweights the opening mood. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure in the middle beats; the prose remains uniformly elevated and abstract throughout, and the final shift is asserted rather than embodied in image or rhythm.</comment>
