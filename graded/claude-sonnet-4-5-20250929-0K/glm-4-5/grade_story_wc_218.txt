<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation crystallizes early and his brazen calm persists, but internal contradiction is minimal—he moves from acceptance to purpose too smoothly without embodied struggle. The arthritis mention gestures at physical cost, but emotional complexity flattens into serene determination; no genuine mistakes or blind spots complicate his trajectory. The final choice (completing the circuit) feels preordained rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Interiority leans abstract ("weight of mortality settled differently") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the copper-wire network grows across months, culminating in a final circuit and light-symphony closure. Orientation anchors quickly (island caretaker, temple orchard, diagnosis). The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias completes his work and dies peacefully, foreclosing further action with visible cost—his death). However, the "six months" timeframe compresses five months into summary ("by the third month," "month five") with minimal scene pressure; the final circuit lands but the escalation reads more as elapsed-time montage than tightening choices. Cost is visible (death) but the causal because/therefore linkage between wire-wrapping and interspecies awakening is asserted rather than dramatized with friction or resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The living stone pillars and temple orchard anchor the setting early and return at closure (pillars glow, orchard transforms). Spatial choreography is clear; the copper wire and oak branches function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elias's work (arthritis, precise geometric patterns). However, much description is postcard-like ("otherworldly iridescence," "symphony of light") without sensory hierarchy filtered through Elias's professional or emotional priorities. The orchard does charge the final image (plants and stone breathing together), satisfying the 9+ gate partially, but the environment's pressure on choice remains light—Elias faces no environmental obstacles or resource scarcity that alter his tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: foster interspecies respect before death. The work proceeds month by month, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is montage-based rather than choice-driven; no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. Arthritis flares, but he continues without altering approach. The final circuit is the culminating act, but it arrives as scheduled completion rather than a decision narrowing live options. Cost is visible (Elias dies), yet the price is temporal (six months pass) rather than a felt sacrifice or renunciation that forecloses a competing path. Agency reads as endurance, which qualifies for Earned Stasis, but the lack of friction or complication keeps pressure modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of interspecies connection emerges through the wire-and-pillar work and the final harmony. The botanical diary and predecessor's disappearance seed mystery, and the ending avoids overt moralizing. However, several phrases skirt thematic echo: "interspecies respect," "architectural secrets," and "bridge between worlds" recur as prompt-like labels rather than embodied particulars. The copper wire and light function as symbolic elements, but the transformation is asserted ("plants and stone seemed to breathe together") without a non-literal image that reweights prior material in an unexpected way. The final paragraph's "promise of the future" and "beyond the veil" edge toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person POV is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, and free indirect style is clean. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices plants, wire, and diagrams without a character-specific filter (professional or personal bias). Diction occasionally elevates ("brazen calm," "symphony of light") beyond what the moment requires, and several sentence stems recur ("The island caretaker," "The botanical diary," "The copper wire wrapped around oak branches"). No dialogue appears. Register is controlled but lacks rhythmic variety under pressure; the prose maintains uniform mid-register throughout, neither tightening at climax nor modulating with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no causality breaks. However, template cadence is pervasive: "The [noun]" opens numerous consecutive sentences, and many paragraphs begin with time markers or subject restatements without variation ("Elias," "The island caretaker," "The copper wire"). Paraphrase loops appear: "architectural secrets" is restated across multiple lines without added pressure; "copper wire wrapped around oak branches" recurs verbatim as a label. Figurative language ("symphony of light and growth," "bridge between worlds") clusters in the final third without pattern-teaching or payoff, and mixed metaphors (pillars "breathe," wire "sings," light "pulses") stack without coherent vehicle logic. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "almost") appear frequently. Apply −1.2 for template cadence + loops + late figurative density touching closure, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—terminally ill caretaker completes a mystical botanical project—is familiar and emotionally safe. The six-month deadline, botanical diary, and predecessor's disappearance follow template story beats without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The copper-wire method and interspecies communion read as genre fantasy without a fresh inflection; removing Elias's name and substituting another orchard would leave the arc unchanged. The ending offers peaceful closure with no risk or ambiguity, and the central question (can he complete the work?) is answered affirmatively without complication. "Brazen calm" is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses. Derivative Premise Guardrail: −1.0 for template plot without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes decisions (reads diary, begins wire-wrapping, completes final circuit), satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, most choices are serially enacted without on-page friction or trade-offs; the narrative summarizes his work across months rather than dramatizing key turns. The final circuit is the culminating action, but it feels scheduled rather than a decision that narrows live options. Causal pressure is modest; swapping "island caretaker" for "temple keeper" would require only minor edits. Score in functional band: three-gate presence + one beat (final circuit) + modest causal pressure, minus ornamental middle months and summary-only development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears early (setup), is consulted for diagrams (development), and rests beside Elias at closure (payoff). Three gates met. However, its use is largely static: Elias reads it once in detail, then references "the method" without on-page interaction. The diary does not return with reweighted meaning at the end—it is simply present. Closure linkage is physical presence rather than causal action or charged reprise. Score: three gates + early signal + two beats (night reading, final resting) + closure presence, minus ornamental final mention and no evolving use. Swappable with "predecessor's notebook" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Architectural secrets" is named early (setup) and motivates Elias's work (development); the secrets are "fully revealed" at closure (payoff). Three gates met. The concept shapes the dominant stake (awakening the dormant connection) and drives the wire-wrapping method. However, the "secrets" remain abstract—what specifically makes the pillars "conduits" or the wire patterns effective is asserted rather than demonstrated with on-page mechanics. The concept is label-present in the final paragraph but does not change options or introduce cost; it is thematic backdrop rather than active constraint. Score: three gates + causal linkage to method + closure mention, minus abstraction and swappability (could be "temple mysteries" or "hidden knowledge").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is signaled early (month one) and described in his approach (studying diagrams, precise wire-wrapping). Setup and development present. However, the trait is label-only; no on-page beat shows the systematic approach enabling success or its gentleness incurring a cost (e.g., slower progress risking the deadline). The trait does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff. Closure: absent—the final circuit is "trembling but precise," which contradicts gentleness. Score: two gates (setup, development label) + one beat (month one study), minus label-only use, no cost, and closure absence. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Remodel" is named early and structures the entire arc: Elias begins the remodel (month one), builds the network (month three), completes it (month six). Three gates met. The action is irreplaceable—the story is the remodeling process. Multiple beats (months one, three, five, six) involve wrapping wire and observing changes. However, the remodel is enacted across summary rather than key dramatized turns; no single remodel beat forces a decision that narrows options. Closure linkage is strong (final circuit completes the remodel, triggering transformation). Score: three gates + four beats + closure linkage + irreplaceability, minus summary-only development and modest causal pressure (could be "restoration" or "activation" with edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Copper wire wrapped around oak branches is introduced early (diary illustration), used repeatedly (months one, three, five, six), and is present in the final beat ("copper wire…would continue its work"). Three gates met. The method is specific and shapes Elias's work (wrapping wire in geometric patterns). However, its mechanics are asserted ("singing against the wood," becoming "a language") without on-page demonstration of why this method works or what cost/friction it imposes beyond arthritis. The wire's presence at closure is thematic rather than causally active. Score: three gates + early signal + four beats + specificity + closure presence, minus ornamental mechanics and no tradeoff. Swappable with "silver thread" or "woven vines" with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Temple orchard set within living stone pillars is anchored immediately (setup), provides the workspace throughout (development), and transforms at closure (pillars glow, orchard breathes). Three gates met. The setting is irreplaceable and specific. Multiple beats occur here (reading, wire-wrapping, final circuit). The pillars are described as "conduits" that shape the project's goal, and the orchard's transformation charges the final image. However, the setting does not pressure choices or alter tactics—Elias works without environmental obstacles, resource scarcity, or spatial constraints. Score: three gates + early signal + five beats + specificity + closure charge, minus no on-page constraint or tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Six-month timeframe is introduced in the opening (setup) and structures the arc (months one, three, five, six noted). Development: months pass, but the deadline does not tighten decisions—Elias proceeds on schedule without urgency or tradeoffs. Payoff: he completes the work "on the first morning of his sixth month" and dies, so the timeframe does land at closure. Three gates met, but the clock is decorative; no beat shows time scarcity forcing a choice (e.g., skipping a step, accepting imperfection). The summary pacing ("by the third month") flattens the deadline's pressure. Score: three gates + closure presence, minus no tactical pressure, decorative tracking, and late closure arrival (month six is stated only in the penultimate paragraph). Cap at ~5.5 for minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To foster interspecies respect" is named early (setup: "his motivation crystallized") and drives the remodel (development). Payoff: the ending paragraph declares "the interspecies respect he had nurtured would continue to grow." Three gates met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized—no beat shows Elias weighing this desire against a competing want or cost. The phrase "interspecies respect" recurs as a prompt label without embodied conflict or friction. The desire shapes the goal but not the tactics; Elias's commitment is unwavering and serene. Score: three gates + causal linkage to action, minus told-only integration, label repetition, no friction, and closure summary rather than dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" is named in the opening line (setup) and recurs in month one ("the brazen calm never left him"). Development: the tone is asserted but not modulated—Elias remains uniformly serene under physical decline and approaching death. Payoff: the final beat describes him as "profoundly peaceful," maintaining the tone. Three gates met, but the tone is static and label-only; no on-page moment dramatizes what "brazen" (bold, audacious) adds to "calm." The prose does not rhythmically embody the tone under pressure—sentences remain mid-register throughout. Swappable with "quiet resolve" or "steady acceptance." Score: three gates + two mentions, minus static mood, label-only use, no modulation, and failure to charge the final image. Cap at ~5.0 for lack of on-page embodiment.</comment>
