<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fractal weaver remains a label rather than a person with contradictory impulses. Interiority consists largely of abstract musings ("whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final gesture—smiling and walking toward the horizon—feels declarative rather than earned by prior internal conflict. The shift from curse to gift is told, not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who the weaver is, where exactly they are, and what the burdens are remain unclear past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens, but closure lacks visible cost—the weaver's acceptance of their role is asserted ("boundary-lessly connected") rather than paid for on the page. The repeated burden-collection beats do not escalate or tighten options; they cycle without meaningful deepening until the final paragraph's summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto is vividly textured with metallic reflections and starlight cracks, but it remains a backdrop rather than a constraint on choice. The kerosene lamp burner is handled in multiple beats, charging the space with atmosphere. However, the environment does not alter tactics or complicate the weaver's work—every burden calcifies smoothly without spatial friction. The setting supports tone but does not reach the constraint threshold for higher scoring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting burdens—is signaled early but never tightens. Each burden calcifies without complication; the weaver's internal shift from trapped to connected is declared rather than forced by a trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost. The accumulative lens requires a meaningful deepening or cadence shift, but the final paragraph simply restates the opening premise without reweighting it through visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the weaver's witness role and the metaphor of calcified emotional weight. The final image attempts resonance—"boundary-lessly trapped" reframed as "boundary-lessly connected"—but the shift is asserted through summary rather than earned by a specific event. The whalebone reverie and shingled hush function as atmospheric motifs without constraining choice or charging the closure. The piece avoids moralizing but lacks the specificity to make the transformation undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a lyric, slightly archaic texture ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") that is consistent and purposeful. However, the diction edges toward purple in places—"fractal within fractal," "sediment in their mind"—without the pressure-driven urgency that would justify the density. The weaver's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; their observations of burdens and visions read interchangeably. No dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "boundary-lessly trapped" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure, and "shingled hush" recurs as decoration rather than function. Figurative language is dense—"fractal weaver," "whalebone reverie," "calcified into stone"—but often vague, lacking concrete anchors. Template cadence emerges in the burden-collection sequence: "This one belonged to… its weight was…" repeated without variation. The final paragraph stacks summary claims ("that was the nature of their calling") that dull momentum rather than propelling the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise of collecting and calcifying emotional burdens is evocative, but the execution follows a template: mystical figure performs ritual work in atmospheric setting, experiences moment of insight, reframes burden as gift. The specific elements—bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, whalebone reverie—are vivid but do not synthesize into a surprising turn. The transformation from trapped to connected is a familiar arc without a non-obvious inflection that grows from the particulars of the burdens themselves.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The fractal weaver is present throughout and performs the central action, but makes no choices that alter tactics. The work proceeds smoothly without complication; the internal shift is asserted in the final third rather than forced by a decision. Observes and witnesses without agency-driven turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner appears in multiple beats: produced, lit, flickering, adjusted, extinguished, and carried. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric detail—it guides the weaver but does not constrain choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Present across the arc but not causally active in shaping the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" recurs as description—layers of silence, absorbing transformation—but remains metaphorical rather than stake-shaping. It does not constrain or enable a tactic; it is invoked for tone. Present in multiple beats but ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is stated early and returns in the final paragraph where it is reframed as "boundary-lessly connected." This label-only use does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The shift from curse to gift is told rather than dramatized through a trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Calcify" drives the central ritual: burdens transform into permanent geological forms on the altar. The action is repeated across multiple beats and shapes the weaver's work, but does not produce a meaningful turn—each calcification succeeds without friction. The process defines the structure but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is mentioned in several beats—aligning for the ceremony, adjusting under starlight, stepping between worlds—but the mechanics are vague and the method does not constrain or complicate attempts. It is stated as necessary but not dramatized as a challenge or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The bronze grotto provides vivid atmosphere—metallic reflections, starlight filtering through cracks, central chamber altar—and is present from opening to close. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The weaver's work proceeds unimpeded by the space. Setting supports tone but does not function as micro-setting that constrains tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" is mentioned in the second paragraph and described as "the season… when the world held its breath," but time does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. The burdens are collected "by dawn" without urgency or clock pressure. The timeframe is ornamental, not functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation to collect burdens is signaled early and frames the entire arc. However, it is not dramatized as conflicted—the weaver proceeds smoothly through fourteen burdens without friction between want and cost. The shift to seeing the work as gift rather than curse is told in reflection rather than forced by a choice. Desire is present but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" appears in two beats as a descriptor for the weaver's dreamlike concentration state. The tone is lyric and contemplative throughout, modulating slightly when the weaver witnesses the vision of the ancient civilization. However, the tone does not charge the final image with pressure—it remains consistent rather than crystallizing at closure. Functional but static.</comment>
