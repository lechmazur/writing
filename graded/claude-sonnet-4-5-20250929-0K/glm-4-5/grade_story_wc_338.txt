<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "perceptive" and "methodically curious" traits are asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The final decision to repair the torn map "to honor it as a threshold" reads as thematic gesture without visible cost—we see no foreclosed path or sacrifice. Interior voice relies on diagnostic abstraction ("profound sense of shielded openness") instead of concrete, character-particular perception. The empathy motivation is told repeatedly but never dramatized through a hard trade-off or micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words; no penalty applied. The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing: Elara's realization that the henge is a celestial phenomenon shifts from physical reopening to understanding sacred silence. However, the cost is abstract—"inviting others to experience the wonder without stripping away the mystery"—without an on-page forfeiture or constraint that alters her options. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (pattern of silent footage → discovery), but the final "reweighting" occurs via exposition rather than image or enacted pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault supplies vivid atmosphere ("persistent drumming of water on ancient stone"), and the torn map functions as a micro-setting object that charges the closure image when Elara repairs it. Spatial choreography is clean; the vault, workspace, and surveillance footage cohere. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elara's discovery unfolds through passive observation rather than navigating access, proximity, or a world-rule obstacle. Scope-appropriate detail without occupational depth beyond generic "map framer" tasks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reopening the henge's secrets—is signaled early but never tightens into a live on-page dilemma. Elara's "months" of study and the "one rainy Tuesday" discovery occur off-stage or in summary; no reversal, failed attempt, or trade-off narrows her options. The "trembling hands" moment gestures at intensity but delivers exposition ("aligned perfectly with celestial events") rather than a pressure-driven choice. Coincidence (the pattern appears in footage) solves the puzzle without protagonist agency or visible price, and the resolution—sharing the discovery "in the same spirit"—avoids concrete consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of honoring silence and sacred knowledge versus documentation emerges organically from the henge premise and the torn map motif. The final image—repairing the map "to honor it as a threshold rather than a barrier"—attempts a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the thematic statement is spelled out in exposition ("some knowledge exists not to be documented, but to be felt") rather than dramatized through Elara's enacted choice with friction. The whispered chapel as celestial phenomenon is a fresh inflection, but the piece edges toward sermonizing in the penultimate paragraph ("had taught her that the most profound cartography occurs…in the human heart").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Single-POV narration remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Elara "notices" and "studies" without a character-specific way of filtering detail under stress. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("shielded openness," "celestial phenomenon") that sits above lived-in interiority. The "methodically curious nature" label recurs without distinct syntactic or rhythmic texture. Filter verbs ("noticed," "understood," "felt") stack in the discovery beat without voice-motivated purpose, and the final paragraph edges into helpful-narrator mode, over-explaining the resonance rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent paragraphs: "perceptive map framer with a methodically curious nature" → "Her methodically curious nature drove her" → "Elara's colleagues…had often questioned her methodically curious approach." Template cadence runs in the discovery sequence ("It aligned perfectly…The whispered chapel wasn't…Elara felt…"). Stock metaphor: "pathway to understanding" and "windows into the human relationship" dilute specificity. The final two paragraphs summarize thematic payoff rather than advancing scene pressure. Sentence openings show variety elsewhere, but clarity at closure is harmed by exposition replacing image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The celestial-alignment reveal offers a fresh angle on lost-place mysteries, and the torn map as deliberate threshold is a non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc—curiosity → discovery → wisdom—could transfer unchanged to any archaeological puzzle with minor name swaps. The "silent video footage from decades apart" and Guild surveillance since the 1920s gesture at specificity but remain ornamental; neither detail constrains Elara's tactics or complicates her choices. The piece avoids template moralizing in the middle beats but edges toward abstraction at closure, settling into a safety middle that honors mystery without bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout but her perceptive/map-framer traits drive observation, not key decisions. The climactic "discovery" (celestial alignment) happens to her through passive study, and the final choice (repairing the map) is told rather than dramatized with live cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but agency is diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The henge is central to stakes and appears in all three gates: premise, months of study, and the celestial discovery. However, it remains abstract—never handled, observed directly, or physically encountered. The discovery reweights its meaning (celestial phenomenon vs. structure) but this occurs via exposition. Functional across beats but lacks embodied presence or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The whispered chapel shapes the premise (sacred place kept silent) and returns at the climax as the celestial-alignment reveal. It reweights from building to phenomenon, but the concept is told rather than enacted—Elara never navigates conflicting pressures around silence versus disclosure on the page. Present in setup and payoff; weak middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is asserted four times but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. Elara's patient overlaying of footage is consistent with the label but could be executed by any diligent researcher. The trait does not create trade-offs (e.g., missing a faster, riskier path) or complicate her tactics. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Reopen" appears in the premise and final paragraph but the major turn—discovering the celestial pattern—happens passively through observation rather than an enacted attempt to physically or conceptually reopen the henge. The closure repairs the map "to honor the divide," which is thematically linked but does not depend on "reopen" as a tactic. Swappable with "rediscover" or "understand."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is signaled early ("months…comparing silent video footage") and drives the discovery beat (overlays, shadow variations, celestial alignment). The method shapes the middle attempt and enables the climax. However, the mechanics remain vague—how footage from the 1920s captures seasonal/time-of-day changes that reveal a structure is unexplained. Functional but underspecified at the closure moment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault anchors setting throughout and supplies atmosphere (drumming water, faint frescoes). The "one rainy Tuesday" discovery ties weather to the climactic beat. However, the vault does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—she could study the footage anywhere. Micro-setting present; postcard description edges into ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The torn map "dividing known from unknown" is introduced early, handled in the middle (Elara aligns it with findings), and charged at closure when she repairs it "to honor it as a threshold." The tear's deliberate creation adds specificity, and the alignment with the constellation path drives the discovery. Present across all three gates and causally active, though the final "repair" gesture is told rather than shown with embodied action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Empathy and interpreting silence are declared as motivation in paragraph 5 and echoed at closure ("empathy for their silence had taught her"). However, no on-page beat dramatizes Elara choosing empathy over another want (fame, speed, disclosure) with visible cost. The motivation is asserted but never tested under conflicting pressure. Told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is named once at the discovery beat ("Elara felt a profound sense of shielded openness") and echoed in the final paragraph's approach to sharing. The tone does not modulate with escalating pressure—Elara's interior remains consistently contemplative and measured throughout. No tonal shift that charges the final image; static mood with a thematic label.</comment>
