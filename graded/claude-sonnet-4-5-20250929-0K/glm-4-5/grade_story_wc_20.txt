<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to understand "the weight of names" is stated repeatedly rather than dramatized through contradictory choices under pressure. The final choice to forge a new coin arrives without internal conflict—no competing impulse or visible renunciation on the page. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("luminous regret," "spark of purpose") rather than embodied, character-specific perception. The transformation feels declared rather than earned through prior causality that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (foundry, Elias, post-search). One tightening occurs when Elias shifts from searching to forging, but the closure—holding the new coin and declaring his wisdom—lacks visible cost; no prior option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The kintsugi principle is invoked as metaphor without constraining a choice. Closure reads as conceptual repricing, yet the cost remains abstract ("brokenness mended with gold") rather than legible in action or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The foundry setting provides concrete sensory anchors (steam, rain, furnaces, copper disc) and Elias interacts with tools across multiple beats (etching, heating, retrieving). The rain-washed surfaces recur purposefully. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elias's success is unimpeded by resource limits or spatial pressure. The final image is charged by the foundry's transformation, lifting the score, but the setting remains more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redeeming the lost artifact and Elias's fractured purpose—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when he accepts Lumina's loss and shifts to forging. Yet the escalation lacks agency-driven cost: no live option is foreclosed, no tactical trade-off shown. The forging succeeds without obstacle, and the final wisdom ("names are foundations of being") is asserted rather than tested. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the deepening is thematic claim without dramatized price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The kintsugi metaphor and "weight of names" theme are woven throughout, and the final image (holding the imperfect coin) attempts a resonant reconfiguration. However, the thematic answer is stated rather than enacted: "wisdom forged in failure," "regret into luminous purpose." The ending leans on explicit philosophizing ("names were not just labels but the very foundations of being") in place of a non-literal image that reweights prior particulars. The reprise of "rain-washed" and "luminous regret" charges the closure modestly, but the moralizing in the final third lowers the score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable. Perceptual signature is present in the way Elias filters the foundry through alchemical terms and memory of Lumina's lessons. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous regret," "factually mystical," "vast cosmos") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. Lumina's quoted voice ("The zodiac is not a map, but a language") carries distinct idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the forging sequence. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance holds, but the prose occasionally sounds like thesis rather than lived thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template stems appear frequently: "rain-washed" recurs six times, often in identical constructions ("rain-washed foundry," "rain-washed hands," "rain-washed surfaces"). Adjacent lines restate without added pressure ("He had explored the limits of his craft and found something more valuable... wisdom forged in failure"). Stock metaphor strings ("steam rising... like a ghostly sigh," "balance of cosmic forces") dull immediacy. Some lines do double work (tool use + internal state), but the closure paragraph summarizes rather than propels. Apply −0.8 for loops/stems and figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—alchemist forges replacement artifact to redeem loss—follows a familiar redemption-through-craft template. The kintsugi metaphor is borrowed rather than synthesized into unique story logic. Emotional arc (grief → acceptance → creation → wisdom) proceeds without surprise or reversal. The forging succeeds on first attempt with no obstacle, and the final wisdom is stated rather than discovered through specific, non-obvious particulars. Specificity (zodiac symbols, foundry tools) adds texture but does not transform the template. The "weight of names" hook offers a fresh angle, preventing lower scores, but the execution remains mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias makes one decision—to forge a new coin—but the choice is uncontested and succeeds without complication. His observation and memory drive most beats; agency at closure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The zodiac coin is introduced early, mentioned across multiple beats (loss, memory, forging symbols, final holding), and returns with reweighted meaning in the ending image. It shapes the dominant stake and appears in the closure unit, but its properties (embodying names) remain abstract and do not constrain a tactical choice. Strong setup and payoff, but mid-development involvement is passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions are stated as metaphor ("mending what's broken with golden purpose") and echo in the final image (gold leaf melting into etched lines). However, the concept does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page—it is thematic overlay rather than causal pressure. Setup is clear, but development and payoff are ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is mentioned once as Lumina's saying ("science elevated by wonder, wonder grounded in reality") without constraining an action or enabling a visible cost. Label-only attribute that could be removed without altering the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Redeem" is the explicit motivation and frames the story's stakes. The redemption attempt (forging the new coin) occupies the middle and closure beats. However, the redemption succeeds without cost or trade-off, making the action replaceable with "restore" or "recover" with minimal edits. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Exploring limits" is stated twice ("by exploring the limits of his understanding," "explored the limits of his craft") but the method is not dramatized—Elias does not test boundaries or face failure in the forging. The method is asserted rather than enacted, making it swappable with "mastering" or "applying" his knowledge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry is present in setup, middle (furnace, crucibles, molds), and closure (final retrieval of the disc). It provides tools Elias uses and recurs in the final image. Spatial detail is concrete and the setting participates in multiple beats. However, it does not pressure a choice or impose a resource limit—Elias's success is unimpeded. Strong presence and closure linkage lift the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early ("search party had disbanded at dawn," "weeks following every clue," "now, alone") and the shift from searching to forging marks a temporal turn. However, the passage of time during the forging ("hours passed") is summarized without tightening decisions or creating urgency. Present, causal role in one beat, but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To understand the weight of names" is stated as motivation and echoed in Lumina's lessons and Elias's final realization. The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between wanting understanding and a competing cost. Functional role in framing stakes, but the motivation is summarized rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is named early, recurs in the middle ("luminous regret he had carried"), and modulates in the closure ("regret into luminous purpose"). The tone is coherent and charges the final image through the transformation of regret. However, the tone is declared via the phrase itself rather than enacted through sentence rhythm and image alone. Strong setup-to-payoff arc, but the effect leans on the label.</comment>
