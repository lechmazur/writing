<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak labels ("somatic markers," "pearl of stillness") that flatten emotional specificity rather than embodying it. The ritual with the photograph and her work with children demonstrate embodied choices, but the diagnostic self-awareness ("She would trace the faces...permitting herself to feel") reads more like psychological exposition than lived contradiction. The final release of the photograph carries cost, but the emotional progression is overly calibrated and lacks the messy irrationality expected from trauma processing. Backstory dominates without sufficient present-tense micro-choices to anchor each reflection.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens with the photograph serving as a recurring anchor. Orientation is delayed—we learn setting details gradually through the first third—but the pattern of ritual-to-release provides structural coherence. The closure (releasing the photograph to the wind) constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost: she relinquishes the last physical evidence of her past. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract; the piece tells us she "remained frozen" but doesn't show how this forfeiture alters her immediate or future options beyond symbolic release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliffside provide concrete sensory anchors (salty air, cool earth, churning sea) filtered through Maya's gardening expertise. The oyster shell discovery that generates the "pearl of stillness" metaphor shows setting constraining conceptual development. The spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the final cliff-edge positioning charges the photograph release. The micro-setting of hands on earth during panic episodes demonstrates how environment enables coping tactics, meeting the 9+ gate partially but not fully integrating setting pressure into the central conflict's escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—processing trauma while maintaining daily function—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when Maya moves from private ritual (unfolding/folding the photograph) to public teaching to final release, each narrowing her relationship to the past. However, the escalation is more thematic than tactical; no on-page reversal forces her to choose between competing goods or pay an immediate price beyond the symbolic. The children's presence adds texture but doesn't create genuine opposition. The seventh anniversary provides temporal pressure, but Maya's decision feels inevitable rather than earned through compressed agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The pearl-of-stillness metaphor dominates to the point of over-articulation: "As inside the oyster...so within ourselves" and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("to anchor optimism in realism") state theme rather than letting it emerge. The photograph's journey from preservation to release carries genuine resonance, but the piece undermines its own subtext with phrases like "how life continues in spaces between darkness and light." The trauma-to-transcendence arc, while emotionally honest in places, trends toward the therapeutic-journey template without sufficient specificity to transform it. The children calling her "The Gardener of Calm" feels like an imposed symbolic label rather than organic observation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Maya's perception. The voice carries distinct texture in gardening observations ("coax life from even the most fragile cuttings") and the perceptual signature of someone who notices growth cycles. However, the register drifts into workshop language during emotional beats: "somatic markers," "anchoring optimism in realism," "Resonant Reconfiguration." The children's dialogue ("Can you teach us to be still like you?") reads overly articulate for natural speech. Psychic distance is controlled, but the narrator's certainty about Maya's internal metaphors (the pearl, the collision with tragedy teaching her to craft meaning) occasionally exceeds what feels character-generated versus author-imposed wisdom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose carries significant template artifacts: repetitive sentence stems ("Maya would," "She would trace," "She felt"), paraphrase loops (paragraphs 6-7 restate the ritual without advancing it), and elevated diction that clashes with moment-to-moment perception ("perpetual rebirth a mirror for her own journey"). The scaffold phrase "to anchor optimism in realism" appears three times, including in the critical final paragraph where it flattens the closure image. Filter-verb stacks appear in reflective passages ("had come to her," "had grown nimble," "had become visible"). Information density is uneven: early paragraphs compress effectively while middle sections loop through the somatic-marker concept. The opening and closing images carry some power, but overwriting dulls their impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—trauma survivor finding peace through gardening—follows a widely-used therapeutic-narrative template without sufficient transformation through specific lived detail. The "pearl of stillness" concept and somatic-marker framework read more like imported psychological vocabulary than discoveries organic to this character's experience. The arboretum setting and lighthouse detail provide atmospheric specificity, but don't fundamentally alter the familiar arc. The children subplot and the seventh-anniversary timing add structural beats but feel arranged to fulfill narrative expectations. The photograph release at cliff's edge is the story's most specific image, yet even this gesture has strong precedent in closure-through-letting-go narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's identity as drone-strike survivor is established early and shapes her ritualistic coping throughout. Her decision to release the photograph creates the final turn. However, much of her presence is observational/reflective rather than active decision-making under pressure. The teaching moments with children show her affecting others but don't create genuine conflict that tests her survivor identity. Present in setup and payoff, functional in middle development, but the choices feel more thematic than tactically constrained.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The photograph appears in multiple beats: morning ritual (paragraphs 4-7), anniversary contemplation (paragraph 21), and final release (paragraph 26). Its meaning evolves from preserved memory to burden to released artifact. The "crumpled" and "edges soft with repeated caresses" details show physical handling. It drives the closure action directly. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with visible cost tied to its release, though the middle beats repeat function rather than deepen complication.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "pearl of stillness" concept is introduced via the oyster-shell discovery (paragraph 12), explicitly labeled and restated multiple times (paragraphs 11, 13, 19, 24), and invoked at the ending (paragraph 24). However, it functions more as thematic language than as a mechanism that constrains choices. Maya doesn't have to choose between seeking stillness and another competing need; the pearl is described as an outcome she achieves rather than a goal that shapes tactics under pressure. Present but largely ornamental despite repetition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Maya's talent with plants is mentioned in paragraph 3 ("quietly talented with the ability to coax life"), demonstrated in scarred hands that "had grown nimble" (paragraph 14), and shown teaching children (paragraphs 16-19). However, "quietly talented" itself is a label rather than a trait with visible tradeoffs. The gardening enables her coping environment but doesn't create on-page cost—we never see her talent fail or force a difficult choice between competing uses of that skill. Functional but doesn't constrain action with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "freeze" action appears in "freeze overwhelming emotions" (paragraph 8), teaching children to "freeze-frame a fluttering hummingbird" (paragraph 16), and "remained frozen against the cliffside" (paragraph 27). It shapes her coping method throughout and provides the final physical image. However, "freeze" is somewhat interchangeable with "pause" or "still"—the specific word isn't mechanically necessary. The concept is more important than this exact verb, but it does appear in setup, development, and closure with reasonable integration to the somatic-marker framework.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Somatic markers are introduced as method in paragraph 8 ("somatic markers she had learned to recognize"), detailed with examples (clenched jaw, shallow breathing in paragraph 9), demonstrated in the earth-touching response (paragraph 10), and taught to children (paragraphs 17-19). They provide the mechanics of how Maya manages emotion. However, they don't face a test—we never see them fail or require adjustment under escalating pressure. Present across setup and development, mentioned near closure (paragraph 22), but the method itself doesn't create tactical constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The arboretum is established in paragraph 1, provides the gardening context throughout, supplies the oyster shell that generates the central metaphor (paragraph 12), and serves as the location for teaching children. The cliff edge enables the photograph release. The "cool earth" grounds panic episodes (paragraph 10). The setting is present in all three gates and provides resources (plants, earth, cliff) that enable Maya's coping. However, it doesn't constrain—the arboretum never limits her options or forces a difficult spatial choice. Solid presence but primarily facilitative rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse keeper's departure is mentioned in paragraph 2 as past context and echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("After the last lighthouse keeper"). It establishes that Maya arrived after a transition point, but this timeframe doesn't create urgency or tighten decisions. The "seventh anniversary" (paragraph 21) provides a date for the climax, but the passage of seven years is told rather than tracked. No on-page clock pressure; the temporal element is atmospheric rather than tactical. Mentioned but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Anchoring optimism in realism is named explicitly in paragraph 6, demonstrated in the photograph ritual (paragraphs 6-7), and restated in the final two paragraphs. Maya's actions throughout—acknowledging both beauty and destruction—dramatize this motivation. The children subplot shows her optimism made visible to others. However, there's little friction between the optimism and realism; they coexist without forcing difficult trade-offs on the page. The motivation is coherent and present in setup, development, and payoff, but it doesn't create conflicted choices. The explicit restatement at the end reduces its earned quality.</comment>
