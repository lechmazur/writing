<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's professional interiority is established but remains surface-level—her "watchfully calm demeanor" and "fortified vulnerability" are told labels rather than embodied contradictions. The connection between the lantern and her personal rebellion against her supervisor feels abrupt and insufficiently grounded in prior causality; the grandmother's stories and "small family museum" arrive as exposition without altering present choices until the final decision. The closing choice to submit findings gains some weight from career jeopardy, but the controlling supervisor remains abstract, never pressuring her on the page, so the cost feels declared rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a causal lens: Maya discovers fresh scratches, opens the lantern, finds the note, and decides to expose corruption. Orientation is adequate (investigator, tunnel, post-flood). However, the closure choice—submitting findings tomorrow—lacks immediate felt cost; the career threat and supervisor's reaction remain off-page promises. The note's dual function (historical escape route + modern corruption evidence) is convenient rather than earned through Maya's investigation tactics. One meaningful tightening occurs when she opens the lantern, but the final image of "tucking evidence into her case" with a smile softens the stakes rather than charging them with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tunnel setting is anchored with concrete details: pooled water, damp earth, mildew, yellow tape, protruding pipe. The lantern's "greenish patina and intricate metalwork" and the "tarnished" quality supply texture. However, the environment does not constrain Maya's choices—she moves freely, examines evidence without obstacle, and the flooding serves only as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The setting stages the investigation but does not meaningfully alter her path or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about preventable death—is clear. Maya's discovery of the note provides one tightening: evidence of systemic negligence raises the stakes beyond a single death. However, escalation is mild; no reversal forces a trade-off on the page. The "controlling influence" she must escape is abstract and never applies counterpressure. The final choice to submit findings carries declared career risk but no visible immediate cost—no confrontation, no loss of alliance, no tactical sacrifice shown. The climax reads as a resolved decision rather than a choice under fire.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of personal liberation entwined with historical freedom is signaled through the underground railroad lantern, but the connection is stated rather than enacted: "the possibility of personal liberation merging into a single purpose" tells the reader what to feel. The final paragraph moralizes overtly—"This death wasn't just preventable...It was scripted"—and then explains the lantern's symbolic function: "The lantern's light had guided people to freedom generations ago; now it would illuminate her path forward." The thematic echo flattens what could have been a resonant image into a lecture, removing ambiguity and complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Maya throughout. The voice carries professional idiom ("preventable death investigator," "empirical observation," "forensic tools") that fits her role. However, interiority often defaults to abstract labels—"entangled memories," "fortified vulnerability," "watchfully calm"—rather than distinct perceptual texture. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the transit officer's single line is generic. The prose modulates somewhat under pressure (shorter beats when opening the lantern), but the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("now it would illuminate her path forward") breaks the investigative register into thematic summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate, but the prose carries repetitive conceptual loops: "fortified vulnerability" appears twice, "controlling influence" three times, "watchfully calm" twice, all as scaffold labels. The final paragraph stacks metaphoric declarations—"reverberate beyond this case," "transform into something stronger," "merging into a single purpose"—without concrete action. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "Her grandmother's stories, the small family museum back home, the connection to ancestors" and "photographing patterns...water displacement levels...fibers of fabric" list without syntactic variation. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "seemed") cluster in the middle section but do not stack densely enough to trigger the full artifact penalty. Paraphrase loop: "ending not just this investigation but also the controlling influence" restates the theme already declared two sentences prior.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—investigator finds historical artifact revealing modern corruption—is familiar and executed without fresh synthesis. The lantern's dual function (underground railroad + hidden note) is mechanically convenient. Maya's personal stakes (breaking free from controlling supervisor) are generic "brave whistleblower" material with no specific occupational or regional inflection. The closing smile and declarative resolution ("It was scripted") choose safety over ambiguity. No element feels inevitable in hindsight; the grandmother's museum and ancestral connection could be cut without altering the investigation's logic, revealing ornamental rather than integral design.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and makes the key decision to submit findings. However, her investigator role is more observer than active decider until the final beat; she notices, photographs, and documents but does not face a tactical choice that alters her approach mid-scene. The decision to expose corruption is signaled early and never contested on the page, reducing causal pressure. Present in setup and closure but lacks middle development where a choice narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lantern appears in three beats: initial discovery, opening mechanism, and final image. It constrains Maya's action (she must work the mechanism with forensic tools) and its contents (the note) supply the evidence that raises stakes. However, the lantern's personal resonance (grandmother's stories, ancestral connection) is told rather than shown altering a choice. It participates in closure but as a thematic symbol more than a causally indispensable object; a different artifact could deliver the note with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is mentioned twice as a label but never dramatized as a present constraint. Maya's memories of her grandmother and the family museum are summarized exposition that do not alter her investigation tactics or create friction between past and present action. The concept is ornamental theme rather than a pressure that shapes choices on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is mentioned three times but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action. The text tells us it is "her defense against the chaos of death" and that her "watchfully calm exterior belied the turmoil beneath," but no on-page moment shows this demeanor costing her information, trust, or speed. The attribute is present in setup and closure but does not shape a middle choice with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears three times: the lantern "seemed to reverberate with history," the click "seemed to reverberate throughout the tunnel," and "the investigation would certainly reverberate beyond this case." The middle instance (the click) is concrete and tied to the mechanism opening, a key turn. However, the other uses are metaphoric declarations rather than actions that redefine options. The verb could be replaced with "echo" or "resound" without structural change, placing it in functional but replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Empirical observation" is named as "her method" early and shown in the investigation beats: she catalogs the scene, notices overlooked scratches, documents dust patterns and water displacement, photographs everything. The method shapes her approach throughout and supplies the evidence for closure. However, the mechanism is straightforward professional procedure without unique constraint—any competent investigator would follow similar steps—so it trends toward essential execution rather than irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is anchored early with concrete details (pooled water, damp earth, narrow service alcove, protruding pipe) and provides the discovery site for the lantern. The post-flood water stains the note, linking environment to evidence. However, the tunnel does not constrain Maya's choices or tactics—she moves freely, examines everything without obstacle. It stages the investigation but does not pressure decisions, placing it in the "shapes one key turn" band via the discovery itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The drought ending and subsequent flooding are present in the opening line and affect the note's condition (water-damaged edges). However, "after the drought ends" does not create a ticking clock or constrain Maya's investigation timeline. The three-day missing period is mentioned but not leveraged to tighten decisions. The timeframe is functional setup without development or closure linkage, trending toward replaceable context.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Maya's desire to break free from her "controlling influence" (supervisor who demands obedience and suppresses innovation) is stated multiple times and drives the final decision to submit findings despite career risk. However, the supervisor never appears on the page to apply counterpressure, so the friction is told rather than dramatized. The motivation shapes the closure choice but lacks middle-beat cost where it would alter tactics or force a tradeoff. Present in setup and closure; weak in development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is named twice and described as "her shield" that "began to transform into something stronger, more like courage." The tone is coherent in the investigative beats (methodical documentation, controlled interiority) but the final paragraph's declarative optimism—"determined smile," "illuminate her path forward"—shifts into uplifting resolution rather than maintaining the guarded tension the phrase implies. The tone is present but does not modulate under pressure in a way that charges the final image; it trends toward static mood with a tidy pivot at closure.</comment>
