<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The guardian is presented with generic "neither fully human nor completely beast" abstraction and trait labels (dimensional homesickness, foggy lucidity) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies heavily on summary exposition ("had learned to wait," "had begun as a survival technique") instead of embodied emotion under pressure. The final "transformation" into translucent edges and belonging everywhere/nowhere reads as unearned epiphany without visible cost or a foreclosed path. The method of "interiorizing exteriors" is declared but never dramatized through specific micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors arrive but "feral library guardian" and "frozen garden in mist" remain vague placeholders past the 120-word threshold without concrete spatial grounding or teaching a disorientation pattern that pays off. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative imagery competes with a causal pendant-power arc, yet neither coheres into a legible closure. The ending claims transformation ("stepped forward," "transformed into another page") but offers no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost; the guardian's state shifts are asserted rather than dramatized. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence makes the price of this ending legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "frozen garden in mist" and "stone cherub" provide visual anchors, and the pendant's warmth and the roses' color shifts offer sensory evolution tied to plot. However, spatial choreography remains vague (no clear layout, distances, or exits), and the garden never constrains a choice or charges the final image—the guardian simply "stepped forward" into undefined space. The library is mentioned only in the title "library guardian" without any stacks, books, or spatial detail on the page. Micro-setting elements (body, tool, recurring object) do not shape tactics or the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>A dominant stake (dimensional homesickness, desire to return home) is signaled, but the guardian faces no on-page opposition, dilemma, or cost. The pendant's energy crescendos without resistance, and the guardian's "interiorizing exteriors" practice is summarized rather than tested under pressure. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the ending grants the guardian simultaneous belonging everywhere without any visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Coincidence (the pendant reaching "critical point") resolves the situation, and the protagonist's agency is passive observation rather than decisive action with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The theme of "befriending uncertainty" is stated directly ("befriending it was to befriend reality itself") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The ending offers explicit thesis statements ("boundaries of light were not barriers but invitations," "home was not a place but a state of consciousness") that moralize rather than resonate through image. The pendant and frozen roses recur but do not reweight meaning—they simply illustrate the stated theme. No earned wisdom arises from specific struggle; the guardian's epiphany is declared, not demonstrated through concrete action with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the elevated diction ("foggy lucidity," "patchwork illusion of connection") maintains consistency. However, the prose edges into abstract philosophizing ("transforming the void between dimensions from a prison of waiting into a playground of possibility") that exceeds the guardian's lived experience in scene. Filter verbs ("could see," "could temporarily experience," "seemed to smile") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic elevated fantasy rather than character-specific; no dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "boundaries of light" appears in seven sentences doing the same thematic work; "the guardian" opens nine consecutive sentences in template cadence; "had learned" / "had been" / "had evolved" stacks past-perfect constructions without varying rhythm. Stock metaphors ("patchwork illusion," "playground of possibility," "dance with them") and therapy-speak ("make friends with uncertainty," "state of consciousness one carried within") dull the peak beats. Mixed metaphor: "boundaries of light" are simultaneously barriers, invitations, and currents the guardian navigates. Register drifts into essay mode ("the culmination of their motivation," "another density") at closure. Information density is low—most sentences restate the guardian's waiting or the pendant's humming without advancing situation or choice. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per Text Artifact Screen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise (dimension-exiled guardian waiting in a liminal garden) follows a familiar template without transformation through specific world logic or lived detail. The "feral library guardian" and "frozen garden" are placeholder generics; "boundaries of light" is an abstract concept rather than a grounded phenomenon with rules. The ending's "belonging everywhere and nowhere" is a stock mystical resolution. Emotional beats rely on generic fantasy tropes (cultist's corrupted crystal, ancient cherub, glowing trees under violet suns) without fresh synthesis or a non-obvious angle that arises from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The feral library guardian is named in the opening and appears throughout, but their choices do not create key turns—they observe, wait, and passively absorb the pendant's energy. The ending "stepped forward" is the only action, and it is not a decision that alters tactics or options with cost. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cultist's pendant appears in paragraph 3, hums with power in multiple beats (paragraphs 3, 10, 14, 18, 25), and the guardian "focus[es] their practiced method of interiorizing exteriors toward the pendant's energy" in paragraph 18. However, the pendant's mechanics are vague, its use is summarized rather than dramatized, and it does not constrain a choice or shape the closure image with cost—it simply grants transformation. Two gates (setup, middle) met; closure participation is ornamental. Functional but replaceable with any magical artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Boundaries of light" is mentioned in seven sentences across the story (paragraphs 4, 10, 11, 16, 23) as a recurring phrase but remains an abstract metaphor. It does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—the guardian does not interact with, test, or navigate these boundaries in a way that alters options. The ending claims the boundaries "were not barriers but invitations," but this is thematic echo, not dramatized pressure. Present but swappable with any liminal-space metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is labeled in paragraph 4 and echoed in paragraph 21 ("dimensional homesickness was transformed"), but the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The guardian's longing is told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal tradeoffs. Label-only attribute without visible pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Wait" is named as the guardian's discipline in paragraph 5 and appears throughout ("centuries of waiting," "continued to wait," "After centuries of waiting"). The action frames the story's temporal arc and the guardian's stance crystallizes at the end from passive waiting to active attention. However, waiting does not drive a major turn with cost—it is endured posture rather than a choice that redefines options. Present across beats and tied to closure theme, but could be swapped with "observe" or "endure" without structural change. Lyric resonance present but causal pressure weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is introduced in paragraph 6, explained in paragraph 7, and invoked again in paragraph 18 ("focus their practiced method of interiorizing exteriors toward the pendant's energy"). The method appears in setup and middle, but its mechanics are vague and it is not demonstrated through specific attempts with cost—the guardian "absorbing external elements" is summary rather than scene. Two gates met; development is told rather than shown. Functional presence without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "frozen garden in mist" is anchored in the opening and recurs (frozen roses in paragraph 11, mist oscillations in paragraph 15, garden brightening in paragraph 19, final mention in paragraph 24). However, the garden does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome—it is backdrop rather than constraint. The guardian's spatial moves within it are vague. Present across the arc but postcard description without tactical impact. Swappable with any mystical setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears once in paragraph 5 as metaphor for the guardian's "current existence" and is never developed or used to tighten decisions. Time is vague—"centuries" and "millennia" are mentioned but do not create a live clock that alters tactics. The "first rays of twilight" in paragraph 10 do not impose urgency. Timeframe is ornamental metaphor without pressure. Introduced early but abandoned; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To make friends with uncertainty" is named in paragraph 8, restated in paragraph 9 ("befriending it was to befriend reality itself"), and echoed in the ending ("embrace the unknown," paragraph 26). The motivation is present across the arc but remains abstract theme rather than dramatized desire in friction with cost. The guardian's choices do not test this want against competing needs or prices. Told throughout but not embodied in conflicted action. Functional label without causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named once in paragraph 12 and echoed in paragraph 19; the tone of abstract philosophizing and elevated diction (e.g., "porous," "dimensional walls thinning," "state of consciousness") is coherent but static—it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. The tone supports the mystical concept but remains one steady register without escalation or cadence shift. Present and consistent, but does not intensify to heighten closure. Mid-band for coherence without dynamic range.</comment>
