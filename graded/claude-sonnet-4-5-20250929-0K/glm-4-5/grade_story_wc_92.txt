<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is characterized primarily through role ("vigilant lock sentinel," "keeper of keys and secrets") and occupation-level detail rather than embodied contradiction. His "calm inventiveness" functions as a label without visible tradeoffs—he performs artist-deception and authority with equal smoothness, never struggling or miscalculating. The secondary guard and Keeper are functional props who apply no genuine pressure; their "nervousness" or "winking hush" are told rather than shown through distinct speech or choices. No micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece orients place and role by ~120 words but lacks meaningful escalation or a legible closure unit with felt cost. The blackout is resolved off-page ("power surged"), and Elias simply resumes his post—no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization forecloses a path. The "embers of revolution began to glow" is assertion without dramatized consequence. Under a Situational lens (the most charitable reading), pressure never crystallizes into a stance with on-page cost; under Causal, the sundial completion and power restoration feel coincidental rather than because/therefore linked to Elias's agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bioluminescent walls and half-painted sundial are anchored early and provide concrete visual detail. However, the fort's spatial choreography remains vague—corridors and courtyard are named but not mapped, and the blackout's effect on movement is asserted rather than shown constraining Elias's navigation. The sundial serves as message board and recurs at closure, lending purposeful specificity, but environment does not force a tactical choice with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transmitting coordinates for a revolutionary gathering—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, complication, or cost appears: Elias completes the sundial without obstacle, the blackout ends on schedule, and the message is delivered. The Keeper's meeting and cautionary words ("we cannot force this revolution") are exposition rather than pressure. Agency is absent; Elias performs a predetermined task with no choice that narrows options or exacts visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme ("silent revolution sparked by ideas") is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from dramatized conflict—"the cradle of sparks," "winking hush," and fire metaphors are recycled without tension. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "embers of revolution began to glow" and "tiny but potent vessel of transformation." No specific event or image offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question; the Keeper's "like fire, it must catch naturally" is platitude rather than earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction is elevated and homogenous across narrative voice and dialogue—"winking hush," "cradle of sparks," "calm inventiveness"—with no perceptual signature distinguishing Elias's professional filter. Dialogue ("The Keeper requires your presence," "Those who understand the coded angles will know") is expository and lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. Under peak pressure (blackout), syntax and lexicon remain smooth and literary rather than compressing or embodying stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Patterned artifacts pervade: "vigilant lock sentinel" opens twice, "bronze quill holder" recurs six times with minimal variation, and "winking hush" / "cradle of sparks" are synonym-churned across beats without advancement. Template cadence is visible in stacked "Each…" and "The…" openers. Metaphor strings ("cradle of sparks," "embers of revolution," "fire…catch naturally") are stock revolution imagery without fresh synthesis. The final paragraph is pure scaffold—three sentences restate "revolution quietly spreading" with zero added pressure. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—secret society using art to communicate revolutionary codes during a blackout—is a template dystopian-resistance plot executed without transformation. The "coded angles in a half-painted sundial" and bronze quill holder are genre-typical spy props. Emotional arc and conflict would survive unchanged with different names and setting. The "winking hush" tone and fire metaphors echo familiar revolutionary rhetoric. No synthesis or risky choice elevates the familiar frame; the story hedges toward median safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and completes the sundial, but his role is execution of a pre-determined plan rather than decision under pressure. He paces, traces walls, completes art, meets the Keeper, and resumes his post—all without a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. His observation of younger guards and "calm inventiveness" are told traits without dramatized tradeoff. Present in closure but not causally active; he simply returns to his post as the revolution "begins to glow" off-page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder is touched in four beats: initial description, removal and unfolding to reveal brush, replacement after the meeting, and final mention against his heart. However, its use is mechanical—Elias unfolds it, uses the brush, and replaces it—without visible cost or tactical constraint. The "warm against his ribs" and "tangible reminder" are static descriptors. It does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the final mention is ornamental rather than charged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"The cradle of sparks" appears twice as metaphor ("needed only the right whisper to ignite," "tangible reminder of their carefully nurtured cradle of sparks") but never shapes an on-page choice or tactic. It is thematic assertion—revolution requires nurturing—without dramatized friction or cost. The concept is told rather than enacted; no action traces causally to this premise. Present as label only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is asserted in paragraph one ("calm inventiveness amidst the growing tension") and recalled in paragraph four ("His calm inventiveness had served them well, designing methods…"). However, no on-page moment shows Elias inventing a solution under pressure or paying a cost for his composure. The sundial communication system is pre-existing, not improvised. The trait is label-only without visible constraint or enabling tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Intrigue" is named three times and frames the setup—building for weeks, communicated via sundial—but the on-page action is routine execution. No turn traces to intrigue as a causal force; the blackout and sundial completion proceed without complication. The element is present thematically ("contribution to the intrigue") but does not redefine options or create friction. Swappable with "conspiracy" or "plan" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The coded angles in the half-painted sundial are introduced early (paragraph two), detailed in paragraph three (Elias completes the message with brush strokes), and confirmed in paragraphs seven and nine ("those who understand the coded angles will know," "completed message"). The method shapes the communication tactic and recurs at closure. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than shown—we are told the angles convey coordinates but never see how interpretation works or what cost the encoding exacts. Functional across setup, middle, and payoff but without specificity or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight is anchored in the opening sentence and recurs throughout: bioluminescent walls flicker during the blackout, corridors move from "brilliantly illuminated" to "merely luminous," and power returns the fort to "full luminance." The setting provides atmosphere and marks the blackout's progression. However, it does not constrain Elias's movement or force a tactical choice—he traces walls "with practiced fingers" but the darkness poses no obstacle. Present across beats and shaping the temporal frame, but postcard rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blackout is introduced in paragraph one, persists through Elias's work (paragraphs two–six), and ends in paragraph eight ("power surged…minutes later"). It provides cover for the covert communication and marks the window for action. However, the blackout is "anticipated, planned even"—it does not surprise or complicate. No urgency or ticking-clock pressure is dramatized; Elias completes the sundial and attends a meeting without haste. The timeframe enables the plot but does not tighten choices with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To spark a silent revolution" is stated repeatedly (paragraphs four, six, seven, nine) and frames the overall goal. However, the motivation is never dramatized as conflicted—Elias, the guard, and the Keeper share identical conviction with no friction, doubt, or competing desire. No on-page choice tests this want against cost; the sundial completion is smooth execution. The motivation is told thematic backdrop rather than a force that creates pressure or foreclosure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Winking hush" is named explicitly twice (paragraphs five and seven) and echoed in "quiet," "subtle enough to evade detection," and the blackout's secrecy. The tone is asserted rather than enacted—no dialogue carries subtext, no gesture implies more than it states. The tone does not modulate under pressure; Elias remains evenly composed from opening to close. The final paragraph's "embers…began to glow" is declarative rather than charged by restraint or implication. Present as label without tonal control in execution.</comment>
