<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains more concept than character. Her specialty, her quill, her mentor, her past predictions are told in exposition; we never see her misbelieve, struggle with conflicting impulses, or make a micro-choice under pressure that reveals hierarchy of values. The final act—dipping the quill and writing—arrives without dramatized internal friction or visible cost that would make this choice difficult rather than procedural. Interiority is abstract ("visualizing the vast network of data points") rather than embodied and particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words, but no meaningful escalation or reversal occurs. The piece opens with Elara ready to write, describes her methods and past successes in summary, then ends with her writing—a straight line without tightening options or altering knowledge. The closure unit (pen meeting page) lacks felt cost; she is "satisfied" without visible forfeit or friction. Under any inferred lens, the ending delivers procedural completion rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with on-page price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly named and receive atmospheric detail, but function as backdrop rather than constraint. Cracks "already forming along what her calculations had predicted" could pressure a choice but remain observational. The spire "amplified her abilities somehow"—a told convenience without tactile mechanics. Spatial choreography is clear; sensory detail is selective but never forces Elara to adapt tactics or pay a cost tied to environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—warning villagers of the thaw—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, no competing pressure, no moment where the map might fail or demand a trade-off. Elara faces no meaningful obstacle; her past accuracy is summarized, her current task proceeds without friction, and the ending pronounces success without demonstrating escalation or cost. The piece operates as a procession of affirmations rather than a conflict under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The concept "ignorance cartographer" and the theme of prediction versus adaptation are clearly signaled, but remain at the level of label and summary. The kingfisher quill and obsidian spire recur as symbols without dramatized thematic friction—Elara never confronts a limit to prediction or a moral cost of intervention. The final paragraph's "seeded innovation within the constraint" repeats the prompt's language rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer earned through scene work. Thematic resonance stays abstract.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; phrases like "vast network of data points" and "groundedly imaginative approach" feel borrowed from the prompt rather than inhabited. Register drifts toward explanatory mode ("ignorance cartographer, her specialty was charting not what was known") without the idiom or rhythm of a lived perspective. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance remains consistent but lacks texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "predictive modeling" appears five times, "transformation" / "transformative" recurs across adjacent paragraphs, and several sentences restate Elara's past accuracy without advancing pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Elara [verb]" or "[Elara's trait]." The kingfisher quill is described as shimmering, capturing light, hovering—three ornamental beats without causal work. Figurative language ("dark tooth," "illuminate the blank page before it even touched it") stacks without coherence. Scaffold phrases like "her purpose was clear" and "with quiet determination" pad rather than propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—cartographer of the unknown who writes predictive maps—echoes familiar speculative-fiction templates without fresh transformation. Elara's methods are declared ("meteorological data, geological markers, celestial alignments") but remain generic system-building rather than specific lived detail. The obsidian spire as "natural conductor" is a stock mystical-realism device. No bold risk or unconventional choice; the arc follows a predictable announce-then-execute path. The piece reads as a competent assembly of prompt elements rather than a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is named throughout but makes no key turn; her role is observational and procedural, not decisional under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill appears in paragraph 3 (setup), is dipped into ink near the end, and "finally let...meet the blank page" in the final beats. Three touches across the text, but purely procedural—no cost, no tactical constraint, no reweighted meaning at closure. Swappable with any writing instrument.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Writing the future" is named in paragraph 5 and repeated as theme throughout; it frames expectation but does not shape on-page choices or narrow options. The map is written but its creation involves no friction, only procedural completion. Present in closure image but without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" appears once (paragraph 7) as a label, then echoed in paragraph 20. No dramatized tradeoff between "grounded" rigor and "imaginative" leaps; the trait exists as summary rather than constraint or enabler of a specific choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Prevail" appears twice (paragraphs 12, 23) as a descriptor of past and intended success. No on-page action dramatizes overcoming resistance; the element is told rather than enacted, swappable with "succeed" or "complete."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Predictive modeling" is named in paragraphs 5, 9, 13, 24. Mechanics are summarized (meteorological, geological, celestial data) but never shown shaping an attempt or forcing a tactical adjustment. Present across beats but purely expository, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake anchor the setting in paragraph 1 and recur across the text. The spire "amplified her abilities" and provides a "retreat" for three winters; the lake shows cracks that confirm predictions. Two functional beats (amplification, confirmation) give the setting modest causal presence, but no choice is forced by spatial constraint. Early signal and closure participation lift the score; lack of tactical pressure caps it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the pen meets the blank page" is signaled in paragraph 4, structures the entire narrative as a pre-action window, and lands explicitly in paragraph 26 when she "finally let the kingfisher feather quill meet the blank page." The frame tightens expectation and delivers closure participation, but no on-page clock pressures a decision or alters tactics. Present in all three gates (setup, middle anticipation, payoff) with thematic coherence but minimal cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Seed innovation within a constraint" appears verbatim in paragraphs 10 and 30, framing Elara's stated motivation. No on-page scene dramatizes conflict between innovation and constraint; the villagers' need is summarized, her solution proceeds without friction. Motivation is told and reiterated rather than tested through choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" is named in paragraph 17 and echoed in the final lines. The tone remains earnest and declarative throughout, with no modulation under pressure. The concept of transformation recurs as theme and labels the villagers' survival, but the narrative does not enact a tonal shift or charge the final image with the weight of change. Present as thematic statement; absent as felt pressure.</comment>
