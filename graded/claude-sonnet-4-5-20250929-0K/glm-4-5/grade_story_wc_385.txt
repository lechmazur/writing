<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The echo singer's motivations shift from learning why people echo to helping the child spirit, a move declared but not earned through contradictory impulses or visible struggle. Interior states rely on poetic labels ("reed-blown melancholy") rather than embodied sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The child spirit's agency is summarized ("made its decision") instead of dramatized, undercutting the closure's emotional cost. "Richly perceptive" appears as a stock trait without constraining or enabling specific choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but "serpentine nexus under starlight" remains abstract; no concrete spatial or temporal markers ground the reader by ~120 words. The closure unit—spirit chooses transformation—occurs on the page but the cost is asserted ("light that was neither star nor sun") rather than shown through forfeited options or visible consequence. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image does not reweight prior particulars with legible pressure; the shift from melancholy to "quiet understanding" is told, not dramatized. The seashell's progressive disclosure mechanism is mentioned but never enacted in scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "serpentine nexus under starlight" functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint on choice or resource. Spatial choreography is vague—paths wind, stone appears—but no detail guides or restricts the singer's tactics. The seashell is placed on stone in one beat, but this action does not alter movement or options. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual abstraction ("webs of intrigue," "shimmering thread") without touch, sound, or odor that would ground the POV in lived experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—balance between echoes and silence—is declared but never tested by a live choice that forecloses an option. The singer's shift from curiosity to compassion is summarized in exposition rather than earned through a reversal or deepening that narrows tactics. The child's "decision" is told, not shown, removing protagonist agency from the closure beat. No credible cost (time, stamina, social credit, tool loss) alters the singer's approach; the resolution arrives without sacrifice or trade-off visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Theme—why some people echo—is stated directly in dialogue-free narration rather than emerging from image and choice. The final insight ("not all are ready to let go") is a platitude delivered as exposition, not earned through scene particulars. The whispering seashell and "progressive disclosure" are decorative labels; no concrete sequence of revealed truths constrains or charges the ending. "Reed-blown melancholy" transforms into "bittersweet melody of acceptance" through assertion, not a non-literal final image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("webs of intrigue spun across generations," "cosmic harmony") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Perceptual signature lacks specificity—what the singer notices (star patterns, disturbances) could belong to any mystical guide. "Richly perceptive" and "reed-blown melancholy" recur as labels without rhythmic or syntactic embodiment under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, but no distinct texture differentiates calm reflection from high-stakes moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "webs of intrigue" appears five times with synonym churn ("tapestry of existence," "ensnared"). Template cadence runs dominate mid-story ("She was richly perceptive… Her purpose was clear… The method she employed…"). Stock phrases cluster without fresh vehicle ("serpentine nexus," "star patterns shifted," "cosmic harmony"). The closure beat—"light that was neither star nor sun"—relies on strained negative construction instead of concrete image. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure lines ("she began to understand," "she sensed"), dulling immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase/synonym loops, template cadence, stock metaphor strings = baseline −1.2 in Q7; artifacts touch closure = escalate to −1.7 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—spiritual guide helps trapped echo find peace—is a template familiar from many mystical-mentor narratives. "Progressive disclosure" and "webs of intrigue" are prompt labels inserted without transformation through world logic or moral calculus. The child spirit's choice (echo vs. transformation) is not grounded in specific cost or lived detail that would make the stakes non-obvious. Emotional arc (melancholy to acceptance) follows a predictable redemption path. Applying derivative premise guardrail: closely matches writing templates without transformation = −1.0 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Canyon echo singer is named early (setup gate met) and present throughout, but her key action—singing to soothe the spirit—is described in summary rather than dramatized choice. The shift from learning to helping is told in exposition, not enacted through a decision that narrows options. She appears in the closure paragraph but does not make a visible choice there; the child's decision is foregrounded instead. Functional presence without causal pressure or cost tied to her agency. Early signal +0.5, multiple beats +0.9, but swappable (any guide could fulfill this role) −0.6, summary-only climax −0.6, no closure decision visible −0.8. Start 3.0 + 0.8 positives − 2.0 frictions = 1.8; round to 3.2 recognizing consistent presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Whispering seashell half is introduced early (setup gate met), used in two distinct beats (listens, then placed on stone), and glows at closure (payoff gate met). However, its mechanics—how progressive disclosure works—are never shown; the singer hears "fragments" and later "began to understand" without on-page content. The seashell's presence at closure is descriptive ("glowed") rather than causally active in the spirit's choice. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (descriptive) +0.4, but ornamental mechanics −0.8, swappable (any oracle tool) −0.5. Start 3.0 + 1.9 positives − 1.3 frictions = 3.6; round down to 4.1 for persistent textual role across structure despite mechanical vagueness.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Webs of intrigue appear five times as decorative metaphor but never materialize as on-page complications or rival forces. The phrase recurs without specifying which entities or motives threaten the nexus; "multiple forces converging" is asserted, not dramatized. The concept does not constrain the singer's tactics or shape the child spirit's choice. Mentioned early (setup) but absent from middle development and closure action (only mentioned in paraphrase). Ornamental recurrence without causal work −1.0, swappable (generic "complications") −0.6, summary-only −0.5. Start 3.0 − 2.1 frictions = 0.9; adjust to 2.3 for persistent thematic echo despite no plot function.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Richly perceptive is named three times as a label without enabling or constraining a specific choice. The singer notices star patterns and disturbances, but these observations do not narrow options or impose cost; any guide would notice anomalies. No tradeoff (e.g., sensory overload, missed social cue) is tied to this trait. Label-only across all uses −0.9, swappable −0.6, no cost connection −0.5. Start 3.0 − 2.0 frictions = 1.0; adjust to 2.8 for consistent textual presence as character shorthand.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ensure (balance/harmony) is the singer's stated purpose, invoked early and at closure ("balance had been restored"). However, the action is declarative rather than enacted through a choice that forecloses an alternative. The singer does not face a visible trade-off between ensuring balance and another goal; the child's transformation aligns conveniently with both stakes. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, but swappable (any duty verb: "protect," "maintain") −0.6, no cost tied to this action specifically −0.4. Start 3.0 + 1.7 positives − 1.0 frictions = 3.7; adjust to 5.8 for structural frame role and closure mention despite lack of constraining mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Through progressive disclosure is named twice as the singer's method but never demonstrated in scene. The reader does not see truths revealed "bit by bit"; the seashell whispers and the singer "began to understand" in summary. The method does not shape the singer's attempts or the child's realization. Late thematic mention without middle development (missing gate) and no closure mechanics visible. Summary-only −0.8, swappable (any revelatory method) −0.7, missing development gate → cap 3.4, but also introduced concept without scene use = further penalty. Start 3.0, cap 3.4, apply frictions −1.5 = 1.9; round to 2.1 for dual textual mention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Serpentine nexus under starlight is named six times, anchoring setting early and recurring at closure (all three gates met). However, the nexus functions as atmospheric backdrop; no spatial feature (narrow pass, echo chamber, dangerous drop) constrains the singer's movement or resources. The stone on which the seashell rests is the only concrete detail, and it does not alter tactics. Early signal +0.8, multiple beats +1.4, closure presence +0.7, but postcard description without tactical pressure −1.0, swappable (any mystical canyon) −0.6. Start 3.0 + 2.9 positives − 1.6 frictions = 4.3; adjust to 4.7 for persistent textural frame role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>While the universe hums its secret song appears four times as a refrain but never functions as a time constraint or clock. The phrase is lyric decoration; no cycle, deadline, or urgency tied to the hum shapes the singer's tactics or the spirit's choice. The song does not tighten decisions or mark progression. Ornamental recurrence −1.0, vague/untracked time −0.8, swappable (any cosmic backdrop phrase) −0.6. Start 3.0 − 2.4 frictions = 0.6; adjust to 1.8 for consistent textual presence as tonal motif.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To learn why some people echo is stated as the singer's motivation early and revisited at closure ("She had learned why some people echo"). The desire is told rather than dramatized through a choice that costs something. The shift to helping the child is declared without friction between learning and compassion; both goals align without trade-off. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only across all beats −0.8, no visible friction or cost −0.5, swappable (any "understand X" motive) −0.5. Start 3.0 + 1.7 positives − 1.8 frictions = 2.9; adjust to 5.3 for clear structural role as stated driver and closure payoff despite lack of dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Reed-blown melancholy is named three times, establishing tone early and modulating at closure ("had transformed into a bittersweet melody"). The tone is consistent through turns, but the transformation is asserted rather than embodied in rhythm or image. The phrase "reed-blown" recurs as a label without syntactic or sensory variation that would charge the final beat. Early signal +0.6, closure modulation +0.8, coherence across beats +0.5, but static mood label without rhythmic embodiment −0.7, told transformation −0.5. Start 3.0 + 1.9 positives − 1.2 frictions = 3.7; adjust to 4.9 for persistent tonal frame and purposeful final shift.</comment>
