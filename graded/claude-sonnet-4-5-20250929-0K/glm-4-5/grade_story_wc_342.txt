<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness is label-only; though it motivates her artistic method, it never constrains a choice under pressure. The coin discovery and final realization occur without internal conflict or contradictory impulses. Motivation is declared (mirror the sky, honor the Scholars) but not dramatized through competing desires with visible cost. The ending shift from literal stars to "constellations of human connection" reads as epiphany rather than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; the piece layers discovery (hidden compartment → coin → pattern recognition → final impressions) toward a closure image that reweights Elara's project. Orientation is clean. However, the closure unit—walls shimmering with interlocking patterns—is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), yet the cost is asserted rather than shown: no visible sacrifice, foreclosed option, or price paid on the page. The final pocket-coin moment gestures toward continuity but does not land a decisive change with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hollowed tree trunk, moonlight through carved leaf patterns, and the hidden floorboard depression all pressure Elara's discovery sequence. The coin's tactile indentations serve as micro-setting that enables her pattern recognition. Spatial choreography is clear (central chamber, floor, walls). The tree's imminent demolition provides temporal constraint, and the final wall impressions charge the closure image, lifting the setting into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (complete the sky-mirror project before demolition) is signaled early. The coin discovery deepens the project's meaning, but the transformation from literal stars to soul-patterns occurs without a visible tradeoff or narrowed option. No on-page reversal tests commitment; the protagonist moves smoothly from idea to execution without friction. The dawn approach provides urgency, yet Elara faces no tactical cost or forced choice that alters her plan.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (perception beyond conventional sight, essence over appearance) emerges through Elara's face blindness and the coin's algorithmic key. The final wall patterns offer a non-literal answer to "how to see people" without stating a moral. However, the piece leans on the prompt's concept labels ("fractally precise," "essence rather than appearance") and delivers a thesis-adjacent final paragraph ("honor the tree, its inhabitants, and her unique way of seeing") that edges toward thematic echo. The coin motif charges the closure but is introduced late (past midpoint).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (pattern over feature) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("heightened stillness," "fractally precise," "the limits and the boundless potential") that exceeds the immediate voice. Filter verbs ("she allowed herself to discover") and abstract phrasing ("the invisible bonds between people") dull immediacy in peak beats. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across multiple beats: "discovering the limits" recurs in lines 8, 14, and 22 with minimal variation; "her motivation transformed" (line 17) is restated in "her ultimate achievement" (line 21). Template cadence appears in the opening ("she moved…she had worked…she saw…she knelt"). Stock phrases ("heightened stillness," "discovery dawning," "ultimate achievement") cluster in final third. These artifacts dull propulsion and trigger −0.6 in Q7; they also disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Face-blind portrait artist is a fresh angle, and the coin-as-algorithmic-key offers specificity. However, the core arc (artist completes final project in condemned space, discovers hidden artifact that redefines her art) follows a template structure. The synthesis of pattern recognition and soul-mapping is conceptually tidy rather than risky. Emotional specificity is limited; the piece prioritizes concept over lived friction. No derivative-premise penalty applies, but the middle-ground resolution trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Face blindness establishes her artistic method and enables her to decode the coin's patterns (causal link in one beat), but it does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff. Present in setup (paragraph 2) and referenced at closure ("faces without defining them"), but her disability functions as backstory explanation rather than live pressure. Functional but replaceable; pattern recognition could be motivated by other traits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The secret book safe is discovered (beat 1: floorboard), opened (beat 2: coin inside), and its contents shape the ending (impressions around chamber). It appears early (~30% mark), drives two distinct beats, and the coin's pattern informs the final wall work. However, the safe itself is a container; the coin does the causal work. Swappable with any hidden compartment. Cap at 6.1 for two-beat involvement without unique irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is signaled in setup (line 8: "pushed her to discover the limits"), recurs mid-story (line 14: "allowed herself to discover the limits"), and frames the ending (line 22: "discovered both the limits and the boundless potential"). It shapes her realization that the Scholars recorded souls, not faces, altering her project's aim. However, the concept is more thematic gloss than a constraint that narrows options. Two-gate plus lyric reprise; trends 5.5–6.3 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears twice: line 6 (mapping system) and line 15 (coin patterns → plaster molds). The trait describes her method but does not constrain or enable a dramatized choice with visible cost. It labels her process rather than creating friction or tradeoff. Present but ornamental; swappable with "mathematically exact" or similar. Late-ish first strong use (line 15, ~60% mark) and no closure linkage beyond mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Craft" drives three beats: adjusting projections (paragraph 9), pressing coin into clay and transferring to plaster (paragraph 16), and crafting impressions around the chamber (paragraph 19). The action is causally central to the closure: the final wall patterns are the product of her crafting. Signaled early (paragraph 1: "complete one final project"), sustained through middle, and culminates in the shimmering walls. Essential across beats; removing it collapses the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The centuries-old coin with faint indentations is introduced mid-story (~45% mark, paragraph 11) and immediately decoded via Elara's pattern recognition. Its method (algorithmic key through indentations) enables the plaster-mold technique and informs the final wall impressions. It shapes two beats (discovery/decoding and application) and participates in closure. However, late arrival (−0.3) and the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized in action. Strong causal work but swappable with any patterned artifact; trends upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tree trunk library supplies spatial anchors (central chamber, carved leaf ceiling, wooden floorboards) and the hidden compartment that triggers discovery. The building's imminent demolition pressures the timeline. Moonlight through ceiling carvings creates the constellation effect Elara mirrors. The setting constrains her final night of work and provides the surfaces (walls) for her impressions. Present in setup, pressures choices, and charges the closure image (walls shimmer). Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hush before demolition is declared in setup (paragraph 3: "final hours") and recurs at closure (paragraph 20: "as dawn approached," paragraph 23: "first mechanical sounds"). It frames urgency but does not tighten tactics on the page; Elara works methodically without visible time pressure forcing choices or shortcuts. The clock is present but not leveraged to narrow options or impose cost. Two-gate (setup and closure mention) but no middle development; cap at ~5.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mirror the sky inside walls" is Elara's stated project (paragraph 3) and transforms mid-story (paragraph 17: "not about literal stars anymore, but about mapping constellations of human connection"). The motivation drives her presence in the library, her adjustment of projections, and the final impressions. However, the shift is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Three gates (setup, middle transformation, closure achievement) but desire is told more than shown in friction. Trends upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" appears in setup (paragraph 4: "exuded a heightened stillness"), recurs in closure (paragraph 23: "in the heightened stillness between destruction and creation"), and modulates subtly (paragraph 5: moonlight shifts; paragraph 20: dawn stirs outside). The tone is coherent and charges the final image ("between destruction and creation"). However, it remains a single static mood with minimal modulation under pressure; no tonal shift that reweights stakes. Lyric reprise functional but not dynamic; trends mid-6s.</comment>
