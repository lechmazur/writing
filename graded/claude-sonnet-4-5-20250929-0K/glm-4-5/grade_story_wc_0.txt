<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's transformation is presented almost entirely through assertion and reflection rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The piece tells us she has "shifted" and found "kindled humility" without dramatizing the internal conflict that would make such a shift credible. Micro-choices are absent; she observes and reflects without facing competing pressures that would reveal hierarchy of values. The final "smile" registers as summary of emotional state rather than embodied response to stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure event occurs; the piece is a static meditation on transformation already completed before the narrative window opens. The "after the flood" timeframe places all decisive change in backstory—Elena has already shifted focus, already found her calling. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes theme ("she had found her true calling") rather than allowing image or action to reconfigure meaning. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights stakes; the piece loops thematic assertions without escalation or cost visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is established early and provides vivid anchoring detail (broken glass, cracked terracotta, water-stained walls). Micro-setting touches—butterfly wing on pot, seedling through concrete—are selective and purposeful. However, the environment does not constrain any on-page choice or meaningfully charge the final image; Elena moves through space observing rather than navigating obstacles that alter tactics. Spatial choreography remains coherent but passive.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>No dominant stake is tested on the page. The piece declares Elena's motivation ("to strip needless drama") but never dramatizes a moment where that desire conflicts with another pressure or cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs within the narrative window; all transformation happened before the story opens. The final paragraph's summary ("she had found what she had been searching for") confirms the absence of live escalation. Coincidence does not apply; the problem is that nothing happens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of decay/renewal and cosmic/terrestrial connection emerges through concrete images (butterfly wing dust, spiral galaxies, seedling through concrete). However, thematic assertions dominate the final third: "not in distant stars, but in the gradual change," "true calling: to witness and honor." The piece tells its theme repeatedly rather than allowing particulars to accumulate into resonance. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly, replacing earned insight with summary. Subtext is minimal; most meaning is stated directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into abstract register inconsistent with on-page perception: "kindled humility," "preprocesses reality," "Resonant Reconfiguration" (implied by structure). Narrative distance is consistent but emotionally remote; Elena's interiority reads as philosophical summary rather than embodied thought under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic—she "marvels," "realizes," "smiles"—without character-specific filtering. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops across multiple paragraphs: lines 11–12 (decay everywhere/promise of new life), lines 13–14 (same forces/different scale), lines 19–20 (decay not ending/destruction precedes creation) restate identical ideas. Template cadence runs through reflection: "Elena realized," "Elena knew," "Elena felt." Stock metaphors accumulate: "cathedral," "talisman," "cycle anew." Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is low; most sentences perform thematic summary rather than advancing situation or choice. Apply −1.2 for loops and template stems touching multiple beats; artifacts appear throughout final third, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Core premise (scientist finds meaning in small post-disaster renewal) is widely used template material without fresh transformation. Emotional arc could run unchanged with different names and setting. The "cosmic researcher learns humility from nature" trajectory is familiar and executed without specific, non-obvious synthesis. Authentic particulars (neutron star research, butterfly wing dust patterns) are present but underused; they ornament rather than generate inevitable turns. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece chooses safe, median philosophical resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elena appears throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or stakes. She observes, documents, reflects—passive witness rather than agent under pressure. Her profession is mentioned but does not constrain or enable action; "neutron star researcher" functions as biographical detail without causal weight. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Butterfly wing dust appears in paragraph 6 (collection), 14 (microscope examination), and 22 (talisman). Two distinct beats qualify, but the object does not constrain choice or enable tactics; it serves as observational prompt for thematic reflection. No visible cost tied to the element. Present across beats but functionally inert; swappable with any small natural artifact. Caps at 4.6 for late first appearance (beyond 40% mark) and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Gradual change" is announced in line 4 and echoed throughout (lines 10, 15, 24). The concept shapes the thematic frame and appears in the penultimate paragraph's summary ("gradual change happening right before her eyes"). However, it does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options; Elena's observation of gradual processes does not face pressure or cost. Present in closure image but as theme echo rather than causal force. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with thematic linkage allows mid-band, but lack of middle development and causal work limits score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" appears once (line 3) and once echoed (line 13: "ability to preprocess reality"). Label-only mentions without on-page demonstration; the trait does not enable or constrain any action with visible cost. Does not participate in closure. Ornamental descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Decay" is present throughout (lines 11, 19, 20, 25) and structures the thematic opposition (decay/renewal). It shapes the dominant frame and charges the final image ("decay that surrounded her was not something to fear"). However, decay is observed rather than enacted by protagonist; no major turn traces to this action as agent-driven choice. Three-gate presence (setup, development as observation, closure theme) with strong thematic integration but limited causal pressure. Specificity and closure linkage lift score into mid-6s despite lack of protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Accumulated dust patterns" appears in lines 8, 15, 20, 26. The method is signaled and recurs across beats, but its mechanics do not shape attempts or constrain tactics; Elena reads patterns without facing resistance or cost. Present in closure paragraph but as descriptive reprise rather than causal mechanism. Functional but replaceable; any observational method would serve equally. Three gates met but swappability and lack of causal pressure limit score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse is established in opening line and recurs throughout (lines 2, 9, 16, 24). Setting provides concrete detail and frames the transformation spatially. However, the environment does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome; Elena moves through it observing without navigating constraints that alter tactics. Three gates met (setup, development, closure) with purposeful spatial anchoring, but lack of causal pressure on protagonist action limits score. Micro-setting elements (pot, concrete) are present but do not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the timeframe in line 2 ("three weeks ago") and recurs (line 24). However, time does not tighten decisions or shape tactics; no live clock operates within the narrative window. The flood is backstory; all transformation occurred before the story opens. Functional temporal anchor but no pressure on present choices. Setup gate met, but development and closure participation are absent; the element marks a completed shift rather than shaping live escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to strip needless drama" is stated in line 5 and echoed in line 16. Told rather than dramatized; no on-page moment shows this desire in friction with competing wants or costs. Does not shape middle choices or participate causally in closure. Present as label but not enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Kindled humility" appears in lines 9 and 18 as explicit label. Tone is consistent—reflective, meditative—but does not modulate with pressure (no pressure exists on the page). The phrase charges thematic summary in line 18 but functions as assertion rather than emergent effect of scene work. Single static mood throughout; no escalation or turn tests tonal coherence. Functional consistency but lacks the pressure-driven charge required for higher scores.</comment>
