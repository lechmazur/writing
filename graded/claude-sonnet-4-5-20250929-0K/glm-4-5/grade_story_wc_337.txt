<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to ground spirits is clear, and her trembling hands are well-embodied. However, her internal contradiction remains abstract—"broken in ways no craft could mend" is label-only and never dramatizes competing impulses in scene. The attribute of accumulating silence is intriguing but functions more as a metaphor than a trait that constrains her choices under pressure. Jacob's final secret reveal feels unmotivated because we never see him struggle with whether to speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elena's internal repair through the act of unraveling the net. The cost is present but light—"one tiny section of her own damage repaired"—and the spirits settling feels more told than shown. Orientation is prompt (paragraph 1), and the lens holds, but the closure's emotional weight doesn't fully land because the net's unraveling happens too smoothly without friction or setback. The ending reweights her attribute from burden to gift, qualifying as RR, but the shift feels asserted rather than earned through dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vivid and consistent, with starlight and fractured rainbows creating a distinct atmosphere. The net functions as a micro-setting object that enables the climactic unraveling. However, the sanctuary itself doesn't constrain Elena's choices—she works unimpeded, and the space functions more as backdrop than pressure. The starlight's role in "grounding" the spirits is poetic but mechanically unclear, which limits its tactical function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and remains coherent. The story accumulates texture through the unraveling beats, but there's no meaningful reversal or tightening: Elena begins with purpose, proceeds without obstacle, and succeeds. The net yields "whisper of history" and "fragment" in a smooth progression that lacks friction. The spirits settle without resistance, and Jacob's secret emerges passively. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or pattern break is needed; here the beats loop rather than escalate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of accumulated silence transforming from burden to gift emerges through particulars—the net, the needle, the spirits—and avoids overt moralizing until the penultimate line ("A secret isn't meant to be kept forever"), which edges toward thesis statement. The prism imagery of fragmentation and the unraveling knots create a coherent metaphorical layer without becoming allegorical. The final image of "mended masks" cast by starlight offers a resonant callback, though the thematic answer feels slightly over-articulated in Elena's closing reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, with a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"silence accumulated like dust in abandoned corners." Free indirect style is clean throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that doesn't feel fully Elena's ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush" as repeated terms) and reads more authorial. Jacob's single line of dialogue is functional but his voice doesn't distinguish from the narrator's texture. No head-hopping or POV leakage; the reflective passages are well-anchored to present stimuli.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, but several patterns recur: "Elena [verb]" openers appear in seven paragraphs, creating mild template cadence. "Interlaced hush" appears three times with near-identical function, reading as a thematic echo rather than escalating meaning. Figurative language is dense—"coiled like the shed skin of some ancient sea beast," "movements causing the light to bend unnaturally," "settled beneath the starlight like snowflakes finding earth"—which suits the Accumulative mode but occasionally slows momentum in the unraveling sequence. The phrase "lucid unrest" appears twice, first as modifier and then as transformed concept, which works but borders on self-conscious patterning. Minor filter-verb stack in paragraph 11 ("felt herself becoming"). No loops or major clarity issues; information density is moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The broken-healer archetype and spirit-grounding through craft work are familiar tropes executed competently but without fresh transformation. The prism sanctuary and accumulating-silence attribute add specificity, yet the emotional arc—wounded healer repairs self while healing others—follows a well-worn template. The fisherman's net and tapestry needle as tools for spirit work offer a tactile angle, but the mechanics remain abstract. The piece commits to its premise and avoids hedging, which prevents it from falling lower, but no turn or synthesis feels surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout and her role as mask restorer frames the premise. She makes one key decision—to unravel the net—but the choice is presented as duty rather than conflict, and she proceeds without friction. Her brokenness is mentioned but doesn't constrain her action; the repair she experiences at the end is a result, not a causal turn. Two beats (approaching the net, working the knots) involve her, but observation dominates over high-stakes choice. Present in closure (the final paragraph), but her agency there is reflective rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in three beats: initial mention with "uncommon purpose," the approach to the net ("poised, a conductor preparing"), and the unraveling sequence where it "moved with impossible precision." Its symbolic and functional role is clear—it's the tool that releases spirits—and it's present in the closure paragraph ("She pocketed her tapestry needle"). However, the needle itself doesn't constrain or fail her; it functions perfectly. Its reprise in the final line reweights it as readiness for future work, which adds charge. Strong setup and closure linkage, but the needle's mechanics remain abstract, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is introduced in paragraph 14, arrives at the 50% mark, and recurs three times as both goal and achieved state. It shapes the central tactic—Elena must weave silence to calm spirits—and is present at closure ("the interlaced hush deepened into a profound stillness"). However, it reads more as poetic label than a concrete pressure or cost; we don't see Elena struggle to achieve it or pay a price when she does. The concept is functional and thematically apt, but swappable with "woven silence" or "gathered quiet" without structural loss. Late introduction and abstract treatment limit integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elena's ability to accumulate silence is seeded early (paragraphs 5–6), mentioned in the climactic unraveling (paragraph 19: "drawn into her attribute of accumulated silence"), and reweighted at closure (paragraph 26: "no longer a burden but a gift"). The attribute enables the final act—each loosened knot adds to her reservoir—and carries a visible cost (it has been isolating). However, the mechanics remain vague; we don't see her choose to deploy it or struggle with its limits. The attribute is thematically active but causally light, functioning more as character trait than on-page constraint. Three beats, early setup, closure linkage, but limited friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Exhume" appears once (paragraph 16: "she could exhume trapped spirits and memories by unraveling knots") as method explanation, then is enacted across paragraphs 18–20 as Elena releases "whisper of history" and "fragment of someone's final word." The action is central to the climax and shapes the resolution—spirits are grounded, Jacob's secret surfaces—but the verb itself could swap for "release," "free," or "unearth" with minimal edit. The exhumation drives two beats and is causally linked to closure, but its specificity as exhumation (versus release) doesn't leverage unique properties. Strong middle and ending involvement, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method is seeded early (paragraph 13: the net is mentioned; paragraph 16: unraveling knots releases spirits) and executed across paragraphs 18–20 where each knot loosened produces a specific effect. The net's centuries-old history is relevant—Jacob gestures to it, and its age ties to the spirits' suffering. The mechanics matter: unraveling is the sole tactic, and the final knot's release triggers the climax. The method drives two beats (approach, execution) and is indispensable to closure. However, the net could be another knotted object (tapestry, rope) with minor edits, slightly reducing irreplaceability. Setup, development, payoff all present; strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is established in paragraph 3 and recurs in six paragraphs, providing consistent atmosphere—fractured rainbows, starlight bending, crystalline walls. It houses the spirits and supplies the starlight under which they settle. The setting is present at closure ("starlight above her sanctuary casting patterns"). However, the sanctuary doesn't constrain Elena's choices; she works freely within it. The prisms' light effects are vivid but decorative—no choice hinges on the refraction. The starlight's role in grounding spirits is asserted but mechanically unclear. Strong atmospheric presence, moderate causal involvement, closure linkage present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "across sharing a secret" is enacted: the story begins before Jacob shares, proceeds through the unraveling, and concludes after his secret is spoken (paragraph 25). However, time is not tracked or tightened—the unraveling unfolds in a smooth, untimed sequence with no clock pressure. The secret's revelation is the structural endpoint but doesn't create a deadline that alters Elena's tactics. The timeframe is present in the arc but functions as a frame rather than a pressure device. Present at closure, functional but replaceable with "across one evening" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to ground restless spirits is stated early (paragraph 11) and drives the central action—approaching the net, unraveling knots, achieving the interlaced hush. The spirits' unrest is shown through "movements causing the light to bend unnaturally" and their settling at closure is on-page. However, the motivation is monolithic—Elena never questions or struggles with the desire; it's duty without internal friction. The desire shapes two beats (decision to act, execution) and is fulfilled at closure with a small internal cost (her own repair). Functional across the arc, but the lack of conflicted choice limits depth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is introduced in paragraph 10 ("feeding their lucid unrest") and transformed at closure (paragraph 27: "lucid now, but no longer unrest"). The tone is sustained through the piece—clarity mixed with disturbance, fractured light, trembling hands, whispered secrets—and modulates in the final third as unrest becomes peace. The tone charges the final image by making the transformation explicit. However, "lucid unrest" as a phrase feels slightly imposed rather than emergent from the scene's texture. Coherent modulation, purposeful reprise, but the tone doesn't deepen pressure in the middle beats—it remains atmospheric rather than escalating.</comment>
