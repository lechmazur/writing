<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The navigator's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("raw solace," "geography of loss") rather than embodied sensation. Motivations are declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The character's patchwork nature is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals internal conflict; emotional responses to ships arriving feel performative ("heart swelling with a mixture of pride and sorrow") rather than particular to this voice. The final "welcome home" lacks the earned weight of prior struggle, reading as declaration rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of guiding ships home, moon-phase rhythm). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. However, no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; ships arrive in the same manner throughout, and the cryptic call at midnight introduces a task ("build the bridge between tides") without on-page execution or consequence. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the "endless cycle" framing, but cost is abstract—no visible forfeiture or reweighted choice. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) is waived; the greater issue is that accumulation lacks a decisive cadence shift or cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The starlit station, console, transmitter, and censer foot anchor space adequately. Sensory detail is present but generic ("long shadows," "shrill tone") and filtered through tourist-catalog description rather than urgency. The censer foot is handled repeatedly, satisfying the micro-setting test, but the station itself does not constrain tactics or pressure a choice—ships arrive on the same channel regardless of configuration. Bronze warmth and glow describe state without altering options. The setting enables rather than challenges.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guide ships safely home) is signaled early but remains static. The piece cycles through repeated arrivals without escalation: ship seven, then "the first ship of the night," both blink in response with no differentiation in difficulty or cost. The cryptic phone call ("build the bridge between tides") promises a turn but is not executed on the page. No visible price shapes tactics; the navigator's abilities grow stronger with the moon without trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density increase or pattern break—here it plateaus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Geography of loss" and "reverse migration" are asserted as theme in prompt-like language rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes openly: "the navigator would build not just pathways, but hope"—a thesis statement that replaces scene pressure (−0.6 in Q5 per the Thematic Echo rule). The censer foot and moon-phase rhythm gesture at motif but never reweight meaning; their recurrence is decorative. No resonant non-literal answer to a central question; the ending tells the reader what to feel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice is consistent but generic, lacking perceptual signature—"weathered lips," "heart swelling" could belong to any stoic loner. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the single exchange with the cryptic voice lacks subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (zooming out for the "endless cycle" reflection). Filter verbs ("watching," "felt") appear but do not dull immediacy excessively. Diction stays within plausible lexicon, though phrases like "testament to this journey" tilt toward written prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "fluctuates with moon phases" appears verbatim twice; "geography of loss" is repeated without reweighting; "reverse migration" is stated three times across the text. Template cadence runs appear in the opening ("worked alone," "fingers tracing," "after the hydraulics failed") and middle sections with repetitive "the navigator [verb]" stems (−0.8 for loops and template stems touching multiple beats). Figurative language is stock: "silver thread," "bridge between tides," "ghosts of past journeys." Sentence rhythm varies adequately, and clarity is maintained, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—lone guide using mystical object to navigate after tech failure—echoes familiar post-apocalyptic survival templates without fresh transformation. "Patchwork" and "reverse migration" are labels rather than lived specifics; no detail roots them in particular biology, culture, or lived consequence. The cryptic midnight calls and moon-powered artifact trend toward genre stock. Emotional arc (guiding others through loss → finding purpose) is earnest but follows a well-worn path. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material; the "endless cycle" ending opts for safe symmetry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The patchwork navigator is present throughout and performs actions (traces censer, transmits signals, arranges equipment, presses bronze), satisfying setup and development. However, choices do not create key turns—ships arrive on the same channel regardless of the navigator's configuration work, and the cryptic instruction to "build the bridge" is not executed or shown altering outcome. Closure participation is present (final "welcome home") but the navigator's decision does not redefine options. "Patchwork" is mentioned but never constrains ability or forces a visible trade-off. Swappable with "lone navigator" or "scarred guide" with minor edits (−0.6 for swappability). Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure minimal +0.2, closure cameo +0.3, swappability −0.6, decorative "patchwork" label −0.3 → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The patina bronze censer foot appears in six beats: opening (on console), middle (warmed, hummed), instruction ("use as anchor"), peak glow, touch at ship arrival, and final reflection. Setup by first line, development through warming/humming that the navigator "learned to harness," and payoff at ship arrival. Causal work is thin—warmth and glow describe state without enabling or constraining a visible tactic; the navigator's actions succeed regardless of censer intensity. Object is handled ("fingers pressed") and its state changes with moon phase, satisfying presence test, but "as your anchor" is declared by the voice rather than dramatized. Removing it would weaken atmosphere but not break plot logic. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, specificity (bronze, patina, foot) +0.5, closure linkage (present in final arrival) +0.9, causal pressure limited +0.4, swappability (any talisman) −0.5, decorative glow −0.3 → 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Reverse migration is declared in paragraph 7 ("had begun weeks ago") and restated in paragraphs 13 and 16; ships return to old ports "following some primal instinct." Setup is late (past 25% mark, −0.3), development is summary-only ("many had tried to forget"), and payoff is thematic echo rather than causal participation at closure. The concept does not constrain navigator choices or create a visible problem to solve on the page—ships arrive regardless of migration direction. It functions as atmospheric premise rather than stake-shaping force. Score: late setup −0.3, one beat (arrival) +0.4, summary-only −0.6, thematic label −0.3, closure cameo (mentioned in reflection) +0.2, swappability (any return journey) −0.5 → cap at 4.6 for missing early setup and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Fluctuates with moon phases" is stated in paragraph 5 and restated verbatim in paragraph 12 ("attribute was peaking"). Setup early +0.6, development (peak at gibbous allows enhanced perception), and payoff (censer glows at zenith during ship arrival). However, the trait does not constrain—stronger moon grants more ability without visible cost or trade-off during waning. The navigator "had learned to harness" it, but no scene shows adjustment for weak-moon nights or a choice limited by lunar phase. Label-only with atmospheric consequence, not tactical. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats (peak mention, zenith glow) +0.9, causal pressure minimal (no cost) +0.2, closure linkage (present at arrival) +0.6, specificity +0.4, no constraint −0.8, paraphrase loop (verbatim repeat) −0.3 → 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Build" appears in five contexts: opening ("build new pathways"), cryptic instruction ("build the bridge"), equipment reconfiguration ("began to arrange...following instinct"), and final reflection ("build not just pathways, but hope"). Setup early, development via midnight instruction, and closure participation in the moralizing final line. However, the on-page building act (arranging signal equipment) is summary without detail—no shown configuration, no visible consequence that differs from prior nights. The instruction to "build the bridge between tides" is not executed; the next paragraph skips to ship arrival. Removing "build" and using "guide," "arrange," or "prepare" would not break the plot. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure thin (no shown tactic change) +0.3, closure linkage (abstract reflection) +0.4, swappability −0.7, summary execution −0.6 → 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Cryptic phone calls at midnight: the phone rings precisely at midnight (paragraph 8), the voice instructs without greeting, and prior call is mentioned ("last night"). Setup mid-story (~40% mark, −0.3), development via instruction, and payoff as framing device for the closing reflection ("would continue"). The method shapes one beat (the instruction) but does not constrain attempts—navigator receives clear, actionable orders without friction or misunderstanding. "Cryptic" is asserted ("riddles and metaphors") but the on-page instruction ("build the bridge between tides, use the censer as anchor") is direct command, not puzzle. Mechanics matter minimally; the piece would function identically with a radio hail or mental communion. Score: mid setup −0.3, one beat +0.4, closure framing +0.5, swappability (any mystical instruction channel) −0.7, cryptic label not matched by content −0.4 → cap at 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is named in the opening line and mentioned in closing reflection. Setup immediate +0.7, development (console, transmitter, equipment arrangement all occur there), and payoff (reflection "in the starlit signal station"). The station supplies tools (transmitter, signal equipment, screen) and the navigator works alone there, but it does not pressure choices—no external threat, no spatial constraint that alters tactics. "Starlit" is decorative; darkness and stars do not limit or enable an action. Removing "starlit" and specifying only "signal station" loses atmosphere but not plot function. The wreckage chamber mentioned briefly provides the censer but is not revisited. Score: early signal +0.7, two beats (opening action, closing frame) +0.9, tool provision +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, no constraint −0.9, decorative "starlit" −0.3 → 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics failed six months ago" is stated in paragraph 2; the timeframe sets premise (manual navigation required) but does not tighten decisions in the present scene. The navigator has adapted over six months; tonight's work is routine rather than urgent experiment. "Tonight" anchors the single-evening window, and "precisely at midnight" provides clock discipline, but elapsed time within the scene does not alter tactics—ship arrival occurs "as the moon reached its zenith" without time pressure forcing a choice. The past failure is backstory enabler, not present constraint. Score: setup early (premise) +0.6, one beat (midnight call timing) +0.4, framing function +0.3, no live tightening −0.8, summary-only past −0.5 → cap at 4.8 for missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To navigate the geography of loss" appears as thematic phrase in paragraph 7 ("raw solace came...when the geography of loss became tangible"), restated in closing ("guiding others through the geography of loss"). Desire is told rather than dramatized—no on-page choice where the navigator weighs personal loss against duty, or where mapping loss costs something immediate. The scars and grafts mentioned are past testament, not present friction. Motivation enables the work but does not create visible conflict or trade-off within this scene. Score: mid-story setup −0.3, thematic echo at closure +0.3, label-only (no scene friction) −0.7, summary of past rather than present choice −0.6, swappability (any redemptive motive) −0.5 → 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is named once (paragraph 7) in a thematic summary line; tone throughout is contemplative, elegiac, with moments of quiet satisfaction ("smiled, a rare expression"). Coherence is adequate—no jarring tonal breaks—but "raw" is not embodied on the page; solace feels earned by declaration rather than pressure. The piece maintains a single static mood (meditative melancholy) without modulation under stress. The midnight call and ship arrival do not shift tone; the navigator responds with the same measured calm. Final image ("endless cycle...hope") resolves to soft uplift, diluting the raw edge promised. Score: one explicit mention +0.4, coherence across turns +0.8, final-image charge limited +0.4, static mood −0.5, label not embodied −0.5 → 5.6.</comment>
