<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The line walker remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of generic mystical declarations ("eyes that saw between worlds") without character-particular texture. The final "task complete" moment arrives without any visible cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path. No internal conflict dramatized; the protagonist glides through ritual without struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but never coheres: ritual steps are listed without deepening pressure or cadence shift. Orientation debt persists past 120 words—who this person is, what specific threat "the coming silence" poses, and why *tonight* matters remain vague. No on-page closure: the story ends with the line walker sensing "the next place," a promise of continuation rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The ritual's completion changes nothing legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and conjured clearing are named repeatedly but remain atmospheric labels without constraining choice. Spatial choreography is clean (pavilion → mosaic floor → chamber center → outside). The "kinetic parapet beneath the dunes" appears in three beats but never alters a tactic; it "responds" and "resonates" without shaping the line walker's actions. No tool, object, or environmental feature charges the final image or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("preserve the echo of wisdom") is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening; the ritual proceeds from tracing patterns → circle emerges → consecration peaks → task complete in a frictionless sequence. Agency is observation and gesture without cost: no live option is foreclosed, no price paid. The "personal cost" is told ("isolation in the present") but not dramatized through a choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus isolation is asserted but never earned through concrete conflict. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "preservation required constant attention, strangely honest assessment, and the courage to walk between established lines." No resonant image reweights prior material; instead the text lectures. "Strangely honest" appears twice as a label without showing how honesty constrains or enables a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person distance is stable. Voice tends toward generic mystical register ("liminal spaces," "echo of wisdom," "ley lines converging") without character-particular idiom. Two lines of dialogue feel authored rather than spoken. Perceptual signature is "peripheral awareness" repeated but not rendered through distinct sensory filters. No head-hopping, but the prose could describe any ritual practitioner.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "murmuring pavilion" appears six times, "kinetic parapet" five, "peripheral awareness" four, "conjured clearing" six—each repetition restates presence without adding pressure. Template cadence: "The line walker [verb]" opens eight sentences. Figurative language is stock ("eyes that saw between worlds," "truth could grow wild like flowers"). Sentence variety is low; most paragraphs begin with the subject. Heavy scaffolding across the piece triggers cumulative −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Premise (mystical guardian preserves wisdom through ritual) is a familiar template without transformation. "Half-masked line walker," "prophet," "kinetic parapet," and "conjured clearings" are ornamental neologisms that do not cohere into a fresh synthesis. No specific world logic or emotional calculus distinguishes this ritual from any other preservation ceremony. The final image (line walker continues to next site) is an open loop rather than an earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Half-masked line walker is named throughout but makes no key choice that alters tactics. The character observes, traces patterns, and completes a ritual without friction. Removing the mask midway changes nothing; replacing it at the end has no consequence. Setup present, middle development absent (no constrained choice), closure participation ornamental (the walker departs without cost). Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development; lower to 3.2 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Kinetic parapet appears in four beats: initially "shifting" (paragraph 4), "responding to the prophet's presence" (same), "resonating in harmony" (paragraph 20), and "eternal motion" (final). Setup present, middle mention lacks causal pressure (it responds but does not enable or constrain), closure mention is atmospheric ("respond as it always had"). No visible cost tied to the parapet. Cap at 4.6 for late setup (paragraph 4, past first third); lower to 4.1 for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Conjured clearings appear in paragraphs 9, 12, 18, 24, and 27. Setup delayed to paragraph 9 (second third). The clearing is manifested, expands, and remains but does not narrow options or force a trade-off. It "creates a sanctuary where wisdom could speak" (told, not shown). Closure participation is summary ("gateways to understanding"). One causal beat (manifesting enables consecration) lifts it to functional. Cap at 4.6 for late setup; +0.2 for closure mention reaches 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" appears twice: paragraph 6 ("strangely honest in their approach") and paragraph 19 ("Strange honesty compelled the line walker to acknowledge the personal cost"). Both are label-only; no on-page action where honesty constrains a choice or imposes cost. Setup present, middle and closure absent as causal force. Swappable with "unusually candid" or "quietly truthful." Cap at 2.8 for missing closure; −0.2 for label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Consecrate appears in paragraphs 10, 16, and 20 ("consecration reached its peak"). Setup present (paragraph 10 signals the ritual). Middle development: the act of consecration structures the sequence. Closure: "consecration reached its peak" but does not drive a turn; the ritual completes without cost. One causal beat (consecration enables the preservation) and closure mention earn functional status. Early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, swappability −0.4, summary-only at closure −0.4 = base ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Peripheral awareness appears in paragraphs 4, 17, and 28. Setup present early. Middle use (paragraph 17): "Through peripheral awareness, the line walker sensed energy flows" but the sensing does not alter a tactic. Closure (paragraph 28): "already sensed the next place" is setup for a future beat, not resolution. The method is told but never shown constraining a choice. Cap at 4.6 for late functional development; −0.5 for ornamental middle use, −0.4 for told-only mechanics = 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Murmuring pavilion is named in paragraphs 1, 5, 12, 13, 20, and 26. Setup immediate. The pavilion "whispers secrets" and "fell momentarily silent" but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. It is backdrop for the ritual, not a constraint. Closure participation: "seemed to smile knowingly" is personification without causal weight. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, ornamental use −0.8, no closure linkage −0.7, swappability −0.4 = ~4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrives" appears in paragraphs 2 and 30, and "three moons past" in paragraph 2. The timeframe is setup but never tightens decisions. "Tonight" (paragraph 10) suggests urgency but no clock constrains the ritual or alters moves. The prophet's "diminishing aura" (paragraph 17) is mentioned once without consequence. Setup present, middle and closure absent as live pressure. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure; +0.1 for thematic echo = 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Preserve the echo of wisdom is stated in paragraph 3 and restated in paragraphs 15, 21, 25, 26. Setup early. The motivation frames the ritual but is never conflicted on the page; no friction between want and cost dramatized through choice. The "personal cost" (paragraph 19) is told, not shown. Closure: "Wisdom's echo had been preserved" declares success without visible trade-off. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, told-only −0.8, no friction −0.5 = ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Whisperfield calm appears once in paragraph 26 ("In the whisperfield calm that followed"). Tone is contemplative throughout but does not modulate with pressure; the ritual's "peak" (paragraph 20) reads as serene as the opening. No cadence shift charges the final image. Introduced in final third, ornamental, static mood. Cap at 4.6 for late appearance; −0.6 for single mention, −0.6 for static application = 3.4.</comment>
