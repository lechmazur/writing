<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The albino tracker's motivation is clearly stated but operates largely in label-only mode; interiority consists of abstract scientific musings ("serene anger," "consciously wild") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic disappearance moment lacks embodied sensory degradation or irrational impulse—the protagonist steps forward with clinical calm, then reports understanding afterward via summary rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The drone relationship reads as utility rather than crucible. No visible tradeoff between competing goods pressures the final choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early and remain stable. The story infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: eclipse → ink experiment → temporal displacement → reappearance with insight. However, the central causal link—how stepping into spilled ink enacts temporal displacement—remains unexplained mechanics ("the designs on the ink flared with impossible light"). The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing (the realization "We change our relationship to it during moments of crisis"), but cost is asserted rather than shown: the tracker "gasps" and vitals fluctuate, yet immediately commands the drone and reaches for a journal with no visible foreclosed path or tactical constraint. The lens holds, but the cost at closure is diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is vividly rendered and its celestial-anomaly property is tied to the research premise. The hummingbird drone and disappearing ink supply tactical texture. However, the setting does not constrain the protagonist's key choice or alter the outcome—stepping into the ink could occur in any lab. The spatial choreography inside the shelter (worktable, stone slab, vial) is clear but does not pressure the disappearance action. Strong atmospheric specificity, but the environment functions as backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking temporal distortion—is signaled early. The piece presents one meaningful tightening: the tracker moves from theory to self-experiment. However, agency is minimal; the protagonist's decision to step into the ink faces no on-page obstacle, competing desire, or visible tradeoff. The eclipse's coincidental alignment supplies the resolution (the ink "flared" only when the eclipse's shadow passed), which reads as external trigger rather than protagonist-driven escalation. The insight at the end ("We change our relationship to it") is declared but not tested by a renewed dilemma or cost that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of temporal perception in crisis is coherent and emerges through the experimental arc. The closing line ("We change our relationship to it during moments of crisis") articulates the premise but arrives as exposition rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The "serene anger" and "consciously wild" traits are invoked repeatedly but never dramatized as contradictory impulses in a choice. The disappearing ink and hummingbird drone recur, yet neither constrains a decision or recharges meaning at the closure beat—static motifs rather than thematic engines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual filter reflects the tracker's scientific focus (geometries, temporal anomalies). However, diction drifts into generic elevated register at peak moments ("ephemeral patterns," "fabric of the patterns," "temporal displacement") without embodied sensory texture. The dialogue with the drone is functional but thin. The prose carries a uniform, measured rhythm that does not modulate under the extreme stress of bodily dissolution, missing an opportunity for syntactic pressure or fragmentation during the disappearance beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>句-level clarity is high; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Grammar and tense are consistent. However, the piece exhibits scaffold loops and template cadence: repeated "Their [noun]" openings across paragraphs, synonym churn around "serene anger" (mentioned three times without evolution), and paraphrase loops (the opening two paragraphs restate the eclipse-time link). The disappearance beat—the story's climax—uses passive constructions ("began to dissolve," "had seemingly disappeared") that flatten immediacy. The final paragraphs pile exposition ("Record this," the three-year backstory, the albinism extended metaphor) rather than propelling toward a charged image. No figurative muddle, but density and propulsion sag in the second half.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of albino tracker, temporal research, and disappearing ink is specific. However, the execution leans on familiar beats: isolated researcher, mystical experiment at celestial event, transformative journey yielding insight. The "serene anger" and "consciously wild" labels gesture at complexity but remain ornamental. The core turn—stepping into ink to displace in time—is visually distinctive but mechanically unexplained, reading more as magical gesture than grounded transformation. The emotional truth of isolation and the hunger for understanding are present but not deepened by a non-obvious moral calculus or tradeoff. Mid-band specificity without ingenuity that reweights the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The albino tracker is present throughout and makes the key decision to step into the ink. However, the choice lacks on-page friction or competing desire; the protagonist proceeds methodically from setup to experiment with no visible hesitation or cost that narrows options. Albinism is mentioned repeatedly but functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than trait that pressures the disappearance choice. The character's observation dominates; the single decision (stepping forward) is enacted without dramatized internal conflict. Setup and middle presence are clear; payoff at closure is observational summary rather than a new choice shaped by what was learned.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The hummingbird drone appears in three beats: initial instruction, mid-scene surveillance, and post-disappearance alarm. Each mention is functional (narrative utility) but does not constrain or enable the protagonist's central experiment. The drone's "urgent beeps" and holographic vitals display react to the disappearance but do not alter the tracker's stance or next move. The object is present across the arc but remains a passive recording device rather than a tool whose specific properties shape tactics or closure. Setup, middle touch, and ending cameo satisfy two gates, but swappable with any monitoring device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is introduced early, explained (visible under certain conditions before fading), and physically used in the experiment. Its ephemeral geometry is the medium through which temporal displacement occurs, making it integral to the method. However, the ink's mechanics are asserted rather than tested; the protagonist does not wrestle with failed attempts, dosage choices, or competing hypotheses that would show the ink shaping tactics. It drives the single climactic beat and is causally necessary, but its properties are not explored through incremental pressure. Setup, middle use (pouring and observing), and closure participation (the ink flares as the vehicle) are present, earning mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" is mentioned twice: once as a label for the protagonist's profession choice and once in backstory. The attribute is told rather than shown through on-page action; no moment demonstrates the tracker resisting convention or choosing isolation over connection with visible cost in the present. The trait does not constrain the disappearance experiment or inform the final realization. Present as characterization flavor but ornamental to the arc; no dramatized friction or tradeoff tied to this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The disappearance is the story's climactic action, occupying the central beat and fulfilling the protagonist's stated goal. The narrative arc is built around this moment (setup → experiment → vanishing → return). However, the action itself is a brief passage with passive syntax ("began to dissolve") and lacks on-page struggle or incremental stages that would deepen its cost. The protagonist steps forward, vanishes, experiences revelation, and reappears—largely a transit rather than a contested choice with visible tradeoff. The action is indispensable to the plot but executed as summary rather than high-pressure scene. Setup, middle (the act itself), and ending (reflection on it) are all present, earning solid integration despite thin dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The method—ephemeral patterns in spilled ink—is introduced early, demonstrated in the experiment, and identified as the key to temporal displacement. The protagonist theorizes synchronizing consciousness with the patterns, then enacts it. However, the mechanics remain abstract ("hidden geometries that shimmered," "woven into the fabric of the patterns") with no on-page test of variables (pattern type, ink volume, timing) that would show the method shaping tactical choices. The method is present in setup, executed in the middle, and referenced at closure ("Record this"), but it functions as a single-use device rather than a system under iterative pressure. Mid-band for presence across gates without demonstrated constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is described in the opening and its property (magnifying temporal anomalies during celestial events) is stated as the reason for the tracker's three-year residence. However, the setting does not constrain or enable the disappearance experiment in a specific way; the ink could be poured and stepped into anywhere. The encampment's corridors and carved shelter supply atmospheric detail but do not pressure the protagonist's choices or alter the outcome. Setup is strong, middle presence is descriptive, and closure does not invoke the setting's unique features. Functional world-building without tactical integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the eclipse ends" is established in the opening line and the eclipse's final shadow coincides with the ink flaring at the climax. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the protagonist works methodically without deadline pressure. The eclipse's alignment is a coincidental trigger rather than a constraint the tracker must race or adapt to. The timeframe is present at setup and ending but does not shape middle tactics or impose visible cost. Functional but replaceable timing; any celestial event could serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation—to discover why time slows in crisis—is stated early ("an experience that had haunted them since childhood") and drives the research premise. The protagonist designs and executes an experiment to test this question. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or visible sacrifice; the tracker proceeds without on-page obstacle or cost that tests commitment. The childhood haunting is mentioned but not developed into a specific memory or fear that complicates the present choice. The final insight ("We change our relationship to it") answers the question but arrives as exposition rather than earned struggle. Setup and thematic presence across the arc earn mid-band, but lack of friction or tradeoff limits integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is invoked three times: once in dialogue with the drone, once as "replaced by a tremor of awe," and once in the backstory. The phrase is used as a static descriptor rather than modulating with the narrative's pressure; the protagonist's tone during the bodily dissolution and return reads as measured observation without tonal shift. The anger is not anchored to a specific on-page target or escalated by the experiment's risk. Present as a label but not coherent as a dynamic emotional register that charges the final image or turns. Ornamental use without tonal pressure.</comment>
