<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mapper's interiority is abstract and label-driven ("softly purposeful," "restrained wildness") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. No meaningful choice appears on the page; the protagonist observes, theorizes, and imagines outcomes without facing a dilemma that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending delivers satisfaction ("the mapper felt satisfaction") through summary rather than a dramatized renunciation or alteration. Motivation remains declared—"unyoke the people from their burden of constant haste"—but never tested by an on-page obstacle or internal conflict that would reveal hierarchies of value.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, mapper at window). However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The story ends with the mapper feeling satisfaction and imagining future outcomes; the "patient revolution" remains a plan rather than a turn that narrows options or imposes cost. The accumulative lens is signaled by moon-path tracking and magnetic resonance, but the final image ("patience, once sculpted, would stand as humanity's greatest achievement") asserts theme without reweighting prior material through action or a charged callback that transforms the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cracking lake sounds, humming viaduct, oil lamp shadows). The viaduct's magnetic anomaly constrains the mapper's method and charges the zenith moment when it hums, satisfying the micro-setting standard. However, spatial choreography within the sanctuary is vague—no specific tool handling or room-to-room movement pressures a choice—and the setting does not evolve causally to alter the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—launching a "patient revolution" by tracking celestial patterns—is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma or trade-off. The mapper waits for the full moon, the viaduct hums on cue, and the protagonist charts the resonance without opposition, uncertainty, or a choice that forecloses an alternate path. No reversal or deepening alters options; the ending delivers thematic satisfaction without a visible price paid or a live constraint that shaped tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—patience versus urgency, celestial alignment as corrective wisdom—emerges from the mapper's observations and the natural phenomena. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "patience, once sculpted, would stand as humanity's greatest achievement," replacing scene pressure with an asserted thesis. The revolution concept and moon-path imagery recur but do not shift meaning through the ending; instead, they serve as ornamental reinforcement of the premise stated at the outset.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated register ("restrained wildness," "softly purposeful") that suits the contemplative mapper. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("profound beauty of moving in harmony with natural cycles") that flattens immediacy, and the mapper's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—details are catalogs (charts, instruments, oil lamp) rather than biased observations that reveal a distinct way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and vivid figurative language ("polished obsidian mirror," "wind in haunting melodies"). However, repetitive conceptual loops appear: "patient revolution" and "unyoke" recur without added pressure, and scaffold phrasing like "the mapper knew," "the mapper had discovered," "the mapper began to chart" creates template cadence across multiple paragraphs. Mixed metaphors ("sculpting patience," "web of patience being woven") blur coherence. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate the revolution's method without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—celestial observation as revolutionary method, magnetic anomalies aligning with moon paths—offers a fresh angle, and the "patient revolution" concept is non-obvious. However, the execution leans on stock New Age wisdom (returning to "ancient rhythms," rejecting "tyranny of urgency") without transforming it through lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The mapper's passivity and the absence of a risky choice that heightens stakes lower originality; the story reads as a contemplative essay on a concept rather than a dramatized synthesis where stakes force the protagonist into uncharted territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The mapper observes, theorizes, lights a lamp, and charts resonance—but no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. Mentioned throughout but functionally ornamental; swappable with "patient observer" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The viaduct appears in setup (discovery of magnetic anomaly), development (alignment with moon paths), and closure (hums at zenith as confirmation). It constrains the mapper's method and shapes the midnight beat. However, it does not impose a cost or create friction; it behaves as predicted, confirming theory rather than complicating stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "patient revolution" frames the dominant stake and recurs as a label throughout. However, it remains conceptual—a plan rather than an on-page action that narrows options. The ending asserts its future impact without dramatizing a turn or cost tied to the revolution's launch.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears twice as a descriptive label (workspace arrangement, mapper's expression) but never constrains a choice or enables a tactic with visible cost. Ornamental trait without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is named as the revolution's goal and recurs thematically, but the action itself is never dramatized on the page. The mapper imagines villagers "unyoking themselves" in the future; no present beat shows the protagonist enacting or testing this action with consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is signaled early, mentioned across several beats (decade of records, alignment with viaduct, charting resonance), and shapes the mapper's method. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than shown in granular action, and the method does not face a complication that forces adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake anchor every beat, providing spatial continuity and vivid imagery (cracking ice, humming viaduct felt through floors). The sanctuary's volcanic construction and the lake's reflective surface subtly pressure the mapper's observation work. The lake's thawing edges in the final line signal seasonal shift, but this does not alter a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the lake freezes over" marks the inciting condition and the full moon post-solstice tightens the timeline for the zenith observation. However, the timeframe does not impose urgency or force a trade-off; the mapper waits and the predicted event occurs on schedule without complication.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "sculpt patience from impatience" is declared and recurs thematically, but never tested by an on-page obstacle or internal conflict. The mapper's desire is asserted rather than dramatized through a choice where patience costs the protagonist something immediate or contradicts another impulse.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" appears as a recurring phrase (lamp flame, mapper's vision, heart of all things) and the tone balances contemplative stillness with natural intensity (cracking lake, humming viaduct). However, the tone remains static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image, which delivers thematic satisfaction in an elevated, abstract register rather than a sensory or tactical crystallization.</comment>
