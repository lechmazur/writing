<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft onto community is clearly established and drives her actions through the search quest. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract longing ("hollowness, a rootless yearning") rather than embodied contradiction. The group formation and arbor dedication show progression, but the final emotional beat leans toward collective warmth without visible internal cost or a foreclosed path specific to Elara. Secondary characters (Kael, Mira, Fen) remain functional types without distinct pressure or status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Elara's isolation → collaborative search → discovery of ancestral sigil → collective dedication. Orientation anchors early (marsh-reeds, crater, orchard). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the group etches the sigil together, reweighting isolation into belonging. Cost is implied through "unshed tears" and the renunciation of solitary identity, but the final image prioritizes communal affirmation over a visceral, on-page price that forecloses a specific prior option. One meaningful deepening is present, satisfying length requirements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and luminescent crater provide vivid, otherworldly anchors with consistent sensory detail (glowing fluid, obsidian outcrops, transparent trees). Spatial choreography during the search (rappelling, pulleys, submerged path) is coherent. The arbor functions as a meeting beacon and final canvas, charging the closure image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it remains atmospheric rather than tactical, capping high-band entry per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and drives the shared search proposal. The quest provides one meaningful tightening (group formation overcoming hesitancy) and a deepening (sigil discovery reweights community from external goal to inherent bond). Agency is present in the proposal and final dedication act. Yet the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path at closure; the group's success feels frictionless after the initial hesitancy, and the final reconfiguration offers warmth without a legible on-page price that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—belonging and kinship—emerges through concrete images (reeds, arbor, sigil) and the shift from solitary to collective action. The sigil discovery as ancestral mark rather than artist's tag provides a non-obvious reweighting. The final dedication avoids overt moralizing, allowing the etched sigil and synchronized breath to carry resonance. However, the phrase "not to found beauty, but to found belonging. To us" borders on direct thematic statement, and the orchard "acknowledging the bond" risks sentimental abstraction, preventing full high-band entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara with appropriate psychic distance and embodied perception (fingertips, breath, kneeling). Diction is consistent and elevated, fitting the otherworldly setting. The non-English fragment "沟通推进" appears mid-paragraph without translation or pattern-teaching, breaking legibility and voice coherence—this is a clear text artifact. Voice distinction among secondary characters is minimal (they remain functionally silent), but single-POV focus mitigates this. Purposeful compression in the search montage is legible under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear with vivid figurative language ("drink the crater's light and bleed it back") and purposeful rhythm. However, multiple issues accumulate: the untranslated fragment "沟通推进" is a disruptive artifact; "boldly sympathetic regard" and "luminescent ache" recur as abstract labels without embodied grounding; synonym churn appears in "hollowness, a rootless yearning" and "profound and resonant"; the final paragraph stacks modifiers ("glimmering," "radiant," "luminescent") without new information. Template cadence surfaces in repeated "their" constructions during the search sequence. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The marsh-reed sculptor in a crystalline crater is visually distinctive, and the sigil twist (ancestral mark, not street art) offers a meaningful reframe. However, the loneliness-to-belonging arc and collaborative quest follow familiar templates without transformation through specific lived contradiction or cost. The emotional progression is tidy and frictionless after the initial hesitation. The group's synchronized effort and the orchard's validating shimmer read as wish-fulfillment rather than earned complexity, lacking the bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus that would lift originality into higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara proposes the search (middle beat enabling the quest) and performs the final dedication (closure beat). Her reed-weaving and arbor creation frame the story. However, her choices feel enabled by group consensus rather than individually costly; the peak decision is collective rather than hers alone, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glimmering obsidian arbor is introduced early (first paragraph), serves as meeting point during the search (middle development), and becomes the canvas for the etched sigil at closure (payoff with reweighted meaning). It accumulates significance across all three gates with specificity (volcanic strands, light pulses). The arbor's transformation from solitary creation to communal symbol directly shapes the ending's resonance, and its unique properties (dark volcanic material holding light) are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Webs of kinship appear as metaphor throughout ("tangled like unseen webs," "threads of past hurts," "webs of kinship stretched thin") and the sigil resembles "a spider's web." The concept shapes thematic resonance but remains largely abstract; it does not constrain a tactical choice or alter on-page options with visible cost. The final dedication enacts the concept but as fulfillment rather than pressure, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears once as a descriptor of the orchard inhabitants' regard toward Elara ("their gazes held a boldly sympathetic regard"). It does not constrain or enable her action with cost, nor does it recur or evolve. The trait is label-only and ornamental, meeting no integration gates beyond passive presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dedication is prepared throughout (arbor as creation, search as bonding), explicitly performed at closure ("I dedicate this glimmering obsidian arbor..."), and redefines the arbor's meaning from solitary art to communal bond. The act is irreplaceable—swapping "dedicate" for another verb would weaken the ritual and thematic weight. It drives the closure unit with specificity and cost (transformation of the arbor's purpose).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shared search is proposed in paragraph two, structures the middle quest (mapping, pulleys, climbing, discovery), and culminates in finding the sigil that reweights community understanding. The method's mechanics (reed pulleys, rappelling, Fen's pathfinding) shape tactics and reveal character bonds. However, the search succeeds without setback or visible cost, and the sigil is found rather than earned through a costly choice, limiting top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater are established early and provide vivid sensory anchors throughout (luminescent fluid, obsidian outcrops, transparent trees). The crater's physical challenges (treacherous depths, crevasses) enable the quest and the arbor's location at the edge situates the closure. However, the setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost or alter tactics in a way that changes the outcome; it functions as evocative backdrop rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears only in the opening sentence as atmospheric flavor. It does not track time, create urgency, or constrain decisions. The story's temporal progression ("Days dissolved into nights," "one twilight") is vague and untracked, failing to tighten tactics or alter the final image. The timeframe is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to graft onto community is dramatized early ("rootless yearning," proposing the search), drives the middle quest (bonding through shared effort), and is fulfilled at closure (dedication as "found belonging"). The desire faces friction in fleeting connections and her own isolation but is resolved without a visible cost or foreclosed path—she achieves belonging without renouncing solitary artistry or another competing value, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" recurs across the story (crater's "aching glow," "deepened, sharpened," "dissolved...into pure luminescent warmth") and modulates from isolation to fulfillment. The tone is coherent and charges the final image ("radiant home," orchard shimmers brighter). However, the progression is smooth and untroubled after the initial setup; the ache dissolves without friction or ambiguity, and the tone does not tension the closure with cost, preventing high-band entry.</comment>
