<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are coherent and her grief-driven arc is present, but interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing ("feisty nature," "heart swelled with hope"). The final choice to plant the seed feels more symbolic than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied emotion is thin; the quartz eye "aching" functions as a convenient physical correlate rather than a genuine bodily constraint under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The story opens with adequate orientation (who, where) but the closure unit—planting the seed after finding footprints—relies on an off-page reversal (daughter's visit) rather than on-page agency. The causal lens is attempted but weakened by the daughter's absence; Elara's bridge-building is accumulative textural work that shifts to a thematic statement in the final paragraph rather than a felt cost. The "deciduous vows fall, but wisdom persists" moralizing replaces scene pressure at closure, reducing the ending to summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard-spanning-rafters setting is vivid and purposefully surreal, anchoring the piece early and returning at closure to "murmur its approval." Spatial choreography is clear; the mosaic path, tiny bridge, and cathedral column are used tactically. The seed planting near the carved names integrates setting into the final image, charging it with generational continuity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting with the daughter—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is largely internal and reflective; no on-page confrontation or reversal tightens options. The bridge artifact and seed exchange function as symbolic gestures rather than choices that foreclose live paths with visible cost. The daughter's off-page response mutes agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the deciduous-vows metaphor and the orchard motif, but the final paragraph ("Deciduous vows fall, but wisdom persists through seasons") states the thesis outright rather than allowing it to resonate through image. The accidental-wisdom concept is asserted in narration ("The accidental wisdom came not from grand gestures but from this tiny miracle") rather than dramatized. The bloom and seed gestures are purposeful but the closure moralizes instead of offering a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and voice carries a consistent register. The "endearingly feisty" label appears twice but is not embodied in distinct speech patterns or perceptual bias. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the ribbon discovery; filter verbs ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to murmur") are voice-motivated and light. No head-hopping, and the quartz-eye detail offers a signature detail, though underused as a perceptual filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor loops: "Deciduous vows flittered through her mind" echoes the final paragraph's thesis; "endearingly feisty" appears twice without fresh action. The final paragraph stacks elevated diction ("murmur its approval," "watered the seed with tears from both eyes") and delivers theme as summary rather than image, dulling momentum. Information density is adequate; no major template cadence or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The orchard-in-cathedral premise offers a fresh visual hook, and the quartz-eye mender supplies world specificity. However, the estranged-parent-symbolic-gesture arc is familiar, and the transformation is thin: removing the cathedral's surreal orchard would leave a stock reconciliation frame intact. The "Great Departure" and "veil" nod to a larger world but remain ornamental. The bloom and seed exchange feel convenient rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to build the bridge and plant the seed drives the arc. However, her choices are more symbolic than tactical; the daughter's off-page response determines the key turn (ribbon taken, seed left). Setup and development are met; closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ribbon is pulled from the bag early (beat one), used as a cord in the bridge construction (beat two), and found missing with a seed left in its place (beat three). It anchors the generational link and is reweighted at closure. Its removal is off-page, muting causal pressure, but the seed exchange directly shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Deciduous vows" is named in reflection ("These deciduous vows flittered through her mind") and again in the final paragraph as a thematic claim. It does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics; it functions as a metaphor for the estrangement rather than a mechanical concept that shapes action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is applied twice as a label ("her feisty nature showing," "Her endearingly feisty determination") without enabling or constraining a specific choice with cost. It describes her attitude but does not alter a beat's outcome or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Persistence structures the middle act: Elara works "until the tiny bridge was complete" and "continued to persist" despite sore fingers. It shapes the bridge-building beat and the seed-planting beat. However, the action is somewhat generic—any sustained effort could replace it—and the daughter's off-page visit determines the key turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The forgotten bag is opened early and its contents (tin, ribbon, nails, porcelain) supply materials for the bridge. Setup and development are met. However, the mechanics are summarized in one paragraph rather than shown across distinct problem-solving beats, and the bag does not constrain the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The orchard-spanning-rafters is anchored in the opening line, provides the symbolic apples that Elara bridges toward, and returns in the final beat ("The orchard above seemed to murmur its approval"). It supplies both visual texture and thematic weight, shaping the bridge construction and charging the seed-planting image. The cathedral's persistence parallels Elara's effort.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the breach of contract" is mentioned in the opening but remains abstract; no live contract or ticking consequence tightens decisions on the page. The "years" Elara has carried the bag and the overnight bloom suggest elapsed time, but no clock pressures her choices or the daughter's return timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire to bridge generational wisdom is stated early ("bridge generational wisdom by combining elements from her past with the cathedral's present") and drives the bridge construction. It is told more than dramatized; the friction between wanting connection and fearing rejection is implied rather than shown in contradictory impulses. The seed planting enacts the motivation at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom" is named in narration ("The accidental wisdom came not from grand gestures but from this tiny miracle") but the tone does not modulate distinctly across beats. The bloom's appearance and the seed exchange gesture toward serendipity, yet the final paragraph's moralizing ("wisdom persists through seasons") shifts into earnest summary rather than maintaining the accidental quality through image.</comment>
