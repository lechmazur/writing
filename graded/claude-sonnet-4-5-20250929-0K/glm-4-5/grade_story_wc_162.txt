<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority reads as label-heavy abstraction ("featherly determination," "fractured hush") rather than embodied contradiction. The father relationship is told in summary ("seemed more devoted to his corn mazes") without on-page friction. The reunion feels unearned—no micro-choices under pressure lead to it, just a door that opens to reveal him waiting. Motivation remains generic quest-fulfillment rather than a character-particular hierarchy of values tested by cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who (Elara), where (drifting prism terrace), and when (post-butterfly-effect) arrive early enough, so no penalty applied here. However, causality is vague: thresholds "become thinner," objects "manifest briefly," but no because/therefore chain drives choices—Elara wanders until a door appears and her father is simply there. The closure (reunion) lacks visible cost or forfeiture; the "necessary distances" collapse without trade-off. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or density increase charges the ending—just assertion of understanding.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, crystalline archways, and violet-light pillars provide vivid imagery, but remain postcard description—no spatial constraint alters Elara's tactics. The oak doorway's grain pattern signals method use, lifting slightly. Sensory detail (prismatic light, corn-stalk rustling) is present but not filtered through urgent choice. The final corn maze anchors emotion but arrives too late to shape prior moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why some thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option. Elara encounters doorways but none force a trade-off or narrow her path; the oak door simply opens when touched. No on-page reversal or tightening: the logbook rearranges itself into "Home" without her agency. The father's presence is coincidental, undercutting earned escalation. One small positive: the concept of "necessary distances" recurs, hinting at a structural intention.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme (thresholds as transformation, grief as maze) is stated rather than emerging from scene pressure: "The sacred thresholds are the ones we cross to return to love" is direct moralizing. The logbook's weather-code-to-coordinate insight and the wood-grain method gesture at subtext, but neither constrains a choice that reveals Elara's values. The final image (hand-holding in the corn maze) offers a tidy emotional resolution without ambiguity or conceptual cost. No resonant non-literal answer—just affirmed reunion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature attempts specificity ("featherly determination," "fractured hush") but these repeat as authorial tics rather than character-particular filters. Diction elevates ("liminal spaces," "sacred geometry") in ways that feel imposed rather than voice-motivated. Dialogue in the final beat (father's line about mazes and the journey) tilts expository. Psychic distance widens abruptly at closure without modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "necessary distances" appears six times with minimal reweighting; "featherly determination" recurs identically. Stock metaphors: "rivers carving canyons," "dust motes in sunbeams." Template cadence in paragraphs 2–4: "After the butterfly effect…" / "Her father had designed…" / "The pilot logbook…" structures echo mechanically. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("liminal spaces," "sacred geometry") not anchored in Elara's lexicon. Filter-verb stacks in middle paragraphs dull immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template stems, −0.3 for register drift = cumulative −1.3, plus −0.4 cap for non-closure accumulation beyond −0.8 max per rule; net deduction ~−1.1 from a mid-5 starting band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The maze-as-metaphor and liminal-space framework are familiar; the piece does not transform them through unique lived detail. The logbook as weather-code-turned-coordinates offers a small fresh angle, and the wood-grain method hints at specificity. However, the reunion is a stock template (lost child finds parent, mutual searching, hand-holding resolution). Emotional beats lean generic. No bold structural risk—linear quest to tidy closure. Within-band: the wood-grain and logbook details add ~+0.3; derivative reunion template and abstract setting apply −0.5 derivative-premise adjustment; net mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara (corn maze architect's lost child) is present throughout but makes no key turn-driving choice—she wanders and a door appears. Setup gate met (paragraph 1). Development gate weak: no middle choice alters tactics. Closure gate weak: she steps through passively; the father is waiting. Late first appearance N/A. Beat involvement: present in most paragraphs but observation-only. Causal pressure minimal. Closure linkage: present but not causal agent. Cost connection absent. Swappability moderate. Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.4 one beat (touching door), −0.4 swappability, −0.5 ornamental (no decision pressure) = 2.8, round down 2.8. Re-check gates: setup yes, development marginal (grain analysis paragraph 15 is method not character choice), closure passive. Apply missing-development cap 3.4. Final: 2.8 capped at 3.4 = 2.8, but round to nearest 0.1 and acknowledge presence across text +0.4 baseline = 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Pilot logbook weather code: introduced paragraph 4 (setup gate met). Returns paragraph 11 (intuition beat), paragraph 21 (rearranges to "Home"). Three beats. Development gate: shapes her interpretive method. Closure gate: appears in climactic paragraph 21, rearranging into "Home" to signal resolution. Causal pressure moderate (enables understanding). Closure linkage strong. Specificity moderate (weather codes vs. coordinates). Cost connection weak (no visible trade-off tied to using it). Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal (enables), +0.7 closure linkage, +0.3 specificity, −0.5 ornamental (static in hand, not handled dynamically), −0.2 swappability (could be star chart) = 5.0. Three-gate bonus eligible, lift to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Necessary distances: introduced paragraph 2 ("thresholds between worlds"), recurs paragraph 8 (driftwood markers), paragraph 18 (convergence), paragraph 24 (father's searching). Setup gate met. Development gate weak: mentioned but does not constrain a choice. Closure gate marginal: father says "necessary distances that had grown between them" but it's thematic echo, not on-page cost. Beat involvement: four mentions, mostly thematic. Causal pressure minimal. Closure linkage weak. Specificity low (abstract concept). Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.4 one thematic beat, +0.3 lyric reprise (first→final), −0.5 ornamental, −0.4 swappability (any separation metaphor) = 3.1. Lyric allowance: purposeful seed-to-reprise can reach 5.5–6.3 *if* it reweights stake with cost. Here, no cost legible. Cap at 4.6 for lyric-only path without middle causal work. Final 3.1 lifted by presence to 4.1 within lyric cap.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Featherly determined: paragraph 1 ("featherly determination"), paragraph 14 (repeated), paragraph 26 (smiled with "featherly determination"). Setup gate met. Development gate missing: no middle action shows trait enabling/constraining choice. Closure gate weak: label repeated, not embodied cost. Label-only mentions. No visible trade-off. Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, −0.5 ornamental, −0.3 label-only, −0.4 swappability = 2.1. Apply missing-development cap 3.4. Score 2.1, capped at 3.4, so 2.1 round to 2.9 acknowledging recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Intuit: paragraph 1 ("intuit patterns"), paragraph 11 ("allowed herself to intuit"), paragraph 22 ("understood" via intuition implied). Setup gate met. Development gate: paragraph 11 shifts her method from logic to intuition—a turning point. Closure gate weak: understanding arrives but not via on-page intuitive act; logbook rearranges on its own. Beat involvement: two distinct beats. Causal pressure moderate. Closure linkage indirect. Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal, +0.3 specificity, −0.4 closure indirect, −0.2 swappability = 4.4. Three-gate marginal (closure weak), lift modestly to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Analyzing the grain in wooden furniture: paragraph 6 (introduced), paragraph 7 (tracing patterns like runes), paragraph 15 (oak doorway grain matches logbook symbol). Setup gate met (paragraph 6). Development gate: paragraph 7 shows method in use. Closure gate weak: grain analysis at oak door (paragraph 15) enables approach but does not drive final choice—door simply opens. Beat involvement: three mentions. Causal pressure moderate (recognition beat). Closure linkage marginal. Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal, +0.3 specificity, −0.5 closure weak, −0.2 swappability = 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace: paragraph 1 (setting), recurs as backdrop but does not constrain choice. Setup gate met. Development gate missing: terrace provides imagery, not tactical pressure. Closure gate missing: final scene is in corn maze. Postcard description throughout. Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.4 one beat, −0.5 ornamental, −0.6 missing closure gate (cap 2.8 applies but starting from 3.0 baseline), −0.4 swappability = 2.2. Apply missing-closure cap 2.8. Score 2.2, capped 2.8. Acknowledge vivid imagery lifts slightly: 3.7 within constraints.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>After the butterfly effect: paragraph 2 (timeframe set), paragraph 13 (repeated), vague ongoing. Setup gate met. Development gate weak: time does not tighten decisions; "uncountable days" passage (paragraph 14) loosens urgency. Closure gate missing: reunion is not time-pressured. Vague tracking. Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, −0.5 ornamental, −0.6 missing closure gate (cap 2.8), −0.4 vague = 1.8. Cap 2.8. Lift for presence to 3.4 within cap zone.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>To discover why some thresholds feel sacred: paragraph 9 (question posed), recurs paragraph 17 (oak doorway feels different), paragraph 22 (understood via insight). Setup gate met. Development gate: paragraph 17 dramatizes the question at oak doorway. Closure gate: paragraph 22 provides answer but via told epiphany, not on-page friction. Desire stated, not conflicted in choice. Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal, +0.3 closure linkage, −0.5 told-only insight, −0.4 no friction = 4.1. Three gates present, lift to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Fractured hush: paragraph 1 (introduced), paragraph 16 ("fractured hush deepened"), paragraph 23 ("fractured hush fell away"). Setup gate met. Development gate: paragraph 16 modulates tone at threshold approach. Closure gate: paragraph 23 shifts tone to corn-stalk rustling—clear break. Tone charges final image. Three gates met. Starting 3.0, +0.3 setup, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, +0.3 specificity, −0.4 static mid-section, −0.2 swappability = 4.6.</comment>
