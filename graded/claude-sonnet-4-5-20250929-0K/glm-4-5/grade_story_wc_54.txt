<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "stoic determination despite the wonder" and "stoic wonder" are label-only feelings that tell emotional state without embodied specificity. The discovery of the sextant and decision to restore power proceed without meaningful internal conflict or visible trade-offs. The final "smile slightly, her expression still composed but her eyes alight" exemplifies emotion performed rather than lived through action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (abandoned terminal, Maya, carnival left). The inferred lens is Causal-leaning Accumulative: Maya explores → finds sextant → reaches power center → restores lights → discovers equations. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the terminal comes back to life and Maya sees new possibilities, but the cost is implied rather than felt on the page—no visible sacrifice, forfeiture, or foreclosed path. The final paragraph asserts hope and future trajectory without dramatizing what was risked or lost to achieve this moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is anchored with selective detail (dusty console, ticket counter, power distribution center, transformers as "sleeping giants"). The sextant and lights function as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the terminal never constrains Maya's choices—she moves freely, finds what she needs, and succeeds without spatial or resource friction. The lights "awakening in an evening sky" is vivid but the metaphor does not alter tactics or reveal character under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—can Maya restore power and find hope—is signaled but never genuinely threatened. She works with "careful precision" and "absolute focus," throws the switch, and after a perfunctory pause the lights flicker on. No failed attempt, no visible resource cost, no trade-off between competing needs. The sextant discovery and power restoration are sequential additions rather than escalating pressure that narrows options. The coincidental inscription reveal at the end ("coordinates and equations that seemed to speak directly to her project") undercuts earned agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme is announced rather than earned: "maze of intentions," "equations for hope," "tool for navigation—not just through space, but through hope itself" are abstract meta-statements. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "she had found her equation for hope." The sextant as symbol is introduced, rediscovered with new inscriptions, then verbally decoded, all ornamentally rather than through constraining choices. The carnival's departure and Maya's "course toward the future" are generic framing without specific, contradictory particulars that would allow the theme to emerge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal space," "stoic wonder," "resurrect what had been left behind") that sits uneasily with "curious civil engineer intern." The perceptual signature is generic—Maya notices dust, brass, lights—without character-specific bias or professional filter shaping what she sees. Internal voice carries some consistency but lacks distinct rhythmic texture under pressure. No dialogue on the page to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "maze of intentions" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "stoic" paired with "determination" and "wonder" recurs as a label rather than embodied state; "redirected flows" and "resurrect" are repeated without deepening. Template cadence: "She moved… She reached… She pulled… She began…" structures several beats identically. Stock metaphors abound: "sleeping giants," "stars awakening in an evening sky," "ghosts of journeys past." The closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("equation for hope," "course toward the future") that dilute rather than sharpen the final image. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −0.8 for loops and template stems; −0.4 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats totaling −1.2, with artifacts touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—intern restores power in abandoned spaceport and finds hope—follows a familiar template of rediscovery and symbolic resurrection without transformation. The sextant is a convenient symbol whose inscriptions appear exactly when needed. The carnival's departure functions as atmospheric framing but never intersects causally with Maya's project. "Functionally creative" and "stoic wonder" are told traits rather than lived contradictions. The final image ("charted a course toward the future") echoes countless uplift endings without a specific, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She decides to stay, explore, pocket the sextant, and restore power in a linear sequence without meaningful friction or trade-offs. Her actions are descriptive (wandering, kneeling, working) rather than decision-driven under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure but replaceable with any curious explorer archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sextant piece is discovered early, pocketed, felt as "heavier" mid-story, then examined again at the end when inscriptions are revealed. It appears in three beats but functions ornamentally—its discovery does not alter Maya's plan, and the inscriptions conveniently provide "coordinates and equations" without prior setup. The object is thematically charged ("tool for navigation") but does not constrain choices or shape tactics. Closure participation is descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is invoked three times as a thematic label: travelers' mixed motives, the terminal's legacy, and Maya's discovery path. It does not shape on-page stakes or alter Maya's tactics—she navigates the terminal's corridors and systems without confusion or decision branching. The concept functions as atmospheric metaphor rather than a constraint that forces choices. Present in setup and closure but only as echo.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is stated twice but never demonstrated through on-page problem-solving that involves visible trade-offs. Maya "began mapping possibilities, connecting dots" and "rerouting connections"—all told summary without showing the creative process or its costs. The trait could be removed or swapped for "determined" or "resourceful" without structural impact. Label-only mention without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Resurrect" appears in multiple forms: Maya's goal to "resurrect what had been left behind," she works to "bring at least a small part of the terminal back to life," and "she had managed to resurrect a piece of the past." The action is central to the plot and present in setup, middle, and closure. However, the resurrection succeeds without complication—no failed systems, no cost in time or safety, no choice between partial and full restoration. The action drives the sequence but lacks the friction or trade-off that would make it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is stated as Maya's method and repeated at closure ("Through redirected flows and resurrected systems"). The mechanics are summarized ("rerouting connections and bypassing corroded circuits") without on-page detail that would show how redirection matters versus any repair method. The method is mentioned in setup and closure but does not shape visible problem-solving beats or constrain her approach. Functional but replaceable with "repairs" or "rewiring."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is present throughout, anchoring Maya's exploration from corridors to ticket counter to power center to main concourse. It supplies resources (console, transformers, circuits) and the lights' return charges the final image. However, the terminal never pressures Maya's choices—she moves freely, finds what she needs without locked doors or missing parts, and succeeds on her first attempt. The setting is essential to atmosphere and closure participation but does not constrain tactics. Three gates met; causal pressure weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"After the carnival left town" anchors the opening but functions only as static past-tense context. No urgency tied to the carnival's departure, no deadline, no ticking clock that alters Maya's decisions. Hours pass during her work but without tracked consequence. The timeframe could be "after the war" or "after the evacuation" with identical story logic. Present in setup; absent from middle pressure and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Maya's desire "to puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated early and echoed at closure ("she had found her equation for hope"). The motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no scene shows Maya wrestling with despair or choosing hope over safety. Her work proceeds smoothly without friction between the abstract goal and concrete costs. The motivation frames the story but does not force on-page choices with visible trade-offs. Setup and closure present; middle development is summary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is introduced as "her expression one of stoic determination despite the wonder she felt" and returns as "stoic wonder as the terminal gradually came back to life" and "smiled slightly, her expression still composed but her eyes alight." The tone is consistent across setup and closure and modulates slightly (absolute focus → slight smile). However, it is told rather than embodied—no contradictory sensory details or perceptual shifts that show wonder constrained by stoicism. The tone labels the mood without charging the final image through distinct voice or rhythm.</comment>
