<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Leo remains more curator than character; his "discerning" trait is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. Motivation arrives late ("decided to prove that listening heals") and lacks embodied cost—he never sacrifices comfort, time, or safety. The community members are sketched in label-only strokes (Mrs. Garcia arranging flowers, Marcus skateboarding) without distinct interior friction. The final "smile" is a stock closure gesture that asserts satisfaction without dramatizing what Leo relinquished to earn it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative lens early (courtyard gatherings, fragments of story) but the closure lands as summarized satisfaction ("healing began") rather than a decisive on-page shift. Cost is gestural: Leo "fulfilled his purpose" by reconnecting the community, yet no visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears in the final beat. The mailbox discovery (letters to neighbors) functions as a reveal but does not narrow options or charge the image with felt price. The Orientation Test is satisfied by ~100 words; no penalty applied there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is named repeatedly but functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Leo could gather these stories anywhere. "Vibrant" and "gold" paint atmosphere yet no spatial detail (bench proximity, fountain acoustics, garden layout) shapes a choice. The locket and mailbox are handled in minimal tactile language; their physical presence does not alter tactics. The "defunct post office" appears only at resolution, too late to pressure earlier moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (solve the locket mystery) is clear by paragraph three, but escalation is iterative rather than tightening: Leo hears more fragments in the same courtyard setting without rising cost or narrowing options. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; the key arrives conveniently from Mrs. Henderson in paragraph 18. The final discovery (letters, not jewels) reweights thematic meaning but does not foreclose a live path for Leo—he retains all options and pays no visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (listening heals, community memory as resistance) is stated overtly multiple times ("Leo decided to prove that listening heals," "Through neighborhood storytelling, healing began") rather than emerging from image and action. The locket and letters function as symbols but their recurrence feels assembled to serve the thesis. The final paragraph moralizes ("Leo smiled, knowing he had fulfilled his purpose") instead of trusting image to carry resonance. "Sandstorm calm" as phrase recurs without accruing new meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited on Leo with no head-hopping. Diction remains serviceable but generic ("expert eye," "subtle thread of curiosity," "fragments of Eliza's story") without Leo-specific perceptual signature. Dialogue carries minimal subtext; Mrs. Garcia and Marcus deliver exposition cleanly without goal-driven evasion. The closing smile and summary thought ("knowing he had fulfilled his purpose") flatten the ending into thesis rather than dramatized stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "Through neighborhood storytelling" appears three times, "aged locket" twice, "vibrant courtyard at dawn" twice, each in identical syntactic slots. Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraphs 11–12 ("Leo began to hear more… Every day at dawn brought new revelations"). Stock metaphors ("thread of curiosity," "rising sun," "morning light painted") and therapy-speak ("listening heals") appear in peak beats without embodiment. The final paragraph stacks summary assertions rather than propelling image. Artifacts touch the closure beat; baseline −1.2 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise (antique dealer solves locked-locket mystery via community stories) is workable but unrefreshed; the mailbox-full-of-letters payoff is a familiar heartwarming template. Leo's discovery method (asking neighbors in a courtyard) lacks friction or ingenuity. The transformation test fails: swap names and the courtyard for a café, and the arc holds unchanged. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material; the piece hedges toward median safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Leo curates the shop and displays the locket (setup), asks neighbors (middle), and arranges letters in the window (ending). His "discerning" trait is label-only; no on-page choice demonstrates curatorial judgment under pressure. He decides to "prove that listening heals" but this motivation arrives late and does not constrain tactics—he continues the same passive inquiry. Present across all three gates but swappable for any curious shopkeeper; causal pressure minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The locket is introduced early (paragraph 2), displayed at the counter (paragraph 5), and arranged beside letters in the shop window (paragraph 24). It is handled but not opened on-page until Mrs. Henderson provides the key. The locked state matters as a setup device, yet the locket itself does not narrow Leo's choices mid-scene—its symbolic role (connecting community) could transfer to any keepsake. Present in setup and closure; functional but replaceable without break.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Locked mailbox mystery" is named in paragraph 5 and resolved in paragraph 20 when Leo opens the defunct post-office box. The mailbox itself appears only at resolution; the mystery's pressure is carried by the locket and verbal clues. The concept frames stakes but does not alter Leo's tactics—he asks neighbors regardless. Present in setup (as phrase) and payoff, absent from middle development; caps at ~4.6 for late-element resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is implied thematically (Leo listens, gathers fragments) but never constrains a choice with visible cost. He does not resist leading or pay a price for passivity; the story rewards his patient listening without friction. The attribute is ornamental—a thematic label without on-page trade-off. Present as summary claim, not dramatized causally.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Hear" drives the middle: Leo hears Mr. Henderson's pointer (paragraph 7), Mrs. Garcia's account (paragraph 12), Marcus's detail (paragraph 13), and Mrs. Henderson's final reveal (paragraph 19). The verb is foregrounded and Leo's listening accumulates knowledge that unlocks the mailbox. However, the action is passive receipt rather than active pursuit, and any information-gathering verb (ask, learn, discover) could substitute with minor edits. Present across beats and integral to resolution; causal role moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Through neighborhood storytelling" is named three times (paragraphs 13, 16, 26) and the method—residents sharing fragments in the courtyard—is demonstrated across paragraphs 7–19. The mechanic (oral history, communal memory) shapes Leo's approach and the thematic close ("Through neighborhood storytelling, healing began"). However, the courtyard conversations are iterative rather than escalating; the method does not alter tactics under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure; meaningful but not indispensable—any communal inquiry format would serve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is named in paragraphs 8, 16, 23, and appears as the locus of neighbor encounters. Morning light and communal routine are described but do not constrain Leo's choices—conversations could occur anywhere. The setting serves atmospheric cohesion rather than tactical pressure. Present across structure but ornamental; no micro-setting details (bench distance, garden access) alter moves. Caps at ~4.6 for absent middle development of spatial constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" appears twice (paragraphs 11, 20) as summary claim—demolition notices threaten the district—but this external pressure does not tighten Leo's timeline or force a trade-off. The mailbox mystery proceeds at Leo's leisure with no clock. The timeframe is thematic backdrop rather than tactical constraint. Present as motif, absent from escalation; caps at ~3.4 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Leo's motivation "to prove that listening heals" is declared in paragraph 16, past the midpoint, then restated in paragraph 27. The desire is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants or costs. Leo never risks reputation, time, or comfort to pursue the mystery; his inquiry is friction-free. The motivation frames theme but does not shape on-page choices under pressure. Late signal (−0.4), label-only (−0.3), caps at ~4.6 for introduced-after-40%-mark.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" is named once (paragraph 11) and implied in repeated phrases ("quiet morning," courtyard as "sanctuary"). The tone is stable gentle curiosity without modulation—no shift in rhythm or diction at peak beats. The phrase does not recharge at closure; the ending maintains the same placid register. Present as label, functional for atmosphere, but static and swappable for any "peaceful resolve" phrasing. Caps at ~4.6 for absent closure participation as active reconfiguration.</comment>
