<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (recurring dreams) is established, but her interior contradictions remain abstract. The nursemaid's sudden appearance and shared ritual feel convenient rather than rooted in dramatized relationship pressure. The queen's transformation is declared ("disenchantment transforming into purpose") rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final smile at counselors reads as summary rather than a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (dream → grotto → reflection → return). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the third paragraph. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (renewed purpose, Earned Stasis of continued duty with secret wellspring), but the cost is asserted ("weight lifted") rather than felt on the page. The bleeding starlight pool reveals younger self, yet no on-page choice forecloses a path or alters tactics—revelation alone without dramatized consequence weakens the closure effect.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight provide vivid visuals, and the ridge climb offers spatial challenge. However, the grotto interior remains postcard-descriptive ("lacy menace," "otherworldly radiance") without constraining a specific choice. The final image of fireflies recurs with thematic weight but does not charge a tactical decision. Micro-setting allowance met, yet no environmental detail pressures the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rediscovering purpose) is signaled early. The ascent provides physical escalation, but no meaningful reversal narrows options—Elara finds the grotto as foreseen, sees her reflection, gains understanding without friction. Maera's explanation ("every queen must rediscover") feels expository rather than earned through protagonist agency. No visible trade-off or forfeited path; the queen returns unchanged in external action, only internally reassured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of true self versus royal burden emerges through the grotto mirror and bleeding starlight motif. The final image of the queen's smile offers resonance, yet the thematic answer remains close to the prompt's explicit setup ("lacy menace...not a threat...but a promise"). Maera's line about being chosen edges into direct statement. The bleeding starlight functions more as symbol than as a particular that generates fresh insight—recurrence without sufficient reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("visceral visions," "softly commanding presence"), though some phrases ("ancient knowing," "supernatural clarity") drift toward stock fantasy register. Maera and Elara's dialogue carries purpose but limited subtext—exposition dominates ("The grotto shows your true self"). Perceptual signature is generic courtly rather than character-specific; narrative distance modulates appropriately but voice lacks idiosyncrasy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs: "disenchanted monarch...seeking meaning," "not the kind...but a deeper connection," "not been a threat...but a promise." Figurative language clusters without pattern payoff ("lacy menace," "bleeding starlight," "liquid sapphire"). Filter-verb stack in reflection pool paragraph ("felt drawn," "seemed almost alive"). Sentence openings vary, but information density is low—many lines restate rather than advance. Mid-band ceiling due to loop/scaffold presence and figurative muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise (disenchanted royal seeks mystical renewal) follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The grotto revelation (younger self, true purpose) resolves predictably. Maera's arrival and the firefly ritual add texture but do not alter the arc's trajectory. Emotional beats (weariness → discovery → renewed purpose) proceed without surprise or earned contradiction. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 for template adherence without fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choice to climb drives the journey, but her decisions do not create reversals—she follows the dream path as foreseen and returns unchanged in action. Observation and summary dominate; no on-page moment where competing impulses force a trade-off. Setup present, development is motion not choice, payoff is asserted understanding. Swappable with any disenchanted seeker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ember grotto appears in title position (implied early signal), is the physical destination at midpoint, and houses the bleeding starlight revelation. Used across three beats (base, ascent arrival, interior chamber), but interaction is primarily observational. The grotto entrance catches embers at descent, recharging the motif with visual resonance. Does not constrain a specific choice beyond motivating the climb. Essential to geography and closure image, yet mechanics remain decorative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is the chamber's core visual, coalesces around Elara's feet with patterned illumination, and remains "her secret...wellspring of strength" in closure. Shapes the revelation beat but does not alter tactics—no choice hinges on its properties. Present at closure as thematic anchor with conceptual weight, yet the cost is declared rather than felt. Two-gate participation (development, payoff) with lyric reprise, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Softly commanding presence" appears twice as label (dismissing guards, final smile) without dramatized trade-off. Does not constrain or enable a visible action with cost—Elara's authority functions as backdrop. Ornamental attribute; swappable with "quiet authority" or similar. Setup-only, no development or closure linkage to specific choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The climb is the story's physical spine: opens conflict, consumes the ascent paragraph with embodied difficulty ("brutal," "razor-sharp rocks"), delivers Elara to the grotto, and bookends with descent. Two beats (ascent, descent) with causal necessity—no grotto without climb. Yet the action itself does not redefine options; it is transit that executes the dream's directive rather than a choice under competing pressure. Essential structure, mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Shared exhale spotting fireflies appears at the ridge base as ritual and recurs in the final paragraph as memory anchor. Early signal present, closure reprise clear, but no middle development—does not shape any attempt or choice during the grotto sequence. Lyric bookend that reweights the relationship motif with modest resonance, yet remains ornamental to the central climb/revelation arc. Two-gate lyric use, functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto above clouds provides vivid destination and houses the chamber. Spatial particulars (cloud line, entrance, vast chamber, pool) are described but do not pressure a choice—Elara walks in and receives revelation. The setting stages the event without altering tactics. Present across setup, development (interior), and payoff (embers at exit), meeting three gates, yet interaction remains postcard. Functional necessity without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the final warning" frames urgency in the opening, the dream "tonight" triggers departure, and "before sunrise" sets the climb window. Dawn marks grotto arrival. Time anchors the sequence but does not tighten decisions—no live countdown forces a trade-off. The timeframe structures pacing without generating pressure. Setup present, weak development, payoff absent from closure. Functional chronology, low integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Recurring dreams are Elara's stated motive throughout: "haunted her sleep," drive the climb, and the grotto "made sense" as their source. Desire is consistent but not conflicted on the page—no competing want challenges the pursuit. The revelation satisfies without cost or friction. Three-gate presence (setup, drives climb, closure explanation) with causal role, yet lacks dramatized internal opposition. Functional drive, mid-integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" appears once mid-story describing the cave shadows and is explicitly resolved in the final line ("not a threat...but a promise"). Tone shifts from weariness to awe to reassurance without modulating under pressure—static elevations rather than dynamic charge. Does not constrain the protagonist's approach or color the final image with embodied dread. Two-gate lyric reprise (mid, closure explanation) but swappable mood; lacks coherent pressure.</comment>
