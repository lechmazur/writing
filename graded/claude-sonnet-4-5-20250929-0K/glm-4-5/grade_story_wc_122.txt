<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The journey from numbness to teaching again is summarized across many beats rather than dramatized in pressured micro-choices. Interiority relies on generic phrases like "wrapped around her heart like winter's chill" and "tears to her eyes" without character-particular texture. The final turn—teaching again—arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed; she simply discovers a method and shares it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt accumulates: who Eleanor is, where the cavern is, and when this occurs remain vague past 120 words. The closure—Eleanor teaching via vibrations—is told in summary ("had found a way to teach again") rather than shown in a decisive on-page moment with felt cost. The piece reads as accumulative/textural in intent, but the final image ("continued to spin") offers no reweighting or crystallization of prior pressure. Applied −0.4 for orientation debt; closure lacks on-page cost proof.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cavern and phonograph appear early and recur, but remain postcard-level: "shadowed alcove," "stone walls," "audibly muted." The broken needle and turntable do constrain Eleanor's method (backward play), satisfying micro-setting criteria at minimum. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the environment does not pressure a key choice or charge the final image beyond serving as backdrop, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early but never faces an on-page test or trade-off. Eleanor experiments, discovers vibrations, and teaches; no reversal or complication narrows her options. The drum maker's initial skepticism evaporates without friction. Escalation is replaced by a montage of successful experiments across "each day" and "one evening," with no visible price or tactic shift. One meaningful tightening is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of rediscovering expression through disability emerges from events, but the final paragraph states it overtly: "found her voice again, not in sound, but in the profound language of vibration and hush." Prompt-label phrases like "filament of hush" and "mirrored hush" recur as abstract markers rather than earned particulars. The ending summarizes the theme ("symphony of silence that only the heart could truly apprehend") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated literary register ("filament of hush," "tangible absence," "mirrored hush") that does not feel character-particular for a music teacher in grief. Perceptual signature is generic: "tears to her eyes," "warmth in the vibrations." No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the voice lacks the textural specificity and rhythmic control under pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "audibly muted except for the occasional scrape" / "cavern, typically audibly muted except for the occasional drum test." Template cadence dominates with "Eleanor [verb]" stems and synonym churn ("filament of hush" appears five times, "backward recorded songs" four times). Stock metaphors ("wrapped around her heart like winter's chill") and scaffolding phrases ("something extraordinary happened," "not only been accomplished but had transformed") flatten momentum. Applied −1.2 for pervasive artifact spread.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—deaf teacher rediscovers music through vibration—is a recognizable disability-triumph template. Transformation is minimal: the phonograph-as-teaching-tool and backward-play gimmick feel ornamental rather than inevitable. The drum maker and students serve convenience roles without friction. The piece does not take bold risks or offer a non-obvious moral calculus; the arc resolves into a tidy, inspirational summary without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Eleanor is present throughout and her status as deaf music teacher frames the premise. However, her deafness functions as setup rather than constraining on-page choices. She traces a drum (beat 1), picks up a needle (beat 2), experiments (beats 3–N), and teaches (final beat)—observation and discovery rather than decision under pressure. No key turn traces to a choice she makes; the phonograph method arrives as discovery, not agency. Present in closure (teaching), but passively. Early signal +0.5, closure presence +0.5, but low causal pressure and swappability (any disabled artist could fill the role) cap the score. Applied −0.5 for late causal work, −0.3 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken phonograph needle appears in beat 2 ("discovered a broken phonograph needle"), is used in beat 3 ("placed one on the turntable, securing it with the damaged needle"), recurs in the middle ("broken phonograph needle...became her tool"), and returns in the final image ("With the broken phonograph needle in hand"). Its damage is mentioned but does not constrain function or create a visible trade-off. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +0.9, closure presence +0.7, but no specific cost or irreplaceability (any needle could play records backward). Applied −0.4 for swappability, −0.2 for ornamental final mention.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Filament of hush" appears as a recurring label ("A filament of hush emerged," "create a filament of hush so powerful," "The filament of hush had become her companion") but never shapes stakes or alters tactics on the page. It functions as thematic echo rather than a constraint or resource. No setup gate (first appears mid-story), no middle development gate (decorative mentions only), no closure gate (absent from final image). Applied −0.8 for label-only use, −0.5 for late arrival, −0.3 for ornamental repetition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" describes the cavern twice ("audibly muted except for the occasional scrape," "typically audibly muted except for the occasional drum test") as atmosphere, not a trait that constrains action. It does not enable or disable a choice with cost; it is setting description. No setup in protagonist action, no middle choice constrained, no closure role. Applied −0.8 for label-only mention, −0.4 for setting-descriptor use rather than character trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears twice: "her tool to enthrall both herself and the curious drum maker" (middle) and "vibrations that enthrall even those who could hear" (near end). The action describes effect rather than driving a turn. Eleanor's demonstrations enthrall the students, but this outcome is told, not shown in a choice that alters tactics. Setup absent (first mention mid-story), middle mention is summary, closure presence weak (students watch in awe). Early presence −0.4, one-beat involvement +0.4, closure adjacency +0.3, but swappability high (impress, captivate, move could replace). Applied −0.5 for swappability, −0.3 for summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are discovered in beat 3 ("spun the record backward, something extraordinary happened"), used repeatedly in the middle ("experiment with different records played in reverse," "playing certain recordings backward"), and present in the final image ("placed a new record on the turntable and spun it backward"). The method enables Eleanor's vibration-teaching but the mechanics are told ("created rhythms in the air that she could feel but not hear") rather than shown constraining a choice. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but no visible cost or irreplaceability. Applied −0.3 for summary mechanics, −0.2 for swappability (forward songs with bass could serve).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is established early ("she sought solace in the drum maker's cavern") and recurs throughout. It supplies the phonograph and provides vibration-friendly stone floors, shaping Eleanor's method. However, it does not pressure a choice or create a constraint with cost; it is a resource-rich setting without friction. Setup +0.6, middle presence (setting for experiments) +0.4, closure presence +0.5, but no causal pressure or irreplaceability. Applied −0.4 for passive resource role, −0.3 for swappability (any resonant space could serve).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"During the faint rustle of turning seasons" appears in the opening and once mid-story ("faint rustle of turning seasons continued outside as autumn gave way to winter"). Time is ornamental; it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. No clock pressures Eleanor's experiments or teaching. Setup gate minimal (vague season mention), no middle development gate (time does not constrain), no closure gate (snow falls "silently" as decoration). Applied −0.7 for ornamental use, −0.5 for no tactic constraint, −0.3 for vague tracking.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To defeat emotional numbness" is stated in paragraph 5 ("her motivation was simple yet desperate: to defeat the emotional numbness") and echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("Her motivation to defeat emotional numbness had not only been accomplished"). The desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. Eleanor never faces a moment where defeating numbness costs her something else; the experiments succeed and she teaches. Setup +0.5 (stated early), middle mention (summary only), closure mention (told resolution). Applied −0.6 for told-only treatment, −0.4 for no friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears twice: as descriptor ("tone of her existence was shifting...to something resembling a mirrored hush") and in the final paragraph ("The mirrored hush of the cavern reflected the peace Eleanor had finally found"). Tone is asserted via label rather than modulated through scene texture and rhythm. The piece maintains a single static literary register throughout; no cadence shift under pressure. Setup absent (first mention mid-story), no middle modulation, closure presence via label only. Applied −0.6 for label-only tone claim, −0.4 for static mood, −0.2 for late arrival.</comment>
