<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Ellara's motivations are declared but her interior life reads generic across beats—"desperate conviction," "trembled as new knowledge flooded"—with no character-particular contradiction. The grandfather connection arrives via retrocognitive download rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Her transformation is asserted ("profound light and shadow") rather than earned through on-page micro-decisions that foreclose paths. The final act of publishing exists in summary, distant from the window where we could witness her weighing cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous: the story toggles between causal (diary triggers visions), accumulative (lagoon as recurring motif), and situational (protagonist receiving knowledge passively). Orientation arrives piecemeal—zeppelin library, coastal dunes, obsidian lagoon—but no clear spatial anchor for the opening beat until paragraph eight. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing ("published the unvarnished history") but occurs entirely off-page in summary, with no felt cost visible in the final image. The ending paragraph asserts transformation rather than demonstrating a before/after with stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are vivid as images but function as postcard backdrops. Beach debris arrangement is described but doesn't constrain Ellara's choices—materials appear without scarcity or tool difficulty. The lagoon "accepts and transforms her offering" via unexplained magic rather than physical interaction that tests her agency. Spatial choreography is vague: does she kneel on the beach while the zeppelin hovers, or has it landed? The setting's charged potential never materializes as tactical constraint or resource.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"uncover truth in tension"—is declared but never tested by a competing pressure or cost that forces a trade-off. Ellara's retrocognitive trapping resolves itself; the lagoon dialogue succeeds without complication. The grandfather subplot appears and resolves off-page without altering her present options. No on-page reversal or tightening: the diary opens, visions come, messages work, publication follows. The escalation is a montage of elapsed weeks rather than a single beat where agency narrows options with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—healing historical wounds through connection—is announced in the grandfather's final words ("The past never leaves us, it waits until we're ready to bear its truth") rather than arising from specific choices. The obsidian lagoon and beach debris could serve as charged motifs but remain ornamental; their recurrence doesn't reweight prior material with cost. The ending's "published the unvarnished history" is a theme statement, not a resonant image that complicates the premise. Subtext is minimal; every thematic question is answered explicitly in interiority or dialogue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds consistently but the perceptual signature is generic—"haunted by what wasn't written," "desperate conviction"—without character-specific idiom. Diction drifts into elevated register during reflection ("chromatic memories," "resurrected heart") that doesn't match an archivist under duress. No dialogue on the page to test voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean but the internal texture flattens under emotional intensity rather than sharpening. The prose reads as neutral omniscient commentary on Ellara rather than filtered through her particular way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template-cadence runs pervade: "Dr. Ellara Vance traced…," "After the letters were found…," "To uncover truth…," "Opening the seventh volume…," "Now retrocognitively trapped…," "The searing reverie…," "On the zeppelin's viewing deck…" (seven consecutive paragraph openers follow noun-phrase + predicate without variation, triggering −0.6). Paraphrase loops cluster: paragraphs two/three both establish "the archive drifted" / "the zeppelin sailed"; paragraphs nine/ten repeat "her blood called" / "passions and pains." Stock metaphors: "floating library," "truth in tension," "searing reverie." Figurative density in non-peak beats: "chromatic memories," "resurrected heart," "profound light and shadow." Combined artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is low; many sentences restate setup without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core premise—encrypted diary unlocks temporal visions—follows template urban-fantasy structure without transformation. Retrocognition, floating archives, and temporal lagoons are familiar elements assembled without a fresh synthesis. The beach-debris parley is a single inventive detail but arrives late and resolves without complication. The grandfather connection and civil-rights backstory are earnest but generic; no specific historical detail grounds the 1963 protest. The ending's publication arc could occur in any archival discovery story with minor edits (swappability test). No bold risk-taking; the piece opts for median fantasy-realism conventions throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Ellara is on the page throughout but her choices are passive: she "traced," "spotted," "pored over," "gathered," "arranged." The publication decision occurs off-page in summary. She reacts to diary visions rather than forcing turns. Present in setup and ending but does not drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in paragraph two (early signal), is reached in paragraph eighteen, accepts her message in paragraph twenty, and frames the final reflection in paragraph twenty-four. Four distinct beats. However, its mechanics are unexplained—it "accepts and transforms" via magic rather than physical constraint. It shapes the ending image but does not narrow options or impose cost. Swappable with any mystical reflecting pool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Encrypted diary discovery triggers the inciting incident (paragraph three: "After the letters were found last Tuesday") and is present in the climax (paragraph seven: "Opening the seventh volume"). The encryption reappears as "a bridge between generations" in paragraph twenty-two and is resolved in paragraph twenty-five ("new text where once was code"). Three beats, but the mechanics are told rather than shown—symbols "rearrange themselves" without Ellara's agency. It enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trapping is named in paragraph six and recurs in paragraphs nine and eleven ("visceral moments from the past without warning"). Paragraph twenty-one asserts "Retrocognition cannot be fought but acknowledged," but this is theme claim, not on-page cost. The visions provide knowledge without visible trade-off; no scene where a vision interrupts a high-stakes choice. Present in three beats but ornamental—label-only mentions without constraining action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Parley is signaled in paragraph twelve ("decided to parley with the past") and enacted in paragraphs sixteen–twenty (beach debris arrangement, lagoon response). Two beats. The act shapes the ending's knowledge reveal but the mechanics are unexplained and the success is immediate, without complication. Replaceable with any communication ritual. No visible cost tied to the parley itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris is signaled in paragraph twelve, prepared in paragraph sixteen, and executed in paragraphs eighteen–nineteen. Three touches across beats. The method is specific (driftwood, shells, volcanic glass spelling questions) but its mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized—no scene showing her choosing between word structures or testing message legibility. The lagoon responds instantly without showing whether her arrangement mattered. Causal role in one beat but swappable with any symbolic offering.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The floating library on a zeppelin is introduced in paragraph one, recurs as spatial anchor in paragraphs three, eleven, fourteen, and twenty-five. Five mentions but all are postcard descriptions—"polished oak floors," "viewing deck," "floating library became her home"—without constraining choice or supplying resources. The captain's skepticism (paragraph fourteen) is told, not dramatized. The setting does not pressure tactics; Ellara could conduct the same arc in a ground-based archive. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the letters are found last Tuesday" anchors paragraph three. Paragraph eleven notes "Seventy-two hours after mysteriously acquiring the diaries." The ending mentions "weeks that followed." The timeframe is vague and does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no deadline she races. The Tuesday reference is not developed; we never learn what day the ending occurs or how urgency shaped her choices. Present as label but does not function as constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The desire "to uncover truth in tension" is declared in paragraph four, reiterated in paragraphs nine ("truth in tension into the air") and twenty-one, and asserted as resolved in paragraph thirty ("published the unvarnished history"). Motivation is present across setup, middle, and ending but is told rather than dramatized—no scene where she weighs the cost of revelation against another desire. The want never conflicts with fear or competing need on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone is signaled in paragraph seven ("searing reverie of teargas… bitter taste of injustice") and recurs in paragraph twenty-nine ("searing reverie of human complexity"). The elevated diction ("chromatic memories," "resurrected heart") attempts reverie but reads distant and abstract. Tone does not modulate with pressure—peaks and reflections share the same wistful register. Present in setup and ending reprise but static; does not charge the final image with fresh intensity.</comment>
