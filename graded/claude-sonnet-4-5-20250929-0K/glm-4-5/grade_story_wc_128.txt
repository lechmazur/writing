<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is characterized primarily through labeled traits ("shrewd," "whimsically attentive") and summary ("his colleagues often joked"), rather than dramatized choices under pressure. The mentor's locket recurs but functions as exposition vehicle more than a constraining force on present decisions. Interior life remains thin; his "familiar stirring" and business calculations are told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final cycle with the young archivist is recounted in summary ("he would initiate the friendship as before"), eliminating agency at the moment that should prove character change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing via "cycles of compassion," but closure arrives as narrator summary ("thus the cycle continued") rather than a dramatized image with visible cost. The misdelivered envelope setup is paid off once with Eleanor, then the "years later" paragraph telescopes a second cycle into exposition without dramatizing the mechanics or stakes. Orientation is delayed—who Elias is addressing and where Eleanor is positioned remain vague until after their exchange begins. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) wobbles between business calculus and theme assertion, never fully crystallizing a pattern through repeated on-page beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "breezy library under stars" anchor is vivid and recurs at closure, charging the final image with a sense of return. Spatial details—roof panels retracted, upper pavilion, seaside café—ground key moments without excess. However, the library's interior mechanics (how archives constrain Eleanor's daily choices, how funding cuts manifested physically) remain abstract, limiting micro-setting pressure. The body and tool layer is thin; papers "tousled by breeze" appears once without evolving into tactical use.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early but remains largely motivational rather than conflict-driven. Elias's offer to help Eleanor's archive faces no on-page resistance, complication, or cost; "within months" the project succeeds via summary. The "next week" café scene gestures toward a turn but delivers exposition rather than a choice that narrows options. The final paragraph's "years later" recursion asserts cycle continuation without dramatizing a second decision under new pressure, flattening escalation into theme claim.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Cycles of compassion" is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("thus the cycle continued") rather than emerging through image and action. The locket's three photos function as symbolic inventory, not a charged contradiction. The line "the greatest cargo transported wasn't in containers but in the recognition of shared humanity" exemplifies explicit theme-statement rather than earned resonance. Some particulars work—chipped cups, Eleanor's document-stained fingers—but the ending resolves into overt moralizing ("a never-ending cycle of carefully calculated, exuberant compassion") that flattens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with Elias is generally stable, though several passages slip into distant summary ("his cargo broker mind already calculating") that tells rather than enacts his process. Dialogue is functional but uniform in register; Eleanor and Elias speak with similar cadence and vocabulary despite different backgrounds. The phrase "whimsically attentive nature" recurs as label rather than manifesting through perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he found himself") appear frequently in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. Voice remains competent but lacks the textural specificity that would distinguish Elias's way of noticing under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "his whimsically attentive nature" is restated across three paragraphs without added detail. Template cadence runs through several beats ("Elias felt… Elias listened… Elias placed…"). The final two paragraphs stack summary sentences with identical stems ("For in the end… And his locket… Thus the cycle…"), each restating the compassion-cycle thesis. Stock constructions appear: "the one that always came when," "something he rarely did," "as before." Figurative language in the closing ("his own composition of human connection") elevates register without concrete grounding. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, stock phrasing −0.3; artifacts touch closure image, total −1.2 baseline, escalated to −1.5 for closure contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—broker notices undervalued archivists and uplifts them—follows a familiar altruism template without a fresh moral calculus or complicating cost. The misdelivered-envelope mechanism is a standard meet-cute device. Elias's locket and mentor backstory function as exposition rather than transforming the present conflict. The "years later" recursion gestures toward pattern but arrives via summary, not a second dramatized instance that would earn the cyclical structure. Emotional specificity (chipped cups, document-stained fingers) provides texture but does not reweight the core dynamic. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece settles into a tidy thesis rather than inhabiting ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his broker expertise is mentioned repeatedly, but his shrewdness manifests primarily in summary ("calculating which shipping companies might sponsor") rather than on-page negotiation or tactical choice. The "cargo broker by day" introduction signals the role early, and the final metaphor ("the greatest cargo transported") links it to theme, satisfying setup and payoff gates. However, no middle beat dramatizes a broker-specific decision under pressure; his professional skill enables the archive funding off-page. Swappable with "philanthropist" or "consultant" with minor edits. Positives: early signal +0.4, closure thematic link +0.5. Frictions: middle development absent −0.6, summary-only use −0.5, swappability −0.6. Band guidance suggests ≤4.6 for missing middle gate; net 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locket appears in three beats: Elias opens it before entering the library, shows it to Eleanor at their first meeting, and places a new locket in her hands at project completion. Setup and development gates are met. The photo inside shifts from mentor alone to three photos (mentor, Eleanor, empty space), reweighting its meaning from personal talisman to symbol of connection cycle. However, the locket does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it functions as exposition vehicle and thematic marker rather than plot lever. Positives: early signal +0.4, three beats +1.4, closure participation (new locket) +0.8, evolving meaning +0.5. Frictions: ornamental (no choice pressure) −0.8, swappability (another keepsake would serve) −0.5. Net ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Cycles of compassion" is named explicitly in the final paragraphs and shapes Elias's stated motivation throughout, satisfying setup and thematic payoff. The piece attempts to dramatize one cycle (Elias helps Eleanor, Eleanor later helps Elias's clients) and assert a second ("years later… he would initiate the friendship as before"), but the second cycle remains summary. The concept does not constrain an on-page choice or create a tactical dilemma; it functions as thematic claim rather than story engine. Positives: early signal +0.4, closure thematic statement +0.5. Frictions: no middle choice pressure −0.8, told rather than shown in recursion −0.6, swappability (one-time kindness would work) −0.6. Band guidance: present but largely ornamental; net 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Whimsically attentive" is labeled three times ("his colleagues often joked," "his whimsically attentive nature noting," "whimsically attentive exchanges") but never dramatized through a scene-specific perception or micro-choice. The trait is told as his habit of remembering clients' details, yet no on-page beat shows him recalling a forgotten fact under pressure or making a decision that his attentiveness enables. Setup gate met (labeled early); middle and payoff gates absent (no choice constrained by the trait). Positives: early label +0.3. Frictions: label-only −0.7, no demonstrated cost −0.5, swappability (generic "observant" works) −0.6. Net 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears as Elias's action in three moments: approaching Eleanor with the envelope, offering coffee, and the asserted future recursion. Setup and payoff gates are met. The first initiation (approaching with the envelope) launches the central relationship, and the coffee invitation advances it, giving the action causal weight in two beats. However, the final "years later" initiation is recounted in summary rather than dramatized, and the action itself is replaceable—Eleanor could have approached him, or a third party could introduce them. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure link (asserted recursion) +0.4. Frictions: final instance summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.5. Net ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The mistaken-address envelope is the inciting mechanism, clearly signaled in paragraph three and paid off when Elias delivers it to Eleanor. Setup, development (it brings them together), and payoff (theme of mistake-become-opportunity) gates are met. The piece names the method again at closure ("all because of an envelope with a mistaken address"), and the "years later" paragraph gestures toward a second such mistake. However, the mechanics of the misdelivery are not explored—why it happened, whether it recurs literally or metaphorically—and the method does not constrain Elias's tactics or present a dilemma. Positives: early signal +0.6, two beats (delivery, thematic callback) +0.9, closure participation +0.6. Frictions: mechanics vague −0.4, second instance summary −0.5, ornamental (one meeting suffices) −0.5. Net 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "breezy library under stars" is introduced early ("roof panels had been retracted to reveal a canopy of stars") and returns in the final image ("the library under stars") and locket photo, satisfying setup and payoff. The breeze tousles papers once, hinting at micro-setting pressure, but no choice or tactic is shaped by the physical space—Elias could deliver the envelope anywhere. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint or resource. Positives: early vivid anchor +0.6, closure reprise +0.7. Frictions: no middle choice pressure −0.7, ornamental (postcard description) −0.7, swappability (any quiet space works) −0.5. Band guidance: present in setup and payoff but no development gate; net 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the symphony ends" anchors the opening moment and provides a sense of evening transition, meeting the setup gate. However, time thereafter is vague and untracked: "the next week," "within months," "years later" compress elapsed duration without tightening decisions. No scene operates under a live clock; Elias's choices are not pressured by deadline or urgency tied to the post-concert timeframe. The symphony reference does not return or reweight at closure. Positives: early signal +0.4. Frictions: no middle time pressure −0.8, closure absent −0.8, vague progression −0.5, swappability (any evening works) −0.6. Net 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To uplift silent contributors" is stated overtly as Elias's motivation and drives his approach to Eleanor and his funding offer. Setup, development (offer to help archive), and payoff (theme assertion "his motivation unchanged") gates are met. The desire is consistent but not conflicted—no on-page moment shows Elias torn between self-interest and altruism, or a cost he must pay to act on this drive. The motivation enables plot but does not create friction or trade-off. Positives: early signal +0.5, two beats (approach, funding) +0.9, closure statement +0.5. Frictions: told more than shown −0.6, no visible cost or conflict −0.7, swappability (generic kindness works) −0.5. Net ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is labeled once ("his cautious exuberance tempered by respect") and the phrase "tentative smile" hints at it, but the tone does not modulate across beats or charge the final image. Elias's voice remains steady and warm throughout; no scene shows exuberance checked by caution in a way that alters his tactic or creates tension. The tone is coherent but static, neither deepening under pressure nor shifting at closure. Positives: early label +0.3, coherent presence +0.4. Frictions: label-only (not embodied in rhythm or choice) −0.7, no modulation −0.5, closure uncharged by tone shift −0.5. Net 4.3.</comment>
