<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is declared rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her internal conflict ("bravely conflicted") reads as a label applied twice without embodied tension or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The final choice to upload the letter lacks visible cost on the page—she sits and waits, smiling, with no dramatized trade-off or foreclosed path. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("heart raced," "crystallized") and therapy-speak ("bravely conflicted") instead of character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative elements. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the opening. The closure unit—Elena uploading the letter and awaiting consequences—occurs on the page, but the cost remains abstract: no on-page consequence, no forfeited relationship, no immediate price paid. The decision feels inevitable from paragraph one, eliminating meaningful tightening or deepening. The piece teaches a pattern of declarative summary ("dangerous liaison," "contraband truths") but does not dramatize the pressure that would make the choice costly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cryogenic archive setting is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("thermal suit," "amber-light," "profound silence") and recurs throughout. The "echoing library under snow" phrase appears six times, creating a motif that charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice—Elena's access to dormant networks and her ability to upload are frictionless. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the cold/silence atmosphere supports tone, but the environment does not alter tactics or shape the ending's cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elena will release the letter—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation. A power fluctuation hands her the letter; she discovers its contents; she uploads it without obstacle or reversal. No on-page tightening narrows her options: the dormant networks are conveniently accessible, transmission succeeds in seconds, and no Federation monitoring interrupts. The cost ("cryonic suspension or worse") is declared but deferred off-page, failing the on-page cost test. The piece moves in a straight line from discovery to decision without a turn that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus controlled history—emerges from the premise but is stated directly multiple times ("Knowledge cries out to be free," "contraband truths," "who controlled the truth"). The final image of Elena waiting in "revolutionary potential" offers resonance, but the thematic question is answered by authorial assertion rather than dramatized particulars. Subtext operates weakly; the piece tells its thesis rather than letting action and image carry meaning. The "echoing library under snow" motif recurs but does not deepen thematically across beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the cold/silence filtering, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("crystallized," "repurposed from preserver to liberator") that feels more authorial than archivist-specific. The lone dialogue line ("Knowledge cries out to be free") reads as thesis statement rather than naturalistic speech. Psychic distance is consistent, and free indirect style is clean. Texture is purpose-driven but occasionally generic ("her heart raced," "resolve to scandalize").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "echoing library under snow" appears six times; "contraband truths" three times; "bravely/brilliantly conflicted" twice; "dizzying quiet" twice; "within the blink that follows surprise" twice. Template cadence is evident in repetitive sentence stems and declarative summary structures. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") stack in emotional beats without voice justification. Stock metaphors ("touches of light in the darkness") and therapy-speak labels ("bravely conflicted") dull immediacy. Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("brilliantly conflicted and resolute"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—archivist discovers incriminating document and leaks it—is a familiar template executed without fresh synthesis. Elena's decision path is telegraphed and linear, with no transformation through unexpected friction. The "dormant networks" and "ancient peer-to-peer chains" read as convenient world-building rather than lived detail. Emotional specificity is minimal; the arc could transplant to any whistleblower scenario without loss. The ending's "revolutionary potential" and smiling archivist feel generic and safe, avoiding the messy particulars that would distinguish this story from its template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout and makes the key decision to upload the letter. Setup: introduced immediately. Development: discovers the letter, accesses networks, uploads. Payoff: waits for consequences. However, her choice feels predetermined from the opening; no on-page reversal or constraining friction alters her path. The decision is summarized in declarative beats rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. She is the agent but her agency is uncomplicated, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The letter appears in multiple beats: discovery in sector seven, reading its contents, uploading it, and the final reference to its global release. Setup: paragraph four. Development: drives Elena's internal conflict and the upload decision. Payoff: "dangerous liaison letter had found its way into the world." The object is causally active and irreplaceable—without it, the plot dissolves. However, it is handled primarily through summary and declaration rather than tactile interaction or evolving perception. Strong causal work elevates it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes and appears throughout: the letter contains "contraband truths," Elena worries about "controlled information," and the ending imagines "contraband truths" waking the globe. Setup: paragraph seven. Development: motivates Elena's choice. Payoff: explicitly named in the closing paragraphs. The concept is declared repeatedly but does not constrain tactics—Elena's access is frictionless, and the upload succeeds without complication. It functions thematically more than causally, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" appears twice as a label without embodied dramatization. Paragraph eight: "bravely conflicted between duty and the weight of revelation." Paragraph twenty-three: "bravely conflicted heart hammered." No on-page action demonstrates the conflict costing her a choice or altering tactics. The trait is ornamental, applied by the narrator rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Replacement with "conflicted" or omission would not change the plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The action to "scandalize" is named in paragraph seventeen and drives the upload decision. Setup: mid-story explicit statement. Development: the upload is framed as an act of scandal against the Federation. Payoff: the letter's release will "ignite conversations." The action is irreplaceable—without it, the arc collapses. However, it is summarized rather than dramatized, and the upload itself is frictionless, reducing causal texture. Strong closure linkage but limited beat involvement elevates it to mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dormant networks" are introduced in paragraph sixteen, used for the upload in paragraph eighteen, and confirmed in paragraph twenty-two. Setup: late (beyond 50%). Development: the upload mechanism. Payoff: transmission finalized through them. The method is specific and irreplaceable—peer-to-peer chains older than the Federation—but its mechanics are asserted rather than shown. It does not constrain Elena's choice; access is convenient and immediate. Late introduction and summary-only use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Echoing library under snow" is seeded in the opening line and recurs six times, anchoring atmosphere and the final image. Setup: immediate. Development: the setting's "profound silence" mirrors Elena's isolation and amplifies her internal debate. Payoff: "In the echoing library under snow, the archivist closed her eyes" and the closing "dizzying quiet" reprise. The phrase charges the closure through patterned return. However, the environment does not constrain action—Elena's access and transmission are unimpeded. Strong lyric resonance elevates it despite limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Within the blink that follows surprise" appears twice (paragraphs ten and twenty-two) as a poetic marker rather than a functional timeframe. The phrase does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the upload "takes seconds" but Elena then sits and waits with no clock pressure. Time is vague throughout—how long she reads, decides, or waits is untracked. The element reads ornamental, introduced for lyric effect without altering tactics. Swappable with "in an instant" or omission.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to provoke an unspoken conversation" is explicitly named in paragraph fifteen and repeated in paragraph thirty-one. Setup: mid-story. Development: frames the upload as an act of provocation. Payoff: "people would wake to contraband truths." The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices, and Elena's internal friction is minimal—she moves from hesitation to resolve without visible cost. The motivation is present and shapes the arc but lacks embodied struggle, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" appears three times across the story, paired with "profound silence" and "echoing library." Setup: paragraph two ("profound silence"). Development: paragraph thirteen ("dizzying quiet"). Payoff: final paragraph ("dizzying quiet of the archive was no longer oppressive"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly—initial oppression shifts to "electricity of awakening potential." However, the modulation is declared rather than earned through beat-level pressure shifts. The tone charges the final image but does not constrain choice, placing it in mid-band.</comment>
