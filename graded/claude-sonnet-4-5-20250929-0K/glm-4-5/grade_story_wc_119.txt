<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The writer remains entirely static across twenty paragraphs—no contradictory impulses, no embodied struggle, only serene certainty about his mission. Interiority is abstract ("cosmic current," "grand design") rather than character-particular, and the prophetic gift is told rather than dramatized through concrete micro-choices under pressure. The ending smile confirms he has faced no cost, no renunciation, no genuine friction between wants and limits. No meaningful change or credible endurance with visible price appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece is a twenty-paragraph mosaic of static tableaux with no taught pattern, no legible transitions, and no pressure escalation under any lens. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (lighthouse, writer, fortunes), but no causal linkage or accumulative deepening narrows options or raises cost. The ending declares change ("more people would begin to see") without showing a decisive act, renunciation, or conceptual repricing with felt price. Closure is asserted, not earned on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vivid and anchored early (rocky island, circular room, ancient typewriter, spiral staircase). However, the environment remains postcard-static across the night; no tool, constraint, or spatial detail alters a choice or charges the final image. The delivery container and morning boat appear only as mechanical transit, not as pressure points. Micro-setting potential (typewriter, lantern, delivery container) is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transposing humanity's perception—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening forecloses an option or forces a trade-off; the writer types fortunes unopposed and smiles at dawn with zero friction. Letters of gratitude confirm his success without dramatizing any cost, failure, or constraint. Coincidence does not resolve because no problem appears; the piece is a mission statement, not a pressure arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Open secrets" and "transpose life into a new key" are invoked as labels in nearly every paragraph but never tested through specific, grounded action. The final sunrise smile and declaration of incremental change replace scene pressure with thematic summary. No epiphany is earned through struggle, no image reweights prior material without stating a moral. The piece philosophizes about meaning rather than enacting it through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The third-person narrator maintains stable distance and a coherent register—lyric, elevated, but legible. However, the prose slips into corporate abstraction ("orchestrate change by directing flow," "grand design of existence") that clashes with the mystical-artisan frame. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present (cosmic currents, palimpsests) but remains uniform across all beats, showing no modulation under pressure. Filter verbs are sparse, and POV boundaries hold.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the middle: paragraphs 11–14 recycle "prophetic," "open secrets," "directing flow," and "transpose" without adding pressure or detail. Template cadence dominates—"The writer had," "He hadn't," "Now he worked," "His motivation was"—across consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors (tide, beacon, seeds) accumulate without fresh specificity. Information density is low; most sentences restate the mission rather than advance it. Rhythm never varies with scene need.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—fortune-cookie wisdom as vector for espionage and prophecy—is high-concept but executed as a static vignette that could be transplanted to any mystic-with-a-medium frame (tarot reader, DJ, graffiti artist) without structural change. The microdot spycraft detail is mentioned once and never integrated into stakes or tactics. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the arc is a straight declaration. Middle-ground hedging avoids both the thriller mechanics and the mystic's personal cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The writer types fortunes, seals one, descends, and reviews letters—no choice that alters tactics or narrows options. Observation without decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Microdot film specs appear in one sentence (paragraph 3) as exposition, never handled, never returned, never charged with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Open secrets" is invoked as theme in eight paragraphs but does not shape an on-page stake or constrain a tactic; it remains a label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Accidentally prophetic" is told in paragraphs 4–5 and 12, never dramatized as a constraint or enabler with visible cost in a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Orchestrate" appears as mission statement in paragraph 6 and final line; no key turn traces to this action as a concrete, irreplaceable move.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Directing flow" is named in paragraphs 6 and 13 as abstract method, never shown shaping an attempt or choice with mechanical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse is anchored early and revisited (circular room, spiral staircase, delivery container at base), but it supplies no resource or constraint that alters outcome. Postcard function across most beats; micro-setting potential in typewriter and delivery container is unused.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"After last orders" frames the opening but does not tighten decisions; the night-to-dawn span is vague and untracked, with no live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Transpose life into a new key" is stated twice as desire but never conflicted on the page; no friction between want and cost appears.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The tone—mystical, elevated, circular—is coherent and sustained across all beats but remains static; no modulation with pressure, no charge at the final image beyond serene affirmation.</comment>
