<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's motivation is present (thirty years of brokering truces, lost family) but interiority relies heavily on label-speak and abstract formulations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "trembling in their hands" moment gestures toward embodied emotion, but the narration otherwise defaults to summary statements about idealism, solitude, and redemption without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to leave the clipboard is told as symbolic gesture rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a visible path. Micro-choices exist (asking "Shall we begin?") but do not reveal a hierarchy of values with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early (negotiator, terrace, midsummer) and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the day's progression, celestial alignment, and treaty completion. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the clipboard gesture and the child's laughter, reweighting war/peace tension. However, cost remains abstract and largely asserted ("price of redemption," "debt carried forward") rather than dramatized in a specific forfeiture or action that narrows Elian's options. The piece teaches its contemplative pattern by midpoint and holds it through the ending, but the final image does not point to an exact on-page sentence where cost is unmistakably legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ancient terrace, celestial bodies, and stone canopy provide consistent spatial grounding and sensory anchors (salt air, three suns, moonlight). The ebony clipboard returns at multiple beats and its final placement serves as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elian's professional lens (worn leather shoes, weathered cloak), though some descriptions drift toward postcard phrasing ("hues of impossible beauty"). The environment constrains the ceremony's ritual structure and the terrace functions as both stage and witness, meeting the 9+ threshold test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (ending the forever war through this treaty negotiation) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the day's progression: initial trembling, navigating the first breach, mapping resources, and observing cracks in the alliance. One meaningful tightening occurs at midday ("first breach in generations"). However, escalation is described rather than dramatized—key turns ("harder work began after lunch," "mapping of shared resources") are summarized without showing Elian's agency forcing trade-offs. The cost is asserted in reflective summary ("lifetime of solitude and compromise") rather than shown as a specific forfeiture that alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (imperfect peace, cyclical conflict, redemption's ongoing cost) emerges organically from the treaty's flawed success and Elian's reflections. The ebony clipboard and the child's laughter function as resonant particulars that reweight the opening premise. However, the final paragraphs drift into explicit thematic statement ("if true peace was possible," "price of redemption was never fully paid," "peace was not an event but a practice") that replaces scene pressure with authorial summary. The piece invites reflection through its contemplative structure, but the ending articulates rather than dramatizes its central question, weakening the non-literal answer requirement for high scores.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable throughout with a contemplative, elegiac register appropriate to Elian's three decades of experience. Perceptual signature is present (noticing salt air, celestial patterns, the clipboard's polish from "nervous thumb strokes"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions during peak moments ("operatively gentle," "eternal territories of conflict," "flawed beauty of a world perpetually at war with itself") that read as authorial rather than character-particular under stress. The brief dialogue ("Shall we begin?" "The peace will hold") feels purposeful but limited. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the closing reflection flattens immediacy with philosophical summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and several images are concrete (ebony clipboard polished by thumb strokes, scuffed leather shoes, salt air). However, the prose suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "the price of redemption" appears twice in near-identical phrasing; "flawed beauty" is repeated; multiple sentences open with "The" followed by abstract nouns ("The ceremony itself," "The ebony clipboard," "The price of redemption"). Stock metaphors proliferate ("collective memory of betrayal," "forever balance between war and uneasy truce"). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the final third without clear pattern-teaching, creating density that slows rather than propels. Information density is moderate but momentum sags under reflective weight in the closing beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (peace negotiator at a midsummer treaty ceremony) is functional but follows a familiar template: weary diplomat, symbolic ritual, fragile hope, cyclical conflict. The celestial alignment and three suns add speculative texture, but these details do not transform the core emotional arc, which could function unchanged in a purely realistic setting. "Operatively gentle" and "flawed beauty" gesture toward fresh phrasing but remain abstract rather than dramatized through specific action. The ebony clipboard's symbolic placement offers a purposeful closing image, yet the story's meditation on endless war and imperfect peace remains within well-worn thematic territory without a non-obvious synthesis or risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and frames the story, appearing in setup, middle (navigating the first breach, mapping resources), and closure (placing the clipboard, turning away). Their decisions (asking "Shall we begin?" placing the clipboard as symbolic gesture) are present but summarized rather than dramatized as on-page turns that narrow options. The negotiator role shapes the dominant stake but key moments (the treaty signing, the mapping of shared resources) are told rather than shown, reducing causal pressure. Two gates clear (setup, closure participation); middle development is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in setup (retrieved from beneath the cloak, "polished by countless nervous thumb strokes"), is handled mid-story (holding the treaty, emptied of its burden), and returns with reweighted meaning in closure (placed in the center of the negotiating table as symbolic gesture). Three beats across the arc. However, its evolving use is largely descriptive rather than causally active—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress. The final placement charges the closure image but remains symbolic rather than dramatizing a specific cost tied to the object's unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The price of redemption" is named twice in the text, explicitly in the final third: "Elian's signature...represented a personal redemption, the price of which had been a lifetime of solitude and compromise" and "The price of redemption, Elian knew, was never fully paid." The concept shapes the dominant stake thematically but does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics in a dramatized beat. It functions as thematic commentary rather than a pressure that changes options. Setup is present (implied in Elian's history), but middle development and closure participation are summary-only, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is named once in the text: "Their approach had always been operatively gentle—listening more than speaking, understanding before persuading." This label describes Elian's method but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown through a choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No middle development or closure participation; the phrase appears in setup as backstory summary. Label-only mention and swappability (could be replaced with "patient" or "diplomatic") cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Muster" appears once: "today required them to muster strength they hadn't drawn upon since the war had stolen their family thirty years prior." The action frames Elian's internal preparation and is present in setup, but it does not drive a key turn or redefine options in a dramatized beat. The "mustering" is asserted rather than shown through a specific choice under pressure. No clear middle development or closure participation; the story could function with "gather" or "summon" without structural impact. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Ritual significance" is named once: "The ceremony itself held deep ritual significance, with each step of the negotiation following ancient customs that lent gravitas to every word spoken and paper signed." The method is signaled in the middle section and its mechanics (ancient customs, step-by-step process) are mentioned. However, the ritual steps are summarized rather than dramatized—we do not see how specific customs constrain choices or shape attempts. The ritual frames the treaty process but does not drive a key turn on the page. Present in two beats (middle description, implicit in closure ceremony) but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ancient terrace appears in setup (opening line), middle (sun piercing through stone canopy, guests departing), and closure (midsummer moon rising, Elian remaining on the terrace as the final image anchor). The setting provides spatial continuity and the stone canopy creates a micro-environmental detail. The terrace functions as stage and witness rather than actively constraining choice, though its ancient permanence contrasts with the fragile treaty. Three gates met; the setting charges the final image through its timeless quality ("since long before the forever war began") but does not alter tactics or supply resources that affect outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"The slow dance of celestial bodies" is introduced in setup ("planets rare in alignment cast strange shadows") and referenced at closure ("celestial bodies continued their timeless trajectory"). The timeframe establishes atmosphere and the midsummer + celestial alignment frame the day's ritual. However, the celestial clock does not tighten decisions or alter tactics in a dramatized beat—the day's progression is summarized ("by midday," "after lunch," "as the three suns began their descent") without showing how time pressure forces choices. Two gates (setup, closure mention); middle development is descriptive rather than causal, capping at 4.6 per missing middle gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice" is explicitly stated mid-story: "they found their true purpose: to anchor ideals in practice, transforming abstract concepts like justice and reconciliation into binding agreements and reparations." The motivation is present in setup (three decades of failed negotiations, unquenchable idealism), named in the middle, and implicit in the closure gesture (leaving the clipboard for future negotiators). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—we see Elian's trembling hands but not friction between ideals and costs in a specific on-page action. Two gates clear; middle is summary-only, reducing friction and cost legibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" is explicitly named twice: "cracks became visible in the newly forged alliance—flawed beauty, Elian thought, like everything worth preserving" and "the price of redemption...born into the flawed beauty of a world perpetually at war with itself." The tone (contemplative, elegiac, acknowledging imperfection) is coherent through turns and modulates from trembling hope to bittersweet acceptance. The tone charges the final image (child's laughter amid ancient stones). However, the phrase "flawed beauty" reads as thematic label rather than tone woven through pressure—it is stated rather than enacted through scene texture. Present in setup (implied in "glimmer of unquenchable idealism"), middle, and closure; tone shapes atmosphere but is somewhat static in its philosophical register.</comment>
