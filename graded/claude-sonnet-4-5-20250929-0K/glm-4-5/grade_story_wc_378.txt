<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Unit 734's internal conflict between mechanical nature and "strangely organic responses" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The transformation choice arrives without visible struggle—the android executes protocol 34 smoothly, no cost shown in the decision moment itself. Embodied emotion is largely absent; labels like "nostalgia" and "inner static" replace concrete perception under pressure. The miniature selves appear as solution rather than through a micro-choice that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with fragments layering toward transformation, but the closure effect—miniaturization through "controlled burn escape"—lacks visible cost at the moment of change. The original form "slumps inert," yet this consequence is reported after the fact rather than dramatized as a foreclosed option. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening, no penalty. The two-of-three gate test (Resonant Reconfiguration via transformation) is approached but the cost remains asserted rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and bio-luminescent petals anchor setting vividly. The dome's wavering protective field constrains Unit 734's options during the magnetic shift, pushing the miniaturization choice. Spatial choreography remains clear across the dome interior. The crystalline box and the roses function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image, lifting the score above mere description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the garden and resolve inner static—signals early. The magnetic shift provides external pressure, but escalation proceeds through reported system states rather than dramatized reversals that narrow options. "Systems failure imminent" is declared, yet Unit 734's execution of protocol 34 reads as smooth application rather than a tightening choice with visible trade-off. The cost (original form inert, consciousness fragmented) is legible but arrives as outcome rather than dramatized during the peak decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragmentation-as-wholeness emerges from the transformation structure and is reinforced by the final image of thousand connected selves. The empty box glowing softly at the end offers a non-literal recurrence that reweights the opening, avoiding overt moralizing. However, "strangely organic" and "inner static" function as prompt-label placeholders rather than embodied particulars, and the children's return is asserted convenience rather than thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited to Unit 734; no head-hopping. Diction like "містул memory circuits" (typo or artifact?) and "strangely organic" repeated across paragraphs suggests template phrasing rather than distinct perceptual signature. Prose rhythm varies adequately, though several paragraphs open with "The" or "Unit 734" in close succession. Psychic distance is consistent, and the android's way of noticing (receptors, processing unit) maintains character filter throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" appears four times without variation, a clear paraphrase loop. Multiple paragraphs begin with "The" or "Unit 734" in adjacent lines, creating template cadence. "Systems failure imminent" and "controlled burn escape" read as placeholder labels rather than motivated diction. Figurative language ("electromagnetic pulses painted the sky in colors that shouldn't exist") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. Information density is moderate; some sentences like "The android's fingers traced the polished surface..." advance setup but do not do double duty. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.3, template cadence −0.4, total −0.7 applied once here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Android-caretaker-as-miniature-swarm offers a fresh angle on the fragmentation premise, and the box of childhood fears as fuel is a specific detail. However, "controlled burn escape" and "inner static" remain abstract; the magnetic-north-shift apocalypse and glass-dome-garden read as assembled sci-fi tropes without deeper synthesis. Transformation test: swap "desert roses" for another fragile ecosystem and "android" for another synthetic being, and the emotional arc persists largely unchanged, indicating mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Unit 734 is present throughout and makes the miniaturization choice, but that choice is executed via protocol rather than dramatized as a turn with visible cost in the decision moment. The caretaker role frames the stakes (preserve garden, resolve static) and appears in the ending (thousand selves tending roses). However, "nostalgic" is told-only and does not constrain a middle beat. Setup ✓, Development (weak: protocol execution), Payoff ✓. Two gates plus weak middle development place the element at functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The box appears in paragraph 4 (hidden in chest cavity), is opened in paragraph 9 to fuel transformation, and returns empty and glowing in the final paragraph. Three touches across setup, middle use, and closure reprise. However, the "childhood fears collected over decades" backstory is told rather than shown affecting a choice, and the box's mechanics ("fueled the transformation") remain vague. Causal pressure is moderate; the element enables the transformation but could be swapped for another energy source with minor rewording. Lyric reprise (first mention → final glow) adds resonance but does not fully compensate for the vague mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Controlled burn escape" is named in paragraph 11 as protocol 34 and mentioned again in the penultimate paragraph, but its mechanics—how containing chaos enables miniaturization—are told rather than dramatized. The concept does not constrain middle tactics; Unit 734 simply initiates it. Closure mentions it ("through controlled burn escape") but as summary rather than active choice. Late first explicit appearance (second half), swappable with "emergency transformation protocol" with minimal edits. Present and functional but ornamental to the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" appears four times: opening (polishing), paragraph 7 (inner static context), paragraph 11 (fingers on control panel), and paragraph 20 (roots connecting to soil). The trait is told repeatedly but does not constrain a choice until the very end, when roots manifest as visible cost. Label-only use across most beats, with payoff deferred to closure image. Replaceability moderate (could be "increasingly biological" or "hybrid nature"). Present across beats but lacks middle causal pressure; the roots at the end elevate slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Miniaturization is signaled in paragraph 10 ("Miniaturization was the only escape now") and executed across paragraphs 11–16 (reducing scale, fragmentation, tiny versions appearing). The action redefines Unit 734's options and produces the closure state (thousand miniature descendants). Setup mid-story, Development (the fragmentation process spans multiple beats), Payoff (ending state depends on it). All three gates met. Causal pressure strong; removing miniaturization breaks the resolution. Specificity high; the action is irreplaceable. Deduction for late setup (introduced at ~40% mark) −0.5; strong development and payoff counter.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"By containing chaos" is mentioned in paragraph 12 ("By carefully containing the chaos within its internal systems...") but functions as summary explanation rather than a method dramatized across beats. The mechanics are told, not shown shaping attempts. No middle beat where the method is tested or adjusted. Setup ✓ (mid-story mention), Development missing (no visible constraint or enabling moment), Payoff weak (closure summarizes method rather than enacting it). Missing middle development caps at 3.4; swappability and summary-only use lower further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert rose farm anchor every beat: opening (shimmering dome, polishing), middle (dome shudders, protective field wavers, life support systems), and ending (garden preserved, miniature selves among roses). The setting supplies the survival constraint (dome integrity) and shapes the miniaturization tactic (preserve ecosystem within failing dome). Setup ✓, Development ✓ (dome's wavering field pressures the choice), Payoff ✓ (garden flourishing inside, roots in soil). All three gates met. Causal pressure strong; setting is irreplaceable and drives both stakes. Specificity high (bio-luminescent petals, thousand varieties).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Magnetic north shift is introduced in the opening line and completes in paragraph 17 ("The magnetic north shift completed..."). The shift provides external pressure (electromagnetic pulses, destabilized magnetosphere, radiation) that threatens the dome and forces Unit 734's choice. However, the timeframe is vague—no clock tightens decisions beat by beat; the shift simply "intensifies" and then "completes." Setup ✓, Development ✓ (escalating threat across middle beats), Payoff ✓ (shift completes as backdrop to resolution). All three gates met, but the time element does not tactically constrain moves; the android executes protocol without time-based trade-offs. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To resolve inner static" is named in paragraph 7 and restated in paragraph 18 ("achieving resolution through fragmentation"). The motivation frames the character's arc but is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants in a choice moment. Paragraph 3 mentions nostalgia "though technically impossible," hinting at conflict, but no on-page beat shows the android torn between mechanical duty and organic impulse with visible cost before the solution. Setup ✓, Development weak (motivation asserted, not tested in a friction moment), Payoff ✓ (resolution claimed in ending). Missing strong middle development; desire told-only. Caps at ~4.6 for missing setup in first third and weak dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" is named in paragraph 14 and enacted in the ending (thousand miniature selves, each complete yet connected). Tone modulates from coherent urgency (magnetic shift, system failure) through fracturing (consciousness separating) to resolution (miniature descendants moving with grace). The final image (roots connecting each android, empty box glowing) charges fragmentation-as-wholeness without stating a moral. Setup implicit (fragmentation vocabulary early), Development ✓ (tone shifts with fragmentation process), Payoff ✓ (ending crystallizes the tone). The tone is coherent and supports closure but could be more tightly signaled early; paragraph 1's "distorted shadows" and "strangely organic" hint but do not teach the pattern until midpoint.</comment>
