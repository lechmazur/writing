<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The painter's motivations are established—persuading mirrors through ritual—but interiority remains largely abstract ("spirit soared," "melancholy of separation"). The borrowed heartbeat concept is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Perceptively calm reads as a label without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ending renunciation lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply gathers tools and vanishes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The piece accumulates atmospheric detail and establishes the ritual pattern, but closure lacks decisive reweighting with felt cost—the mirrors show possibilities, she murmurs "Wonderful," then departs until spring with only "familiar melancholy." The separation from the terrace's heartbeat is told, not dramatized as a foreclosed path. No meaningful tightening narrows options or changes knowledge in the final third.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and rain-created droplets are vividly rendered and recur across beats. The prism fractures her image into possibilities, which charges the vision sequence. However, the terrace functions more as backdrop than constraint—she completes her ritual without the environment resisting or altering her tactics. The rain amplifies resonance (told) but does not force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: persuade mirrors to show possibilities. The ritual unfolds without complication or reversal; rain and prism simply amplify her success. The vision of alternate lives arrives as spectacle, not a choice-point that narrows options. No visible price paid; the "borrowed heartbeat" separation is abstract. Agency is execution of a rehearsed ritual rather than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of possibility and paths-not-taken emerges through the mirror visions and fractured reflections. The coded lullabies and generational lineage hint at concealed knowledge. However, the final image ("vanished from the echoing terrace until spring called her again") resets to the opening frame without reweighting prior material or offering a non-literal answer. The "familiar melancholy" is told, not charged by a specific cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("perceptively calm demeanor," "dusky harmony," "crescendo") and occasionally drifts into tourism-voice ("tiny rainbows," "precious moments"). Filter verbs are sparse. The single line of dialogue ("Today the mirrors will listen") feels purposeful but isolated. Perceptual signature is present but tends toward lyricism over character-specific bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in adjacent paragraphs: "elusive mirage painter" and "The Painter" reintroduced; "borrowed heartbeat" concept repeated across three paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "She [verb]…, her [noun]…" stems recur. Stock metaphor: "spirit soared." Information density is moderate; several lines elaborate atmosphere without advancing plot. Figurative language ("prism caught her movements, fracturing her image") works cleanly at peak beats. Minus −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence; text-artifact screen applied once here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mirage painter and coded lullabies offer a fresh synthesis of ritual magic and urban setting. The prism parapet and rain as catalyst are specific. However, the emotional arc—solitary practitioner performs seasonal ritual, glimpses other lives, departs—follows a familiar lyric template without a non-obvious turn. The borrowed heartbeat remains ornamental, not causally tested. No bold risk elevates stakes or complicates the familiar contemplative frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; humming, tracing stone, opening eyes to witness visions are actions, but none creates a turn or forecloses a path. Her choices execute a predetermined ritual without friction. Caps: missing middle development (no choice alters tactics) → 3.4; missing closure participation (she gathers tools and vanishes, no decision) → 2.8. Lowest cap 2.8, but lyric reprise (first → last) lifts slightly. Early signal +0.3, beat involvement (three touches) +1.4, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6. Net ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rain-wet prism appears in four beats: initial arrival, touch, fracturing image, and implicit presence during vision. It amplifies resonance and fractures her reflection into possibilities, shaping the vision sequence. Early signal +0.3, beat involvement (three+) +1.4, causal pressure (enables vision) +0.8, specificity +0.5. Closure linkage partial (implicit in vision) +0.4. Net ~6.8; essential to the vision beat but does not constrain a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Introduced at 40% ("survived by sharing a borrowed heartbeat"). Mentioned three times but only as exposition; it never alters tactics or forecloses a path. The "quickened" heartbeat and "easing" are told. Caps: introduced after 40% → 4.6; missing middle development → 3.4; missing closure participation → 2.8. Lowest 2.8, plus late-arrival friction −0.6, summary-only −0.3. Net ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Label appears twice: opening line ("perceptively calm demeanor") and late third ("perceptively calm expression never changed"). No on-page action constrained or enabled by the trait; it describes rather than dramatizes. Missing all three gates. Label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.8. Net ~2.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Grace" appears in movement description ("movements filled with the grace") and as understanding achieved ("grace of understanding"). Present in two beats but does not create a turn or redefine options; it colors the ritual without causal pressure. Early signal +0.3, beat involvement (two) +0.9, but ornamental use −0.8, swappability (could be "precision" or "fluidity") −0.6. Net ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Introduced at ~28% ("Drawing from…hum a tune borrowed from children's songs") and developed across three paragraphs with mechanics explained. The melody resonates with mirrors and carries intention. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two) +0.9, causal pressure (enables mirror response) +0.8, closure linkage (implicit in final success) +0.5. Summary-only for mechanics −0.4. Net ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Echoing terrace anchors all action, appears in opening and closing, and "absorbed and returned her melody." Spring timing frames the ritual window. The terrace houses the borrowed heartbeat connection. Early signal +0.8, beat involvement (three+) +1.4, closure linkage (final line) +0.7, specificity +0.4. However, it does not constrain a choice or resist her ritual; postcard function −0.6. Net ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Time window established early ("hush before the cathedral bells") and tracked tightly: pre-dawn prep, first bell tolls, "last bell faded," morning takes hold. The bell transition is the threshold she must stand within. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure (defines ritual window) +1.0, closure linkage (marks completion) +0.9, specificity +0.5. Net ~7.2; the clock shapes her ritual but does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stated explicitly in paragraph 8 and implicit in the ritual throughout. The desire to show possibilities drives the on-page action. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (two) +0.9, causal pressure (goal motivates ritual) +0.8. However, no friction between want and cost; the ritual succeeds without sacrifice or renunciation on the page. Told-only desire −0.5. Net ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears twice: paragraph 14 ("creating a dusky harmony") and final paragraph ("dusky harmony of her purpose fulfilled"). Tone is consistent—lyric, contemplative, softly mystical—but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image beyond label. Early signal +0.3, closure linkage (final line) +0.7, but static mood throughout −0.6, label-only in ending −0.3. Net ~4.9.</comment>
