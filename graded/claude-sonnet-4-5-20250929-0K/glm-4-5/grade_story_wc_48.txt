<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The novelist is a collection of abstract labels rather than a person making choices under pressure. Interior life consists entirely of reflection and philosophical summary ("he had come to understand," "discovered that his true motivation") with no embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "peace" arrives as declaration rather than earned through dramatized renunciation or cost. Motivation remains told throughout; no on-page micro-choice tests commitment or foreclos a path with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure unit exists—no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with legible cost. The protagonist begins at peace with his manuscript and ends at peace; "conflicted" is asserted in the opening but never dramatized through a choice that narrows options. The "whisper of closing pages" timeframe promises imminent action, but the entire piece remains reflective summary without a causal turn or pressure point. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (mist, nexus, and seashell introduced without spatial or temporal anchor until paragraph three), triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The feral nexus and mist are described repeatedly but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—postcard atmosphere only. Spatial choreography is vague (forest? ruins? no anchor of scale or position). The seashell fragment appears as a symbolic token placed on the manuscript without affecting action. No micro-setting (body, tool, proximity) shapes tactics; the environment remains decorative throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled or tested on the page. The novelist is described as "struggling against the current of commercial expectations" in backstory, but no publisher, deadline, or competing choice appears in the present scene. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options; the protagonist observes mist and recounts prior experiences without agency. The final smile declares resolution of a conflict never dramatized, violating the requirement for one meaningful pressure point with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than dramatized: "solemnize...the very essence of human resilience," "ephemeral cameo appearances...indelible impressions," "transform them into something lasting." The final paragraph delivers a thesis summary ("even the smallest things can contain entire universes") in place of resonant particulars. The seashell's "mathematical geometry" and "against the current" motif are introduced late as symbolic convenience without prior constraint or accumulation. No concrete event on the page reweights the premise; all meaning is asserted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is absent—the narrator observes in generic elevated prose without character-specific bias or selective attention. Diction drifts into corporate/academic register ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "profound motivation," "transformative clarity") inconsistent with a working novelist's interior voice under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("On this final page...") sounds like written thesis rather than spoken thought. Psychic distance remains uniform; no modulation under stress. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("observed how," "seemed to breathe," "would rise") dulling immediacy without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "whisper of closing pages" / "inside the whisper of closing pages," "lucidly watchful" repeated identically across paragraphs, "ephemeral cameo appearances" x3, "against the current" x3, "shapes of different hopes" x3, "feral nexus in mist" x5. Template cadence dominates with runs of "The [noun] [past tense verb]" and "he had [past perfect]" stems. Stock metaphors ("swirling hush," "delicate mathematical geometry," "sacred reverence") flatten texture. Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring rather than sharpening sense. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("swirling hush grew louder"), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The frame—artist at symbolic location reflecting on completed work—is a widely used template executed without transformation. All elements (mist, ruins, seashell, "against the current") function as interchangeable metaphors for creative struggle; no specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus distinguishes this novelist's journey. The "ephemeral cameo appearances" method and "shapes of different hopes" motivation are asserted as unique but remain abstract. Transformation test fails: change the art form and setting, the emotional arc remains identical boilerplate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The conflicted novelist is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or options. All "conflict" is recounted in backstory (publishers demanding accessible stories). Observation dominates; the protagonist places the seashell and smiles, but these gestures carry no visible cost or choice—setup and ornament only, no development or payoff gate met.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The spiral seashell fragment appears in the opening (setup gate met) and is placed on the manuscript near the end (payoff gate present but ornamental). No middle development—it is described but not handled or used to constrain a choice. The "delicate mathematical geometry" and symbolic function remain static; no evolving use or reweighted meaning across beats. Two gates with weak causal work caps eligibility near 6.0, but swappability (any symbolic object could replace it) and ornamental closure use lower the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Against the current" appears as a repeated phrase describing backstory struggle (commercial expectations, academic theories) but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. The protagonist does not resist or navigate any present current; the concept functions as thematic echo only. Late first appearance (paragraph two in metaphorical summary), no beat involvement, no closure linkage beyond a final mention—ornamental use throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is repeated identically as a label in three paragraphs without constraining or enabling any action. No on-page moment shows the trait creating a cost or tradeoff—observation is described but does not alter what the protagonist notices, chooses, or foregoes. The attribute could be removed without changing any beat, confirming label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Solemnize" appears twice: once in dialogue as an intention and once in the narrator's description of placing the seashell. No major turn traces to this action; the gesture is symbolic rather than causal. Easily swappable with "honor," "consecrate," or "mark" without structural change. No middle development; the action does not redefine options or pressure—ornamental use caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" is mentioned three times as a thematic claim (characters from his history manifested; relationships occurred this way; he understood through these) but the method is never signaled early or dramatized—no mechanics shown, no effect on attempts or choices. Summary-only use in backstory reflection without shaping present tactics; the method could be removed and the story unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The feral nexus in mist is named in the opening (setup gate met) and described repeatedly but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource. The setting is postcard atmosphere—static fog and ruins without spatial constraints or tactical use. No middle development gate (the protagonist does not navigate, use, or resist the environment), and no payoff gate (the mist "embraced him" as metaphor, not causal). Ornamental across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" appears as a phrase describing symbolic time (the novel's ending, the final page being written) but no live clock tightens decisions. The timeframe is vague—mornings at the nexus are mentioned, but no urgency or tracked duration shapes tactics. The element is metaphorical rather than functional; removing it would not alter any beat. Late first clear mention (paragraph four), no development, ornamental payoff only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"To collect the shapes of different hopes" is stated twice as the protagonist's motivation (gathering aspirations from strangers, transforming them) but never dramatized or conflicted in an on-page choice. Told-only in reflective summary without friction between wants and costs. No beat involvement; the motivation does not shape any present action or decision. Setup gate met (paragraph seven), but no development or payoff with causal work—swappable with any creative-gathering metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Swirling hush" appears multiple times as atmospheric description (the mist creates a hush, it grew louder, it embraced him) with consistent elevated tone. The tone does not modulate with pressure—no variation between reflection and peak moments—and does not charge the final image beyond repeating the phrase. Functional but static mood throughout; the tone could shift to "crystalline silence" or "brooding quiet" without structural change, confirming replaceability.</comment>
