<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to salvage something pure" remains abstract throughout; no internal contradiction or embodied emotion shapes her choices under pressure. The captain's spirit and descendants appear as plot functions rather than individuals with distinct wants. Key moments—visiting descendants in dreams, their confessions—are summarized rather than dramatized, so no micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The final exchange with the captain's ghost delivers therapeutic closure without the protagonist foreclosing any live option or paying a felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as causal-accumulative hybrid, but the sequence relies heavily on summary: "Night after night, Elara documented…" compresses what should be the story's escalating pressure. Orientation anchors appear early (diver, shrine, snow globe), satisfying the test. The closure—captain's "Thank you" and the globe now clear—asserts resolution rather than showing a decisive change or cost on the page; the final image reweights prior material only thematically, without visible forfeiture or a crystallized stance that narrows options. No meaningful reversal tightens tactics or knowledge between the wreck-dive and the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and wreck setting are vivid in isolation but remain postcard backdrops; neither environment constrains a choice or alters tactics. The snow globe's "strangely warm" glass and later "soft inner light" are asserted qualities that do not pressure any decision. Sensory hierarchy by POV is absent—wreck-diver details (pressure, visibility, current) and ghost-whisperer perceptions (spirit presence) are told rather than filtered through embodied urgency. Spatial choreography within the shrine is clear but inert.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—expose the sabotage truth—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Elara's dream-visitation campaign unfolds in summary; no single descendant resists, misinterprets, or forces a trade-off. The sabotage revelation and subsequent confessions occur off-stage ("One by one, the descendants came forward"), eliminating all escalation and visible cost. The captain's gratitude substitutes for a protagonist-driven turn. No tightening, deepening, or reversal narrows Elara's options or changes her knowledge through causal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of "salvaging purity from wreckage" emerges through recurring imagery (melted snow globe, borrowed starlight, glacier shrine) but remains abstract; the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "You have salvaged what was pure." The snow globe's transformation (melted → clear, warm → glowing) operates as symbolic convenience rather than earning resonance through protagonist struggle. No non-literal answer to the central question arises from particulars; the ending moralizes ("sometimes the most powerful truths are those we discover ourselves") instead of offering a charged image that reweights prior material. The phrase "weaving truth carefully" recurs as a prompt label without dramatized friction between revelation and withholding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Diction drifts toward elevated register in peak beats ("rupture between worlds," "salvaged what was pure") that exceeds a wreck-diver's working lexicon without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific way of noticing that distinguishes Elara's focus from an omniscient catalog. The captain's dialogue ("Thank you… You have salvaged what was pure") and Elara's closing thought both recycle the prompt's "salvage something pure," flattening voice distinction and specificity. Psychic distance remains consistent; no purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "descended… cutting through darkness" / "ghost whisperer… felt the lingering presence" / "salvage something pure from the wreckage" recurs three times verbatim. Synonym churn on "salvage/expose/reveal" and "windows of connection" without added pressure. Stock metaphor strings: "borrowed starlight" (three uses), "weaving truth carefully" (two uses), both without reweighting. The final two paragraphs stack summary and thematic echo without propulsion. Filter-verb reliance ("she felt," "she learned," "she knew") in high-pressure beats dulls immediacy. Mid-story compression ("Night after night… piecing together a pattern") summarizes what should drive escalation, creating a momentum sinkhole. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("salvaged what was pure"), triggering disqualification per the Text-Artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Core premise (ghost whisperer uses artifact to expose historical crime via dreams) is a template confluence of paranormal-romance and cozy-mystery beats without transformation. The melted snow globe as conduit, glacier shrine, and dream-visitation method are ornamental rather than irreplaceable; substituting a mirror, mountain cave, or séance would leave the arc intact. No bold risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; the emotional and causal path follows median safety choices. Proximity check: "borrowed starlight" and "windows of connection" read as stock poetic placeholders. The transformation test fails—swapping names and objects preserves the plot.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Wreck-diver ghost whisperer: present throughout and frames setup, but Elara makes no on-page choice that creates a key turn. Descent, retrieval, dream visits, and final gratitude all proceed without resistance or visible cost tied to her dual role. Mid-band functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Melted snow globe: handled in wreck-dive beat, placed on altar, acts as conduit across nights, and appears in closure ("now-clear snow globe… back on its altar"). Three-beat involvement with closure reprise, but its transformation (melted → clear, warm → glowing) is asserted rather than earned by protagonist action or choice. Swappable with another artifact (locket, compass) without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Windows of connection: mentioned as rumor early, described as dream conduit mid-story, and referenced at closure ("windows of connection now open"). Shapes the method (dream analysis) but does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off on the page. Functional metaphor without causal pressure or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Weaves truth carefully: stated twice ("weave truth carefully," "weaving truth carefully") without on-page demonstration. No scene shows Elara withholding, timing, or framing a revelation to avoid harm; descendants discover truth "on their own terms" in summary. Label-only trait without visible constraint or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Expose: signaled early as the goal, executed in summary ("One by one, the descendants came forward"), and referenced at closure ("exposed… crime"). Drives the middle sequence but off-page, so swappable with "reveal" or "uncover." Functional role in one major beat (the dream campaign) without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams: introduced at midpoint ("They came to her… as fragments—cameo appearances…"), used in one summarized beat ("Night after night, Elara documented these dream visitations"), absent from closure. Late signal, summary-only use, and no causal pressure on tactics. Swappable with séance or vision without loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice: appears in one paragraph early and one line at closure ("her glacier shrine"). Vivid description but no pressure on choices; the shrine supplies no resource or constraint that alters tactics. Postcard micro-setting without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>To salvage something pure from the wreckage: stated explicitly at setup, repeated verbatim at closure ("You have salvaged what was pure"), and drives goal pursuit. Present across three beats but told rather than dramatized; no on-page friction between this desire and a competing want or cost. Lyric reprise reweights thematically but without visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Borrowed starlight: used three times (opening simile, dream presence, closing smile), establishing a lyric motif. Tone remains stable and gentle throughout; no modulation under pressure or tonal charge in the final image. Functional recurrence without escalation or felt cost tied to the tone shift.</comment>
