<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and backstory anchors her present constraint, but interiority remains abstract—"wistful and determined," "pearl of stillness"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The workshop sequences show skilled hands and practiced fingers, yet no internal conflict acts simultaneously in scene; her journey from wistful to joyful reads as emotional summary rather than dramatized struggle. The final acceptance feels asserted rather than earned through on-page cost that forecloses a path. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, so relationship bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early (star watcher, grotto, nightly climbs). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: polishing rituals deepen into shared gatherings, and the final paragraph reconfigures her earthbound state from restriction to unique vantage. However, closure cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page choice forecloses a live option or exacts visible price; the transformation is told in summary ("didn't seem like a restriction anymore"). Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path is legible at the ending beat, triggering −0.6 in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is vivid (moisture-shimmer, carved by ancient waters) and returns across beats, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. Sea glass fragments and the cliffside workshop supply tactile detail, and the grotto transforms from solitude to gathering place, charging the final image. Because the setting shift participates in the closure reconfiguration, Q3 reaches 7.1, meeting the "constrains a choice or charges the final image" gate for mid-7s entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (share stars without fire) is signaled early and persists. The discovery that polished sea glass projects celestial patterns is a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, and the grotto evolves from private sanctuary to pilgrimage site. However, no on-page reversal narrows live options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the progression reads as steady accretion rather than pressure that tightens and forecloses. Band guardrails for 8.0+ require a tightening that forecloses a path or forces a trade-off; this piece deepens without that constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (earthbound does not preclude cosmic connection; sharing light gently vs. destructive fire) emerges from sea glass mechanics and the final reconfiguration. The "zephyr bloom of inspiration" and "pearl of stillness" risk abstract label-speak, but the closing image—grotto transformed, purpose found—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("didn't seem like a restriction anymore") rather than letting the image alone reweight prior material, preventing entry to high-7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is present (telescope, celestial wonders, patient ocean). Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts into stock lyricism ("gift from the depths," "pulse of the universe"). Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, sentence stems repeat ("Each piece," "As memories," "She discovered") and figurative density ("sleeping serpent," "pearl of stillness," "zephyr bloom") layers without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is solid and spatial choreography tracks, but template cadence runs appear: "Her motivation to share...had grown stronger" / "Fire destroyed; she sought to illuminate" / "Along the shore...she collected" / "Back in her small workshop" loop through boilerplate openers across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loops: "dreams of distant worlds and impossible journeys" echoes "dreams to ash" without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("gift from the depths," "patient hands," "pulse of the universe") and filter-verb stacks ("would climb," "would weigh," "would transform") in ritual description dull immediacy. Applying template-cadence (−0.4), paraphrase-loop (−0.2), and stock-metaphor (−0.3) penalties totaling −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The earthbound astronomer who finds alternative cosmic connection is a familiar template, and the sea-glass solution feels convenient rather than inevitable. The grotto-to-gathering arc and fireless-light motivation add specific detail, but emotional beats (wistful → determined → joyful) follow predictable stages without bold risk or non-obvious synthesis. No proximity to famous lines, yet the piece reads as a median execution of a well-worn premise without transformation through lived complexity or surprising moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role frames the premise, but her choices are passive (collecting, polishing, arranging) rather than turn-creating. The shift from solitary to communal happens off-page ("soon her serpentine grotto became a place of pilgrimage"); no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present and functional but observation-heavy; decisions trend low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sea glass appears early (shore collection), returns in workshop polishing, and is causally active in the discovery beat (catching starlight creates patterns). It participates in closure by transforming the grotto into a gathering place. However, the final image mentions it generically ("simple magic of polished sea glass") without charged reprise or reweighted meaning, capping upper reach. Three beats (collection, polishing, discovery) plus closure linkage; early signal +0.5, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, minus late generic mention −0.3 and swappability for similar reflective material −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" appears twice as metaphor for emotional state (mid-story calm, final nightfall peace) but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. It remains thematic echo without constraining choices or altering options. Lyric reprise is present (early calm → ending peace) but no causal pressure or cost connection. Ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" describes sea glass twice (collection beat, final lesson) but remains label-only; no on-page action or cost tied to this specific trait. The reflective property enables the celestial projection, but "vibrant" adds no constraint. Functional but swappable with "reflective" alone. Label-only trait −0.3, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Weigh" appears once in the workshop beat ("weigh each piece carefully in her palm, testing its density and clarity") and is tied to the polishing process. It contributes to the discovery but is not revisited or reweighted at closure; easily swappable with "examine" or "assess." One beat +0.4, early signal +0.3, causal role (feeds polishing) +0.5, swappability −0.6, no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced early ("method...passed down through generations"), used in the workshop beat (roughened edges → faceted surfaces), and enables the discovery that sea glass can project starlight. It participates in closure by producing the "star maps" that draw pilgrims. Early signal +0.6, two beats (workshop, discovery) +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, minus swappability (generic polishing vs. specific gem technique) −0.4 and summary-only final mention −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto is anchored early, used in nightly climbing rituals, workshop location, and gathering space. It transforms from solitude to connection, directly shaping the closure reconfiguration. The mist and serpentine twist add specificity, and the setting participates in the final image ("misty sanctuary"). Early signal +0.7, three beats (climb, workshop, gatherings) +1.4, causal pressure (location enables projection display) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (serpentine, moisture, carved walls) +0.6, minus slight swappability (any secluded coastal site could substitute with edits) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" appears twice as a framing device (opening dreams, near-end recollection) but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Time is untracked; "each passing year" and "countless hours" remain vague. No live clock or escalation tied to memory timing. Lyric reprise is present but no causal pressure. Ornamental use −0.8, vague time −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation (share light without fire) is stated early ("grown stronger with each passing year, especially after witnessing how flames consumed") and drives the sea-glass solution. Fire's destructive history shapes the tactic choice (fireless projection). However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page—no friction between wants and costs, no moment where fire tempts as easier path. Early signal +0.7, causal pressure (frames solution method) +1.0, closure linkage (fireless gatherings realize goal) +1.1, minus told-only friction (no on-page tension between desire and obstacle) −0.6 and summary of past trauma without present dramatization −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" appears once as metaphor near the end ("a zephyr bloom of inspiration") but does not define overall tone. The piece's tone is gentle, lyrical, and steady across beats—no modulation with pressure or tonal shift that charges the final image. Static mood −0.6, single mention without pattern −0.5, no closure charge −0.7.</comment>
