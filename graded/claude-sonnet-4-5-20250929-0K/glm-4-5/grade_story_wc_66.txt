<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The copyist's motivation is clear (wanting stories to flow freely), but her interior life remains abstract—she never faces a moment where her revolutionary work costs her something personal on the page. Her decision-making is told rather than dramatized; we're informed she's been broadcasting for years, but no micro-choice under present pressure reveals her hierarchy of values. The "thistled calm" trait is label-only, and her emotional state never degrades or complicates under the risk she supposedly faces. No meaningful internal contradiction or embodied struggle appears in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words; the story opens with generic work, then introduces the radio, then the alcove (which contradicts "her small apartment"), creating spatial confusion that never fully resolves. The dominant lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs—the final paragraph asserts thematic satisfaction ("reawakening the imagination") without on-page cost or a before/after moment. The second half is pure backstory summary (seven-year famine, dust discovery, listener methods) that halts forward pressure entirely. No causal turn or meaningful tightening appears; the broadcast simply ends and she walks home.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "ember alcove" carved into a hillside is vivid and the mist swirling in response to her voice offers one moment where environment reacts to action. However, the alcove contradicts the earlier "small apartment," spatial choreography is unclear (where is the radio? how does she "pack away" equipment in a carved hillside?), and the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The dust's behavior is described but not shown affecting her decisions in scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—evading the Narrative Control Bureau—is declared but never tested on the page; no authority figure appears, no detection risk materializes, no tactic shifts under pressure. The story presents a single uncomplicated broadcast with no reversal, complication, or cost. The second half abandons present action entirely for backstory summary, flattening all pressure. No agency is demonstrated beyond routine execution of a nightly task; the ending asserts "every risk worthwhile" without showing a single risk paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of story-as-resistance emerges clearly and the dust-as-carrier concept offers a fresh metaphor. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("reawakening the imagination of an entire generation") rather than letting the image resonate, and the "teach dust to tell stories" phrase is repeated mechanically. The piece asks a question about narrative control but answers it with assertion rather than dramatized complexity or earned insight from specific experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable and the prose has a consistent literary-lyric register. However, the copyist's perceptual signature is generic—she notices nothing in a character-specific way, and her diction remains uniform across emotional states. The second half shifts entirely into exposition-summary voice, losing the scene frame. No dialogue appears. The voice is competent but lacks the specificity and pressure-responsive modulation that would distinguish it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "her fingers stained with ink" / "her fingers moved across," "stories should flow freely" / "stories return to people's lives" / "narratives were rationed" / "diverse narratives." Template cadence appears in the backstory paragraphs with repeated "The [noun] had [verb]" constructions. Stock phrases accumulate: "simple yet profound," "quiet revolution," "color and meaning." The second half is pure tell-mode summary that stalls all momentum. Figurative language ("thistled calm," "ember alcove") is decorative rather than functional. Multiple −0.3 to −0.4 deductions for loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dust-as-narrative-carrier concept is inventive and the pirate-broadcast frame offers a fresh angle on story-famine dystopia. However, the execution relies on familiar resistance-artist tropes (secret identity, underground broadcast, oppressive bureau) without transforming them through specific choices or non-obvious moral calculus. The "story famine" could be transplanted to any regime-control narrative. The method (dust particles retaining sound) is clever but explained rather than demonstrated through consequence, and the ending's assertion of success feels unearned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The copyist is present throughout and her occupation provides cover, but she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses options. Her "diligent" work is mentioned in the opening line and never constrains her broadcast choices. She could be any underground broadcaster; the copyist role is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The radio dial glow appears in three beats: the opening corner description, the adjustment/tuning moment, and the fade at broadcast end. However, it's purely atmospheric—no choice hinges on the glow, and it doesn't return with reweighted meaning. Static description without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is the central activity and shapes the story's frame. It drives the opening setup, the middle broadcast execution, and the ending satisfaction. However, no concrete risk or tactical adaptation occurs on the page; the broadcast proceeds without complication. The concept is present but never tested or deepened by pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" appears once as a descriptor for the radio dial glow. It enables no action, constrains no choice, and involves no tradeoff. Label-only mention without consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears in "cloak her message via elusive song lyrics," describing her method. It's mentioned once in the setup and alluded to when she sings, but the cloaking itself is not shown creating friction, forcing a tactical choice, or being tested by detection risk. Swappable with "hide" or "disguise."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Via elusive song lyrics" is signaled early and present in the broadcast beat where she sings about "lost love and changing seasons." However, the mechanics never matter—no lyric choice is dramatized, no detection risk forces her to adjust phrasing, and the method is summarized rather than shown. Functional but untested.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "ember alcove in mist" is introduced in the fourth paragraph and mentioned again at the packing-away moment. The mist swirls "as if responding" to her voice, a nice image, but the alcove never pressures a choice or supplies a tactical resource. It contradicts the earlier "small apartment" and remains decorative. Postcard description without agency.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the story famine" is signaled in the opening and elaborated in the backstory block. The seven-year duration and post-famine present shape context and motivation, and the "after" status informs her belief that stories should flow freely now. However, no live clock tightens her decisions in the present scene; time is backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To teach dust to tell stories" is stated explicitly in paragraph six and repeated in the final paragraph. It drives her nightly work and the dust-discovery backstory. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized—no friction between this desire and a competing cost or fear appears on the page. Label-only depth without conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" appears twice: describing her demeanor and the night. The tone is consistent and literary-lyric, but it remains static—no modulation under pressure, no tonal shift that charges the ending. The phrase itself is decorative and doesn't constrain the emotional register or interact with the closure image.</comment>
