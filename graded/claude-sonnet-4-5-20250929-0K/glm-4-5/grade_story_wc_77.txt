<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation remains abstract throughout—"photographic curse," "fear," and "resuscitation" are deployed as labels rather than embodied stakes that drive concrete micro-choices. The whispering advisor reveal (future self) arrives without causal groundwork; nothing in prior behavior or dialogue seeds the reversal. Interiority leans on therapy-speak ("unbosom your fear," "acknowledging weakness") and the final transformation is asserted rather than earned through on-page contradiction or renunciation with visible cost. The piece tells us the protagonist "learned" and "understood" but never dramatizes a moment where competing impulses force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (abandoned funhouse, post-resuscitation, moonlight) arrive early, but the causal chain fractures immediately: paramedics revive the protagonist "moments before" yet the funhouse visit unfolds as a long sequence with no spatial or temporal grounding. The advisor materializes without setup, the dream dictionary appears from a pocket with no prior mention, and the opera cloak clasp "dissolves into light" then "materialized in my hand one last time" in defiance of prior physics. The ending offers a conceptual repricing ("curse revealed as gift") but the cost is declared, not shown—no on-page action or image where a live option is foreclosed. Under a Causal lens the piece fails; under Accumulative it never teaches a pattern; the effect reads as outline.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The funhouse setting provides "decaying corridors," "crooked mirrors," and "heavy velvet curtain" but remains a backdrop—no spatial choreography constrains movement or choice. The "lingering luminance" recurs but never alters tactics; it glows, intensifies, spreads through veins, yet the protagonist's actions would be identical in any mystical locale. The opera cloak clasp is handled twice (touch, dissolve) but its materiality is inconsistent (solid, then light, then solid again). Micro-setting allowance applies, but the body and objects here are ornamental rather than pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"transform relationship with death"—is declared in exposition rather than tested in scene. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: the protagonist enters the funhouse, reads paradoxes, touches the clasp, and emerges enlightened without cost or resistance. The whispering advisor offers no opposition, the mirrors pose no dilemma, and the "fear's weakness" is revealed through passive observation. Under the inferred Causal lens escalation requires a because/therefore tightening; here each beat is additive (and-then) with no foreclosed path or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The paradox motif ("courage through surrender," "weakness is strength") is announced rather than discovered through specific action. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "beautiful precisely because it terrifies us into growth" and "all because I learned to listen" are thematic summaries rather than emergent images. The "repulsive allure" phrase recurs but never charges the closure—it describes rather than embodies. The dream dictionary and opera cloak clasp are symbolic conveniences introduced late to harvest thematic points without prior integration into the protagonist's choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice holds a consistent elevated register but leans on stock mystical phrasing: "materializing as a flickering shadow," "ethereal form strengthened," "pure potential." Psychic distance remains stable (close third) with no head-hopping. The advisor's dialogue reads indistinct from narration—"Unbosom your fear" and "The universe has prepared paradoxical notes" share the same abstraction. Filter verbs ("I saw fear itself," "I gasped to recognize") are overused in peak beats. The prose avoids major POV leaks but lacks perceptual signature; every object is noticed with identical reverence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "lingering luminance" appears eight times with minimal variation, "whispering advisor" recurs as a tag without subtext, and the final five paragraphs restate transformation via synonym ("crumble away," "dissolve," "disperse," "complete"). Template cadence: "I [verb]" sentence stems dominate the second half. Mixed metaphor: luminance "coalesced around" the clasp then "spread through my veins" defying spatial logic. Stock phrases: "sickly, beautiful light," "pure light," "strange new existence." The ending summarizes rather than dramatizes the closure beat, and "repulsive allure" in the penultimate line is told as theme rather than shown in image. Artifacts touch the closure unit; disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise (mystical funhouse journey post-resuscitation to cure a "photographic curse") stitches genre tropes without transformation. The paradox-driven revelation and advisor-as-future-self are familiar beats executed without fresh specificity. The emotional arc—fear → acceptance—maps to template stages. The "dream dictionary" and "opera cloak clasp" read as prompt-mandated objects rather than organic story logic; removing them and substituting near-synonyms ("journal," "amulet") would leave the plot unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present in setup (materializes beside protagonist), middle (instructs "unbosom," touches clasp), and ending (reveals as future self, explains final lesson). The advisor's choices (appear, instruct, reveal identity) create narrative turns but the protagonist remains passive recipient; the advisor does not force a dilemma or constrain options. Swappable with "spirit guide" or "mentor" with minor edits. Causal pressure is minimal—guidance is delivered, not resisted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Appears in setup (draped on phantom figure), handled in climax (protagonist touches it, dissolves into light), and returns in ending (materialized one last time). Two distinct beats plus reprise. However, the clasp's mechanics are inconsistent (solid, light, solid) and it resolves a symbolic problem (fear) it did not help create on the page. The clasp enables the transformation beat but could be replaced with any mystical artifact; its specific properties (a clasp, securing an opera cloak) are never leveraged. Mid-band for presence and reprise; capped by swappability and late problem-solving.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Lingering luminance" is introduced early (paragraph 2), recurs frequently (glows around mirrors, marks curse, intensifies, coalesces, spreads through veins), and appears in the ending (dissolved into morning light, spreads through veins). However, it functions as atmosphere rather than shaping stakes—the protagonist's actions and choices would be identical if luminance were replaced with "aura" or "energy." It never constrains a decision or alters tactics. Present across beats but ornamental; causal role is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Mentioned in setup ("photographically cursed since the day I'd stopped breathing," reflections appear abnormal) and briefly in the climax (reflection shifts according to internal logic, transforms into light). The curse is a label rather than a constraint; it never forces a trade-off or limits an action on the page. No visible cost tied to being "photographically cursed"—the mirrors distort but the protagonist proceeds unhindered. Summary-only trait without dramatized consequence; missing middle development and closure causal link. Cap at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unbosom" appears in the advisor's command (mid-story: "Unbosom your fear"), as action (protagonist touches clasp, reads paradoxes aloud), and in the final reflection ("I unbosom my final fear to the empty horizon"). The action is tied to the climactic moment but is interchangeable with "confess," "release," or "speak"—nothing about unbosoming specifically drives the turn. Present in middle and ending; shapes one beat but swappable. Lyric reprise reweights slightly but causal irreplaceability is low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dream dictionary introduced mid-story (protagonist withdraws it from pocket, no prior setup), used in one extended beat (reads paradoxes aloud that the advisor then interprets), and briefly referenced in the ending reflection ("Through paradoxical notes in my dream dictionary"). The method enables the transformation scene but the mechanics are vague—why this dictionary, what makes the paradoxes operative. Missing setup gate (late first appearance, second third); present in middle and ending but ornamental. Swappable with any mystical text. Cap at 4.6 for late intro; slight lift for ending mention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Funhouse anchors the opening and recurs as the frame (enters, explores chamber, walls crumble, emerges at dawn). Setting provides atmosphere (decaying corridors, crooked mirrors, velvet curtain, dust) but never constrains choice—spatial layout is vague, no doorway blocks or passage forces a trade-off. The funhouse's "repulsive allure" is told rather than leveraged tactically. Present in setup and ending; middle beat use is passive. Postcard description without micro-setting pressure; functional frame but replaceable with any mystical locale.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the resuscitation" anchors the opening and recurs in reflection ("After the resuscitation that had brought me here," "my resuscitation was not an end"). However, elapsed time is untracked—the sequence unfolds as a single fluid beat with no clock pressure. The timeframe is a static label rather than a live constraint; urgency is absent. Dawn arrival in the ending suggests passage of time but does not tighten decisions. Present in setup and ending; missing middle development where time would alter tactics. Cap at 3.4 for missing development gate; slight lift for ending presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated early (advisor: "to trick fear into revealing its weakness") and pursued across beats (protagonist reads paradoxes, touches clasp, confronts mirror-fear). The desire drives the middle sequence and is affirmed in the ending ("I had learned to trick fear"). However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted—no moment where the protagonist hesitates, resists the advisor, or weighs the cost of confronting fear. Present in setup, middle, and ending; shapes action but lacks friction between want and price. One-dimensional pursuit; no visible trade-off dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Repulsive allure" is introduced early (funhouse offers "repulsion and allure"), recurs mid-story ("sickly, beautiful light that made my skin crawl while drawing me deeper," "twisted, malformed, yet somehow possessing an attraction"), and explicitly restated in the ending ("the repulsive allure that is transformation itself"). Tone is coherent but static—every mystical element is both repulsive and alluring in identical measure. No modulation with pressure; the tone does not shift as stakes rise or at closure. Present across beats but unvaried; the final image asserts tone rather than charging it through unexpected juxtaposition.</comment>
