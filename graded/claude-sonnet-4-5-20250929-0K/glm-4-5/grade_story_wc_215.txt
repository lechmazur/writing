<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The recluse's interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout ("tranquilly perceptive," "astonished"). Emotional states are asserted rather than embodied—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene, and the final choice (sitting in silence) lacks visible cost or internal resistance. The ghost-watchers and travelers function as props rather than sources of relational pressure. The piece tells us the recluse "understood" repeatedly but never dramatizes struggle or foreclosed alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "recluse," "oasis," and "ghosts visible" across the opening three paragraphs without anchoring *who* (name, age, gender) or *when* (how long post-Veil, season, time of day) by ~120 words; this triggers the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and caps Q3 at 7.0. The closure—box opens, bee dissolves—lacks felt cost: no option is foreclosed, no tactic changes, and the recluse's situation remains identical. The accumulative pattern (repeated "through contextual clues," "astonished recluse") is not taught early or paid off; it reads as template cadence rather than purposeful design. Drive lens is ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal, further weakening coherence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The oasis anchors spatially (hives, acacia, root cellar, extractors) and the scorched wasteland frames isolation, but details are ornamental—no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters a tactic. The box's warmth during silence and the moonlight spill are atmospheric but do not pressure decisions. Spatial choreography is vague: we never learn the recluse's position relative to hives or cellar across beats. The cap from Q2's orientation debt (7.0) does not apply here because the penalty was under threshold, but micro-setting never engages the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"preserve the weight of unspoken words"—is declared but never tested by a live opposition or trade-off. No reversal narrows options: the recluse investigates, sits, and the box opens without cost. The travelers' compliance ("they somehow understood") eliminates friction rather than escalating it. Agency is passive observation, not decision under pressure, and the ending grants success without dramatizing what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme—silence as preservation, mute eloquence—is coherent and enacted through the recluse's gesture and the box's mechanics. However, it is stated explicitly in the final third ("preserve the weight of unspoken words," "covenant required someone who understood") rather than emerging from image alone. The stained-glass bee and the travelers' finger-to-lips moment carry thematic charge, but the piece lapses into thesis articulation ("Their purpose: not to change what happened...") in the penultimate paragraph, reducing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic: "astonished," "tranquilly perceptive," "mute eloquence" are labels rather than a distinct way of noticing. Diction is elevated and uniform across beats, with no modulation under pressure. The phrase "through contextual clues" appears identically in three paragraphs, signaling template cadence. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains static—no compression or zoom during the box-opening climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "through contextual clues" (3×), "astonished recluse" (4×), "weight of unspoken words" (3×), and "tangled covenant" recur without evolving function. Sentence stems repeat: "The astonished recluse…" opens multiple paragraphs; "They [verb]" and "One [time]…" dominate. Stock metaphors ("smoke in the desert wind," "moon-bleached air") and elevated register ("mute eloquence," "transcended mere pollination") flatten voice. Figurative density in non-peak beats (prismatic shadows, ethereal figures, impossible colors) clutters without advancing pressure. Final-third artifacts touching closure trigger −1.0 and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—ghosts visible after the Veil, a silence-based covenant—offers initial freshness, but execution is derivative: the wise hermit, the magical box that opens for the worthy, and the convert-the-skeptics ending are familiar beats. The bee-and-beekeeper imagery is apt but not transformed; the stained glass, wax seal, and backward-flying swarm function as ornamental magic rather than grounded logic. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes, and the emotional arc could transfer to any mystical-threshold story with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The recluse is present throughout and makes two choices: investigate the cellar and sit with the box. Both are low-agency observation rather than decisions that narrow options or incur cost. The character's "tranquil perception" is label-only; we never see the recluse struggle or renounce an alternative. Setup and middle development are present, but closure participation is passive—the box opens on its own. Swappability is high: any patient seeker would function identically.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The box appears early (paragraph 6), is handled in two beats (discovery, moonlit placement), and returns at closure when it opens. Its warmth-during-silence mechanic shapes the recluse's final tactic (sitting without words). However, the cost of this choice is invisible—no option is foreclosed, no price paid—and the box's "impossible colors" and magical release are ornamental rather than grounded. Causal pressure is moderate; specificity (stained glass, wax seal) is present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" is mentioned seven times but never dramatized as a stake with friction. We are told it exists and what it requires, but no on-page conflict tests the recluse's commitment to it or forces a trade-off between covenant and another want. The concept functions as thematic label rather than shaping tactics. Setup and thematic payoff are present; middle development is absent. Swappability is high: "ancient pact" or "sacred duty" would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is mentioned twice as a label but never constrains or enables an action with cost. The recluse perceives ghosts and interprets the box, but so do the travelers by the end—no unique capability is dramatized. The trait does not shape a tactical choice or foreclose an alternative. Ornamental mention only; no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gaze" appears in eight paragraphs and structures the recluse's investigation: gazing at spirits, gazing at the box, sitting with eyes closed. The climactic choice—silent presence—is an extension of gazing. However, the action is swappable with "observe" or "watch" and does not itself narrow options; the box's mechanics (silence, not gazing) drive the outcome. Setup, development, and closure presence earn mid-band; causal pressure is moderate but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is signaled early and recurs in three beats (spirits near hives, glass imagery, hidden journals). The method enables the recluse's understanding of the covenant's requirement. However, the mechanics are vague—what specific clues led to which insight is never shown—and the method does not constrain a choice or impose cost. Functional presence across beats, but the recluse's final success (sitting in silence) does not depend on prior clue-gathering; any patient listener could succeed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The oasis is anchored early (paragraph 2) and its elements—hives, cellar, acacia trees, extractors—provide spatial texture. The root cellar yields the box (causal participation), and the "oldest hive" is the site of the climactic placement. However, the setting does not pressure choices: the recluse could perform the same actions anywhere with a box and moonlight. The scorched wasteland frames isolation but does not constrain tactics. Setup and closure presence earn moderate credit; causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The post-Veil timeframe is established early and ghosts are visible throughout, but time does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The "anniversary of the oasis's abandonment" triggers the climax, yet we are never told why that date matters or what would be lost by waiting. No clock tracks elapsed hours or seasons. The timeframe provides atmosphere but does not constrain tactics or alter the recluse's options. Setup present; development and closure participation absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"preserve the weight of unspoken words"—is stated explicitly in four paragraphs and drives the recluse's purpose at closure. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted: no scene tests whether the recluse wants to speak, break silence for a traveler's sake, or trade preservation for connection. The motivation is told and then fulfilled without friction. Setup and thematic closure are present; middle development (choice under competing wants) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" is declared as tone and enacted through the recluse's silence, gesture, and the travelers' wordless understanding. The prose remains elevated and static throughout—no modulation under pressure, no contrast between calm and crisis. The tone supports the covenant's theme but does not charge the final image with new weight; the bee's dissolution and the travelers' finger-to-lips are consistent extensions rather than reconfigurations. Coherence is present; dynamic range is absent.</comment>
