<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The statue's motivation is delivered through telepathic exposition rather than embodied choice under pressure. The diver remains a passive receiver throughout, making no contradictory decisions or visible trade-offs—curiosity leads smoothly to understanding without foreclosing any path. Interior states are labeled ("turbulent thoughts," "ancient satisfaction") rather than shown through micro-choices that alter present options. The ending grants wisdom without dramatized cost: the diver simply "nodded" with "new understanding settling."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within acceptable range. The dominant lens reads as accumulative/textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the statue explains, the diver listens, the ampoule releases visions, and understanding arrives without narrowing options or forcing a stance. The "cascading revelations" are summarized lecture rather than pressure that changes tactics. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration attempt (diver gains understanding), but the cost is asserted ("better questions") not dramatized on the page; no visible forfeiture or constrained choice results from the exchange.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and detailed (corals, bioluminescent light, crumbling buildings, tiny fish through archways), and the underwater garden is sustained throughout. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The ampoule and garden supply spectral memory-visions but these are passive observation, not resources the diver navigates or manipulates. Sensory selection is consistent but does not reflect urgency or shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding the city's fall) is signaled early but remains abstract. No meaningful tightening occurs: the diver descends, receives exposition, watches visions, and accepts the lesson without a single reversal or trade-off. The statue's telepathic delivery bypasses all friction. Agency is absent—the diver makes no decision that forecloses a path or costs anything on the page. The "cascading revelations" are narrated summary, not pressure-tested beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (the danger of absolute certainty, the value of nuance) is articulated repeatedly in direct statement: "no truth is absolute," "welcome nuance into your certainty," "the truth is not a single thread but a tapestry." The city's downfall (hubris via technological pursuit of certainty) is told rather than shown through specific on-page event. The ampoule's visions gesture toward particulars but remain spectral illustration. The ending offers a moral ("better questions") instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material without thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, focalized on the diver's reception and the statue's telepathic voice. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific way of noticing distinguishes this diver. Diction is elevated and consistent but not voice-particular ("incisively kind," "distant chimes," "ancient satisfaction"). The telepathic mode bypasses dialogue and embodied interaction, flattening the opportunity for subtext or goal-driven exchange. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean but burdened by repetitive sentence stems ("The statue…," "The diver…") and synonym churn (e.g., "understanding," "wisdom," "knowledge," "truth" cycle without added pressure). Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "thread the truth through the structural weakness," "currents of doubt," "tapestry," "layers of sediment"—mixed metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "watched") stack in high-information beats. Information density is low; many lines restate the theme without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise (underwater ruin + telepathic guardian statue + ampoule of collective memory) assembles familiar SFF furniture without transformation. The central lesson—beware hubris and absolutism—is a well-worn moral delivered as lecture. The "cascading revelations" method and "thread through structural weakness" phrasing suggest template construction. No on-page turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the diver's acceptance is unearned convenience. Risk-averse execution: the statue is kind, the diver receptive, the lesson tidy.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The living statue is present throughout and delivers all exposition telepathically, but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or narrows options. Its function is oracle/lecturer; it explains, extends the ampoule, and smiles at the end without embodied decision under pressure. Setup clear, no middle choice, closure participation is passive satisfaction—two gates at best. Ornamental telepathy without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The foxglove-stained ampoule is introduced early (paragraph 1), clutched by the statue, extended to the diver (paragraph 3), and opened to release memory-visions (paragraph 6). Three distinct beats with setup and closure presence. However, its foxglove stain is decorative label; the "iridescent liquid" could be any vessel of knowledge with minor edits. It does not constrain a choice or impose cost—the diver simply opens it and receives visions. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Cascading revelations" is named explicitly in paragraph 2 and thematically present as the statue delivers layered truths. However, the revelations are narrated summary ("each truth building upon the last") rather than dramatized beats that narrow options or force the diver to navigate conflicting knowledge. The concept shapes thematic texture but does not alter on-page tactics or stakes. Present and thematically consistent but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Incisively kind" appears as a label in paragraph 1 ("incisively kind") and echoed in paragraph 2 ("gentle insistence") and paragraph 6 ("warmer, more human"). The trait describes the statue's telepathic tone but never constrains a choice or imposes trade-off—kindness does not cost the statue anything or force a tactical decision. Label-only presence without visible consequence or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Thread" appears three times: paragraph 1 ("thread the truth through the structural weakness"), paragraph 2 ("thread their existence through the structural weakness"), and paragraph 6 ("thread your way through the structural weakness"). The action is metaphor for accepting nuance, not a physical or tactical move. It echoes thematically but does not drive a turn or redefine options on the page. Swappable with "navigate" or "integrate" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Through structural weakness" appears as part of the "thread" metaphor (paragraphs 1, 2, 6) but the method's mechanics are never demonstrated. The text asserts the city "thread[ed] their existence through the structural weakness of human fallibility" but does not show how threading works or what structural weakness the diver must navigate. Thematic echo without dramatized mechanics or on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city garden is anchored early (paragraph 1), sustained with specific detail (corals, bioluminescent light, crumbling buildings, tiny fish, archways), and returns in the climax when spectral forms populate it (paragraph 6). Present in setup, middle, and closure. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics—it functions as vivid backdrop. The garden charges the final image but imposes no spatial pressure on the diver's decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after revealing the secret" is signaled in paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 notes the diver "descended once more," establishing a return visit. However, the "after" window does not tighten decisions or create urgency—the statue simply continues its lesson without time pressure. The timeframe orients the reader but does not function as a live clock that alters moves or escalates cost. Functional orientation, no tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to welcome nuance into a certainty" is articulated by the statue in paragraphs 2, 5, and 6 ("welcome nuance into your certainty," "embrace the complexity") and the diver expresses desire to understand (paragraph 5). The motivation is told and echoed but never dramatized as a conflicted choice—the diver does not resist or weigh competing wants. The ending claims the diver gained "better questions" but no on-page friction between certainty and nuance tests the shift. Thematic claim without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone "animate lifeless" is present in the juxtaposition of the living statue (stone, motionless, yet conscious and telepathic) and the final line's "animating the lifeless with its consciousness." The paradox is sustained: stone that thinks, ruins that come alive via memory-visions. Setup and closure participation are clear. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—it remains a static poetic register throughout, neither tightening nor charging the final beat with tonal shift. Coherent but without dynamic escalation.</comment>
