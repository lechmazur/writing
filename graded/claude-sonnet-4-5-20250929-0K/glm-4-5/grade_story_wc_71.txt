<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aria's interior relies heavily on abstraction ("gift," "mystery," "quest") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that alter tactics under pressure. Her actions are systematic but lack friction or cost on the page—she collects, places, understands, then continues without a visible trade-off. The climactic "understanding" arrives as declarative insight rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Emotional states remain at a stable contemplative register throughout with no degradation or intensification that narrows options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: anchors arrive late—"Aria Emerson" not named until line 1, town setting vague, "last Tuesday" creates timeline confusion against "three mornings" and "this morning." The closure unit is an epiphany ("Aria understood") followed by unchanged continuation of her walks, offering reconfiguration without visible cost or foreclosed path. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (sensory detail, poetic recursion) but the ending supplies a causal explanation ("shard of hush allowed her to hear") that contradicts the lens, creating ambiguity at closure. No meaningful tightening: the three-morning ritual and final placement do not narrow options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and filtered through Aria's contemplative attention ("streetlights daydreamed," "dew-kissed streets"). The orris root shard and lighthouse cottage anchor the final beat, and spatial choreography remains clear. However, the bay town itself is generic—no idiom, regional specificity, or occupational detail grounds the locale. The shard constrains the final image by enabling her epiphany, meeting the 9+ gate partially, but the environment does not pressure choice; it supplies atmosphere only.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early but never tested. Aria's three mornings of placement face no resistance, complication, or reversal. The climax is an automatic glow and revelation, not a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path. The "understanding" changes her knowledge but not her behavior: she continues her walks unchanged, offering no visible cost or trade-off. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break; instead, the piece loops her ritual without deepening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme—traces of love animate spaces—emerges from concrete particulars (displaced objects, lighthouse cottage memory). The orris root "shard of hush" and final sunrise image attempt resonance. However, the ending articulates the theme explicitly in the final paragraph ("what makes a house alive is simply the echo of lives..."), converting earned image into stated moral. The hushed-blaze motif recurs but remains ornamental rather than constraining choice. No friction or counter-reading complicates the thesis; the piece affirms its premise without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature ("when streetlights daydreamed," "hushed blaze"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though register occasionally slips into essayistic abstraction ("inadvertently profound truth," "sanctifying glow"). No dialogue to evaluate. Elision of the three-morning sequence is purposeful compression. The voice modulates minimally under pressure, maintaining contemplative rhythm even at the climactic glow. No head-hopping or POV leakage; psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "streetlights daydreamed" (repeated four times), "shard of hush," "hushed blaze," "inadvertently profound," "sanctify" (three times), "breathed with life" (twice). Mixed metaphor: "hushed blaze" contradicts itself without resolving into coherent image. Template cadence in paragraph 4: "She would continue... she would continue... through... while..." Paraphrase loop: final two sentences restate the same thematic point. Information density is low in the closing paragraph, which recapitulates rather than advancing. Sentence openings vary; grammar is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—sensitive observer maps emotional traces through objects—is familiar (psychometry, urban exploration, grief studies). Execution leans on stock metaphor ("houses breathed," "light drank sound") and abstraction over fresh specificity. The orris root identification and "shard of hush" coinage attempt originality but remain ornamental labels. The resolution offers no surprise or non-obvious synthesis; the epiphany confirms the opening premise without transformation. Risk-averse: the piece chooses contemplative safety over dramatic friction or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria notices "creeping normality" in paragraph 1 and the trait motivates her walks, but no on-page decision turns on this noticing. Her observations lead to understanding, not choice. Present across beats but does not constrain tactics or alter cost. Swappable with "sensitive observer" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orris root shard appears in paragraph 2 (setup), is carried and placed in paragraph 3 (development), and enables the epiphany in paragraph 4 (payoff). Three gates satisfied. Used in two distinct beats (identification/carrying, placement/glow). However, the shard's "drink the surrounding sounds" property in paragraph 2 is not used at closure; instead it "allowed her to hear," contradicting its earlier silence effect. Causal involvement is real but the mechanics shift. Swappable with any talismanic object. Closure linkage partial: present but mechanics inconsistent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" named in paragraph 2, synonymized as "orris root shard" and "the fragment" throughout. Concept shapes the final epiphany (allows her to hear what was always there) but does not constrain choices or tactics earlier. The paradox (silence that reveals sound) is declared but not dramatized through cost or friction. Present in closure image but arrives as explanatory device rather than driving earlier pressure. One-beat causal work at the end; lyric reprise without middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" applied to the orris shard in paragraph 2. Functions as a thematic label only; does not enable or constrain action. The trait is asserted by narration, not demonstrated through cost or choice. Mentioned once; no reprise or development. Ornamental descriptor that could be removed without altering Aria's tactics or the glow outcome. Present but not integrated.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Sanctify" recurs three times: paragraph 1 (method to sanctify spaces), paragraph 3 (sanctify her understanding), paragraph 5 (sanctify spaces between memory and presence, sanctifying glow). Frames her ritual across setup, development, and closure. However, the action itself—placing objects—does not create turns or face resistance. The term is more motif than driver. Lyric reprise reweights the opening but the middle placement (paragraph 4) triggers the glow without requiring sanctification as mechanism. Present in closure but the specific action is swappable with "bless," "honor," "mark."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Method signaled in paragraph 1 ("displaced things," "small objects"), executed in paragraph 3 (placing shard, driftwood, key), and present at closure (she carries her collection forward). Mechanics are consistent: objects as vessels of attachment. Three gates satisfied. However, the method does not constrain or enable a choice under pressure; it is Aria's sole tactic, never tested or varied. No friction or cost tied to gathering displaced objects versus other methods. Functional across beats but does not shape escalation or trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Quiet bay in spring" and "predawn hours" recur in paragraphs 1, 3, 5. Timeframe and locale anchor atmosphere but do not pressure choice. The bay supplies the orris shard (setup participation) but the lighthouse cottage could exist anywhere coastal. No resource constraint or environmental complication. Postcard-level specificity without tactical weight. Spring season and bay setting are swappable with other liminal times/places. Functional anchor, minimal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" recurs in paragraphs 1, 3, 5, framing the predawn window. The dawn arrival in paragraph 5 provides a cadence endpoint but does not tighten decisions. Aria's ritual spans "three mornings" without time pressure or deadline. The timeframe is atmospheric and consistent but does not alter tactics or impose cost. Lyric reprise charges the final image (streetlights surrender to dawn) but no mid-scene clock constrains her. One-gate participation (closure image) with early signal; no development constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation stated in paragraph 1 ("mystery that drove her"), developed through the three-morning ritual (paragraphs 2–4), and answered in the climactic understanding (paragraph 4). Present across all three gates. The desire is consistent and shapes her tactics (collecting, placing, observing). However, the motivation faces no friction or cost: Aria's want is never conflicted with fear, resource limit, or competing need. The epiphany satisfies her curiosity without sacrifice. Desire drives action but lacks internal contradiction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" named in paragraph 3 and recurs in paragraph 5 ("hushed blaze of her understanding"). The oxymoron is asserted but not embodied: the prose maintains steady contemplative rhythm without modulation between quiet and intensity. Tone is coherent but static; no shift under pressure. The final glow and sunrise should intensify but remain at the same register as the opening. Present in closure paragraph but does not charge the image with new pressure. Label-only trait; swappable with "quiet intensity" without loss.</comment>
