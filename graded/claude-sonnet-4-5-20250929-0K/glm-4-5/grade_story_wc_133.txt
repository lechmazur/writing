<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete early ("hands trembled," insomnia tied to the tidal path), and her attachment to the brooch before the exchange creates micro-tension. However, the final transformation—insomnia fading as purpose clarifies—feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The phrase "paintings artist's heart" is a typo that breaks immersion, and "wryly earnest" appears as a label without embodied cost at the exchange beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (insomniac painter, tidal island, post-water-wars) land by ~80 words. The exchange forms a clear before/after unit: Lena relinquishes the brooch-as-talisman and gains pigments that redefine her purpose. Cost is visible (the amber warmth "imprinted on her palm"), and the ending sleep shift constitutes Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative lens. Minor slip: "Her gallery" in the visitor passage implies a time jump without transition anchoring, briefly clouding causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal island, rain trails, and lighthouse anchor early and constrain discovery (brooch "half-buried in the sand"). The brooch's warmth and the pigments' mineral specificity charge the exchange beat. However, "continental gallery" and "dam broke" remain abstract; the studio setup in the visitor passage lacks spatial grounding, and the island's pressure on tactics is more asserted than dramatized in micro-moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Lena's need to "thresh meaning from experience") signals early and tightens at the exchange: she must surrender the talisman to gain creative material. The woman's offer forces a trade-off with visible hesitation ("fingers tightening"). Cost is legible (the brooch's ghost-warmth persists), and the ending shift from insomnia to purpose shows deepening. One escalation step is sufficient at this length, but the visitor epilogue diffuses rather than sharpens final pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (preservation vs. creation, trauma into testimony) emerges from the brooch exchange and pigment use without overt moralizing. The ending line "sometimes the most valuable exchanges are not of objects, but of stories and understanding" is a thematic echo that abstracts what the scene already showed, triggering −0.5. The phrase "what remains—and what might yet emerge" offers a resonant answer, but the visitor frame distances the reader from Lena's internal resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds throughout; no head-hopping. Lena's perceptual signature (rain trails as navigation, "wryly earnest" self-awareness) is distinct, and the prose modulates from restless early beats to serene closure. The old woman's dialogue carries subtext ("belongs to the island's memory"). Minor slips: "Her paintings artist's heart" is a typo, and "ofcolors" is a word-merge artifact; these dull line-level immediacy without breaking distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats, and information density is high (brooch discovery, exchange, pigment reveal, purpose shift). Two text artifacts harm momentum: "Her paintings artist's heart" (typo/register break) and "ofcolors" (word merge). The phrase "professional courtesy between survivors" is abstract when the exchange could show that courtesy. The visitor epilogue recycles "wryly earnest" without new pressure, a mild loop. Deduct −0.8 for combined artifacts and loops; closure image ("amber brooch... continued to pulse") remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tidal-island-as-refuge frame and post-water-wars setting offer specificity, and the brooch-for-pigments exchange avoids simple resolution. However, the "insomniac artist finds purpose through symbolic object" premise follows a familiar template, and the visitor epilogue ("made the dead speak," gallery testament) leans on stock redemption beats. The rain-trail method is mentioned but not demonstrated in a choice that requires its mechanics, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena's decision to exchange the brooch is the key turn; her attachment and hesitation create friction. The ending choice to paint with the rare pigments alters her tactics (from restless insomnia to purposeful work). Present in setup, exchange beat, and closure; causal pressure is legible. However, the visitor epilogue shifts her from actor to observed, diluting final agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber brooch appears in discovery, exchange, and closure beats. Its warmth functions as talisman, pressures the exchange choice, and "continued to pulse" in the studio, reweighting its meaning from personal comfort to communal memory. Three distinct beats with closure linkage and felt cost at the exchange. Specific properties (warmth, insect-prisoned center) matter to Lena's attachment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unearthed convergence" is named once ("The brooch felt like a piece of unearthed convergence, a meeting point...") as thematic commentary but does not constrain a choice. The exchange itself enacts convergence (past/present, individual/communal) functionally, yet the prompt phrase remains ornamental. Present by first third, thematically linked to closure, but no causal pressure tied to the exact phrase.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Wryly earnest" appears twice as a label: once in Lena's self-awareness ("her words wryly earnest even to her own ears") and again in the visitor epilogue ("her trademark"). Neither instance shows the trait enabling or constraining an action with cost; it characterizes tone without friction. Present early but remains descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The exchange is the story's fulcrum: Lena trades the brooch for pigments, shifting from insomnia/obsession to purpose/creation. The woman's offer forces the choice, and the exchange's consequence (new materials, fading insomnia, gallery work) drives the ending. Present in setup (woman's approach), executed mid-story, and shapes closure. Cost and causal linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Rain trails are mentioned in exposition ("Lena had become an expert in reading rain trails") and as context for the brooch discovery ("Today's rain had left an unusual set of trails"). The method does not shape an on-page attempt or choice; Lena does not navigate using them in scene. Present by first third but functionally passive, used as setup only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tidal island anchors setting, provides the discovery site (lighthouse, sand), and its separation from the mainland frames refuge and trauma. The rain trails and tidal path open the story. However, the island does not pressure a specific tactic in the exchange or ending beats; it functions as backdrop. Present early, linked to closure mood, but causal constraint is light.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the water wars" frames backstory and the pigments' scarcity ("preserved before the water wars," "dam broke"). It colors the woman's loss and Lena's trauma but does not create a live clock or tighten present decisions. The timeframe is thematic context rather than active pressure. Present throughout, but no urgency or tactic change tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To thresh meaning from experience" is Lena's stated goal (opening and ending: "thresh meaning from experience, transforming trauma into testimony"). The exchange tests this desire—she must give up a comfort object to gain creative tools. The final paintings enact the motivation. Present early and at closure, with friction at the exchange beat, but the phrase itself is told more than dramatized in micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Haggard awe" describes the old woman once and is implied in Lena's restless early state and serene-but-watchful ending. Tone shifts from fragmented/restless (early insomnia beats) to reflective (exchange) to settled (ending), modulating with pressure. The final visitor passage holds a quieter awe. Coherent across turns but the exact phrase is label-only, and the ending tone softens rather than charges the image with undeniable pressure.</comment>
