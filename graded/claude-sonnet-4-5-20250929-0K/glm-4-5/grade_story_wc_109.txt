<comment>The oracle remains a vessel for atmospheric description rather than a character making choices under pressure. Her stated obsession with "ambered hush" is told, not dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible tradeoffs. The shift from "mildly obsessed" to "violently determined" occurs via assertion rather than earned causality. Interior contradictions are absent; she moves smoothly from comprehension to acceptance without genuine struggle or cost visible in micro-choices.</comment>

<comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases through layered description and the final glow image reweights the oracle's task. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she smiles and the work is "fulfilled" without forfeiting a live option or facing a felt price on the page. The shift from preventing to guiding the night is narrated rather than dramatized, and no prior choice narrows to force that realization.</comment>

<comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort and tower chamber anchor setting early with vivid sensory detail (winds, thick walls, marbled hush). The three pebbles on the table and the gold leaf booklet supply recurring tactile anchors. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it provides atmosphere without pressing the oracle's decisions. The setting charges the final image when the booklet glows, reaching the lower edge of the constraint band.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—to draw a map through endless night—is signaled early but never tested by competing options or escalating cost. The oracle's task unfolds as a series of contemplative beats without reversal or tightening; she understands, works, and completes without friction. No live option is foreclosed, and the final smile suggests resolution without visible price. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required but not delivered on the page.</comment>

<comment>The theme of navigating darkness rather than resisting it emerges through image and the oracle's whispered insight. The map-of-absence motif and the line "through silence, not against it" offer conceptual resonance. However, the ending states its wisdom too directly ("not an end but a beginning she had helped chart") rather than letting the glowing booklet image carry the weight. The piece nears thematic coherence but retreats into summary at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual filtering remains consistent (the oracle's attention to silence, texture, and absence). Diction is elevated and purposeful, though "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" risk synonym churn without sufficient differentiation. The line "violently determined" represents a register spike that clashes with the contemplative voice. Distance is well-controlled, but the prose leans decorative in peak beats where agency would sharpen focus.</comment>

<comment>Paraphrase loops appear frequently: "marbled hush" and "ambered hush" alternate without clear functional distinction; "retell," "summarizing silence," and interpreting absence recur in adjacent paragraphs restating the same concept. Template stems ("The oracle…") open multiple paragraphs. Figurative density ("veins of different minerals," "canvas," "held breath") saturates the closure paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity. These artifacts dull momentum and lower information density in the final third, touching the closure beat.</comment>

<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>The premise—oracle drawing a map of darkness through silence—offers a lyric angle on apocalypse material. However, the execution relies on stock images (final star, endless night, flaking gold booklet) assembled without transformation. The central turn (prevent vs. guide) is a familiar reframe. Specificity in the pebbles and the sketching-of-voids image provide texture, but the emotional arc and thematic resolution feel templated rather than lived-in or inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>The pebble-shore oracle is present throughout and her task (drawing the map) frames the narrative. However, she makes no contested choice that narrows options or creates visible cost. Her shift from confusion to comprehension is told rather than enacted through decision. She appears in the closure beat but does not act decisively there; the glow emerges from her work without a final choice that transforms stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet is introduced early, handled in multiple beats (tracing edges, opening to a blank page, sketching, closing), and glows at closure. Its gold flakes catch starlight and the sketches emit light, creating a reprise with reweighted meaning. However, the booklet does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it serves as a passive receptacle for the oracle's work rather than an object whose properties alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>2.4</grade>
<comment>"Ambered hush" is named three times and described as a "profound stillness" the oracle seeks to capture. It functions as thematic flavor rather than a stake-shaping concept. The text does not dramatize how this hush changes the oracle's options or tactics; it remains ornamental. The concept does not drive a beat or enable a turn, and its mechanics are not explored on the page.</comment>

<grade>2.9</grade>
<comment>"Mildly obsessed" is stated once in paragraph two and upgraded to "violently determined" in paragraph six. Neither formulation constrains an on-page action or imposes visible cost. The obsession is told as motivation but does not create friction or force a tradeoff. The attribute could be removed without altering the oracle's arc or the story's causality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Retell" is named explicitly ("retell the ancient prophecies") and echoed in the final paragraph ("dared to retell the story"). The oracle's task involves retelling through her map and interpretation. However, the retelling does not create a turn or redefine options; it is the frame for her static work. The action is present but does not drive escalation or closure in a way that makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>"By summarizing silence" appears in paragraph three and is echoed in the phrase "reading the spaces between words" and the final line. The method is named but not mechanically demonstrated; we do not see how silence is summarized or how that act differs from ordinary interpretation. It appears as description rather than a technique that shapes attempts or alters outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort is introduced in the opening line and anchors setting throughout (tower chamber, thick walls, storm pressure). The fort provides spatial coherence and atmospheric texture. However, the storm does not constrain the oracle's choices or alter her tactics; by paragraph seven it "seemed distant, separate." The setting frames but does not pressure the central task, making it functional but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The timeframe ("only one star remains") is signaled early and tracked: the star flickers, then vanishes at the climax. This creates a visible clock that marks progression. However, the oracle's work does not race against the star's disappearance or change tactics as time tightens. The star's vanishing coincides with her completion rather than forcing a decision, so the timeframe shapes atmosphere more than it drives choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>The motivation to draw a map is stated clearly in paragraph two and reiterated in paragraph six when she comprehends her task. It drives her actions (sketching, placing pebbles, working in the chamber). However, the desire is never conflicted or tested by competing wants. No friction arises between this goal and a cost she must pay; she works, succeeds, and smiles. The motivation is functional but uncontested.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Marbled hush" appears in paragraphs one, five, seven, and nine, framing the tonal texture. The phrase modulates slightly (from "profound silence and whispers" to "living presence pressing against the walls"), and the final usage charges the image as the oracle smiles in that hush. Tone remains coherent and purposeful, though the near-synonym "ambered hush" introduces minor confusion. The reprise at closure earns lyric credit for reweighting the dominant atmosphere.</comment>
