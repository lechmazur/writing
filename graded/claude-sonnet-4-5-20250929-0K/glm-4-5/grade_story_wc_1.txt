<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lena's interior life is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The trait "steadily adaptive" appears as a label without on-page micro-choices that embody it under pressure. Her epiphany about the mineral smuggling arrives through exposition rather than through a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Emotional states are asserted ("trembled slightly," "newfound strength") rather than embodied in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words; the canyon is unanchored spatially and the temporal window ("three weeks ago," "previous night," "now") creates confusion rather than pressure. The closure unit—leaving the canyon with resolve—lacks visible cost; the decision is declared rather than earned through on-page causality. The drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward causal (ledger investigation) but delivers summary and thematic statement instead of because/therefore linkage. Cost proof test fails: no sentence at the ending shows a legible price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The canyon setting is described lyrically ("vast tapestry of stars," "ancient rock walls") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The glass plates and frost are introduced as method but remain decorative; no spatial choreography grounds their placement or Lena's movements around them. The micro-climate detail is told rather than used. The setting does not charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why someone wants her dead—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The "realization" about mineral smuggling is delivered as exposition rather than through a reversal that narrows options. No on-page tightening or deepening alters tactics; the frost investigation is summarized without pressure. Agency is absent; Lena observes and concludes rather than choosing under constraint. No visible cost accompanies her resolve to "face whatever challenges lay ahead."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "the artist must become the art, transforming pain and fear into something beautiful and true" is meta-commentary. The frost patterns are symbolic convenience introduced late without prior grounding. The ledger and glass art connection is explained rather than dramatized. The final paragraph moralizes ("she had always believed that art could change the world") instead of offering a resonant image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-person limited throughout. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous glass artist," "drifting resonance") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("seemed to speak," "seemed to form") stack in the frost examination passage, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; Lena's way of noticing does not reflect her craft or crisis in specific, biased ways.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "seeking solace in the profound silence" / "the quiet canyon under the stars had become her sanctuary" restate without adding pressure. Template cadence runs through the frost-examination passage with repeated "seemed to" and "certain patterns" stems. Stock metaphors ("force of physical blow," "vast tapestry of stars") and elevated diction ("drifting resonance," "scorched testament") cluster without pattern-teaching. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("carrying the drifting resonance of the stars within her"), triggering the elevated deduction and global 9+ disqualification.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—artist investigates conspiracy through her craft—is a familiar template. The frost-reading method appears without prior grounding and feels ornamental rather than integrated. The charcoal smuggling / rare minerals connection is explained rather than discovered through specific, verifiable detail. Emotional specificity is low; the arc could be transplanted to any artist-investigator frame without loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics. She observes, remembers, and concludes; the key "realization" about minerals is told. Setup present; development is summary-only; closure participation is thematic declaration rather than decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ledger strip is introduced early and revisited in the frost examination, but its coded entries are never dramatized—only summarized. It does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. Closure linkage is weak; the ledger becomes "her guide" in declaration only. Two-beat presence without causal pressure trends mid-band at best.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" appears as a descriptor for the ledger and echoes in thematic phrasing ("scorched testament of the ledger strip would become her guide"). It does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The concept is told rather than used.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is mentioned twice as a label but never constrains or enables an action. No visible tradeoff demonstrates the trait under pressure. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Retrace" is introduced as a decision ("she decided to retrace the events") but the action itself is summarized rather than dramatized. The frost-method substitutes for actual retracing. One functional beat without causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The frost method is signaled the previous night and executed in the morning examination. Setup and development gates are met, but the mechanics remain vague and the patterns are told rather than shown constraining a choice. Closure participation is weak; the method "becomes" her guide in theme only. Two gates with minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The canyon is present throughout and receives repeated lyrical description, but it never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Early seed and thematic reprise without causal work or closure charge trends mid-low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" anchors the story in a post-crisis timeframe, but the three-week span does not tighten decisions. The "previous night" / "now, in the first light of morning" sequence is the only live clock, and it does not alter tactics. Timeframe is present but untracked.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is stated as Lena's shifted motivation but never dramatized in a choice with friction. The desire is told rather than tested. Label-only presence without cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" appears as a phrase in two passages and charges the final image ("carrying the drifting resonance of the stars within her"). The tone is consistent and modulates from reflective to declarative, but the single static mood and lack of causal pressure keep it mid-band. Lyric reprise with weak closure linkage.</comment>
