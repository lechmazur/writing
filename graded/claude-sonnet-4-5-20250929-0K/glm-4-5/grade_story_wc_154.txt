<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's interior motivation ("to graft new meaning onto old wounds") is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The character reads as observant and patient, but we see no on-page micro-choice under pressure—Lina is asleep, so the translator's agency reduces to gentle handling and whispered reassurance without visible cost. The backstory about Pacific conflict zones is heavy (multiple references spread across the text) but does not tilt a present stance; it amplifies his credentials without creating friction. Embodied emotion is present in the "lotus-hearted ache" and reverent touch, but the final choice (placing the coral back in her palm) feels like a ritual completion rather than a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered reflection and the coral's recurring presence. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: "sometimes the dead never leave us but simply change form, just like meaning changes with translation" reweights the premise, and the final gesture (closing Lina's fingers around the coral) crystallizes the ritual. Cost is conceptual and felt rather than visible—Kaelen accepts the weight of translating grief—but the image remains somewhat abstract. The piece teaches its reflective, mosaic pattern early and holds it, but the ending lingers in summary ("His work was done for tonight") rather than a single charged image, slightly softening the closure's punch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vivid and recurring, with sensory anchors (damp bench, tropical plants weeping mist, fading light through glass ceiling) that frame the scene. The coral fragment's "labyrinthine grooves catching the fading light" and the smudged cast notes provide tactile micro-settings. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it serves as backdrop rather than participant. The setting charges the final image through the mist and fading light motif, which supports atmosphere but stops short of the 9+ gate requiring direct influence on a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: helping Lina process her father's absence through decryption and ritual. The pressure is situational and internal to Kaelen's mission, but because Lina is asleep, there is no live on-page conflict or tightening choice. The piece accumulates weight through reflection and the coral's handling, yet no reversal or trade-off forecloses an option—Kaelen completes his task without visible cost or complication. The whispered line "He will come back" reweights meaning, but it is a gift rather than a struggle. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the smudged notes and the translator's realization), but escalation remains muted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—grief, translation, and the persistence of meaning across loss—emerges organically from the coral fragment, the smudged cast notes, and Kaelen's occupation. The final image ("the dead never leave us but simply change form, just like meaning changes with translation") reweights prior material without moralizing. However, the piece flirts with over-articulation: "lotus-hearted ache," "unknotting," and "graft new meaning onto old wounds" are all prompt-adjacent phrases that risk thematic echo. The tissue-like quality of the prose supports subtext, but the ending paragraph ("His work was done for tonight—another small graft onto the old wounds of war") edges into summary and risks stating the theme rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kaelen; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature (reverent, patient, translator's eye for pattern) is consistent. The prose carries a meditative, formal register that fits the character's profession and mission. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("lotus-hearted ache," "unknot the small, brave heart") that feel authorial rather than character-native. Filter verbs ("had noticed," "remembered") are frequent but voice-motivated given the reflective mode. No dialogue is present except brief reported speech, so no convergence issues arise. Under peak pressure (the final gesture), syntax remains controlled, but the piece never truly enters high stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence runs harm momentum: "Kaelen had seen countless objects…" / "The translator knew too well such rituals…" / "Kaelen had once translated…" / "The translator remembered villages…" recycles "Kaelen/The translator [past perfect]" stems across at least six sentences. "Unknot" appears four times, "smudged" three times, and "shrewdly innocent" twice without pattern-payoff. The prose is clear and grammatically clean, but density suffers from synonym churn ("decryption," "unknot," "translate") and near-redundant passages (the coral fragment is described reverently multiple times without new information). Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally mixed: "lotus-hearted ache" is elegant yet abstract. Apply −0.9 for template cadence and paraphrase loops (does not touch closure directly but pervades the middle third).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—translator decrypts smudged cast notes to help a sleeping child process grief—offers a specific synthesis of occupation and object. However, the emotional arc (patient caregiver performing quiet ritual) and the atrium-at-twilight frame feel familiar, and the piece does not transform the material through bold risk or fresh inflection. The coral fragment and the smudged notes provide concrete anchors, but the story could work largely unchanged with different proper nouns (a librarian, a letter, a garden). The ending's conceptual repricing is elegant but anticipated by the setup, and the lack of on-page complication or surprise keeps the piece in the middle band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kaelen (pacific conflict-zone translator) is present throughout and his occupation frames his perceptual filter and mission. Setup clear; development involves his handling of the coral and cast notes; closure participation is gestural (placing the coral back in Lina's palm). However, his translator identity does not constrain a choice under pressure—he observes and comforts without on-page decision-making friction. The trait is more credential than engine. Causal pressure is low; closure linkage is present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The brain coral fragment is touched in three distinct beats: Lina clutches it when nervous (setup); it lies between them and Kaelen traces its grooves (middle); he places it back in her palm at the end (closure). The object's "labyrinthine grooves" and symbolic weight (gift from father) are established early. Development is functional—Kaelen traces it reverently—but the coral does not enable or constrain a choice; it serves as anchor and motif. Closure linkage is strong (final gesture), but cost is atmospheric rather than tied to the coral's specific properties. All three gates passed, but causal pressure and irreplaceability remain mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Shared anxieties" is mentioned twice (Pacific conflict zones, "shared anxieties of those who lose loved ones to war," and "shared anxieties of conflict and loss"), but it operates as thematic label rather than on-page stake. The piece explores Kaelen's empathy and Lina's grief, yet "shared" does not create a decision point or tighten options—Lina is asleep. Setup is present as theme; development and closure are ornamental. Swappability is high; "grief" or "loss" would function identically with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears twice as a label describing Kaelen's demeanor ("carved this shrewdly innocent quality into his features that children instinctively trusted" and "left him with this shrewdly innocent way of seeing the world"). It explains why children trust him but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute is told rather than shown through contradictory choices. No development beat or closure participation beyond description.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unknot" recurs four times (unknot fears through touch, unknot tangled threads of stories, unknotting the truth, unknot the small brave heart). Setup is clear and the metaphor ties to Kaelen's mission and the coral's grooves. Middle beats involve his reading of the smudged cast notes and decryption. Closure participation is thematic (final paragraph: "helped unknot the small, brave heart"). However, the action is metaphorical and does not drive a physical or decision-based turn; it is swappable with "translate" or "decipher" without structural loss. Two gates (setup, closure), but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"By decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast" is the stated method. Setup occurs mid-story when Kaelen lifts the casted arm and studies the notes. Development: he reads "I am brave?" and "Daddy always comes..." and interprets the hope behind them. Closure linkage is present—his whispered reassurance ("He will come back") responds to the decrypted text. However, the mechanics are summary rather than enacted scene-by-scene; the decryption itself does not shape attempts or face obstacles. Two gates (setup, closure), but the method is more frame than engine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is signaled in the opening line and returns in multiple beats (damp bench, tropical plants, fading light through glass ceiling, gathering dusk/shadows). Setup is immediate; development involves the environment's mood (mist, twilight) supporting the tone. Closure participation: "As the last light faded" frames the final gesture. However, the atrium does not constrain choice or supply resources—it is backdrop rather than participant. Lyric reprise reweights atmosphere but not tactics. Two gates (setup, closure); causal pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the anesthetic kicks in" is mentioned in the third paragraph ("an hour after being administered"); Lina is asleep throughout. The timeframe sets initial conditions but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. No development beat or escalation tied to time. Closure does not reference the anesthetic wearing off or a temporal constraint. Single gate (setup); no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated explicitly mid-story as Kaelen's mission. Setup is clear. Development: his handling of the coral and decryption of the cast notes enact the mission. Closure participation: "another small graft onto the old wounds of war" and the gesture of returning the coral. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; Kaelen proceeds without friction or cost. Three gates passed, but friction between wants and costs is absent—Kaelen's desire is coherent and uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" appears once as a description: "There was a lotus-hearted ache to this work, this decryption of a child's private language of loss, beautiful yet painful." The phrase captures the bittersweet tone, and the prose sustains melancholy reverence through imagery (mist, fading light, weeping plants) and diction. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly with the fading twilight. However, the phrase itself is ornamental—a single authorial assertion rather than an engine. The tone charges the final image but is not indispensable; "tender grief" or similar would function equivalently. Setup mid-story, closure linkage atmospheric.</comment>
