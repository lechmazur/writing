<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eliora's motivation (reforge bond with dead brother) is clear and drives the conjuring scene, but her interior life relies heavily on stock phrasing: "tremor in her heart," "transforming herself with each motion," and "heart full of understanding." The metamorphosis is described through label-only changes ("eyes changed first, becoming pools of night sky") without embodied sensation or cost that would make the transformation feel like a genuine struggle. The brother's specter delivers on-the-nose dialogue ("love transcends form") that feels more like thematic summary than lived exchange, and the final return to "herself again" undercuts any lasting consequence of her sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: spice ritual builds density toward brother's manifestation, then fades at dawn. Orientation anchors adequately (beast whisperer, fairy-tale orchard, after phoenix rises). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Eliora accepts mortality yet retains the bond's understanding. However, the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized—"transformed yet fundamentally unchanged" directly contradicts the prior metamorphosis without showing what she actually lost or retained. The brother's appearance and advice arrive without friction or reversal, flattening the peak beat into a comfort sequence rather than a tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard under eternal moonlight is evocative and anchors early. Sensory details (moon-pepper, whispering cinnamon, visible glyphs) contribute texture, and the circle/mist staging is spatially coherent. However, the environment remains decorative: no choice hinges on orchard layout, and the "flowers bloomed brighter" response to the brother's name is ornamental rather than a constraint or resource. The spices enable the conjure but their mechanics (how scent forms glyphs, why roots in soil matter) are not grounded in tactile cause-effect that would elevate setting to active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (see brother once more) is signaled early and pursued throughout. The ritual sequence provides a single escalation beat (mixing spices → metamorphosis → conjure), but no reversal or complication tests commitment: the summoning succeeds on first attempt without cost paid during the attempt itself. The brother's advice ("you must be the one to walk through them now") gestures toward future stakes but does not alter on-page options. Pressure is linear accumulation rather than tightening, and the "connection began to fade" at zenith feels time-driven rather than choice-driven, reducing agency at the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (love transcends death/form) emerges from the conjure premise but is over-stated in dialogue ("love transcends form") and narration ("bond unbreakably forged"). The fortune cookie motif seeds the concept but becomes explanatory rather than resonant ("The fortune from the cookie had led her true"). The final image of Eliora "transformed yet fundamentally unchanged" aims for paradox but reads as hedging, undercutting the metamorphosis's thematic weight. Subtext is thin; the brother's specter delivers thesis statements instead of implication, and the piece closes with comfort rather than lingering complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Eliora with adequate distance control. Diction carries some fairy-tale elevation ("cosmic intimacy," "cosmic moment") that fits the orchard setting, though "mortal coil" and "perfume possibility" veer into stock poetic register. Dialogue is minimal and functional but lacks subtext: the brother's lines ("You carried my absence too long") are grammatically polished and thematically on-point rather than voice-distinct or evasive. Perceptual signature is generic (she traces bark, draws pouches) without character-specific filtering. No head-hopping or tense drift, but the voice does not modulate under metamorphosis stress—syntax remains even throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate, but multiple artifact patterns appear. Paraphrase loops: "no longer just Eliora, no longer just a beast whisperer, but a bridge between worlds" recycles structure; "Not quite solid, not quite ghost" is a stock formulation. Template cadence: "Her eyes changed first... her feet grew roots... the transformation completed" uses repetitive stems without pattern-taught payoff. Filter-verb stack in peak beat: "she was no longer... she called... mist began to rise... it was the echo." Mixed metaphor: "drinking moonlight like water" (roots drink, but moonlight as water is a mismatch). Purple density in high-pressure beats ("cosmic intimacy," "perfume possibility," "cosmic moment") without earned specificity. Applying artifact penalties: paraphrase −0.2, template cadence −0.4, filter stack −0.5, mixed metaphor −0.3, register drift −0.3 = baseline ~−1.7 in Q7. Since artifacts appear throughout including closure third, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise (beast whisperer uses spice ritual to summon dead brother) is competent but not fresh: combines familiar grief-magic and liminal-space tropes without a transformative angle. The fortune cookie and phoenix framing devices feel decorative rather than integrated into causality. Emotional arc (longing → brief reunion → acceptance) follows a well-trod template. The "paradoxically steady" attribute and "cosmic intimacy" tone aim for lyric distinctness but rely on elevated diction rather than specific, grounded choices. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the transformation test fails (swap names/setting and the emotional beats remain unchanged).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Beast whisperer is the protagonist; she decides to perform the ritual and executes it. However, her beast-whispering ability does not constrain or enable the conjure itself—the spices and metamorphosis do the work. The title trait is setup flavor (animals sense "something more potent") but does not drive a key turn or alter tactics. Present in setup and payoff (she remains "the beast whisperer" at end) but minimal middle development. Mid-functional range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fortune appears in paragraph 4 ("The boundary between life and death bends to the spice of courage") and is referenced at closure ("The fortune from the cookie had led her true"). Two touches across setup and payoff, and it frames the spice-courage link. However, it does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning—Eliora would pursue the ritual regardless. The fortune is explanatory scaffolding rather than a causal lever. Functional but replaceable, fitting 5.0–6.9 low end.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis is central: Eliora fears "becoming less human" yet undergoes eyes-changing, roots-growing transformation to bridge worlds. The transformation is described across multiple beats (setup fear, mid-ritual execution, closure return) and enables the conjure. Cost is stated ("losing part of what made her love") but not dramatized with specific sacrifice. The piece commits to the concept and it shapes the peak action, placing it solidly in 7.0–8.4 lower tier despite the abstract cost presentation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Paradoxically steady appears once in setup ("her fingers paradoxically steady despite the tremor in her heart"). The trait is label-only and does not constrain or enable an on-page action—no choice hinges on steadiness vs. tremor. No reprise or cost. Present but ornamental, fitting 3.0–4.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Conjure is the climactic action: Eliora's spice-scented breath forms glyphs, she calls her brother's name, mist rises, and the specter appears. The action drives the peak beat and closure conversation. Setup (motivation to conjure) and payoff (brother's manifestation and advice) are clear. The conjure itself succeeds without complication, which limits irreplaceability (other summoning methods could substitute), but it is causally essential to the ending. Solid 7.0–8.4 range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rare spices are introduced early (star anise, moon-pepper, whispering cinnamon) and their scent is the stated method ("via the scent of rare spices"). The mixing and inhaling are described mid-scene, and "spice-scented breath forming visible glyphs" executes the conjure. Three beats: setup (pouches drawn), development (mixing/inhaling completes transformation), payoff (breath forms glyphs that summon brother). The mechanics matter—removal would break the conjure logic—but the how (why scent creates glyphs, why these spices) is not explored, limiting irreplaceability. Fits 7.0–8.4 low end.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight is established early and provides spatial anchor and tone. The orchard is where "wild things gathered at her whispered call" and the ritual occurs. However, the setting is atmospheric rather than causal: no choice depends on orchard layout, and moonlight functions as lighting rather than resource or constraint. The flowers blooming brighter in response to the brother's name is ornamental. Present across all three gates but functional-replaceable, fitting mid-5.0–6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the phoenix rises" is mentioned in setup ("Three nights had passed since the phoenix rose") and implied to open new possibilities ("whispers spoke of gateways opening"). The phoenix event is backstory context, not a live ticking clock. "Tonight" frames the ritual attempt, and "morning's light" marks closure, but no urgency or deadline tightens tactics. Setup present, weak development (no mid-scene time pressure), mild payoff (dawn arrival). Functional but replaceable, fitting lower 3.0–4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Motivation to reforge bond beyond death is stated early ("Her motivation - to reforge a bond beyond death"), dramatized in the ritual (calling brother's name, pouring love across divide), and resolved at closure ("bond unbreakably forged would sustain her"). Three gates clearly met. However, the desire is pursued without conflicting cost on the page—no friction between wanting reunion and fearing metamorphosis consequences is dramatized as a choice. The motivation drives all beats and is indispensable, but the lack of visible tradeoff keeps it from higher bands. Solid 7.0–8.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cosmic intimacy is invoked in setup ("cosmic dust," "cosmic moment," "cosmic intimacy") and closure ("bond unbreakably forged"). The tone is elevated and lyric throughout, coherent but static—no modulation under pressure (the diction remains uniformly poetic even during transformation). The tone charges the final image with intended resonance, but the repetition of "cosmic" feels assertive rather than earned through rhythm or imagery. Present across beats, purposeful, but one-note execution fits mid-5.0–6.9.</comment>
