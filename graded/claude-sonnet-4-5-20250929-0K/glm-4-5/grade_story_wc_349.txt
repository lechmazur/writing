<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vendor remains a cipher throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses in scene, only abstract observations about moonlight and narrative fragments. The stated motivation ("to find the place where stories begin") never faces dramatized friction or cost; the final "understanding" arrives as pure epiphany without prior struggle. Interior life consists of declarative statements rather than character-particular perception under pressure. The "clean slate" customer at the end exists only to illustrate resolution, not to create relational crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words (who is this vendor? why confined? what does parole mean here?) without teaching a pattern that pays off, triggering −0.4. The closure unit—vendor "finally understood that their long search had ended"—arrives as pure realization with no visible cost or foreclosed path on the page; the "profound peace" replaces pressure rather than emerging from it. The piece drifts in accumulative-textural mode but never tightens or deepens under that lens; we cycle through static descriptions of moonlight, shards, and glass trees without escalation. Drive lens remains ambiguous (causal? lyric?) past midpoint and at closure, warranting additional −0.3 penalty and cross-category caps per rubric.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library atop clouds is vivid and sustained, with specific recurring objects (bottled moonlight phases, memory shards, glass birds). However, spatial choreography floats: the vendor moves between shelves, counter, central tree, and floor without coherent blocking. The final door "pressed together" from shards offers a micro-setting constraint that charges the ending image, lifting the score above mid-band despite the earlier drift. "Floating library shifted" reminds us of the cloud-sea but does not alter a tactic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("find the place where stories begin") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or narrowed by choice. No reversal or tightening occurs; the vendor selects shards, traces patterns, and gathers moonlight fragments without resistance, cost, or trade-off. The customer's arrival feels decorative rather than earned by the vendor's agency. "Glimmering parole" conditions (nightly renewal, no harming completed stories) are declared but never constrain an on-page decision. Pressure remains static across all beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—stories arise from absence and the unspoken—emerges through recurring images (bottled moonlight, memory shards, blank slate) rather than direct statement, which is a strength. The closing insight ("not where stories commence, but rather where they become possible") borders on platitude and arrives without dramatic cost. "Quantifying absence" and "mindfully scattered" repeat as prompt-like labels without thematic friction. The final image of the door and arriving customer offers modest resonance but does not reweight prior material with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans heavily on abstract diction ("glimmering parole," "narrative possibilities," "profound peace") that floats above embodied detail. Sentence rhythm and syntax are controlled, with purposeful variation in length. However, elevated register ("quantifying absence in the human heart," "mythical place") clashes with the vendor's undefined experiential base. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Psychic distance stays consistent but lacks the texture of mind-under-pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence recurs across multiple beats: "The vendor [verb]… The vendor [verb]… The vendor [verb]" in adjacent paragraphs, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loops appear ("stories could not be rushed," then "stories began not in some mythical place" restates the search theme without added pressure). Stock metaphor strings—"crystalline fruits that pulsed with captured narratives," "essence of all tales"—cluster in the opening third without grounding in concrete action. Mixed vehicle: moonlight is both "harvested" and "bottled," then "humming," without coherent physical logic. These artifacts touch multiple beats but not the closure sentence, so penalty remains in Q7 only. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise (vendor in floating library selling bottled moonlight during parole) is imaginative but closely matches portal-fantasy and metaphysical-shop templates common in prompt-driven fiction. Transformation through lived detail is minimal: we learn neither how confinement changed the vendor nor why "fragmenting tales" mattered. The Ancient Archivist, century of confinement, and seven-day parole are declared but not integrated into present stakes. "Clean slate" and "stories begin" lean on familiar meta-narrative tropes without a fresh angle. The final door-from-shards moment offers modest ingenuity but does not redefine prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Vendor is present throughout and makes small moves (chooses shards, gathers moonlight, presses elements together to form the door) but none create a key turn or foreclosure. The "understanding" is internal summary, not a choice that alters tactics. Present in setup, middle selection, and ending door-creation (all three gates), but causal pressure is minimal and swappability is high—any proprietor could perform these gestures. Score reflects functional presence across gates without decisive agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears in opening display, "hummed with forgotten promises" mid-story, and the vendor gathers "a sliver of regret from the grey moonlight bottle, a shard of longing from the blue, and a fragment of hope from the clear bottle" to form the door at closure. Three distinct beats with escalating use; the final assembly charges the door image. However, the "quantifying absence in the human heart" method that produced the moonlight is told rather than shown, and the bottles' specific properties (phases, colors) do not constrain earlier choices. Present in all three gates with closure linkage, but causal necessity remains moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Glimmering parole" is introduced early (second sentence) and mentioned twice more ("required nightly renewal," "permitted this small act of creation") but never constrains an on-page choice or shapes tactics. The vendor does not perform the nightly renewal ritual, nor do we see a rule limit tested. It functions as atmospheric backstory rather than active stake. Present in setup, absent from middle development (no choice shaped by parole conditions), and absent from closure (the door-creation is enabled by parole permission but no cost or friction materializes). Missing middle and payoff gates; cap at 2.8 per rubric.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" appears three times as a descriptor for memory fragments and narrative possibilities but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. The vendor does not wrestle with how to arrange shards, nor does "mindful scattering" impose a trade-off. It remains a label without dramatized tradeoff. Present in setup (shelves description), absent from middle development (selection of shards is not governed by scattering logic), absent from closure (door-creation does not depend on scatter-pattern). Missing development and payoff gates; swappable with "carefully arranged" or "deliberately placed." Cap at 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Incise" appears twice: vendor holds a shard "sharp enough to incise the reality around it if wielded properly," then prepares to "incise a welcoming symbol into the air." However, the actual door-creation uses "pressed the shards together" rather than incising, and no earlier beat shows the vendor incising anything on the page. The action is set up and partially shapes the opening ceremony concept, but the major turn (door-formation) does not trace to this verb. Present in setup (shard description), implied in ending preparation (symbol plan), but execution substitutes pressing for incising. Two gates with weak causal linkage; score reflects setup and partial payoff without middle enactment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"By quantifying absence" is declared once as the method taught by the Ancient Archivist for harvesting moonlight. The mechanics are never signaled on the page—no scene shows the vendor measuring, calculating, or otherwise quantifying anything. The method does not shape any attempt or tactic. Present in setup (single tell), absent from middle development and closure. Missing development and payoff gates; purely expository. Cap at 2.8 per rubric, adjusted down for ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Glass orchard library on clouds is vividly described throughout and houses all action, satisfying setup and continuous presence. However, the setting does not pressure choices: the vendor moves freely among shelves, trees, and counter without spatial constraint affecting tactics. "The library trembled slightly as another potential visitor tried to breach… failed, and retreated" suggests a filter but does not alter the vendor's plan. The floating nature and cloud-bound sanctuary are atmospheric rather than causal. Present in all three gates but does not constrain or supply resources that affect outcome; postcard description dominates. Functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"During the lull on the store's very first opening day" frames the entire piece and the vendor's focus ("today's focus was entirely on the store's opening," "almost time to perform the opening ceremony"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—there is no clock pressure, no risk of missing the moment, and the customer arrives "at exactly the right moment" without tension. Present in setup and ending (customer emerges, opening occurs) but does not track or constrain tactics in the middle. Two gates with weak time-based pressure; the "lull" suggests waiting rather than urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To find the place where stories begin" is stated early as the vendor's deepest motivation and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("finally understood that their long search had ended"). The desire bookends the piece but is never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost. The vendor's actions (selecting shards, gathering moonlight) do not clearly pursue this motivation with visible trade-offs. Present in setup and payoff (understanding arrives at closure) but absent from middle development (no on-page struggle to find the place). Two gates with thematic reprise but told-only desire; lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Integrated fragmentation" coheres as a tone: memory shards, scattered fragments, glass leaves, bottled phases, and the final door "pressed together" from pieces enact fragmentation-becoming-integration throughout. The tone is consistent across beats and modulates subtly from passive observation (opening) to active assembly (ending). However, the tone does not charge the final image with additional pressure—it illustrates the concept rather than intensifying it. The modulation is smooth but lacks a decisive tonal shift that reweights the stake. Coherent and purposeful but stops short of charging closure.</comment>
