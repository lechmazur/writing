<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eldon's motivation is declared ("compress eternity") but never dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. His interior remains abstract and label-driven ("desperate longing," "obsession born from years") without embodied contradiction or embodied emotion in the pivotal rupture scene. The "final choice" to touch the floating words carries no visible cost or foreclosed path—he simply accepts transformation without struggle. Agency is purely observational; he watches rather than decides at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks on-page closure with legible cost. Eldon's "ritual" succeeds without dramatized stakes: the library reforms rather than shatters, and he "realizes he had both preserved and destroyed his life's work" in pure summary. No before/after change is legible—he ends where he began, cataloging. The orientation test penalty applies: who/where/when remain hazy past 120 words (cloud sea, glass orchard, "after reality had become negotiable" offers no spatial or temporal anchor). Drive lens is ambiguous: accumulative imagery without escalation, causal language without linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is vividly described with sensory specificity (crystalline branches, transparent walls, dendritic frost patterns). However, it functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint—Eldon's choices are unaffected by spatial detail. The bottled whisper's placement "beside the antique letterpress" does not alter tactics or access. Micro-setting (the vial, the press) appears but does not charge the final image with constraint or resource pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("compress eternity into a single moment") is declared but never tested. No meaningful tightening or reversal occurs: Eldon prepares for seven days without complication, the rupture "occurs" passively ("became unbound"), and he "succeeds" with no visible price paid on the page. The "cost" is asserted in summary ("could no longer contain infinity") but does not foreclose a live option or force a trade-off. Coincidence (the vial's appearance) initiates the plot without protagonist agency driving escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme (preservation vs. transformation, knowledge vs. containment) is declared rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "he had both preserved and destroyed his life's work" and "the beginning of something new" state the thesis without resonant image. The "rustling awakenings" motif is label-only—words lift and float but do not reweight prior material with cost. No epiphany is dramatized; summary replaces scene pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated throughout ("dendritic frost patterns," "negotiable firmament," "composing stick") in a consistent register. However, perceptual signature is generic: Eldon's way of noticing does not distinguish him from the narrator's encyclopedic voice. Lexical choices ("translucently reformed," "manifestation of containment") drift into abstract jargon that reads more like exposition than a character's lived perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The glass orchard library floated silently" / "This architectural marvel had survived" restate setting without advancement. Template cadence runs across beats: "His fingers...trembled" / "The library responded" / "Eldon began preparing" stack without variation. Stock metaphors cluster: "golden leaves in an autumn storm," "morning dew," "rustling with awakenings." The rupture beat—pivotal moment—summarizes rather than dramatizes ("began to crack branch by branch, but rather than shattering, it translucently reformed"). Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("noticed the glass walls beginning to warp," "watched in awe"). Multiple artifacts touch closure (final paragraph summary), triggering cumulative penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core premise (reality negotiable, library of unborn worlds) synthesizes familiar SFF tropes (floating library, bottled artifact, reality shift) with vivid specificity (glass orchard, letterpress, frost patterns). However, the emotional arc is template: lone scholar pursues obsession, succeeds, accepts transformation—unchanged with different proper nouns. The "rustling awakenings" and "compress eternity" remain abstract rather than grounded in lived particulars. One fresh inflection: the library reforms rather than shatters, allowing knowledge to flow—but this arrives in summary without prior constraint that the transformation overcomes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Eldon is present throughout but makes no key decisions. He studies, discovers, prepares, and watches; agency is purely observational. His final action ("reached out and touched the floating words") does not drive the rupture or alter its outcome. Setup and payoff gates are met (present early and at end), but development gate is missed: no middle choice constrained by his role. Swappable with "cryptic archivist" or similar. Ornamental use triggers cap at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bottled whisper appears early (day of discovery), drives the rupture beat (becomes unbound), and is present conceptually at closure (expansion through chambers). Three beats: discovery, placement beside press, rupture. Causal pressure: its "curious attribute—it destabilizes perfect systems" enables the plot turn. However, Eldon does not handle or use it after placement; it acts autonomously ("became unbound"). Closure linkage is indirect (expansion is off-stage). Specific properties matter (condensed light, vibration) but swappability remains moderate (any destabilizing artifact could substitute with edits). Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Positives: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.5. Frictions: autonomous action (not handled) −0.4, indirect payoff −0.3. Total guidance ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Rustling awakenings is a thematic label mentioned three times: library leaves "rustling with awakenings," books rustle simultaneously, final line "rustling awakenings had only just begun." Does not shape stakes or tactics—Eldon's choices are unchanged by the concept. No causal pressure: the rustling is effect, not cause. Payoff gate met (final line) but setup and development gates missed (not signaled early or constraining middle action). Label-only use −0.3, ornamental mentions −0.5, no causal work −0.8. Cap at 3.4 for missing development gate; frictions lower to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The attribute "destabilizes perfect systems" is stated once ("the bottled whisper possessed a curious attribute") and linked causally to the rupture (glass walls warp, cloud sea churns, rupture occurs). One beat: the destabilization triggers transformation. However, the trait is told rather than shown through choices—Eldon does not wrestle with or manage destabilization; it happens to him. Setup gate met (mid-story signal), payoff gate met (rupture), development gate missed (no middle choice constrained by this trait). Frictions: label-only mention −0.3, summary-only −0.4, no protagonist friction −0.5. Cap at 3.4 for missing development; frictions lower to 4.3 within wiggle room for causal link.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The rupture occurs on-page ("the rupture occurred not with explosion but with implosion") and drives the climax: whisper unbinds, books rustle, words lift, eternity compresses. Two beats: rupture initiation and its immediate effects. However, the rupture is passive (subject-less "occurred," whisper "became unbound") rather than driven by protagonist action. Swappable with "breach" or "collapse" with minor edits. Gates: setup ✓ (foreshadowed via destabilization), development ✓ (rupture is the turn), payoff ✓ (shapes ending transformation). Positives: two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0. Frictions: passive construction −0.6, swappability −0.4. Guidance ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Patterns in morning frost appear twice: Eldon studies them each morning to decipher time's echoes, and he sees "the beginning of something new" in frost on remaining branches in the final paragraph. Setup gate met (early signal), payoff gate met (final image), development gate missed (frost does not constrain or enable middle action—he uses the letterpress and vial, not frost, to compress eternity). Lyric reprise without mid-use. Positives: early signal +0.5, payoff +0.7, lyric reprise +0.3. Frictions: no middle beat −0.6, ornamental final mention −0.3, swappability (any divinatory method) −0.4. Guidance ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass orchard library is present throughout, described vividly, and undergoes transformation (cracks, reforms). Three beats: floating sanctuary, containment system, transformation at closure. However, it does not constrain Eldon's choices—spatial access, proximity, or resources do not shape tactics. The library's "perfect system of containment" is stated but not tested as a limit. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓ (site of action), payoff ✓ (transforms). Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0. Frictions: postcard description without choice constraint −0.8, stated rather than tested limit −0.5. Guidance ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After reality had become negotiable" is the lone temporal anchor, appearing in the opening line. It establishes tone and world-state but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. The seven-day preparation is mentioned without urgency or deadline pressure. No live clock alters moves. Setup gate met (opening line), development and payoff gates missed (no time constraint shapes middle or ending choices). Positives: early signal +0.4, world-state framing +0.3. Frictions: vague (no ticking pressure) −0.7, no middle or closure use −0.6, ornamental −0.4. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup of urgency; frictions lower to 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Eldon's motivation "to compress eternity into a single moment" is declared early and referenced at closure ("he had succeeded in his quest"). Two beats: stated obsession, claimed success. However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction between want and cost. He prepares without obstacle, succeeds without sacrifice, and accepts transformation without struggle. Gates: setup ✓, development ✗ (no middle choice tests the desire), payoff ✓ (closure references it). Positives: early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8. Frictions: told-only −0.8, no friction −0.7, summary success −0.5. Cap at 4.6 for missing development; frictions compound to 5.1 with closure mention.</comment>
