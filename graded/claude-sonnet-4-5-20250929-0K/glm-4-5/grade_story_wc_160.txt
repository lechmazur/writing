<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to harmonize values is declared but her interiority remains abstract—"tremulous confidence," "dappled resolve"—rather than embodied contradiction. The adhesive analysis and chain handling are gestures toward engineering detail, but no micro-choice under pressure reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The grandfather's chain functions as talisman rather than forcing a trade-off. Embodied emotion and character-particular thought are replaced by label-only affect.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early enough, so no Orientation Test penalty applies. The closure—Elara walks toward the entrance with her solution—reads as summary rather than on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the "encrypted compassion" discovery and seasonal-lake design are recounted discoveries, not dramatized reversals that narrow options. The lens drifts between accumulative (breathing building, layered images) and causal (adhesive analysis leads to insight), never teaching or holding a pattern through closure. No visible cost forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crumbling amphitheater inside a dormant volcano is vividly anchored with sensory specificity (moss-covered stone, dappled light, volcanic dust). The breathing rhythm recurs but remains atmospheric rather than constraining a choice or charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent and the setting supplies the inscription that enables the solution, lifting the score into functional territory, but the environment does not pressure tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harmonize conflicting values—is signaled early but never tightened through on-page reversals or forced trade-offs. Elara's "discovery" of the inscription and adhesive analysis are conveniences that solve the problem without her agency or cost; the solution arrives via research rather than a choice that forecloses an option. No meaningful escalation under any lens; the breathing building and trembling hands are static texture rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of balance between progress and preservation emerges clearly from the premise and recurs in the inscription discovery. However, "encrypted compassion" is asserted rather than dramatized through particulars, and the final image—walking toward the entrance with the chain as talisman—offers resolution without reweighting prior material or non-literal cost. The seasonal-lake solution is tidy rather than resonant, and the "slyly heartfelt" and "dappled resolve" phrases veer toward meta-commentary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans on stock engineer-heroine phrasing ("ingenious machinist," "practiced eyes"), and diction drifts into elevated register ("mystical embrace," "divining rod of innovation") that clashes with functional engineering voice. Psychic distance is consistent but the narrator's texture lacks specificity. Filter verbs are present but not excessive; no dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "trembled"/"tremble"/"tremulous" across multiple beats; "breathed"/"breathing" recycled without fresh charge; "dappled" forced into "dappled resolve" and "dappled light." Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" and "Her [noun]" dominate sentence openings. Stock metaphors ("divining rod of innovation," "encrypted compassion") and therapy-speak ("emotional flatlining" is avoided, but "slyly heartfelt" reads label-only). Artifacts cluster in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and applying −1.2 in Q7 for spread and closure proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—engineer finds ancient solution in a breathing amphitheater—is functional but leans on template plot: discovered inscription + adhesive analysis + seasonal-lake hybrid. "Encrypted compassion" and "slyly heartfelt" read as prompt-label insertions rather than organic synthesis. The seasonal-lake solution is clever but arrives via convenience (inscription, adhesive clue) rather than transformation through character choice. Specificity is present in the floodgate/surveyor tools, but the arc is predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her profession frames the premise, but her "ingenious" trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through on-page problem-solving under pressure. The adhesive analysis is recounted; the seasonal-lake design is summarized. No key turn results from a floodgate-machinist choice that could not have been made by a generic engineer. Swappable with "brilliant architect" or "resourceful historian" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The antique surveyor's chain appears in beats one (clutched, gleaming), two (dropped while kneeling), and three (draped as talisman at exit). Its grandfather lineage is noted but the chain does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it functions as symbolic inheritance rather than tool. The final reprise ("centerpiece of her presentation") is told, not shown. Present across structure but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" is named twice—once as Elara's whispered realization, once in the penultimate paragraph—but remains abstract. The adhesive trace "suggesting someone else had fought for balance" is the closest on-page mechanic, yet it does not narrow options or change tactics; it confirms rather than complicates. The concept echoes theme without shaping stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears twice: Elara's message to the council (told, not shown) and her pride in the solution (summary). No on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. The attribute is label-only, not embodied in speech, gesture, or decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Tremble" recurs across four beats: fingers tremble measuring angles, tremors through hands at the adhesive discovery, hands tremble with excitement, hands "still trembled slightly" at the end. The action marks emotional states but does not drive a turn; removing it would weaken texture but not break causality. Mid-band for presence and recurrence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The method—analyzing leftover adhesive with specialized solvent to determine age and origin—is introduced mid-story and executed in summary ("trace elements matching a local botanical preserve"). The technique is recounted rather than shown on the page, and it delivers a clue rather than forcing a tactical choice. Present and functional but late (second third) and ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crumbling amphitheater inside a dormant volcano anchors the entire story and supplies the inscription that enables the solution. The "breathing" rhythm recurs and the environment's dual nature (historical treasure vs. reservoir site) frames the conflict. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's tactics or force a spatial choice; it provides rather than pressures. Strong setup and closure linkage lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" recurs as atmospheric texture but does not function as a ticking clock. The "tomorrow" debate is mentioned but does not tighten decisions on the page. Time remains vague and untracked; no urgency forces Elara to choose between incomplete data and a deadline. Present in the title frame but not leveraged for pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to harmonize conflicting values is declared early, frames the conflict (flood vs. preserve), and shapes the seasonal-lake solution at closure. However, it is told rather than dramatized through a choice with visible cost—Elara's "discovery" of the inscription solves the dilemma without forcing her to sacrifice one value for the other. Strong setup and closure participation, but no friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears twice (final third), and "dappled light" once (early). The tone reads as imposed label rather than modulating texture—resolve remains steady rather than tested. The phrase does not charge the final image or shift under pressure. Late introduction and ornamental use.</comment>
