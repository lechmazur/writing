<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The surveyor's motivation is declared but never tested by genuine conflict on the page—he wants to "become the archeologist of abandoned dreams," yet no choice forces him to weigh that desire against cost. Interior life defaults to poetic abstraction ("stoically sensitive," "interlaced absence") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The metal-box discovery offers a potential turn, but his reaction is curiously frictionless; he simply adds another note without visible stakes or renunciation. No meaningful change or credible endurance with felt cost emerges by the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is serviceable (who/where/when anchor by paragraph two), and the drive lens reads accumulative-textural. However, closure lacks decisive cost: the surveyor retrieves a box, reads memories, adds his own note, and departs—a sequence that deepens mood but does not reconfigure options or meaning with undeniable pressure. The final image ("hushed blaze of countless dreams") restates the premise rather than repricing it. No visible forfeiture or Charged Poise crystallizes; the ending feels like a pause in an ongoing routine rather than a closure unit with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered (marble pillars as "silent sentinels," waterlogged timbers) and the antique inkwell recurs across beats, anchoring the surveyor's ritual. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the drawbridge's function (rising "at sunset each day" yet also "after...each day" and "tomorrow") introduces minor temporal ambiguity. The cold water plunge and foundation stones do constrain one action (wrestling the box free), giving the setting mild participatory weight, but it does not decisively shape the final choice or charge the closure image with new meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting the pavilion and excavating emotional history—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through opposition. The box retrieval is the lone reversal candidate, yet it yields cooperative memories rather than a dilemma or trade-off. No persistent constraint (time, resource, rival claim) forces the protagonist to alter tactics, and the ending recapitulates his opening intent without escalation. Pressure remains static, and closure cost is imperceptible: he adds a note and leaves, exactly as he arrived, with no path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (dreams, loss, remembrance as measurement) emerges through concrete images—preservation cubes, notes in mortar, the submerged pavilion's transformation at sunset. The question "whether dreams could be measured in the same increments as shifting shores" is earnest but borders on stating the premise rather than dramatizing its cost. The ending offers lyric resonance (the "archeologist of abandoned dreams" frame returns) yet stops short of a non-literal answer or conceptual repricing; the surveyor's stance is unchanged, so the thematic payoff feels more echo than reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, and the formal register ("stoically sensitive," "interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") creates a consistent, elevated narrative voice. However, the diction leans toward abstract lyricism ("archeologist of abandoned dreams," "spaces between moments") that occasionally floats above embodied perception. Micro-movements are clear but sometimes over-narrated ("adjusted his glasses," "shouldering his bag"). No dialogue is present. The voice is coherent and legible, though it risks museum-tour distance when listing the surveyor's archive work rather than inhabiting his sensory present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and clarity is generally high. Figurative language ("silent sentinels," "hushed blaze") recurs but does not overwhelm individual beats. Minor scaffold issues: "The firm shore surveyor" opens three sentences, and "antique traveling inkwell" appears four times with identical phrasing, trending toward synonym avoidance rather than true variation. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the final third restates the "archeologist of abandoned dreams" frame twice within three sentences, slightly dulling momentum. Information density is solid; propulsion is moderate, with no major opacity touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—surveyor as emotional archeologist at a submerged pavilion—offers a fresh synthesis of occupation and metaphor. The antique inkwell and preservation cubes are concrete, period-appropriate details. However, the emotional arc is linear and predictable: he documents, retrieves, reflects, departs, promising to return—a contemplative loop rather than a transformation. The "stoically sensitive" label and "interlaced absence" concept read more like prompt echoes than lived particulars that surprise in hindsight. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material beyond its competent execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The surveyor is present throughout, but his choices are procedural (kneel, draw, plunge, open box, write note, leave) rather than dilemma-driven. No beat forces him to weigh competing desires or alter tactics under pressure. He observes and documents; the story happens around him, not because of contested decisions. Present in setup, middle action, and ending, but agency is passive—closer to witness than driver.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The antique traveling inkwell appears in four beats: opening (reflecting light), mid-story (used for drawing), closing ("sealed against dampness," "closed with a satisfying click"), and final packing. It anchors the surveyor's ritual and recurs with consistent texture. However, it does not constrain a choice or shift meaning at closure—it is a faithful tool rather than a charged object. Solid recurrence and atmospheric weight, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is named twice and glossed as "the spaces between what had been and what now remained." It colors the thematic mood but does not alter on-page tactics or stakes. The surveyor seeks to document absence, yet no scene tests whether that pursuit costs him something tangible or forces a trade-off. Present as lyric theme; absent as causal lever or choice constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is declared once as a character label ("a contradiction that made him exceptionally good at his work") and echoed in the final third ("his stoically sensitive nature allowed the silence...to speak"). No on-page action demonstrates this trait under pressure—no moment where stoicism costs him connection or sensitivity overrides detachment. Label-only presence without dramatized trade-off or enabling constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once: "He would have to wrest it free if he hoped to understand the building's story truly." The action (plunging into chill water, fighting nature's grip, yielding the metal box) is the story's lone physical struggle and turns the middle beat from documentation to recovery. Removing this action would collapse the discovery arc. It does not, however, reconfigure the ending or impose a lasting cost; the box yields cooperative memories, and the surveyor proceeds unaltered. Essential to one key turn; modest closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The method is seeded early ("His usual method of placing notes in foundation repairs had already filled dozens of such capsules") and executed twice on the page (evening note, final morning repair). It frames the surveyor's ongoing project and ties to the preservation-cube discovery. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than shown in action, and the method does not constrain a choice or solve a problem it helped create. Present across beats; limited causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is the sole location, richly detailed (marble pillars, foundation stones, waterlogged timbers) and present in setup, middle action (the plunge between stones), and ending (sunset transformation, final look). It supplies the box and resists the surveyor's effort, shaping one key physical beat. The evening transformation charges the final image with "hushed blaze" atmosphere. Solid spatial pressure and closure participation, though the setting does not force a tactical choice or dilemma beyond the single retrieval.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is mentioned in setup ("after the drawbridge rose at sunset each day, the pavilion became his solitary sanctuary") and closing ("after the drawbridge rises again, he would return"). The passage of one evening is tracked (afternoon → sunset → stars), providing temporal scaffolding. However, the drawbridge does not tighten decisions or impose a live deadline; the surveyor works at leisure. Present and coherent, but no clock pressure that alters moves or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation is declared early ("he sought to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams") and echoed at closure ("he had found his calling...the archeologist of abandoned dreams"). It frames his work and colors his reflections. Yet it is never dramatized through friction—no moment where the desire to preserve dreams costs him rest, safety, or competing priorities. The story tells us this is his drive; the plot does not test or complicate it. Thematic presence without on-page conflict or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" appears twice: describing the sunset transformation mid-story and the final image ("carrying with him the hushed blaze of countless dreams"). The tone—quiet grandeur, elegiac beauty—is coherent throughout and modulates gently with the evening's progression. The phrase charges the closing image with lyric weight. However, the tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure; no peak moment intensifies or disrupts the meditative register. Purposeful reprise with moderate closure charge; limited dynamic range.</comment>
