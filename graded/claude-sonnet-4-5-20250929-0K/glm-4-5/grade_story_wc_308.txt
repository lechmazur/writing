<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation remains abstract and label-driven throughout. Interior experience consists largely of therapy-speak ("his very soul intertwined with the canyon's endless history") and stock mystic declarations rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The "centuries-old quest" creates impossible biographical coherence—no degradation, no aging cost, no genuine struggle. The final disappearance arrives without earned transformation or visible forfeit; we're told he "came home" but shown no decisive choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but never coheres into a meaningful tightening or cost. Orientation is delayed: "harmonic stone skimmer" appears first as unexplained role, "Kael" arrives mid-paragraph, and "canyon" setting lacks anchor coordinates until paragraph two; apply Orientation Test penalty −0.4. The arrowhead's "purpose" and the crows' guidance offer no genuine reversal—Kael simply walks to a depression and places the stone, which then pulses. No visible cost, no foreclosed option, no Resonant Reconfiguration; the ending summary ("Kael was gone") tells closure instead of landing it on the page. Closure failure; cap high bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon setting provide vivid initial anchoring and the arrowhead returns at closure, satisfying minimal constraint. However, spatial choreography remains vague—how far is the "deepest recess," what does the depression look like, how do the towers relate to Kael's position? The environment never forces a tactical choice; it serves as backdrop for mystical atmosphere. The arrowhead's placement in the circular depression offers one moment where setting detail (the "humming" match) matters to outcome, lifting the score modestly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is declared but never tested. Kael faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and encounters no friction; the crows guide him, the arrowhead pulses on cue, and revelation arrives without sacrifice. The single tightening moment (following the crows to the depression) lacks agency—Kael observes and complies rather than choosing between competing goods. No visible cost at closure, no path foreclosed, no escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of "movement within stillness" is overtly stated in the penultimate paragraph rather than emerging from scene particulars. The arrowhead and stone circle recur but without charging the final image with fresh meaning—each mention reiterates the same mystical pulse. The ending moralizes directly: "standing still could be the most dynamic journey of all." No earned wisdom from on-page struggle; thematic echo in the final paragraphs lowers the score substantially. −0.6 for explicit theme statement replacing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, but the narrative voice converges with prompt language: "harmonic stone skimmer," "pulse left wandering," "weathered resolve" feel like labels imported wholesale rather than idiomatic to Kael's perception. Diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("dimensional spaces," "ritual as old as the stars") that clash with embodied experience. Register is uniformly ornate without modulation under pressure. Filter verbs cluster in mid-story beats ("seemed to lean closer," "felt complete") dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openers across paragraphs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "historically reverent in ways few could comprehend, his very soul intertwined" restates the same mystical authority without added detail. Synonym churn appears in adjacent sentences—"pulse," "vibration," "resonance" cycle without functional distinction. Template cadence runs: four consecutive paragraphs open with "The [abstract noun]" or "Kael [verb]." Figurative language stacks without coherence: dust "bearing memories," air "shimmer with anticipation," shadows "danced where ancestors walked." Apply −1.2 in Q7 for pervasive loops, cadence artifacts, and metaphor density that obscures rather than sharpens. Line-level debt disallows 9+ globally and caps Q6 at 7.6 per cross-caps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—mystic seeker finds artifact in ancient canyon—follows familiar template without transformation. "Stone skimmer" and "harmonic pulse" offer surface novelty but function as interchangeable mystical props. The crows-as-guidance, the circular depression, the final disappearance all echo quest-fantasy beats without fresh inflection. No lived detail grounds the world logic; "centuries of layered dust" and "bone towers" remain generic everywhere/nowhere anchors. Emotional arc is absent; Kael's "weathered resolve" never wavers or costs him anything. Derivative premise without specific synthesis; apply −0.8 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes one key decision—following the crows—but this choice lacks friction or cost. He observes, walks, and places the arrowhead; each beat is compliant rather than transformative. The character's role is setup and middle participation without closure-driving agency (he "was gone" is summary). Functional but replaceable; another seeker could perform identical moves. Eligible up to ~6.0 via two-gate model (setup, development), but low causal pressure and no closure decision cap near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The arrowhead appears early (paragraph 3), drives Kael's search in middle beats (its pulse guides him), and is placed in the depression at closure, triggering the final pulse. Three-gate fulfillment with beat involvement across the arc. However, its "geometric perfection" and "vibration" remain abstract; no specific property constrains choice or imposes cost. The arrowhead could be any mystical key without altering the plot. Causal linkage present but specificity and irreplaceability are weak; score in lower 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"A pulse left wandering" is invoked as label and theme (paragraph 4, paragraph 19) but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. Kael does not search for the pulse, combat it, or sacrifice to satisfy it; the concept decorates the mystical atmosphere without altering his options. Ornamental use without causal pressure; present but not functional. Setup and thematic reprise without middle development or closure linkage; score low within present-but-ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" is stated in paragraph 2 as backstory summary ("becoming historically reverent in ways few could comprehend") but never constrains an on-page action or imposes visible cost. Kael's reverence does not prevent him from moving artifacts, does not slow his choices, and does not create friction with his goal. Label-only attribute; no tradeoff demonstrated. Present in setup only, no development or closure linkage; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears explicitly in paragraph 9 ("he must appraise the arrowhead's purpose through the patterns in a flock of birds") and drives the middle sequence: Kael watches the crows, interprets their arrow formation, and follows their guidance to the depression. The action is signaled, executed, and leads to the key discovery. However, the appraisal itself is passive observation rather than analysis under pressure, and the crows' answer is immediate and unambiguous—no cost, no alternative readings. Two-gate (setup, development) plus beat involvement; causal role in one major turn earns lower 5-band, but replaceable method and lack of closure struggle prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The "patterns in a flock of birds in flight" are signaled in paragraph 9, executed in paragraphs 10–13 (crows form arrow, descend, create wing patterns), and shape the middle turn by directing Kael to the canyon's heart. The method is specific and drives one key beat. However, the crows' guidance is frictionless—no ambiguity, no competing patterns, no cost to interpretation—and they do not return at closure. Two-gate (setup, development) with one beat of causal involvement; functional but not indispensable. Mid-5-band for purposeful use without closure linkage or escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes" anchor the opening image, frame the spatial context throughout (shadows, echoes, bone surfaces reflecting light), and supply the circular depression where closure occurs. Three-gate fulfillment. The setting provides the discovery site but does not constrain Kael's choices—he walks freely, the environment cooperates. Spatial choreography remains vague (distances, access paths unclear). Essential location for the plot's discovery but lacks tactical pressure or micro-constraint; score lower 6-band for presence across beats without dynamic use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" is invoked as atmosphere (paragraph 2, paragraph 14) but the timeframe never tightens decisions or imposes urgency. Kael has existed "centuries" yet shows no degradation, no deadline, no clock. The dust is described, not tracked; time remains abstract backdrop. Present in setup and referenced mid-story, but no development or closure consequence. Ornamental timeframe without tactical constraint; low present-but-not-functional score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is declared in paragraph 7 and restated at closure (paragraph 23), framing the quest. The motivation drives Kael's search and his interpretation of the arrowhead's purpose. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Kael pursues it without friction, sacrifice, or renunciation. Two-gate (setup, closure) with thematic linkage but no middle friction or on-page struggle. Told desire without embodied trade-off; functional but not deeply integrated; lower cusp of 5-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is invoked explicitly (paragraphs 11, 24) and the tone remains consistent—solemn, patient, mystically assured—throughout. Syntax and image choice ("whispering," "perpetual twilight," "tears carving clean paths") support the weathered-resolve register. However, the tone is static; no modulation under pressure, no charged shift at closure. The final image ("peaceful acceptance") reinforces rather than complicates the established mood. Coherent and sustained across the arc but lacks dynamic range or closure charge; mid-5-band for stability without escalation.</comment>
