<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is abundant but largely consists of reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist experiences a moment of clarity but her choice to continue the conversation feels declared rather than earned through visible struggle with competing desires. Emotions are labeled ("warmly observant," "newfound resolve") rather than embodied through concrete physical sensation under pressure. The jade cicada functions more as a symbolic touchstone than a constraint that forces difficult micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with adequate orientation (Maya, grotto, present conversation) but the closure unit is problematic: Maya's realization about the "texture of time" and transition periods arrives through extended reflection rather than dramatized pressure, and the cost of her new approach remains abstract. The conversation resumes but we see only the beginning of her response, not a completed change or reconfiguration with visible consequences. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost—it restates the theme. Applying Orientation Test: anchors are present early; no penalty. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Maya gives up or gains at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The grotto is anchored early with stars, tidal pools, and stone walls, providing adequate spatial grounding. Sensory detail is present (jade cicada warmth, star reflections in pools) but largely decorative; the setting does not constrain Maya's choice or force a tactical shift. The pools function thematically (transition metaphor) but do not alter the conversation's stakes or outcome. Micro-setting option: the jade cicada is handled but does not pressure the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Maya's research will continue given funding scarcity—is signaled early but never tightened through on-page pressure. The difficult conversation pauses, Maya reflects, and resumes with "observations about how adaptation in tidal pools...could inform sustainable research models," but this shift is told rather than dramatized with visible trade-offs or resistance from Aris. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the tension is resolved through internal realization without agency cost. Escalation under an Accumulative lens would require a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the beat plateaus into summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme (transition periods, texture of time) is stated repeatedly in near-identical phrasing across multiple paragraphs, creating a thematic echo rather than earned emergence. The final image does not offer a non-literal answer—it restates the premise ("texture of time...woven from uncertainties, pauses, and unexpected transformations"). Thematic statements dominate the closing third, replacing scene pressure. The jade cicada's symbolic meaning (metamorphosis) is explained rather than discovered through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maya with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated philosophical register ("the texture of time," "tangential approach to understanding") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; Maya's noticing does not carry idiosyncratic bias beyond the stated "warmly observant." Dialogue with Aris is minimal and serves only to frame the reflection rather than advancing plot through subtext or goal pursuit. The prose maintains consistency but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—reflection passages and action beats share identical cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops pervade the text: "transition periods" and "texture of time" recur in five separate paragraphs with minimal variation, and the jade cicada's warmth/pulse is restated three times in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence is visible in repeated sentence stems: "The jade cicada [verb]..." appears four times. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "realized") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation. Information density is low; many sentences restate the theme without advancing situation or choice. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: paraphrase loops and template cadence across multiple paragraphs in closure third = baseline −1.2, touching closure = −1.7 total in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core premise—scientist reflects on funding crisis via tidal-pool metaphor—follows a familiar template of professional contemplation without transformation through lived detail. The jade cicada and grotto setting are atmospheric but do not generate fresh causal friction. Maya's insight (transition periods have substance) is philosophically sound but arrives as assertion rather than a non-obvious synthesis earned in hindsight. The "tangential approach" method is named but not demonstrated through contrasting failed attempts. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maya (tidal-pool chronicler) is present throughout and her occupation frames the metaphor, but her choices do not create key turns—she reflects, experiences clarity, and resumes conversation without on-page opposition or tactical shift. The role is functional but largely replaceable; removing "tidal-pool" would not break the story's logic. Setup present; middle development weak (reflection, not decision); closure participation is summary of intent rather than action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The jade cicada appears in multiple beats (Maya touches it during pause, recalls its origin, notes its pulse/glow at closure) but functions as static symbol rather than evolving tool. Its "pulsing" and "glowing" are described but do not constrain Maya's choice or alter her approach. The object could be replaced with any heirloom without structural change. Setup strong; middle beats are ornamental; closure participation is cameo (it "shifted slightly" while Maya speaks) without causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Transition periods shape the thematic stakes (Maya studies ecosystems through tidal-pool transitions; funding scarcity is itself a transition) and her realization that "transition periods...contained their own substance" drives the closure insight. However, the concept does not alter tactics or create on-page friction—it remains a lens for interpretation rather than a force that narrows options. Setup clear; middle development thematic; closure participation is conceptual repricing but cost is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is labeled twice (opening, closing) but never constrains or enables a specific action. Maya's observation of star reflections and pool patterns is described but does not create a trade-off or reveal a blind spot. The trait is ornamental rather than causal. Present but not functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Foresee" appears in two contexts: Maya's lifelong effort to "foresee the patterns of change in these pools" and her moment of clarity that lets her "foresee a new approach to her research." The action is told rather than shown through specific predictions or failed attempts, and it does not redefine options in a dramatized beat. The word could be replaced with "understand" or "envision" with minor edits. Functional but replaceable; no specific cost tied to the act of foreseeing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through tangential approach" is named twice: Maya "found understanding through tangential approach" and later avoided "confronting the time question directly" via this method. The means is stated but not demonstrated—we do not see her attempting a direct inquiry and failing, or succeeding through indirection in a specific beat. The method is asserted at closure ("her conversation with Aris would follow the same principle") but not enacted with visible mechanics. Present; not developed or tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The ancient grotto under stars is anchored early and provides atmospheric grounding (tidal pools, stone walls, star reflections). The setting is present across all beats and contributes thematic resonance (grotto "witnessed countless such transformations") but does not constrain Maya's choice or supply a resource that alters the conversation's outcome. The pools are observed but not interacted with in a way that changes tactics. Setup strong; middle and closure participation decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe (pause in conversation) is signaled early and structures the narrative: conversation → pause → reflection → conversation resumes. The pause allows Maya's realization and creates a natural beat for interior work. However, the clock is not tight—no urgency presses her to speak or decide quickly—and the temporal container does not force a trade-off. The element shapes structure but does not pressure the choice. Present across all three gates with moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Maya's motivation "to discover the texture of time" is stated three times and frames her career-long quest, but it is never dramatized in conflict with a competing desire (e.g., financial security, Aris's approval, immediate practical demands). The motivation is told and explained rather than shown through a choice where one want must yield to another. Setup and thematic closure participation are clear; friction between wants and costs is absent.</comment>
