<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elina's archivist role is clear, but her choices remain largely observational. The trait "reactively visionary" is label-only—visions arrive without cost or constraint on her actions. Emotions are summarized ("anger softening to sorrow") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ending transformation in the returnees' eyes is told, not earned through a pivotal on-page choice by Elina that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as accumulative/textural: fragments compile across staggered intervals toward a communal healing. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the harbor shifts from absences to presence), but the cost is conceptual and diffuse—no single on-page moment where a specific price is legible. The final paragraph restates theme rather than reweighting prior material through a charged image, weakening the closure's felt impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ivory harbor is vivid and the "navigated absences" frame filters setting purposefully. Ocean spray, pale stones, and briny scent anchor atmosphere. However, environment remains largely postcard backdrop; no tool, spatial constraint, or object materially alters Elina's tactics. The trumpet valve appears but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it sits on her desk as symbol, not functional pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (compiling fragments to heal the community) is signaled early. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening—each vision adds a layer—but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The herald revelation is summarized backstory; the returnees' transformation is told in a single sentence. Pressure remains static across beats; no meaningful tightening or choice that forecloses a path. Under the accumulative lens, a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost is needed but absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (absences as possibility, not only loss) emerges from the ivory harbor metaphor and the returnees' arc. The ending offers a resonant image—home as shared understanding—but the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "their absences had been navigated," "what they had overcome together." This replaces scene pressure with thematic summary. The herald's trumpet as motif is introduced, used once in vision, then placed on the desk without further reweighting; recurrence does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV on Elina is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is adequate—she notices archival details and visions—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("pristine but painful emptiness," "tapestry she wove") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance is consistent. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she found") are frequent but voice-motivated for an archivist's observational stance, not obscuring immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but template-cadence runs are pervasive: "she found," "she learned," "she witnessed," "she shared." These stems appear in most paragraphs, creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "ocean-spray archivist" restated as "her duty to compile fragments," "navigated absences" echoed as "charted the gaps." Figurative density ("tapestry," "seedlings through soil," "waves against the shore") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −0.6 for template cadence, −0.3 for paraphrase loops, total −0.9 in Q7. Information density is moderate; some lines advance but many recapitulate theme.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The archivist-healer premise is familiar (post-exile recovery, fragments compiled into meaning). The "reactively visionary" trait and "navigated absences" frame offer mild freshness, but execution leans on stock metaphors (tapestry, seedlings, waves) and abstraction. No bold structural or perspectival risk. The herald backstory reveal is summarized, not transformed through specific lived detail. Emotional arc is generic—anger to sorrow to peace—without particularity. No single inflection feels non-obvious or inevitable in hindsight; the story could function unchanged with different names and places.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elina is present throughout as focalizer and archivist. She touches objects, experiences visions, and shares findings—but her choices remain observational. No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Setup and development beats present; closure participation is thematic presence only, not causal action. Functional but replaceable; another observer could perform the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The trumpet valve appears in paragraph 4 (setup), triggers a vision (one beat), and is mentioned again in the final third sitting on Elina's desk. Two touches across beats, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image—it is symbolic ornament. Specificity is adequate (brass, worn smooth), but the object is swappable with any herald artifact. Mid-band for dual presence without causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" is seeded early (paragraph 7), shapes Elina's specialty (charting gaps), and frames the harbor metaphor. It appears in the ending paragraph, reweighting the stake: absences become possibility. This is lyric reprise with thematic closure linkage, but no on-page choice is constrained by the concept. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is thematic echo only. Score in the 5.5–6.3 band for purposeful early–final reprise that reweights the dominant stake without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is named in paragraph 3 and described (visions triggered by objects/stories). It enables the trumpet vision (one beat) but imposes no visible cost or constraint—visions arrive conveniently without tradeoff. The trait is label-only; no on-page action where the trait narrows options or exacts a price. Functional but swappable with "perceptive" or "intuitive." Cap at 3.8 for swappability and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Hearten" is seeded in paragraph 9 (Elina learns to hearten returnees with truth) and echoed in paragraph 15 (her work had heartened them). Two thematic touches, but the action is summarized, not dramatized in a key turn. No scene shows Elina heartening someone through a specific choice under pressure. Functional thematic presence across beats without causal participation in escalation or closure. Mid-band for dual mention without dramatized turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through staggered intervals" is named in paragraph 6 and repeated in paragraph 11 ("staggered intervals of revelation"). The method signals that insights arrive irregularly, shaping Elina's experience, but the mechanics do not constrain or enable a specific on-page action. Setup and thematic development present; no closure participation. Functional but replaceable with "gradually" or "in waves." Mid-band for dual presence without causal leverage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The ivory harbor after rain is vividly established in the opening and revisited in the closing paragraph. The setting's "absences" metaphor frames the dominant stake. However, no spatial constraint, tool, or environmental feature alters Elina's tactics. The setting is atmospheric backdrop without functional pressure. Early seed and final reprise reweights meaning thematically; mid-band for lyric resonance without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the exile ends" is established in paragraph 2 (ships arrive carrying returnees) and anchors the story's present. Time does not tighten decisions—no clock or urgency narrows Elina's options. The frame is static context, not a live constraint. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing development and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elina's motivation "to compile fragments into meaning" is stated in the opening line and drives her archival actions across beats: finding the valve, piecing together the herald's story, sharing truths with returnees. It shapes the dominant stake and reappears in the ending paragraph. The desire is told more than dramatized—no moment where the motivation conflicts with a competing want under pressure. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; score in the 6.1–6.9 band for shaping one key stake without friction or visible cost.</comment>
