<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's gravity-defying nature is declared but never shapes a concrete choice under pressure—he simply "hovers" as backstory fact. The labyrinth-of-self motivation is told repeatedly ("to conquer the labyrinth of self") but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or a micro-choice; the piece substitutes abstract epiphany ("accepting all parts of himself") for earned struggle. Interiority remains generic ("hope mixed with growing dread") without embodied emotion or character-particular phrasing. The final acceptance arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed, reading as summary rather than alteration.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening lines, avoiding penalty. However, the "fractured timeline" journey unfolds through passive observation ("he watched," "he began to retrace") without a causal choice that narrows options or changes knowledge—Elias moves through visions but makes no decision that alters tactics or outcome. The closure claims he "understood" and "accepted" himself, yet this realization is asserted rather than dramatized with on-page cost; no path is foreclosed, no relationship altered, no tactical constraint remains. Under an inferred Causal lens (the piece attempts because/therefore with the tablet→viaduct→timelines), the ending summarizes theme without a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct is anchored early and returns at closure, fulfilling Setup and Payoff gates. Sensory detail is vivid ("damp golden stones humming," "bruised purple" sky) and filtered through urgency during the eclipse sequence. However, the viaduct does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as backdrop for passive observation rather than shaping Elias's tactics, capping the score below 6.0 despite strong descriptive texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>A dominant stake ("understand why he could defy gravity") is signaled early, meeting baseline requirement. The eclipse creates a ticking clock ("tonight was special"), but Elias experiences no reversal or tightening that narrows options—he places the tablet, closes his eyes, and observes alternate timelines without opposition or cost. The resolution ("accepting all parts of himself") is declared rather than earned by a protagonist decision; coincidence (eclipse timing, tablet mechanics) enables the journey without agency. No visible price is paid, no path foreclosed, and the final "knowledge" arrives off-stage as summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A coherent theme (identity fractured across choices, acceptance of complexity) emerges organically from the timeline conceit and the gravity-defier motif. The "labyrinth of self" operates symbolically, and the viaduct's glow/darkness paradox mirrors Elias's emotional state with some resonance. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("he was not broken but beautifully complex, like the fractured timelines themselves"), replacing earned resonance with a stated thesis. The theme resists full tidy moralism through the "darkening brightness" texture, but the closure articulates the answer rather than showing it through a charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and mildly elevated ("phosphorescent glow," "procedural generation"), though some phrases ("gift and curse," "hope mixed with growing dread") trend generic. The piece avoids dialogue, so voice distinction is not tested. Perceptual signature is weak—observations read more like camera tracking than character-specific filtering. Free indirect style is clean, and no filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy, but the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic or syntactic texture that would elevate it above competent baseline.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary adequately; no glaring loops or scaffolding across adjacent lines. Clarity is maintained throughout, and grammar/punctuation are clean. However, multiple beats recycle "Elias [verb]" stems without propulsion ("Elias stood," "Elias placed," "Elias understood"), creating mild template cadence (−0.4). Stock phrasing appears in emotional beats ("gift and curse," "hope mixed with growing dread," "beautifully complex") without fresh embodiment (−0.3). Information density is moderate—many sentences describe without advancing pressure. The confluence of template cadence and stock metaphor in non-closure beats warrants a −0.7 total deduction from a baseline ~6.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The fractured-timelines-as-self-discovery premise closely matches widely used portal-fantasy and multiverse templates without a transforming angle; the protagonist observes alternate selves and returns with acceptance, a well-worn arc. Specific details (gravity defiance, clay tablet, glowing viaduct, eclipse timing) are present but do not cohere into a non-obvious synthesis—removing any one element would not fundamentally alter the emotional or thematic trajectory. The "procedural generation" conceit is mentioned but never demonstrated in a way that makes it irreplaceable. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 from baseline ~5.4 for close template match without transformation through lived detail or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Gravity-defier trait is present in Setup (opening paragraph) and mentioned at Payoff (versions of himself "some hovering, others walking normally"), meeting two gates. However, the trait does not drive a key turn or constrain a choice on the page—Elias's ability to hover is backstory color rather than a tactical tool or source of conflict. Development gate is missing; the trait does not enable or prevent an action during the timeline journey. Swappability is moderate; another unique trait (telepathy, invisibility) could serve the same role with minor edits. Score: two gates met, but no causal pressure or cost tied to the trait. Band: 3.0–4.9; posture at 3.2 for presence without beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tablet is introduced early (Setup: "three months ago… ancient clay artifact"), used in a middle beat (Development: "the tablet had taught him" procedural generation), and appears at Payoff ("he placed the tablet on the central viaduct stone… gripped the ancient tablet"). All three gates are met. The tablet enables the timeline fracture, giving it causal pressure (+0.5) and beat involvement across two distinct beats (+0.9). However, the tablet's mechanics are vague ("procedural generation method the tablet had taught him") and it does not carry visible cost—Elias uses it successfully without trade-off or sacrifice. Specificity is moderate; the "runes" and "clay" details are present but could be swapped for another magical artifact without structural change. Band: 5.0–6.9; posture at 5.8 for solid three-gate presence and causal role, but lacks irreplaceability and cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are introduced by the first third (Setup: "the tablet was a key to fractured timelines"), drive the middle journey (Development: "feeling the timeline fracture around him"), and appear at Payoff (the convergence chamber and return). All three gates are met. The concept enables the journey and provides the setting for Elias's observations, giving it beat involvement (+0.4 for one extended beat). However, the timelines do not constrain a choice or impose a cost—Elias observes passively and returns unscathed. The concept functions more as a setting tour than a tactical challenge. Swappability is moderate; another metaphysical journey (dream realm, astral plane) could serve the same role. Band: 3.0–4.9; posture at 4.4 for three-gate presence and functional role, but no causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is mentioned in Setup ("these timelines operated in a state that was periodically eternal") and Payoff ("a place that was periodically eternal"). Two gates met, but the attribute is purely descriptive—it does not enable or constrain an action or impose a cost. The phrase is abstract and never demonstrated through a specific consequence (e.g., time dilation, loop mechanics). Swappability is high; removing the phrase would not alter the plot. Band: 0.1–2.9; posture at 2.1 for ornamental presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears in Setup ("Elias had learned to retrace his steps") and drives the middle journey (Development: "He began to retrace his steps, moving across the glowing viaduct"). Two gates met. The action is central to the timeline exploration and occupies a sustained beat (+0.4). However, the mechanics are vague—"retrace" blends with "procedural generation" without clear distinction—and the action does not lead to a reversal or cost. Elias retraces successfully and returns unchanged tactically. Swappability is moderate; "navigate," "traverse," or "follow" could replace it with minor edits. Missing Payoff gate (−0.6 to −1.0): the ending summarizes knowledge but does not show a final retracing act. Band: 3.0–4.9; posture at 4.7 for Setup/Development presence and beat involvement, but lacks closure linkage and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Procedural generation" is mentioned in Setup ("the procedural generation method the tablet had taught him") and Development ("began the procedural generation in his mind… new paths procedurally generated before him"). Two gates met. However, the method is told rather than shown—there is no on-page demonstration of how Elias's "intentions and past decisions" algorithmically shape the paths. The mechanics remain abstract label rather than dramatized process. Missing Payoff gate; the method is not mentioned or used at closure. Swappability is high; "visualization," "meditation," or "conjuring" could replace it without structural change. Band: 0.1–2.9; posture at 2.8 for two-gate presence but summary-only use without causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct is introduced early (Setup: opening paragraph), serves as the nexus for the middle journey (Development: "he stood in the same place but the world had shifted—the viaduct now crumbling and ancient"), and returns at Payoff ("The viaduct's glow softened as normal time resumed"). All three gates are met. The viaduct provides the physical anchor for the timeline fracture and is present across multiple beats (+0.9). It charges the final image by softening as closure arrives (+0.7 to +1.8 consideration, conservatively +0.9 here). However, the viaduct does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—Elias uses it successfully without trade-off. Specificity is moderate; the "damp golden stones humming" and "phosphorescent glow" details are vivid but the viaduct could be swapped for another mystical portal location. Band: 5.0–6.9; posture at 6.1 for strong three-gate presence, beat involvement, and closure linkage, but lacks causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" is mentioned in Setup ("accessible only between the drop and the ripple of causality") and Payoff ("the eclipse would create the precise timeframe"). Two gates met. The timeframe is poetic but abstract—there is no on-page demonstration of what "the drop" or "the ripple" concretely constrains. The eclipse creates urgency in theory ("Tonight was special") but does not tighten a decision; Elias completes his journey before the eclipse ends without time pressure affecting his choices. Missing Development gate; the timeframe is not invoked during the middle journey. Band: 0.1–2.9; posture at 3.1 for two-gate ornamental presence without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To conquer the labyrinth of self" is stated in Setup ("His motivation went beyond mere curiosity; Elias sought to conquer the labyrinth of self") and returns at Payoff ("The labyrinth wasn't external but within… conquering the labyrinth meant accepting all parts of himself"). Two gates met (Setup and Payoff). The motivation frames the journey and is explicitly linked to closure (+0.7). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized—there is no on-page friction between wants and costs, no scene where Elias chooses one aspect of self over another. The resolution ("accepting all parts") is asserted without a visible trade-off. Missing Development gate; the motivation is not tested by a middle choice. Band: 3.0–4.9; posture at 4.9 for Setup/Payoff presence and closure linkage, but lacks dramatized friction and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" is signaled in Setup ("The darkening brightness matched his emotional state") and modulates through the journey (Development: "the world darkened further yet glowed more intensely"). Two gates met. The tone is purposefully paradoxical and charges several beats with atmospheric texture (+0.4). However, the tone does not appear in or shape the final image—the ending describes "the viaduct's glow softened" without returning to the darkening-brightness motif. Missing Payoff gate (−0.6 to −1.0); the tone is established and sustained but does not culminate in the closure beat. Band: 5.0–6.9; posture at 5.2 for Setup/Development presence and atmospheric coherence, but lacks closure linkage.</comment>
