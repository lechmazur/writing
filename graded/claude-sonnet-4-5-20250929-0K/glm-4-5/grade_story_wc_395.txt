<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a cipher defined by her role rather than contradictory impulses. Her motivation is declared ("she needed to find") but never dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final paragraph's "ready to uncover" lacks the embodied struggle or renunciation that would earn the closure. Interior voice relies heavily on stock thriller phrasing ("whispers from another dimension," "digital necropolis") without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors do not stabilize until well past 120 words; "corporate memory keeper" and "vast social network archive" remain abstract placeholders without spatial grounding. Closure effect is absent on the page—Elara downloads files and "disappears into the city's underground network" without a decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing that reconfigures prior material with felt cost. The piece ends on declared intent ("ready to uncover") rather than an action or image that demonstrates before/after change. Drive lens reads as intended Causal but the "realization dawned" beat summarizes rather than dramatizes the turn, and the final move (downloading, fleeing) does not narrow options or foreclose a path in a way legible as cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setting remains generic digital-archive abstraction without spatial choreography or tactile anchors. "Grayed out" interface sectors and "warning symbols that glowed like malevolent eyes" offer visual metaphor but no physical constraint that alters Elara's tactics. The archive functions as a data repository rather than an environment that pressures choice. The final image ("city's underground network") introduces a new location without grounding, and no object or micro-setting detail charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("find where deleted files go") is signaled early but never tested by a trade-off or complication that narrows options with visible cost. The "ninety seconds before breach" deadline evaporates without consequence—Elara gains access, downloads everything, and escapes without dramatized friction. The video-fragment discovery resolves the mystery through exposition rather than a turn driven by protagonist choice. No on-page reversal or deepening forecloses a path; pressure remains static assertion ("alarms began screaming") rather than escalation under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of erasure and hidden truth is declared in multiple lines ("the archive doesn't lie, but people do," "nothing could successfully delete the truth forever") rather than emerging from particulars. The Stellaris patch recurs but as a plot token rather than an image that shifts meaning at closure. Final paragraph moralizing ("determined to bring justice") replaces scene pressure with thesis statement. No resonant, non-literal answer to the central question lands; the ending asserts intent without reweighting prior material through image or earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Narrative distance wobbles between close third and distant summary without purposeful modulation. Diction drifts into thriller-generic register ("digital necropolis," "malevolent eyes watching her every move," "digital labyrinth and human deception") that does not feel character-particular. Filter verbs and passive constructions cluster in high-pressure beats ("the absence in the data called to her," "the realization dawned") dulling immediacy. Interior voice reads as interchangeable rather than a perceptual signature; Elara's way of noticing is not selective or biased in idiosyncratic ways. Single brief dialogue line ("The archive doesn't lie, but people do") lands as thematic statement rather than goal-driven speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "deleted files went nowhere—they went everywhere, hidden in the archive's deepest recesses, protected by digital labyrinth" restates the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear in multiple beats: "Being brightly attentive... she noticed," "The recurring numbers... appeared," "The sense of absence grew stronger." Stock metaphor strings ("whispers from another dimension," "constellations in a dark sky," "ghosts in the machine") cluster without fresh vehicles. Register drift into elevated diction ("doomed spaceship," "symphony half-remembered from a dream") clashes with the thriller frame. Figurative language appears in most sentences of the climax paragraph without coherence: "burning a hole in her memory," "echo like forgotten songs," "archive of human experience" stack without clear tenor-vehicle logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Core premise (corporate archivist uncovers conspiracy via deleted social-media files) follows a well-worn template without fresh inflection. The Stellaris patch and recurring numbers function as genre-standard clues rather than details made specific through lived use or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional arc and plot beats would work unchanged with different names and setting markers (swap "digital archive" for "library basement," "Stellaris patch" for "mission photograph"). No bold structural risk or unconventional perspectival choice heightens stakes; the piece executes a familiar mystery frame at a functional level without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara's role is central but her choices do not create key turns. She observes patterns, crafts a lie to gain access, and downloads files—actions that advance the plot but do not alter her tactics or foreclose options with visible cost. The lie (Q9 E) is the only decision beat, and it succeeds without friction. Removing Elara as "corporate memory keeper" and replacing her with another archival role would not fundamentally break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The patch appears in three beats: Chloe's recovered photo (early), the hidden folder discovery (middle), and "burning a hole in her memory" (final line reprise). It signals the Stellaris conspiracy and links to coordinates, shaping the middle discovery beat. However, the patch is described rather than handled, and its evolving meaning is told ("this time beside coordinates") rather than shown through tactile interaction or a choice it constrains. The final reprise reweights it as an obsession marker but does not charge the closure with felt cost tied to the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cold case frames Elara's investigation from the opening and shapes her dominant stake. Three researchers' disappearance is the inciting event, and the video-fragment discovery (middle beat) reframes the case as cover-up rather than accident. The ending declares the case will "reopen" with her evidence. Present in setup, middle turn, and closure reference, but the concept does not constrain a tactical choice with cost on the page—Elara's access to the files is unimpeded once she lies, and the resolution is summary rather than scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive to details others overlooked" is a label-only trait mentioned once in the opening. Elara's pattern-recognition is asserted but not dramatized through a micro-choice where heightened attention enables a discovery at a cost (e.g., missing a deadline, ignoring a warning). The trait could be cut without altering on-page events; her investigation proceeds through access and downloads rather than perceptual struggle.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The lie to gain archive access is signaled early and creates the breach that allows discovery. However, the "ninety seconds before detection" consequence never materializes—Elara completes her download and escapes without the breach cost constraining her tactics. The lie is functional but does not redefine options at closure; it could be replaced with a password guess or insider tip with minor edits. Present in setup and tied to one middle beat, but not essential to the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Recurring numbers (731) appear in timestamps, coordinates, and encrypted messages (setup), lead to restricted sectors (middle), and decode to final coordinates (payoff). The method shapes three beats and participates in closure by unlocking the hidden folder. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—Elara "noticed patterns" and "traced the numbers" without dramatized friction or a choice where decoding imposes cost. Swapping 731 for another recurring marker would not alter story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The archive is present throughout but functions as a data repository rather than an environment that constrains tactics. "Grayed out" sectors and "warning symbols" are described but do not alter Elara's moves—she crafts a lie and gains access without spatial or systemic friction. The archive does not pressure the final choice or charge the closure image; it remains a backdrop rather than a micro-setting that shapes outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" is a phrase mentioned twice: in the middle paragraph as musical clues and in the final line as a metaphor for the archive. It does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions—no clock or temporal pressure shapes Elara's tactics. The phrase is ornamental rather than structural; removing it would not alter the investigation's pacing or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to find where deleted files go" is stated in the opening and drives her investigation across all beats. The motivation is present in setup, middle discovery, and the ending download. However, it is declared rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice where her need to know forecloses another option with felt cost. The investigation proceeds without friction between want and price—she gains access, finds answers, and escapes without a trade-off legible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Tone of "sensed absence" is coherent in the opening ("absence in the data called to her with a silent scream") and recurs in "sense of absence grew stronger" and "whispers of information erased from existence." The tone modulates slightly under pressure but does not charge the final image—the ending shifts to action-thriller declaration ("ready to uncover the truth") rather than sustaining the absence motif. Present in setup and middle, but does not shape closure with pressure.</comment>
