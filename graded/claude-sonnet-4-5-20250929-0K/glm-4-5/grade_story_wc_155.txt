<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Amelia's motivation to rediscover lost joy is stated but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her choices feel frictionless—she seeks inspiration, finds the fragment, applies her technique, creates the display—without genuine struggle or trade-offs visible on the page. The ending declares her purpose fulfilled without dramatizing what she forfeited or risked. Interiority relies on abstraction ("her own lost joy resurfacing") rather than concrete, embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation arrives late: who/where/when are not anchored until multiple paragraphs in, and "fog-choked ruins" + "centuries had passed" + "daydreams" create deliberate disorientation that is never taught as a pattern or paid off at closure (−0.4). The piece follows a causal lens but linkage is weak: Amelia's discovery of the fragment, her light-therapy revelation, and the community's transformation proceed without meaningful tightening or a decision that forecloses a path. The closure—community joy rekindled—is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost, failing the Cost Proof Test (−0.6). The drive lens wobbles between causal and thematic summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The orchard district's fog and ruins are evoked but remain postcard descriptions that do not constrain a single on-page choice. Spatial choreography is vague: Amelia moves from ruins to studio to observatory without tactile grounding or proximity that shapes decisions. The fragment itself—smooth, cool, muted—is described but never used as a micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory detail is generic ("soft contours," "sunlit orchards heavy with dew") and not filtered through Amelia's professional or emotional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscover lost joy—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Amelia's light-therapy method works immediately, the council grants permission despite doubts (no dramatized negotiation), and visitors arrive in increasing numbers without obstacle. No on-page price is paid: she does not sacrifice time, resources, relationships, or alternate paths. The escalation is declarative ("increasing numbers") rather than pressure-driven, and coincidence (finding the fragment, council approval) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Theme—beauty emerging from darkness, joy rekindled through art—is stated overtly in multiple passages ("painting with light hadn't just revealed history—it had rekindled the human capacity for wonder"). The final image offers no non-literal answer; instead, it summarizes the thesis in prompt-like language. The fresco fragment recurs but does not shift meaning or constrain choice; it remains a static symbol. Pensive mirth is named but not embodied through ambiguity or layered emotion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific: Amelia notices "impossible colors" and "whispered secrets" without professional or emotional bias shaping what she ignores. Diction drifts into abstract register ("knowledge network of connections," "fold of her daydream") that feels imposed rather than voice-driven. Dialogue is minimal and functional, carrying no subtext. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose reads like neutral narration rather than a singular mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "rediscover lost joy" / "lost joy resurfacing"; "painting with light" recurs without evolving function; "fog-choked" / "fog-bound"; "ancient and new creations seemed to merge" followed by "fragments of the past had developed into a future." Template cadence runs through the middle third with repetitive "She [verb]" stems (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("liquid dawn," "roots had taken hold") and therapy-speak ("capacity for wonder," "collective joy") dull peak beats (−0.4). The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image, flattening closure momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The core premise—artist restores ancient art, community rediscovers lost tradition—follows a familiar restoration-narrative template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−1.0 derivative adjustment). Amelia's light-therapy method is mentioned but never constrained by technical limits, cost, or failure. The fragment's revelation proceeds without setback, and the ending declares success without ambiguity or risk. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; obstacles appear and vanish for convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Amelia is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She seeks inspiration (decision off-page), finds the fragment (coincidence), applies her method (success without complication), and creates the display (granted permission). Observation dominates; her agency does not narrow options or face trade-offs. Present and functional but replaceable as the protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fresco fragment is handled in multiple beats: discovery, light-therapy revelation, display centerpiece, and mentioned in the final image. It seeds early (~15% in), constrains one choice (Amelia's decision to use light-therapy), and appears at closure. However, it does not evolve in meaning or cost; it remains a static catalyst. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; middle development is weak. Causal pressure is modest: it enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Exposed film" appears once as a metaphor in paragraph 6 ("like exposed film, holding images that had never been properly developed") and is echoed thematically but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. It is ornamental—a thematic flourish rather than a constraint that alters Amelia's method or choices. Not signaled early enough to frame expectation; no cost tied to its mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is introduced mid-story (~25% in) as "light-therapy kit" and "specialized lamps." It enables the fragment's revelation but imposes no visible cost, tradeoff, or failure. The method works immediately without complication. Mentioned in summary at closure ("painting with light hadn't just revealed history") but not dramatized as a constraint. Functional but swappable with any restoration technique; no irreplaceability or tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The display is introduced late (~60% in: "transform the old observatory into an exhibition space") and becomes the site of the ending. It shapes the closure image (visitors' transformation) and is causally linked to Amelia's prior work. However, its preparation is summarized, not dramatized, and no on-page obstacle tests its execution. Two gates (middle, payoff) are met; setup is absent. Causal role is modest: it gathers prior material rather than forcing a new choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Knowledge network" is mentioned twice in summary ("building a knowledge network of connections," "Her knowledge network of historians, artists, and dreamers continued to grow") but never shown in action. No mechanics are dramatized: we do not see Amelia consulting historians, negotiating with dreamers, or synthesizing their input. It is told-only and ornamental, introduced late (~40% in) without constraining a choice or appearing at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district appears early and recurs, but it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint on choice. Fog and ruins do not alter Amelia's tactics, supply resources, or pressure decisions. The setting's transformation ("hope had taken root") is declared, not shown through spatial changes that affect later action. Present across beats but swappable with any lost-history locale; no irreplaceability or micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" appears in two phrases ("during her daydreams," "in the fold of her daydream") as thematic decoration. No temporal frame is taught: we do not know if the entire story is a daydream, a memory, or present action. Time does not tighten decisions; Amelia works "deeper into the night" and "by dawn" without urgency or a live clock. The element is ornamental and does not constrain pacing or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To rediscover lost joy" is stated explicitly in paragraph 3 and echoed at closure ("her own lost joy resurfacing"). It frames the dominant stake and appears in the final image. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. Amelia's path is frictionless: she seeks, finds, reveals, displays, succeeds. No trade-off between joy and another value is tested on the page. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" is named once mid-story ("a pensive mirth lifting her spirits") but not embodied through contradictory emotion or modulation under pressure. The tone remains uniformly hopeful and declarative; no tension between pensiveness and mirth charges the final image. The phrase functions as a label rather than a coherent atmospheric current that evolves with turns. Present but ornamental; does not constrain voice or charge closure.</comment>
