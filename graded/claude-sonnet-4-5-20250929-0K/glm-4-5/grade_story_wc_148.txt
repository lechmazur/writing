<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The son remains abstract throughout, defined by relation to his father rather than embodied choices under pressure. Interiority consists of generic rumination ("sustained impossibilities," "hope of redemption") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "finding his voice" moment is declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices with visible cost. Motivation stays thematic rather than dramatized in concrete action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words—"the son" is never named, the prison's physical layout unclear, and temporal markers absent. The drive lens remains ambiguous (accumulative textures suggest lyric mode, but no taught pattern emerges by midpoint). No on-page closure unit: the ending declares he "found his voice" and "threaded the labyrinth" but provides no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration with visible cost, or conceptual repricing—only summary of off-page transformation. "Before they find the bodies" repeats without causal development or payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and lattice are named repeatedly but never constrain a choice or shape tactics—they remain atmospheric backdrops. The copperlight filtering through the window and the scent of salt/sorrow establish mood but do not evolve causally or charge the closure. Spatial choreography is vague: the confessional lattice's location relative to the cell, the door's function, and the reef's proximity are never anchored in action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—separating himself from his father's legacy—is declared but never tested by on-page choices with visible cost. No meaningful escalation: the son practices truth in a mirror, writes on walls, and presses his face to wood, but these actions do not narrow options or face opposition. "Before they find the bodies" hints at urgency but remains unexplained and inert. Coincidence does not complicate because no complication occurs; the ending summarizes redemption without dramatizing the price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. lies, legacy, redemption) is stated rather than earned through concrete particulars. The lattice and copperlight are mentioned frequently but do not shift meaning across the arc—they remain static symbols. The final paragraph moralizes with "testament to his journey" and "story of redemption," replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. No counter-reading is possible; the piece hedges toward redemptive closure without dramatizing the cost or complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable but lacks perceptual signature—diction and syntax remain generic literary register throughout ("liminal space," "churning sea," "metaphors sustain themselves"). Psychic distance stays fixed at mid-range, never tightening under pressure. Sentence stems recycle ("In the lighthouse prison," "Through the scuffs," "He sustained impossibilities") without rhythmic purpose. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "copperlight repose" appears three times with identical function, "sustained impossibilities" twice, "lattice from confessional" five times without evolving use. Template cadence runs: "In the [place]... he [verb]" opens six paragraphs. Mixed metaphor: "impossibilities sustained themselves like ghosts refusing to be exorcised" blends vehicle incoherently. Stock phrases abound: "liminal space," "past and present merged," "creating a path where none had existed." Penalty: −1.4 for loops and template cadence touching the closure beat; artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—son of the boy who cried wolf in a lighthouse prison—is high-concept but executed through generic redemption beats without specific transformation. The lattice, bodies, and labyrinth remain unexplained symbols rather than grounded particulars. Emotional arc (guilt → redemption through truth) follows template without fresh inflection. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, and the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk-taking; the piece hedges toward thematic safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The character is named in the opening line and referenced throughout but makes no on-page decisions that create turns—he practices, writes, watches, and hovers without altering tactics or facing consequences. Ornamental presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The lattice appears in five beats (opening, repeated middle mentions, closing line) but remains static: a barrier he touches and traces without its properties constraining choice or evolving meaning. Swappable with any symbolic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" appears once in paragraph two and is never dramatized—no on-page action shows him seeking silence or friction when it eludes him. Theme-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" appears twice as label-only trait (hope, forgiveness, love in hatred) without enabling or constraining an on-page action with cost. Told, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Hover" appears twice (threshold morning routine, hovering between identities) but does not drive turns—it describes a static state. Easily swapped with "linger" or "pause."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" appears three times but the method is never used—he reads history, watches guards, sees the future, all through passive observation without mechanics or agency. Summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are named six times and frame the piece but never pressure a choice—no escape attempt, no guard confrontation, no use of the environment's resources. Postcard description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" appears three times but the timeframe is never tracked, the bodies never explained, and no urgency alters his moves. Ornamental tension device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Thread a labyrinth with your own story" appears twice and motivates the writing-on-walls action, but no friction between desire and cost is dramatized—he simply decides and does. Told desire without on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" appears three times (dawn, evening, cell) and establishes warm metallic tone but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image—it remains static mood throughout. Single static note.</comment>
