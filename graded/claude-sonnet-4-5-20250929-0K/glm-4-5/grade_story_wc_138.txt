<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Alistair's immortal boredom is stated but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on summary ("understood now what he must do") and therapy-speak ("not a curse but an opportunity"). The final transformation from bored immortal to guardian lacks on-page causality—no visible struggle or foreclosed path charges the shift. Elara exists only as backstory fuel, never dramatized in a way that tests Alistair's present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. The Drive Lens reads Causal but collapses under scrutiny: Alistair's decision to reunite fragments is declared, not earned through because/therefore pressure. The closure unit—"what came after goodbye was not an end but a continuation"—delivers Conceptual Repricing via stated theme rather than image or cost. The portal step and escondite collapse happen, but no visible price alters options on the page; the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite offers vivid color-shifting walls and dimensional windows, anchoring early. The amulet fragment recurs across beats (touching, manipulating, glowing), satisfying the micro-object-as-setting test. However, the solar storm and magnetic fields remain atmospheric backdrop; neither constrains a tactical choice nor charges the final image. The dimensional windows show rebellion but do not force Alistair's hand—he observes, then decides off-page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled early but remains abstract. The amulet revelation (it belonged to Elara) should narrow options; instead it only adds information. Alistair's step through the portal is a decision, but no live trade-off or visible price is dramatized: the escondite collapses behind him without cost, and the essence-message arrives as summary. One tightening moment (amulet hums, revealing mutiny) exists, but escalation lacks agency-driven pressure or felt consequence at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring motifs (the amulet, magnetic fields, dimensional balance) rather than direct statement in the body. However, the penultimate paragraph delivers Thematic Echo: "immortality was not a curse but an opportunity to witness the endless dance of creation and destruction"—a prompt-like articulation. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "what came after goodbye was not an end but a continuation—of love, of purpose, of existence itself." Both moments replace scene pressure with thesis, triggering −0.6 for Echo and −0.5 for final-paragraph sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "methodical precision honed over countless lifetimes" and "hushed thunder of revelation" feel like committee voice rather than Alistair-specific idiom. Psychic distance widens at closure into narrator summary ("he understood now," "accepted that") that tells insight rather than dramatizing it. Diction stays consistent but lacks textural distinction—syntax and rhythm do not modulate under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "boredom evaporated, replaced by intrigue" followed two paragraphs later by "no longer a bored immortal" restates without adding pressure. Template cadence runs: "He had been searching... when his fingers brushed... The cursed amulet fragment hummed... As the solar storm intensified..." stacks participle and subordinate stems across four consecutive beats. Stock metaphors—"stretching like taffy," "final moments of a dying rainbow," "endless dance of creation and destruction"—cluster without fresh vehicle logic. Filter-verb stacks in closure paragraph ("understood," "accepted," "found") dull immediacy. Applying −1.4 for loops, cadence, and stock phrasing; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—immortal discovers cosmic conspiracy via magical amulet—closely matches template fantasy quest structures without transformation. The "spatial mutiny" and "dimensional balance" remain vague genre furniture. The twist (Elara was a guardian, amulet scattered) arrives as backstory exposition rather than lived discovery. The essence-message resolution ("immortality is opportunity") feels borrowed from prompt language rather than earned through specific, grounded choices. No risk-taking or synthesis elevates the familiar elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Alistair's boredom frames the opening and his final transformation is stated, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, middle beats show observation (watching rebels, discovering Elara's role) rather than decisions that alter tactics. The portal step is an action but lacks on-page cost or constraint. Late-penalty −0.3 (amulet not found until second paragraph); swappability −0.5 (any restless immortal would serve); summary-only transformation −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Amulet fragment appears early (second paragraph), recurs across four beats (brushing, humming, manipulating, glowing), and is present in the closure image. It enables passage and reveals Elara's message, driving two key turns. However, its curse is label-only; no visible cost from handling it constrains Alistair. Causal pressure +0.9 (multiple beats); closure linkage +1.0; specificity +0.4; but swappability −0.5 (any magical key could substitute) and label-only curse −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is introduced mid-story (third paragraph glimpse, fourth paragraph naming), triggering late-arrival −0.4. It remains thematic backdrop: Alistair watches rebellions through windows but they do not narrow his options or force a tactical trade-off. The final turn (he becomes a guardian) echoes the concept but does not dramatize cost. Ornamental use −0.7; swappability −0.6 (any cosmic threat would motivate the quest).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Dimensional awareness is stated in paragraph one and enables Alistair to feel magnetic tendrils and manipulate fields. It constrains one action (using solar storm as conduit) in the middle. However, the trait remains label-only at closure; no visible trade-off (e.g., disorientation, cost of perceiving multiple realities) appears. Early signal +0.5; one beat involvement +0.4; causal pressure +0.6; but label-only −0.6 and swappability −0.5 (any magical sense would serve).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Intrigue replaces boredom in paragraph two and drives Alistair's investigation across middle beats (manipulating fields, accessing amulet secrets). The closure shift to "mission" echoes intrigue's role. However, the action is stated rather than shown through on-page choices with friction. Early setup +0.6; two beats +0.9; closure linkage +0.9; but summary-only dramatization −0.5 and swappability −0.7 (any motivating emotion—curiosity, duty—could replace intrigue without structural change).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are signaled early (paragraph one: tendrils disrupt balance) and recur in paragraph four (Alistair manipulates them as conduit) and final paragraph (he travels "magnetic pathways"). The method enables the portal but mechanics remain vague; no constraint or cost from using magnetic fields shapes tactics. Setup +0.6; two beats +0.9; closure mention +0.5; but ornamental mechanics −0.6 and swappability −0.6 (any energy source could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite appears in paragraph one, its color shifts recur in paragraph two, and it collapses in paragraph eight. However, it supplies no resource that alters tactics and imposes no constraint—Alistair leaves without cost. The collapse is mentioned but not felt. Setup +0.6; two beats +0.9; closure presence +0.4; but postcard description −0.7 and no tactical pressure −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Solar storm is introduced in paragraph one, intensifies in paragraph three, and subsides in the final paragraph, framing the entire arc. However, it imposes no live clock that tightens decisions; Alistair proceeds at his own pace. Setup +0.7; two beats (intensifies, subsides) +0.9; closure bracket +0.6; but vague pressure −0.7 and swappability −0.6 (any cosmic event could frame the window).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The question "what happens after goodbye" is seeded in paragraph three, drives Alistair's amulet investigation, and receives thematic answer at closure ("not an end but a continuation"). The motivation recurs across three beats. However, it remains told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no on-page moment shows Alistair torn between discovery and another cost. Setup +0.6; three beats +1.4; closure answer +1.2; causal drive +0.8; but told-only friction −0.5 and summary resolution −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Tone element "hushed thunder" appears twice explicitly (paragraph six: "hushed thunder of the mutiny"; paragraph nine: "hushed thunder of revelation") and the prose attempts quiet grandeur throughout. However, tone remains static—no modulation under peak pressure, and the final paragraph's declarative summary flattens rather than charges the image. Setup +0.3 (implicit early, named mid-story); closure reprise +0.6; but static mood −0.8 and late first naming −0.4.</comment>
