<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains abstract throughout—his personality molts are told but never dramatized with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interior life consists of poetic declarations ("to forge beauty from anarchy") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The Elias relationship is summarized in reflective blocks without on-page friction, and the protagonist's final action (scattering seeds, sealing the tin) carries no visible cost or foreclosed path. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, rusted library, moon clearing skyline) arrive early. However, the piece offers no causal escalation: the poet moves through tasks (pulling tin, scattering seeds, stacking books) in a static catalogue without a tightening choice or reversal. The ending ("continued his holy work") is a thesis statement, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. The drive lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern break nor situational crystallization is legible at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The rusted library, open roof, and starlight are vivid and consistently anchored. Spatial choreography (aisles, shelves, collapsed sections) tracks cleanly. However, the setting remains scenic: books and shelves are described but do not constrain a choice or charge the final image. The micro-setting (coffee tin, seeds, pages) is handled but ornamental—props are never unavailable or limiting when needed, so they function as symbols rather than tactical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("rebuild this knowledge sanctuary") is signaled early but never tested. The poet encounters no opposition, dilemma, or resource limit; he simply performs a series of symbolic gestures (scattering seeds, stacking books) without a tightening choice or reversal. The closure image restates his mission rather than altering options or imposing cost. No agency, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of "beauty as resistance" emerges through recurring images (flowers, seeds, books, starlight) and is supported by the Elias backstory. However, the final paragraph delivers explicit moralizing ("Anarchy is simply truth without chains," "beauty the authorities couldn't burn") that replaces scene pressure with thesis. The closing line ("luminous fracture at a time") is poetic but does not reweight prior material—it restates rather than reconfigures. The thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph triggers the penalty for prompt-language articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice is consistently elevated and poetic ("molted personalities like Phoenix feathers," "luminous fracture," "cerebral cathedral"), creating a distinct texture. However, diction remains uniformly literary regardless of pressure, and many lines lean on stock metaphor strings ("forge beauty from anarchy," "holy work"). Purposeful compression is present but the pattern is not taught—images shift rapidly without a legible accumulative design. No dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature is generic lyricism rather than character-specific noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting throughout: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("molted personalities like Phoenix feathers," "dancing between mangled metal," "whispers of his past," "blooming resistance," "cerebral cathedral," "luminous fracture") without pattern-teaching or payoff, reducing clarity under pressure. Paraphrase loops abound: "rebuild" appears in six distinct formulations, "blooming resistance" is repeated identically, and the coffee tin's "false bottom" is restated four times. Template cadence in reflective passages: "Each [noun]..." structures appear in lines 2, 10, 22, 24. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("luminous fracture" reappears in the final line without reweighting). Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("convenient amnesia of the world," "truth without chains") that clashes with the vagrant's physical reality. Deductions: density −0.7, coherence muddle −0.5, loops −0.6, template runs −0.4, artifacts at closure −1.7. Disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8 per artifact-at-closure rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet-rebuilding-a-library frame is a recognizable template (solitary creative restoring culture amid decay). The personality-molting trait is mentioned but not integrated into action, reading as quirky ornament. The Elias prison-library friendship and the coffee tin with false bottom are specific details, but they do not transform the core premise. The piece leans on stock metaphors ("Phoenix feathers," "dandelions through concrete," "forge beauty from anarchy") and poetic abstraction rather than grounded, irreplaceable particulars. Swapping names and setting would leave the emotional arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet is the focalizer and performs all on-page actions (pulling the tin, scattering seeds, stacking books), satisfying setup, middle presence, and closure participation. However, his "choices" are uncontested symbolic gestures—no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. He observes and enacts his mission without friction. Baseline presence with ornamental agency: cap at 2.8 per missing causal pressure and swappability (any solitary rebuilder could perform these beats).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The coffee tin appears in three distinct beats: pulled from coat (paragraph 3), opened to reveal seeds (paragraph 9), and sealed at closure (paragraph 29). Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9. However, the tin's "secret false bottom" is static—it holds items but does not constrain a choice or impose cost. The tin is swappable with any container. Deductions: ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.6, no causal pressure −0.5. Band guidance: 5.0–6.9 range for one-key-turn use; specific cost absent, so settle low in band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The "blooming resistance" appears as a thematic label in paragraph 7 and is echoed in phrases like "stubborn persistence of beauty" and "uprising" but never dramatically enacted. The poet faces no opposition to test the concept, and no tactical choice depends on resistance mechanics. Setup present (early paragraphs), but middle and closure participation are thematic echo only. Ornamental −0.7, label-only −0.5, summary use −0.5. Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development; additional deductions place it at 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Personality molts are declared in paragraph 2 ("Each month he molted personalities") and referenced in paragraphs 10–11 ("Yesterday...Gatherer; today...Builder") and 24 ("Tomorrow would bring another personality molt"). Present across setup, middle, closure. However, the trait is never dramatized with on-page cost or constraint—no fragmented memory disrupts a task, no shift alters his approach to a live problem. It functions as poetic color. Three beats +1.4, but label-only −0.5, no causal pressure −0.8, swappability −0.6 (the rebuilding could proceed unchanged). Settle at 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Rebuild" drives every beat: the poet works on shelves (paragraph 4), arranges tools (paragraph 13), stacks texts (paragraph 22), and continues the work at closure (paragraph 31). Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0. However, no turn or cost depends on rebuilding specifically—the action is interchangeable with "restore," "preserve," or "tend." Swappability −0.7, no specific cost tied to rebuild mechanics −0.5. Band guidance places functional-but-replaceable use at 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The prison-library friendship with Elias is seeded early (paragraph 5), recounted in reflective blocks (paragraphs 18–20), and named at closure (paragraph 24: "always Elias's face remained"). Present across all three gates. The method (book-sorting friendship) supplies the tin and the mission but does not shape a present tactical choice—it is backstory that motivates but does not constrain. Early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.4, but summary-only −0.6, no middle causal beat −0.4, swappability −0.5 (any mentor could serve). Settle at 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is anchored early and sustained throughout. The open roof admits moonlight and starlight (paragraphs 1, 13, 27), and "Collapsed Literature" is named (paragraph 22). The setting is vivid and present in the final image. Early signal +0.6, three beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8. However, the library does not constrain tactics—shelves and books are always available when needed, and no spatial or resource limit forces a choice. Ornamental −0.6, no causal pressure −0.5. Band guidance for setting that charges the final image without tactical constraint: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the moon clears the skyline" (paragraph 1) anchors the opening, and moon position is tracked intermittently ("As the moon climbed higher," paragraph 22; "As the moon fully illuminated," paragraph 27). Present at setup and closure. However, no deadline or tightening pressure arises from the passing night—the poet's tasks are self-paced and unlimited. Time functions as atmosphere, not constraint. Early signal +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but no tightening −0.8, ornamental −0.6. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; deductions place it at 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To forge beauty from anarchy" is stated in paragraph 8 and echoed in the closure paragraph ("beauty the authorities couldn't burn"). The motivation is declared and sustained but never dramatized with friction—no competing want or cost tests the desire. The poet enacts the mission without obstacle or trade-off. Setup present, closure mention, but no middle choice that tests the motivation against a price. Told-only −0.7, no conflicted choice −0.8, swappability −0.5 (any restorative desire would yield the same beats). Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" appears as a phrase in paragraph 15, is elaborated in paragraph 22 ("how even broken things hold light"), and returns in the final line. The tone is consistently elevated and poetic throughout, with no modulation under pressure. Present at setup, middle, and closure. The reprise reweights slightly (brokenness as vehicle for light), earning lyric credit. Early signal +0.5, three mentions +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, lyric reprise +0.4. However, tone remains static—no cadence shift or pressure modulation. Single static mood −0.5, ornamental metaphor −0.6. Settle at 4.1.</comment>
