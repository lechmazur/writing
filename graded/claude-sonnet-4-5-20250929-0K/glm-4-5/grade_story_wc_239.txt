<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The witness remains entirely abstract—translucent form, no bodily sensation, no contradictory impulse. Motivation is declared ("to unravel cosmic illusions") but never tested by competing desires or visible cost. The final "unification" happens through summary ("understanding poured from them") rather than embodied choice. No micro-decisions reveal hierarchy of values; the witness enacts cosmic tasks without friction or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words; who/where/when remain vague abstractions (translucent witness, liminal space, universe's hiccup) without concrete anchor. The piece teaches an accumulative pattern of cosmic integration, but closure arrives through summary ("spiral arbitration completed") rather than on-page decisive change or felt cost. The dictionary glows and fills with patterns, but no before/after options or tactics are legible—cost is asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The library setting provides vivid images (towering shelves, stone altar, resounding hush) and recurs throughout. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics; the witness paces and the shelves "rearrange themselves based on intention," removing spatial friction. The softcover dictionary appears in beats and charges the final moment, qualifying as micro-setting that elevates the score modestly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unifying cosmic fragments—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the witness encounters mirrors and shelves without resistance. The universe's hiccup frames urgency in exposition but does not pressure tactics. Resolution occurs through declaration ("spiral arbitration completed") rather than protagonist choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of unity versus separation emerges through images (mirrors, fragments, spiral) and avoids overt moralizing. However, the ending resolves into "completion that would echo across the next universe's beginning"—a stated cosmic payoff rather than a resonant non-literal answer. The dictionary's glow and final-page patterns offer visual resonance, but thematic weight rests on summary rather than earned particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice maintains elevated, abstract register throughout; diction is consistent ("resounding hush," "wanderingly exact," "universe's hiccup"). However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic cosmic-observer rather than character-particular. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains stable. The prose texture is purposeful but does not modulate under pressure or reveal a distinct mind at work.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing pervades: "resounding hush" appears five times, "spiral arbitration" four times, "journeying inward while walking out" three times without reweighting. Template cadence runs: "The [noun] [verb]…" structures dominate. Paraphrase loops recur (paragraphs 6–7 restate wanderingly exact path). Filter-verb stacks ("began to solidify," "seemed to meander") dull immediacy. Figurative density ("threads of light older than time," "pure consciousness suspended in infinite potential") stacks without clear payoff, triggering −0.9 cumulative in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise—cosmic librarian reconciling universal fragments—follows widely used metaphysical-quest templates without transformation through lived detail or surprising calculus. Abstract cosmic stakes remain ungrounded in specific human cost. Diction ("spiral arbitration," "wanderingly exact") creates surface novelty but describes rather than dramatizes. No bold structural risk; the accumulative design is legible but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Witness present throughout but makes no decisions that narrow options. Paces, traces spines, places dictionary—observational actions without trade-offs. Final act ("understanding poured from them") is summary, not choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dictionary appears early (paragraph 3), consulted mid-story ("revealed not definitions but doorways"), and glows at closure, filling with patterns. Returns with reweighted meaning across three beats. However, it does not constrain a choice or force a visible cost—it facilitates rather than resists.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Spiral arbitration named early, reappears in paragraph 12 ("cyclically engage with contradictions"), intensifies near closure. Shapes thematic layer but does not alter on-page tactics or narrow options. Functions as conceptual frame rather than mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Wanderingly exact mentioned three times (paragraphs 6, 7, 14) but describes the path's quality rather than enabling or constraining action. No visible trade-off or cost tied to this trait—label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unify appears early as task, recurs as dictionary command (paragraph 15), and climaxes in final paragraph ("all unified into one resounding hush"). Shapes the dominant stake and closure image. However, the act is summarized rather than dramatized through specific choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Journeying inward while walking out introduced in paragraph 6, echoed in paragraphs 7 and 18. Described as paradoxical method but never shown to constrain movement or force a choice. Its mechanics remain metaphorical; swappable with "spiraling" or "meditating."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Ancient temple library present from opening, anchors all action, recurs in shelves/altar/resounding hush. Provides atmosphere and final staging for dictionary placement. However, it does not pressure choices—shelves rearrange by intention, removing friction. Postcard description elevated by closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Universe's hiccup introduced paragraph 9, noted as brief temporal anomaly, referenced at peak (paragraph 21). Frames urgency in exposition but does not tighten on-page decisions or alter witness's moves. Clock remains abstract, not live.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation to unravel cosmic illusions stated early (paragraph 8), drives task framing, and connects to closure ("unravel cosmic illusions manifested as understanding poured"). Desire is clear but never conflicted—no competing want or visible cost tests commitment. Told rather than dramatized through friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Resounding hush established in opening line, recurs five times, deepens at closure ("one resounding hush of completion"). Tone remains static—no modulation under pressure—but the final reprise charges the image and reweights prior mentions. Coherent through turns; lyric reprise lifts score.</comment>
