<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains a passive conduit for celestial gift and community transformation rather than a protagonist who faces genuine internal contradiction. The seasonal muteness is labeled as "gift of heightened perception" but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost; it functions as backdrop flavor. The final moment—"she climbed to the highest point... and gazed upon the world below"—offers no earned alteration, only serene witnessing. Motivation is declared ("preserve the color of wonder") yet never tested against a competing need or fear that would force a trade-off with felt price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers images (bells, fragment, colors, light) toward a thematic crescendo. Orientation is clean by the opening lines. However, closure fails the cost test—Elara's death produces "a spectrum of colors never before seen," but this is reward, not renunciation or foreclosed path. The narrative summarizes decades in the final third without dramatizing a single pivot where agency narrows options. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the sculpture succeeds effortlessly and the legacy endures unchanged, yielding Conceptual Repricing without undeniable cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering bluff, bell tower, and iceberg fragment anchor the setting vividly. Sensory detail—"glowed with inner light when struck," "glisten with a thousand colors"—is selective and purposeful. The fragment and tower constrain Elara's work spatially, and the sculpture's position "catch[es] the light of dawn," charging the final image. Minimal occupational depth (bell-tuning mechanics) and no spatial choreography under pressure prevent higher scores, but micro-setting (tower, fragment, mirrors) does enable the central action and recurs at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"preserve the color of wonder"—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal forces Elara to choose between competing goods or accept a visible loss; the iceberg fragment "never diminished," the sculpture succeeds without friction, and communities adopt the innovation seamlessly. The only potential tightening—Elara's aging hands—is mentioned but does not alter tactics or outcomes. Escalation is summarized ("weeks... in feverish diligence") rather than dramatized, and closure rewards rather than forecloses, violating the cost requirement under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—communication beyond words through resonant harmony—emerges from the iceberg fragment, sculpture, and color patterns. The final image ("a spectrum of colors never before seen") attempts to reweight the material, but it arrives as cosmic validation rather than a question complicated by cost. The piece leans toward thesis ("symphonies of truth revealed... more complex and nuanced than any language") rather than letting particulars speak. Subtext in gesture and silence is absent; all meaning is narrated. The ending offers resonance but no felt ambiguity or price to charge it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited anchored to Elara. Perceptual signature is present—"feel vibrations others couldn't detect"—but diction remains generic high-register across emotional beats without character-specific idiom or syntactic variation. Filter verbs ("could feel," "would often find") dull immediacy. Narrative distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure; the prose texture does not shift between seasons of speech and muteness. No dialogue appears. The voice reads competent but not distinctive or rhythmically controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate, but momentum sags under summary scaffolding: "For weeks, she worked... In time, others began building... Elara grew old..." compresses pivotal beats that warrant scene. Paraphrase loops touch several passages—"symphonies of truth" appears four times without evolving function; "color of wonder" and "kinetic sculpture" recur as labels rather than charged images. Template cadence appears in the final third: "When travelers ascended... they would often find... The kinetic sculpture continued to glisten..." Figurative language is sparse and functional. Information density is moderate; many lines narrate elapsed time rather than advance on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—synaesthetic bell-tuning crystallized through celestial gift into a color-language—offers a fresh angle, and the "seasonally mute" protagonist could invert typical limitation. However, the transformation is not earned through specific lived detail or moral calculus; the iceberg fragment arrives as convenient divine intervention, the sculpture succeeds without friction, and the revolution spreads off-page. The ending echoes familiar "wise elder leaves legacy" templates. Emotional specificity and particular stakes are absent; the narrative could be recast with different setting and protagonist without altering the arc's emotional truth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that create turns. She receives the fragment, works "in feverish diligence" (summarized), and gazes at the world before dying—observation and execution, not choice under pressure. Setup and development gates are met by presence; closure participation is passive witnessing. Swappability is high; any devoted artisan could fill the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment appears in paragraph five, is handled ("held it up to the sun"), and incorporated into the sculpture's mechanics. It returns implicitly at closure as the sculpture pulses. Two beats: discovery and integration. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables the sculpture but does not narrow options or impose cost. Specificity is high ("inner light when struck," "seemingly infinite overtones," "never diminished"), but the fragment solves rather than complicates, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" appears as a thematic label four times but does not shape on-page stakes or constrain tactics. The concept is narrated ("more complex and nuanced than any language") rather than dramatized through a choice where truth conflicts with another value. Setup is present (paragraph one notes words "become unnecessary"), and it colors the ending image, but it remains ornamental—a claim about the sculpture's effect rather than a force that alters Elara's options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara's seasonal muteness is introduced in paragraph three and labeled a "gift of heightened perception" that enables superior tuning. It appears again at closure ("as the season of muteness approached once more"). However, it never constrains an on-page action with visible cost or forces a trade-off. The attribute is described but not dramatized as a live friction. Two gates met (setup, closure mention), but swappability is high and causal pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears twice: the fragment "began to glisten with a thousand colors" (paragraph seven), and the sculpture "continued to glisten through countless seasons" (final paragraph). The action is tied to the fragment's discovery and the sculpture's enduring function, shaping the creation beat and charging the legacy image. However, no major turn traces specifically to glistening rather than the fragment's broader luminous properties; the verb could be replaced with "shimmer" or "radiate" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The kinetic sculpture is named and described in paragraph ten, its mechanics detailed ("array of finely tuned crystal strings and mirrors that would capture and refract the sounds... into patterns of light"), and it becomes the central communication device for the communities below. It shapes multiple beats (creation, daily use, legacy) and appears at closure. Early signal is absent—it arrives past the 40% mark as the solution rather than a constraint shaping prior attempts. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement, but late arrival and swappability (any light-refracting mechanism could serve) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The whispering bluff is named in the opening line and closing paragraph, framing the story spatially. Communities below look up to the colors, and travelers ascend in later generations. The bluff enables the sculpture's visibility and isolation but does not constrain a choice or supply resources that alter Elara's tactics under pressure. Setup and closure gates met; development gate weak. The setting functions as backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" appears in the opening line and is restated in the final line ("after words had become truly unnecessary"). The timeframe provides thematic context but does not tighten decisions or track a live clock. No deadline or temporal scarcity shapes Elara's work; decades pass in summary. The phrase is ornamental, a world-building detail rather than a constraint. Setup and closure mention met; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is declared in paragraph eleven as Elara's "singular motivation" and echoes in the final image. The desire is told rather than dramatized through a scene where preserving wonder conflicts with another need or costs her something specific. No on-page friction tests this want against fear or competing value. Setup is late (past midpoint), development is absent, and closure participation is thematic echo rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" is named in paragraph twelve and manifests in Elara's wordless devotion, seasonal muteness, and "feverish diligence." The tone is coherent across the piece—restrained intensity without explosive emotion. It modulates slightly at closure (the "final symphony" pulses with unprecedented color), charging the ending image. However, tone remains static through summarized decades; no micro-modulation under on-page pressure. The phrase itself is a meta-label rather than emergent from diction and rhythm.</comment>
