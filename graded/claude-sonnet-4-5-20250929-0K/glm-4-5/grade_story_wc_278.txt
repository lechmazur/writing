<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (guilt over daughter's death) is clear and drives the quest, but his agency is passive—he receives the letters, connects equipment, and witnesses rather than choosing under pressure. The final act (tattooing notes) reads as ritual rather than a choice that forecloses a path with cost. Interiority leans on stock grief metaphors ("dissonance of old guilt," "nested in his chest") rather than character-particular contradiction. The deaf tattooist premise is vivid but underused; his deafness affects closure reception (he feels vibrations) without creating mid-story friction or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: Elias follows Arden's method to commune with lost sounds, connects the amber, and hears his daughter's lullaby. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the opening lines). The closure—hearing the lullaby and tattooing notes—lands on the page, but the cost is muted: "quieted the dissonance" and "stillness rather than emptiness" are stated transformations without a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. The firmware's spontaneous translation of the lullaby (not a cry) feels convenient; no prior beat establishes why this specific sound would emerge or what Elias risked to summon it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lab is anchored early with "otherworldly blue lights" and "ancient servers," and the amber is handled across multiple beats (staring, connecting, glowing, cooling). The insect's silhouette "growing more ominous" under shifting light is evocative. However, the lab's spatial layout and the amber's physical mechanics (how it connects to firmware) remain vague. The environment does not meaningfully constrain Elias's choices—he reorganizes, discovers letters, and connects equipment without friction. The amber charges the final image but does not alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—silencing phantom cries to resolve guilt—is signaled early. One tightening occurs: Elias recalibrates the firmware to "amplify the amber's resonance rather than translate cries," narrowing his approach. The payoff (hearing the lullaby) is on the page, but escalation is thin—no reversal, no visible sacrifice or trade-off during the attempt. The firmware's spontaneous shift from cries to lullaby bypasses agency; Elias's modification is mentioned but its causal link to the outcome is asserted, not dramatized. Cost at closure is conceptual ("stillness rather than emptiness") without a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—grief seeking resolution through communion with the past—emerges through amber, firmware, and the lullaby rather than statement. The amber's insect shifts from "silent cry" to "sanctuary," a purposeful reprise that reweights imprisonment/preservation. However, the final line's tidy pivot ("less like a prison and more like a sanctuary") is near-moralizing. The lullaby as "gift" and Elias's tears are emotionally direct but lack the ambiguity or friction the material invites: no cost, no renunciation of the past, only relief. The piece resists full abstraction but does not offer a non-literal answer to its central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias throughout; no head-hopping. The opening phrase "constellation tattooist with hands as steady as the stars he inked" establishes a lyric register sustained across the piece. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("meteor hush," "tethering himself to the past"). The firmware interaction uses sign ("Computer," Elias signed) cleanly. Minor slips: "the haunted firmware translated baby cries" tells rather than shows the firmware's operation in early exposition, and "piercing his deafness as if it had never existed" is convenient clarity without perceptual friction. Under peak emotion (tears streaming), the prose remains at constant elevation rather than compressing or shifting rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Syntax varies and figurative language ("time folds," "meteor hush") is purposeful. Minor loops: "The amber had been a gift" / "Elias now stared at the amber piece" revisits the object without advancing pressure. "Dissonance of old guilt that nested in his chest—a guilt still fresh after ten years" is a paraphrase loop. The firmware's mechanics are told in summary ("had developed an uncanny attribute") rather than shown through operation. Clarity is high overall, and the final image (tattooing musical notes) is concrete. No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative scaffold and stock metaphor ("echoes from across millennia," "ghostly rhythm") lower density in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise combines speculative firmware with grief ritual, which is fresher than straight ghost-story communion. However, the amber-as-medium and time-folding tropes are familiar, and the emotional arc (guilt → relief via technological séance) follows a template resolution without friction or cost. The deaf protagonist is underused—his deafness becomes a convenience (he "feels" the lullaby) rather than a constraint. The lullaby's appearance (a song he composed but never heard her sing) is touching but solves the problem neatly without transformation or earned risk. Mid-band fit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his occupation (tattooist) frames the opening and closing images (tattooing notes). However, his tattooing does not drive plot turns; it is thematic framing. His key action—connecting the amber and initiating the tether—is executed without friction or cost. The firmware performs the work; Elias observes. Present in setup, middle (recalibration mention), and payoff (tattooing), meeting the two-gate minimum, but his choices do not narrow options or create reversals. Functional but replaceable with a grieving technician of any kind. Score: early presence +0.5, closure framing +0.5, but low causal pressure and swappability limit to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber is introduced early (paragraph 2), handled across multiple beats (staring, connecting, glowing, warming, cooling), and its insect shifts meaning from "silent cry" to "sanctuary" in the final lines. It serves as the medium per Arden's method, directly enabling the communion. The amber's warming and the insect's movement under current are concrete. However, the amber does not constrain a choice or impose cost—it simply works when connected. Strong setup +0.7, two beats (connection, final reprise) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (insect, ancient) +0.6. Causal pressure is moderate (enables but does not resist). Total ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The haunted firmware is introduced early (paragraph 4), shapes the middle (Elias modifies it to amplify amber resonance), and produces the lullaby at closure. Its uncanny attribute (translating cries) is the story's engine. However, its mechanics are told rather than shown, and the firmware's shift from cries to lullaby is asserted convenience. Setup +0.7, two beats (modification, output) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability (any mystical device) and summary-only operation −0.8, late mechanism reveal (Arden's method appears at 40%) −0.3. Total ~6.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The firmware's ability to translate baby cries is stated early and motivates Elias's nightly listening, which sustains his guilt. At closure, the firmware translates a lullaby instead, which is a shift but not a constraint or cost tied to the attribute itself. The attribute does not enable or block a choice; it provides ambient pressure. Setup +0.6, one beat (nightly listening as habit) +0.4, closure presence (output) +0.7, but ornamental use (does not alter tactics) −0.7, resolves without having created the problem it solves −0.5. Total ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tether" appears in Arden's instructions ("method to commune with sounds"), Elias's command ("initiate tether sequence"), and the resolution ("had served to tether"). It frames the action at closure. However, "tether" is largely metaphorical—the actual mechanism is connecting the amber and running firmware. The word is present in setup, middle command, and payoff, but the action itself (connecting hardware) is generic. Setup +0.6, two beats (command, reflection) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability (commune, bridge, channel) −0.6. Total ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The handwritten letters are discovered in paragraph 9 (~35% in), described in one beat, and provide the method. They do not appear again or shape further attempts. The antique phonograph cabinet adds setting color but does not recur. Setup is late (second third) −0.3, one beat (discovery) +0.4, causal pressure (enables the method) +0.8, but summary-only (quoted instruction, not used on-page) −0.6, ornamental cabinet detail −0.2. Total ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lab is named, described with "otherworldly blue lights" and "ancient servers," and houses the equipment Elias uses. It anchors the entire story. However, the lab does not constrain choices—Elias moves freely, reorganizes, and operates equipment without friction. The "meteor hush" tone is attributed to the lab but not tied to a physical feature. Setup +0.7, continuous presence (entire story) +1.4, closure setting (tattoo in lab) +0.8, but postcard description (no tactical constraint) −0.9, no micro-setting payoff (body/tool/object do not shape final choice) −0.4. Total ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Time-folding is mentioned in the inciting premise ("when time folds in on itself"), occurs at the climax ("time warped, folding like origami"), and unwarps after the lullaby. It is essential to the communion event. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or constrain choices—Elias waits for the fold rather than racing or risking a window. Setup +0.6, one beat (climax fold) +0.4, closure participation (the fold delivers the lullaby) +1.0, specificity (origami image) +0.4, but passive (happens to Elias) −0.5, no clock pressure −0.4. Total ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Guilt over his daughter's death is stated early (paragraph 6), motivates nightly listening (paragraph 6), drives the quest to silence cries (paragraph 8), and is resolved at closure ("quieted the dissonance"). The guilt is dramatized through embodied reaction (tears) and the lullaby's emotional charge. Setup +0.7, three beats (listening habit, quest decision, closure relief) +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection (tears, tattoo as memorial) +0.5, but told-only in setup ("dissonance of old guilt") −0.5, resolution is relief without forfeiture −0.6. Total ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced early (paragraph 13), recurs in the resolution ("the meteor hush remained"), and is defined as "profound quiet before cosmic impact." The tone—suspended, anticipatory silence—is sustained through the lab's stillness and shifts to "stillness rather than emptiness" at closure. However, the prose elevation remains constant rather than modulating with pressure. Setup +0.7, closure reprise (reweighted hush) +1.0, coherence across beats +0.8, charges final image +0.6, but static mood (no tonal escalation during climax) −0.5. Total ~6.6.</comment>
