<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thomas's motivation is clear—preserving legacy—but his interior remains abstract through most beats. The discovery of his aunt in the photograph provides a personal stake, yet the emotional response feels summarized rather than embodied ("understood then what he must do"). The final action (phone calls, gathering evidence) is stated but not dramatized, weakening the sense of earned change. Internal contradiction and micro-choices under pressure are largely absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early (warden, ridgeway, reservoir). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: details layer (wind chime → label → photographs → aunt's image) toward a conceptual repricing where Thomas reframes his role from complicit manager to truth-teller. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing his new stance in the final dawn image. However, the cost is asserted ("expunge the false narrative") rather than felt in a specific forfeiture or friction on the page, and the phone-call resolution is summarized, not shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ridgeway, emerging town structures, and cabin anchor space effectively. Sensory details (violet/indigo twilight, mirrored hush, glinting label) are vivid and filtered through Thomas's reflective lens. The liqueur label and photographs function as micro-setting objects that constrain discovery and charge the final image. However, spatial choreography during the cabin scene (journals, photographs) lacks tactile specificity, and the ridgeway does not pressure a choice—it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the town's truth—signals early and remains coherent. The accumulative deepening (wind chime → label → trail of photographs → aunt's image) narrows Thomas's options from passive remembrance to active advocacy. Yet the resolution (phone calls, petitions) is told rather than dramatized, and no live opposition tests his commitment on the page. The cost is conceptual (recognizing complicity) but not viscerally felt in a trade-off or sacrifice within the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as corrective, silence transformed into meaning—emerges organically from the resurfacing town and Thomas's discovery. The liqueur label and photographs function as particulars that resist abstraction. However, the final paragraph veers toward thematic summary ("spinning silence into meaning once and for all," "reclaimed truth") rather than trusting the image to carry resonance. The aunt's defiant photograph offers a strong non-literal answer, but the phone-call resolution dilutes the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Thomas; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("precisely humane," "mirrored hush," "expunge"), though some phrases ("hovering just below consciousness," "crystallize") edge toward abstract register not fully earned by Thomas's interiority. No dialogue present. The perceptual signature is contemplative but generic; Thomas's way of noticing (twilight, echoes, stillness) could belong to many reflective narrators. Psychic distance is consistent but does not modulate with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and several images land cleanly ("sapphire-hued liqueur label," "mirrored hush"). However, scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "deeper into the town's history, deeper into forgotten corners" repeats structure without added pressure; "the reservoir town would no longer be merely water and memory, but reclaimed truth" restates theme already implicit. Filter verbs ("felt compelled," "seemed to hold") dull immediacy in reflective beats. The final two paragraphs summarize action (phone calls, gathering evidence, dawn watch) rather than dramatizing, flattening momentum at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The resurfacing-town premise is familiar but executed with care. The liqueur label as artifact and the photograph trail offer specific texture. However, Thomas's arc—complicit functionary awakening to advocacy—follows a recognizable template, and the aunt's defiant image is a convenient hinge rather than an earned synthesis of prior particulars. The mirrored-hush tone and "precisely humane" trait feel prompt-adjacent, ornamental rather than transformed. Risk-taking is modest; the piece chooses safety in summary over dramatized confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Thomas is present throughout and his observation drives discovery (label, photographs, aunt). However, his key decision—to expunge the false narrative—is told in summary ("understood then what he must do") rather than dramatized in a scene with friction. The phone calls and petition preparation are recounted, not shown, limiting agency to passive realization rather than enacted choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sapphire-hued liqueur label appears twice: discovered on the ridgeway (beat one) and referenced in the cabin search (beat two). It triggers Thomas's memory and links to the aunt's photograph. However, its specific properties (airtight preservation, familiar logo) do not constrain a later choice or reweight the ending image—it functions as a catalyst but remains static after initial discovery.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The reservoir town resurfacing shapes the entire premise: water recedes, structures emerge, and Thomas's discovery becomes possible. It appears in opening, middle (emerging rooftops with the label), and closure (dawn touching rooftops). The concept constrains tactics (treading carefully, timing of exposure) and charges the final image with the town's literal reemergence paralleling truth's return. Removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" is labeled twice (opening and midpoint) as defining Thomas's wardenship but never dramatizes a visible tradeoff. The trait is asserted to demand truth-telling, yet we do not see a moment where precision or humanity constrains his method or costs him an easier path. It remains a descriptor rather than an active attribute shaping on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears once, late in the story, as Thomas's resolution. It names his intention but is not enacted on the page—phone calls and petitions are summarized, not dramatized. The action could be swapped for "reveal," "correct," or "challenge" with minimal structural change. It does not redefine prior beats or create a visible consequence before the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The trail of photographs is signaled early ("following this first image") and unfolds across the middle: slipped between journal pages, depicting protests and final days, leading to the aunt's image. The mechanics matter: each photo adds a piece, narrowing mystery toward personal connection. The method shapes Thomas's discovery arc and the photographs are gathered at closure, participating in his resolve. However, the trail's logic (why hidden? who placed them?) is not explained, slightly weakening causal tightness.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway at twilight anchors the opening and closing images (dawn touching rooftops). It provides spatial grounding and atmospheric charge ("muted shades of violet and indigo," "mirrored hush"). However, the ridgeway does not constrain Thomas's movement or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The cabin (middle setting) also lacks friction; objects are accessed without obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The wind chime's silence signals the water level drop, opening the discovery window. However, time itself is vague: "thirty years" of wardenship, "decades-long submersion," and "as dawn approached" mark duration but do not tighten on-page decisions. No live clock pressures Thomas's choices in the cabin or during his resolve. The timeframe functions as a narrative marker rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To spin stories into shared meaning" is stated early as Thomas's motivation, distinguishing him from other wardens. It shapes his reflective lens and justifies his final action (calling historians, petitioning for recognition). However, the desire is told rather than shown in friction—Thomas faces no counter-pressure that tests his commitment to shared meaning over personal safety or institutional loyalty. The motivation drives theme but not dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" is named explicitly and sustained through imagery: "silence signaled," "quiet symmetry," "reflection of sky in water, past in present," and the final stillness at dawn. Tone remains contemplative and elegiac throughout, modulating subtly from discovery (wonder) to resolve (charged purpose). However, the tone does not tension meaningfully during the recognition beat or accelerate in the phone-call summary, staying static rather than charging the closure with contrast or pressure.</comment>
