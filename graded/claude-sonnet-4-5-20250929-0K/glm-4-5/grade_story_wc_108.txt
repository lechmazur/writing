<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's core motivations—fear and desire for truth—are stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("vulnerability is power," "firmly adaptive") that read as labels rather than lived experience. Her phobias are mentioned but never constrain an actual choice; she simply stands and faces the threat without visible cost. The final "authentic Maya" epiphany arrives unearned, more assertion than dramatized shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as attempted Causal but collapses into summary exposition. The Orientation Test fails: we open mid-action with backstory blocking who/where/when anchors until well past 120 words (−0.4). No meaningful on-page reversal occurs; Maya decrypts the cast off-page between paragraphs, then stands to face silhouettes in a static tableau. The "closure" is a declarative stance ("I have truth") with no visible cost, decisive change, or resonant reconfiguration—just thematic assertion. Closure form is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rusted library and broken skylight provide atmospheric detail, but setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is vague—"between shelves," "restricted section," "grand entrance"—without coherent layout. The cast and seashell are handled, but their physical properties (phosphorescent glow, warmth) feel ornamental rather than tactical. The stars and constellations return at the end but do not alter Maya's options or charge her choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—evade The Production and reach her mother—is declared but never tested on the page. No escalation occurs; Maya completes the decryption off-stage, then simply stands. The approaching footsteps arrive as convenient threat rather than earned complication. Her "vulnerability" tactic is told, not demonstrated through a trade-off or visible price. Pressure is static summary rather than tightening choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in mantra form ("vulnerability is power") and repeated without dramatization. The final paragraph delivers explicit thesis: "her greatest strength had always been hiding within her deepest fears"—pure moralizing that replaces scene pressure. The seashell's "approval" and Maya's transformation into "authentic Maya" are asserted concepts, not earned from particulars. No ambiguity or counter-reading remains; the piece telegraphs its moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register unsuited to a terrified protagonist mid-crisis: "ethereal patterns," "phosphorescent glow," "transformative betrayal," "internationally famous." Filter verbs cluster in peak beats ("she'd been doubled for," "she believed," "she'd discovered"). The seashell's dialogue feels expository rather than voice-driven. Psychic distance remains distant even at climax, abstracting rather than embodying pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy scaffold and paraphrase loops throughout: paragraph 2 ("secret phobias...claustrophobia and cleithrophobia warred") is immediately restated in paragraph 7 ("phobias had made her...terror threatening to paralyze"). Template cadence runs dominate: "The seashell had been...the seashell murmured...the seashell grew warmer...the seashell whispered" (−0.6). Mixed metaphors: "vulnerability is power" contradicts "unstoppable power of absolute truth." Elevated diction in crisis beats ("menacing silhouettes," "cascading starlight," "adrenaline-fueled action films") flattens immediacy. Artifacts touch closure beat (final paragraph recycles "unstoppable power"), triggering disallow 9+ globally and cap 8.8 per artifact rule (−1.7 baseline).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—stunt double discovers she's secret heiress hunted by shadowy organization—follows template action-thriller beats without fresh angle. The "vulnerability as strength" mantra is stated rather than transformed through specific action. Phobias (claustrophobia/cleithrophobia) are mentioned but don't shape any tactical choice. The whispering seashell and decoder-cast feel like prompt-furniture assembled rather than organically necessary. No risk-taking or synthesis that reweights familiar elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Phobia-ridden stunt double is introduced (setup gate met) but the phobias never constrain a choice. Maya's profession informs backstory exposition but doesn't alter present tactics. The final beat contrasts "phobia-ridden professional" with "authentic Maya," but this is assertion, not demonstrated decision. Swappable with "secret agent" or "trained operative" with minor edits. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Whispering seashell appears in paragraphs 1, 4, 6, 12, 15, 20, 21 (setup, development, payoff gates met). It "whispers" guidance and "grows warmer," but these are reactions, not properties that constrain Maya's choices. The seashell's "ancient approval" at closure is symbolic commentary rather than tactical use. Present across beats but functionally passive; removing it would require only thematic adjustment, not plot restructure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is the backstory inciting event (mentor's reveal) that motivates Maya's current hiding. It shapes her emotional state and justifies her quest, meeting setup and thematic development. However, the betrayal itself happened off-page three days ago and doesn't evolve or deepen during the present action. No new layer of betrayal or trust complicates the ending. Functional but past-tense; the story could center on a different inciting trauma with similar structure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is stated in paragraph 7 as a label: "Maya had always been firmly adaptive, turning fear into fuel." This trait is told rather than shown through on-page action. No moment demonstrates her adapting tactics under new pressure; she performs the same decrypt-and-stand sequence throughout. The attribute exists as characterization assertion without constraining or enabling a visible choice. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Outwit" is declared as the plan in paragraph 8 ("outwit The Production") and referenced in paragraph 17 ("outwit her hunters not with strength...but with vulnerability"). However, no actual cunning tactic unfolds on the page. Maya decrypts a cast (off-stage mechanics), then stands to face her hunters—a confrontation, not an outwitting. The "vulnerability" strategy is asserted thematically but not executed through clever misdirection or tactical decision. Functional label, replaceable with "escape" or "confront."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The child's cast with smudged notes is discovered in paragraph 9 (setup met) and decrypted by paragraph 12, revealing coordinates and "Return" (development met). The decryption enables the plot turn and is referenced at closure ("completed the final decryption"). However, the mechanics are entirely off-page—"phosphorescent glow...made the faint writing slightly easier to decipher" is the sole detail. The method could be "decoding her mother's journal" or "cracking a digital file" with minor edits. Functional but generic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Rusted library under stars is established in paragraphs 1–3 (setup met) and anchors the entire scene. The broken skylight provides light for decryption (paragraph 10, weak development). Stars and "cascading starlight" frame the final confrontation (payoff met). However, setting doesn't constrain Maya's choices—she could decrypt and confront anywhere. The "restricted section" and "double doors" are mentioned but don't create tactical friction. Atmospheric container rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after discovering you're not who you thought" is explicitly anchored: "Just three days ago, her mentor...had revealed that Maya wasn't the orphan she believed" (paragraph 5, setup met). This discovery motivates all present action (development met). The ending reconfigures her identity from "useful tool to...unsuspecting heiress" and "authentic Maya" (payoff met). The timeframe shapes the dominant emotional stake across the arc. However, the three-day gap is static backstory; no urgency tightens within the present scene. Functional cause, modest pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to prove that vulnerability is power" is stated as mantra in paragraph 11 and repeated in paragraphs 17, 22. It frames the thematic stance and is invoked at closure. However, this desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. Maya never faces a trade-off between vulnerability and self-protection; she simply declares her stance without visible cost. The motivation is thematic assertion rather than lived friction. Present but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tone "trembling certainty" is embodied in the opening line ("heart pounding...whispering seashell half in her trembling hands") and sustained through "trembling certainty" (paragraph 16), "smiled through her heart-pounding fear" (paragraph 18), and the paradox of terror plus determination at closure. The tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image's juxtaposition of fear and resolve. However, execution leans on repeated "trembling" and "heart-pounding" rather than varied embodiment. Coherent and present at closure, but somewhat mechanical.</comment>
