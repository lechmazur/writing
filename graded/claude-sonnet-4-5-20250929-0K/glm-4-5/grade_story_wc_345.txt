<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elion's motivation is told but never tested through meaningful choice; he simply guides from off-stage without conflict or cost. Aris is labeled "strangely trustworthy" yet her interiority is entirely absent—she functions as a conduit, not a character with contradictory impulses. The community exists as a collective abstraction; no individual voices, embodied emotion, or micro-choices emerge. The story summarizes outcomes ("descendants still thanked," "triumph") rather than dramatizing pressure that would earn those states.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative lens but never teaches a pattern or builds density through reweighted imagery; instead it strings declarative summaries across generations without causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but the closure—"their strange history continued to blossom"—offers no decisive change, no renunciation with visible cost, and no conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The watering-bell discovery is recounted ("After weeks," "remarkable," "ancient device") rather than dramatized, flattening what should be the central turn. Generations pass in the final third via summary, erasing any chance for on-page pressure or felt consequence at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Floating arches, violet sunsets, and the nebula of respite are vivid but ornamental; none constrains a choice or charges the final image. The watering bell's mechanics ("mist that carried symbiotic butterfly larvae") appear once without sensory grounding or tactile interaction. Spatial choreography is clean in the opening paragraphs, but the story abandons concrete setting for abstraction ("central orchard," "their walkways") as it progresses, never using proximity or access to shape a character decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revitalizing failing crops—is signaled early but resolved off-stage through summary ("showed signs of renewed vitality within days"). No on-page tightening or reversal tests Elion's or Aris's commitment; the watering bell simply works, and the community simply follows instructions. Escalation is replaced by declarative statements of success ("collective action," "triumph"), and the multigenerational coda drains any remaining pressure. No protagonist agency drives the turn; discovery and implementation happen in reported summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The theme of strangers-becoming-family is stated in dialogue with the reader ("from strangers into family," "strangers fully become family") rather than emerging from particulars. "Brambled hope" is asserted twice without imagery that embodies tangled resilience or setback. The butterfly-watering-bell symbol is introduced and then labeled ("symbol of rebirth") rather than allowed to resonate through contrasting reuse. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("forever interconnected, forever thriving") instead of offering a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient distance is stable but generic; the prose lacks perceptual signature—Elion's ghost-eye and Aris's "trustworthy" perspective are indistinguishable from each other and from the narrator's declarative register. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Reflection is mostly summary ("Elion knew," "The community had transformed"), and filter verbs ("watched," "knew," "spoke of") stack without motivation. The final third shifts into documentary mode ("Generations later," "Arche studying their history"), abandoning any character lens entirely.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template stems pervade the text: "strangers into family" recurs four times without variation, "floating rock arches" appears in decorative position three times, and paragraph openers recycle "The" and "Elion" stems across adjacent beats. Stock phrases ("quiet satisfaction," "underlying hope," "forever thriving") replace concrete imagery. The line "brambled hope—tangled yes, with setbacks and challenges, but ultimately resilient" is meta-commentary that tells rather than showing texture. Simultaneity errors appear ("As Aris brought… the community gathered") when sequence is unclear, and the final section summarizes centuries in three paragraphs, collapsing momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ghost-guide premise is familiar; the transformation comes only through the agricultural-tech specificity of the butterfly watering bell, which is mentioned but not rendered in tactile or novel detail. The chalked-message mechanic is present but unexplored—why chalk, why dawn, what constraints does it impose? The story hedges every risk: Elion succeeds, the community trusts, the crops recover, and descendants honor the past. No bold perspectival or structural choice disrupts the template "benevolent ghost saves colony" arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elion the altruistic ghost is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or stakes; he simply observes and delivers messages off-stage. Label-only altruism without on-page conflict or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The butterfly garden watering bell appears in the discovery beat and the community-gathering beat, satisfying the two-touch threshold. However, its mechanics are recounted in summary ("turned a small release of water into a mist") rather than handled or dramatized, and it does not return with reweighted meaning in the closure. It enables the solution but does not constrain earlier choices or carry visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is mentioned three times as backdrop ("shimmered in the night sky," "passed closest to Veridia") but never shapes stakes, alters tactics, or pressures a choice. Ornamental description only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Aris's "strangely trustworthy" attribute is asserted ("never doubted") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Her trust is label-only; no tradeoff or consequence appears.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears in the chalked directive and Aris's discovery action ("reexamine the forgotten eastern cropping fields," "Aris finally followed the instruction thoroughly"). It drives one beat but could be swapped for "search" or "investigate" with minimal edits; the verb itself does not carry irreplaceable meaning or recur with charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn frame the ghost's method early and recur across multiple beats ("elegant script appeared," "chalked guidance," "chalked messages now instructed"). The dawn timing and deserted-sidewalk constraint are signaled but never tested—no one interrupts, no chalk runs out, no message is misread. The method enables the plot but does not impose cost or narrow options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is described vividly in the opening and closing but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. The arches become monuments in the final paragraph, a thematic echo rather than a causal pressure. Postcard setting without tactical use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is asserted as a timeframe label but not dramatized as a pressure point. The story recounts transformation ("from strangers into family," "strangers fully become family") without showing the before-state or a moment when that shift closes off an earlier option. Time is vague ("over generations," "within days") and does not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elion's motivation "to orchestrate collective effort" is stated early and drives the chalked-message mechanic across multiple beats. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no friction between his desire and the cost of noncorporeality, no failed attempt that complicates the goal. The motivation is present and functional but lacks visible tradeoff or conflicted choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is named once as a tonal descriptor ("tangled yes, with setbacks and challenges, but ultimately resilient") and echoed in the final line ("brambled hope… transformed into the tangled roots"). The label is asserted rather than enacted through modulation under pressure, and the ending image softens into "forever thriving" optimism, abandoning the bramble. Static mood with a forced reprise.</comment>
