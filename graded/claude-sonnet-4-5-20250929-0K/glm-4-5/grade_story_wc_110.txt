<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "thaw mistrust with transparency" is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The pivotal choice to leave the lens behind arrives cleanly but lacks prior on-page struggle between her desire for transparency and the ethical cost of invasion. Interior language relies on abstract concepts ("barriers between people," "self-imposed prisons of silence") rather than concrete, character-particular sensory anchors. The final renunciation feels declared rather than earned through visible internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Closure reads as Earned Stasis—Elara chooses not to use the lens—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page; no prior tactical choice was foreclosed to make the renunciation urgent. The lens is applied as Causal/Accumulative Hybrid, yet escalation between discovery and decision consists largely of reflection rather than narrowing options. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within range, but the "after words became unnecessary" premise functions as backdrop rather than constraint that shapes her patrol choices. The "hidden chamber" discovery and same-night decision compress causality without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt is evoked with sensory specificity ("raindrops on the crystal structures creating a soft melody") and recurs to frame the ending, achieving a charged reprise. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices during the patrol; the projector booth, hidden chamber, and crystal structures serve as stage dressing rather than spatial obstacles or resources that alter her tactics. The lens qualifies as a tool that enables her discovery, lifting the score into the mid-6s despite the setting's largely atmospheric function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elara will use the lens to reveal hidden truths—is signaled early but never faces an on-page test that narrows her options under pressure. Discovery of the lens and the hidden chamber unfolds without complication; no secondary character, resource constraint, or time pressure forces a trade-off. The final choice to leave the lens behind is a renunciation, but it arrives without prior agency that foreclosed a live option or imposed visible cost. One meaningful deepening (the map leading to the chamber) is present, yet escalation reads as accumulative description rather than protagonist-driven tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of transparency versus silence emerges from the premise and is charged by the lens's power, yet the resolution leans on abstract claims ("freed by honesty") rather than a non-literal final image that reweights prior particulars. The cryptic doodles function as motif but do not constrain Elara's choice at closure; they enable discovery without imposing trade-offs. Elara's decision to leave the lens and begin sharing notes offers a quiet thematic answer, but the shift from lens-use temptation to collaborative note-writing is told in summary rather than dramatized with visible cost. The "after words became unnecessary" conceit invites reflection but is underexploited in the peak choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited, and psychic distance is controlled throughout. Voice carries a lyric, slightly formal register ("the crystal whispering forecourt seemed to approve") that fits the quasi-speculative setting, though diction occasionally drifts toward generic abstraction ("self-imposed prisons of silence"). No dialogue appears on the page, so those bullets are waived. Purposeful compression in the final third (the days-later summary of note-sharing) is acceptable under the Experimental allowance, but the summary mode flattens the immediacy of Elara's internal texture at the moment of renunciation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prose is clean and grammatical, but pervasive template cadence mars momentum: "She spotted," "She picked," "She realized," "She understood," "She decided" create a list-like stem pattern across key beats. Paraphrase loops appear ("not through sound, but through visual representations" / "not to invade privacy but to create understanding"), applying −0.6 for template runs and −0.2 for synonym loops (−0.8 total in Q7). Figurative language ("ambiguously clear," "resonant hush," "thaw mistrust") is used correctly but remains abstract rather than embodied in concrete sensory anchors. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate Elara's realization without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—a post-verbal society using visual doodles and a magical lens—offers speculative potential, but the emotional arc (temptation to invade privacy → ethical renunciation) follows a familiar template without fresh inflection. The cryptic doodles and projector lens are inventive in isolation, yet their narrative function (reveal hidden truths, test integrity) maps closely to conventional "power and responsibility" frameworks. The "after words became unnecessary" setting is mentioned but not exploited to constrain Elara's choices or charge the ending with world-specific cost. No bold risk-taking in structure or tone that heightens stakes beyond the prompt's surface.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the key choice to leave the lens, but her role reads as observer-then-decider rather than agent whose decisions create turns. The discovery sequence (lens, tickets, chamber) unfolds through her patrol but is not driven by her tactical choices under pressure. The final renunciation is a decision, but it lacks prior friction or a competing goal that her choice would foreclose. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but causal pressure is limited; score lands in functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lens appears in three beats: discovery near the projector booth, use to read the doodles, and final placement in the hidden chamber. It enables the central revelation and is directly handled on the page, satisfying setup, development, and closure participation. However, the lens's specific properties (warmth, overlapping images) do not constrain Elara's tactics; it functions as a passive reveal tool rather than an object whose use imposes cost or trade-offs. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage lift the score, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (any magical reveal device would serve) cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" is stated explicitly in the final third and echoed in the ending paragraph, but it operates as theme rather than a constraint that shapes Elara's on-page choices. The concept does not alter her tactics during the patrol or impose a visible cost at the moment of renunciation. Mentioned in setup (her desire for transparency), developed as abstract motivation, and declared at closure, meeting two gates; however, the lack of on-page friction or cost tied to honesty caps the score in the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is used twice as a descriptor (the lens's images, the shared messages) but does not constrain or enable any on-page action. The attribute functions as a label rather than a trait with mechanical consequences; Elara's ability to interpret the doodles is presented as immediate rather than as a puzzle that costs time or imposes uncertainty. Ornamental use without causal pressure or visible trade-off; score remains low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Eavesdropping—reading the private thoughts encoded in the doodles—is the inciting discovery that frames Elara's ethical dilemma and is referenced again when she collects more tickets and discovers the chamber. The action is central to the premise and drives the middle sequence, but the final turn (leaving the lens) is a renunciation of further eavesdropping rather than a complication arising from the act itself. Present in setup and development, and the decision at closure is defined against it; one major turn traces to this action, placing it in the mid-5s with solid beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cryptic doodles are introduced early (scattered concert tickets), used in the middle (revealing stories and forming a map), and echoed in the ending (Elara adopts their style for notes). The method is specific and recurs across three beats, with the map doodle enabling a key discovery. However, the mechanics of interpretation are not constrained—Elara reads them instantly without cost—and the doodles do not impose a tactical limitation at closure. Setup, development, and closure participation are met; causal pressure is moderate; score lands in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt appears in the opening line, recurs in the middle ("seemed to speak to her"), and is explicitly referenced in the final third ("seemed to approve," "became a symbol"). However, the setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a spatial constraint that alters Elara's patrol choices or supplies a resource at closure. The rain and crystal melody enrich tone but do not pressure decisions. Lyric reprise is present, but lack of causal work caps the score in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After words became unnecessary" is introduced in the opening third and referenced again in the ending ("true communication needs no words"), but the timeframe does not tighten Elara's decisions or constrain her tactics during the patrol. The premise shapes the world's communicative mode (silence, doodles) yet remains a static backdrop rather than a clock or historical pressure that alters her choices. Present in setup and thematically invoked at closure, meeting two gates weakly; lack of causal constraint limits the score to low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "thaw mistrust with transparency" is stated early and motivates her discovery sequence, but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction between competing wants. The final choice to leave the lens aligns with the motivation, yet no prior scene shows her weighing transparency against privacy under pressure. Present in setup, invoked in the middle, and declared at closure; functional but lacking visible trade-offs or conflicted choices, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is named in the opening as the "preferred mode of communication" and recurs in the ending ("comfortable silence between people who truly understood each other"). The tone is coherent across beats—quiet, contemplative, lyric—and modulates slightly when Elara's heart races upon discovering the lens. The tone charges the final image by contrasting silence-as-separation with silence-as-understanding, achieving a meaningful reprise. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle modulation is present but gentle; score reaches low-6s.</comment>
