<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Arthur's telepathic gift is label-only; we never see him struggle with hearing too much or making a choice constrained by what he hears. His plan emerges from the grotto meditation without visible internal conflict or competing impulses. The final paragraph claims he's "surrounded not by students, but by fellow thinkers," but this transformation happens off-page without earned causality. Motivations remain abstract—"plant forests of second thoughts"—rather than embodied in contradictory micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors appear late (~para 7 establishes the cobalt library clearly). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the town "changed forever"—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: we're told people "began to talk" and Arthur hears "wonder rather than resignation," yet no on-page scene shows a choice foreclosed or a visible price paid. The window-display plan is summarized in one sentence; the three-week execution is told, not shown. The ending claims transformation without demonstrating it through a concrete before/after image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt library with mist and the magnetic grotto supply vivid anchors. The grotto's "starlight even though it was hundreds of feet underground" and magnetic field that amplifies Arthur's gift are specific and atmospheric. However, the library and grotto never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; they remain backdrops for reflection. The final image of "cobalt light of dawn" reprises the color motif but does not charge the closure with environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reawakening curiosity—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Arthur conceives his plan in the grotto without visible opposition or cost; the three weeks of preparation are summarized in one sentence. The unveiling succeeds immediately: "people stopped, stared, and began to talk" with no setback, adaptation, or trade-off. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift to reweight the stake, yet the text remains at a constant summary distance throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—reawakening creative thought through gentle provocation—emerges from the chess-puzzle conceit and the "forests of second thoughts" metaphor. However, the final paragraphs state the theme overtly: "forests of second thoughts... would resonate for generations," "seeing the board differently," "quiet power of possibility." The closing sentence, "all because one chess coach dared to listen to the words no one spoke aloud," functions as a thematic summary rather than a resonant image that lets the theme arise from particulars. The chess puzzles "with no prescribed solution" are a solid conceptual hook but remain generic without a specific on-page example or visible cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated—"sentinel against the twilight," "hush where past meets prophecy"—which fits a reflective chess coach's interior. Perceptual signature is present: Arthur notices "uniformity" and hears "unspoken thoughts," filtering the world through his gift. However, under peak pressure (conceiving the plan, unveiling the displays), the prose remains in the same lyric register without modulation or compression, and the telepathic gift never alters syntax or rhythm to reflect the cognitive load of hearing multiple voices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or spatial errors. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear frequently: "confusion, constraint, and cries for freedom" / "Why must we do everything this way?" restate the same idea; "small crystal that glowed with captured starlight" is repeated across beats without new information. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Arthur [verb]" or "The [noun]" without variation. Stock phrases: "sentinel against the twilight," "dance of precision and secrecy," "beautiful chaos of human creativity." These artifacts dull momentum and accumulate to approximately −1.0 in this category. The final third contains heavy telling—"something new had been planted"—that summarizes rather than propels.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—telepathic chess coach stages silent rebellion via synchronized puzzles—combines familiar elements (mentor with secret gift, underground sanctuary, puzzle as metaphor) without a fresh synthesis. The "magnetic grotto beneath the library" and "starlight hundreds of feet underground" gesture toward magical realism but remain decorative rather than causally integrated. The rebellion succeeds without complication or surprise; the town's transformation is asserted in generic terms ("wonder," "passion," "beautiful chaos") rather than shown through a specific, non-obvious turn. The core could be swapped to a different mentor figure and method (e.g., murals, poetry) with minor edits, indicating low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Arthur appears throughout but his chess-coach role is functional backdrop; his key choices (conceiving the plan, recruiting co-conspirators, watching the unveiling) are summarized rather than dramatized. He observes more than he decides. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with "concerned teacher" or "thoughtful librarian" without structural loss. Low causal pressure: −0.6 swappability, −0.5 summary-only key beats. Base 3.0 + early signal +0.4 + three beats +1.4 − penalties −1.1 ≈ 3.7, round down to 3.7. However, closure participation is weak (he stands watching, not acting), so apply missing-development cap at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The grotto appears in three beats (para 9–12, para 18, para 26) but functions identically each time: Arthur descends, feels the magnetic pull, cradles the crystal, and listens. No evolving use or reweighted meaning. The starlight and magnetic field are described but never constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure. Setup present, middle repetition without development, closure cameo (para 26) does not causally shape the ending. Early signal +0.5, three mentions (same function) +0.8, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.3 − 1.4 ≈ 2.9, but lyric reprise (para 12 "cradling... crystal" / para 26 "cradled his crystal once more") adds +0.3 for resonance ≈ 3.2. Cap at 4.2 given missing causal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Humble rebellion" is named explicitly (para 24, 29) and shapes the dominant stake—challenging rigid thinking without confrontation. It appears in setup (para 6 "how could one chess coach challenge"), development (para 14 conception, para 16–19 preparation), and ending (para 24 "humble rebellion had succeeded," para 29 "rebellion had been humble"). However, the concept remains thematic rather than constraining choices on the page: we're told it's "humble" and "gentle" but never see Arthur face a moment where he must choose humility over confrontation with visible cost. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (frames the plan) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, but summary-only execution −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.8 − 0.6 ≈ 6.2, but apply missing-cost deduction −1.1 to land at 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Arthur's telepathic gift ("hear the unspoken thoughts in students' minds") is introduced early (para 4) and recurs in beats (para 5 "Today's whispers," para 11 magnetic field "amplified his ability," para 18 "listening to... unspoken hopes and fears," para 26 "listening to the unspoken words"). However, the gift is never a constraint or enabler of an on-page choice with cost: Arthur doesn't struggle with the overwhelming noise, doesn't mishear a crucial thought, doesn't choose to ignore a plea, doesn't face a trade-off between listening and acting. Label-only mentions −0.9, no visible tradeoff −0.8. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4. Base 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.7 ≈ 3.3, round to 3.3. However, lyric reprise (para 4 "unspoken thoughts" / para 30 "words no one spoke aloud") adds +0.3 ≈ 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Cradle" appears four times (para 14 "cradling a small crystal," para 18 "cradling his crystal," para 26 "cradled his crystal once more," implied in para 11). The action is repeated identically across beats without evolving stakes or reweighted meaning. Setup present, development repetition without new causal pressure, closure cameo (para 26) does not shape the final turn. The crystal itself is inert; cradling it does not constrain or enable a choice. Early signal +0.5, four mentions +1.4, ornamental use −0.9, swappability (could be "hold," "grasp," "touch") −0.7. Base 3.0 + 1.9 − 1.6 ≈ 3.3. Lyric reprise adds +0.3 ≈ 3.6, but the gate-model two-of-three (setup + development repetition + closure cameo) allows up to ~6.0; adjust to 4.9 given weak causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Window displays are conceived in para 14, prepared in para 16 ("next three weeks... recruited artists, shopkeepers, and even some of his students"), and unveiled in para 21 ("windows... displayed identical yet unfinished chess positions"). Setup at conception, development during preparation (though summarized), payoff at unveiling. The method shapes the dominant tactic—silent provocation—and the ending image (people debating moves). However, the mechanics are told, not shown: we never see Arthur persuade a shopkeeper, design a puzzle, or face a logistical challenge. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, but summary-only execution −0.7. Base 3.0 + 4.2 − 0.7 ≈ 6.5, but apply swappability deduction (could be murals, posters, street performances) −0.7 to land at 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt library appears in setup (para 7–8), development (para 19 gathering co-conspirators), and ending (implied backdrop for Arthur's return routine). Vivid sensory anchors: "cobalt library," "otherworldly blue hue," "mist crept through narrow streets," "ancient building stood like a sentinel." The library supplies the grotto access (para 9 "hidden door in the rare books section"), and para 8 notes the librarian as "accomplice in quiet rebellions," suggesting the setting enables tactics. However, the library never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables access) +0.6, closure linkage (reprised in para 30 "cobalt light") +0.9, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.1 ≈ 7.1, but apply ornamental-use deduction −0.5 and postcard-description tendency −0.2 to land at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" appears in para 13 ("This was the hush where past met prophecy") and para 27 ("The hush where past meets prophecy had passed"). The phrase is poetic but vague: no on-page scene shows what "past" or "prophecy" means concretely, and no ticking clock or deadline constrains Arthur's choices. Time is summarized ("next three weeks," "the night before," "as dawn broke") without live pressure. Setup in para 13, closure reprise in para 27, but missing middle development and no causal tightening. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, ornamental use −0.9, vague temporality −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.3 − 1.5 ≈ 2.8, round down to 2.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Plant forests of second thoughts" is stated explicitly in para 17 and reprised in para 24 ("forests of second thoughts—questions, alternatives"). The motivation frames the dominant stake and Arthur's plan (window displays to provoke curiosity). Setup in para 6 (Arthur's question "how could one..."), development in para 17 (motivation declared), payoff in para 24 (forests bloom). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicting micro-choices: we never see Arthur weigh planting second thoughts against, say, direct confrontation or personal safety. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only execution −0.8, no visible friction −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.9 − 1.3 ≈ 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" appears in para 19 ("The amplified quiet of their planning session") and is thematically present in para 13 ("hush"), para 20 ("no banners, no slogans"), para 24 ("quiet power of possibility"), para 28 ("quiet power of possibility"). The tone is coherent—reflective, subdued—but remains static across turns without modulation. During the high-pressure unveiling (para 21–23), the prose does not shift rhythm or cadence; the "amplified quiet" label is external to the narrative texture. Setup in para 13–19, closure thematic echo in para 24–28, but missing tonal charge in the final image. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, coherence +0.4, but static mood −0.7, label-only in peak beats −0.6. Base 3.0 + 2.3 − 1.3 ≈ 4.0. Lyric reprise adds +0.3 to reach 4.3.</comment>
