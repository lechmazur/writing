<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elira's warmly inquisitive nature is asserted but rarely constrains a choice with visible cost; her actions during the ascent are primarily observational and reflective. The captain exists only in backstory and memory, so no relationship crucible or status dynamics appear on the page. Interiority often resorts to summary ("Her warmly inquisitive nature had served her well") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("seek out the joy beneath anguish") rather than embodied contradiction. The final understanding feels declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear timeframe structure (floor-by-floor ascent), and the ending delivers a Conceptual Repricing when the goggles reveal the encrypted text and Elira internalizes the captain's dual existence. However, the orientation test shows friction: "who" and "where" are anchored early, but the "when" (relationship to the captain's disappearance timeline) remains hazy until floor eight's retroactive clarification. Cost is stated abstractly ("化作 a silent promise") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or alteration of her options. The closure reweights prior material, but the price feels asserted rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire and crystalline elevator are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (floor markings, ice-crystal patterns on windows, observation deck). The goggles function as micro-setting, constraining the decryption method and charging the final revelation. However, spatial choreography within the elevator remains generic—no tactile interaction with controls or physical positioning that shapes her thoughts—and the observation deck at floor ten is described but does not constrain her final choice. The environment sets mood but does not narrow options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decrypting the diary to understand the captain's disappearance—is signaled early and tightens gradually as Elira ascends and recalls fragments. The floor-nine breakthrough (holding the diary to light through the goggles) provides one meaningful reversal that narrows the mystery. However, the discovery does not alter Elira's tactics or force a trade-off; she simply reads, understands, and descends with a vague promise to preserve dignity. Agency at closure reads as passive reception rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—the duality of public duty and private longing, the patience required to see hidden truths—emerges through the captain's encoded memories and Elira's reflective ascent. The goggles and scattered light form a coherent metaphor that reweights the premise without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges into thesis statement ("the deepest truths often unfold in the quietest moments") rather than letting the image resonate. The captain's dual existence is told more than dramatized, and Elira's closing "promise" abstracts the cost instead of anchoring it in a concrete action or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, elevated register ("warmly inquisitive," "化作 a silent promise") that suits the reflective tone. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. However, perceptual signature is generic; Elira's way of noticing does not constrain or color observations in character-specific ways beyond the role of servant. Diction occasionally drifts into workshop abstractions ("affection for the troubled man beneath the captain's facade") that flatten immediacy. The non-English character "化作" appears unexplained and disrupts otherwise stable prose without clear voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph breaks follow beats cleanly, with no major grammar errors. However, the piece suffers from scaffold and paraphrase loops: "encrypted diary" appears nine times, often in adjacent lines without new pressure; floor markers ("At floor two," "Floor five passed") create template cadence; and reflective passages recycle stems ("she recalled," "she considered," "she reflected"). The final third stacks abstract summary ("her role as an ascending servant had never been more meaningful") that dulls momentum. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice-motivated justification. Applying artifact deductions: paraphrase loops (−0.2), template cadence across multiple beats (−0.5), filter-verb stacks in key moments (−0.5), and summary opacity near closure (−0.4); cumulative −1.6 within band, and artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The airship-captain-with-secret-love premise and the servant-discovers-hidden-truth frame echo familiar templates without a sharp transformation. The floor-by-floor structure provides clear pacing, but the encrypted-diary-revealed-by-special-lenses device is mechanical rather than inevitable in hindsight. Elira's "warmly inquisitive" servant role and the captain's dual-sky metaphor feel chosen for thematic convenience rather than lived specificity. The ending's affirmation of patience and compassion is earnest but generic; removing the icebound spire and substituting another setting would not fundamentally alter the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and the POV character, but Elira's role as "ascending servant" is static; she observes, reflects, and receives revelation without a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The ascent is literal rather than transformative, and her servant status does not constrain or enable a key turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The goggles appear in beats at floors four, nine, and ten, enabling the decryption and charging the final understanding. They are handled on the page ("she lifted the goggles to her face," "held the diary up to a beam of light, angling the captain's goggles between the page and the illumination") and their optical properties drive the floor-nine breakthrough. However, they resolve a problem they did not help create earlier, and their role in the middle is minimal; most involvement clusters near the end.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The encrypted diary discovery frames the ascent and delivers the floor-nine payoff when its symbols transform into readable script. It shapes the dominant stake and appears in setup (floor two), middle (floors five, six, seven), and closure. However, the discovery is passive—Elira does not wrestle with decryption tactics; she simply waits for inspiration—and the diary's content (the captain's secret love) does not alter her present options or impose a visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is asserted in paragraph three but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Elira's observations are careful but not distinctive; the trait could be swapped for "thoughtful" or "patient" without altering any beat. It remains label-only throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears literally (the diary's symbols unfold into script at floor nine) and metaphorically (the captain's dual existence unfolds in Elira's understanding). It drives the floor-nine turn and is reprised in the final paragraphs ("unfold in the quietest moments," "unfolding of a hidden universe"). However, the action is passive—light and optics do the work—and easily swappable with "reveal" or "decipher" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Scattered light is seeded early (floor one: "crystalline walls fracturing the light into scattered patterns") and provides the decryption mechanism at floor nine ("scattered light passing through the specialized lenses"). It shapes the method of discovery and returns in the final reflection. However, it is not signaled as a puzzle element until the moment of use; Elira does not hypothesize or test light-based solutions earlier, so the method feels convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire is vividly described and frames the ascent spatially. Ice-crystal patterns on the elevator window mirror the coded writing at floor seven, and the observation deck at floor ten provides the final setting. However, the spire does not constrain Elira's choices or supply resources that alter outcome; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The elevator's mechanics are generic, and no spatial feature pressures a tactic or decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ten-floor ascent provides a clear temporal spine, with each floor marked and used to stage reflections or micro-discoveries. The timeframe tightens decisions (Elira must reach floor ten) and paces the revelation beats. The climb itself shapes the narrative rhythm and the floor-nine breakthrough is well-positioned. However, no on-page urgency (e.g., countdown, threat, witness) makes the clock press harder; the ascent feels meditative rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To seek out the joy beneath anguish" is stated at floor three and echoed in the final paragraphs as Elira discovers the captain's hidden love. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized; no scene shows Elira choosing this mission over another goal or paying a cost to pursue it. It frames her interpretation of the diary but does not force a conflicted choice or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is present in Elira's reflections ("Her detachment when serving his meals had been professional, yet she harbored affection for the troubled man") and modulates slightly as she internalizes the captain's story. The tone remains consistent and subtly charges the final image of her carrying his secret. However, the diction stays elevated and abstract throughout, with no sharp intensification or collapse under pressure; the tone is static rather than dynamically responsive to turns.</comment>
