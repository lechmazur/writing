<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is defined almost entirely by labels ("earnestly studious," "gilded-leaf stationer") and occupation exposition rather than contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. His routine at dawn is described but never tested; no competing desire or cost threatens the ritual. The final smile is an asserted emotion without embodied grounding. Interiority consists of abstract belief statements ("objects held memories") rather than character-particular perception or micro-choices that foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks on-page closure with felt cost: Elias completes his routine exactly as described at the outset, applies gold leaf, and continues—no tightening, no reversal, no foreclosed option. The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive clearly, but "when the town below had fallen silent" remains vague (permanent abandonment? nightly silence?) past the 120-word threshold without disambiguation or payoff, triggering −0.3. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural by design, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake at closure; the final image ("continued his work") reaffirms stasis without visible cost or reconfigured meaning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth and mountaintop station are vividly described ("blooming labyrinth," "miniature forest representing a different epoch"), but setting remains postcard backdrop—neither environment nor tool constrains a choice or alters tactics. The fluorescent lamp is handled at dawn but its mechanics are told rather than dramatized through spatial interaction. Spatial choreography is coherent and sensory detail is selective, preventing a lower score, yet the 9+ gate (environment/tool must constrain choice or charge final image) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to collect the textures of different times"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs: the dawn hum arrives on schedule, Elias records three notations as practiced, and the process completes without friction. Agency is observation and routine execution, not decision under pressure. The piece describes a static ritual rather than escalating conflict, and no live option is foreclosed with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Invented histories were no less real" is stated as thesis rather than dramatized through competing claims or embodied cost. The final image—gold leaf sealing observations, bonsai waiting—offers atmospheric closure but no non-literal answer that reweights prior material; the thematic question (why preserve when no one cares?) is asked but not tested on the page. Reflection dominates without anchoring micro-choices that shift present stance, and the closing smile asserts meaning rather than earning it through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent elevated diction and psychic distance throughout, with purposeful compression in phrases like "incandescent restraint" and "gilded-leaf stationer." However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—descriptions of bonsai and lamp could belong to any careful observer. The piece avoids head-hopping and sustains single-POV cleanly, but lacks the micro-modulation under pressure or distinct idiom that would reach higher bands. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and no grammar errors. However, paraphrase loops and scaffold appear: "His motivation was singular and pure: to collect the textures of different times. Most days, he did this by examining..." restates intent across adjacent paragraphs (−0.2). Template cadence in paragraphs 11–13 ("This was his core concept... His predecessors had maintained this belief... The notepad contained...") creates expository rhythm without propulsion (−0.4). Figurative language ("golden threads," "scrolls unfurling") appears in reflective beats without earning the metaphor through scene pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf stationer and temporal-texture collection premise offer surface novelty, but the piece executes a static ritual without transforming the premise through specific conflict or non-obvious moral calculus. The "invented histories are real" concept is told rather than tested. Bonsai-as-time-map and fluorescent-hum-as-temporal-resonance read as quirky ornament without causal grounding. The ending reaffirms the opening without fresh inflection or earned turn, and the setup (lone keeper of forgotten knowledge) follows a familiar template without lived-detail transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade>Elias appears throughout and performs the lamp-charting action, but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option. His role is observer executing routine; no key turn traces to his agency. Late first touch (name in paragraph 1, but causal role only in final third) and ornamental use (describes rather than decides) cap the score.</question>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade>The notepad is mentioned in paragraph 2 ("reverently handled"), paragraph 13 ("safeguarded"), and paragraph 20 ("made three notations"), satisfying the ≥2 beat requirement. It participates in the closure beat (gold leaf sealing) and is described as holding "invented histories," linking to the core concept. However, the notepad never constrains a choice or enables a tactic under pressure—it is a repository, not a tool that narrows options. Swappability is moderate; a ledger or scroll could replace it with minor edits. Early signal and closure linkage earn mid-band placement.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade>"Invented histories" is stated explicitly in paragraph 12 ("invented histories were no less real") and echoed thematically in paragraphs 14 and 23, but the concept remains thesis-level—never dramatized through a competing claim, a test of authenticity, or a cost paid for believing it. The concept does not shape on-page stakes or alter Elias's tactics; it is backdrop explanation rather than active pressure. Functional but ornamental.</question>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade>"Earnestly studious" appears as a label in paragraph 3 ("earnestly studious, a quality that had isolated him") and is restated in paragraph 27 ("earnestly studious face"). The trait is told to have isolated him but never dramatized through a choice constrained by studiousness or an on-page social friction. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to the trait; label-only use.</question>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade>"Refract" appears in the climactic beat (paragraph 19: "the hum refracted into a spectrum of frequencies") and is the mechanism by which Elias captures temporal texture. The action is causally central to the premise and shapes the peak moment. However, it is described in a single sentence without prior setup of how refraction differs from ordinary listening or what stakes depend on discerning the spectrum. The action does not narrow options or impose a visible cost; it completes as designed. Early lack of signal (first mention at closure) and swappability (the term could be "resolved," "split," "crystallized") prevent higher scoring. Closure linkage and causal role earn mid-band placement.</question>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade>The fluorescent lamp hum is introduced in paragraph 4 ("knowing that when the first light touched it, something extraordinary would happen"), revisited in paragraphs 9, 17–19 (the charting process), and referenced in paragraph 28 ("the hum faded"). The method is signaled early, dramatized at the climax, and shapes the dominant action. However, the mechanics remain opaque—how does charting a hum capture temporal texture? What cost or difficulty attends the discernment? The lamp's participation in multiple beats and closure linkage support mid-band scoring, but lack of on-page constraint or trade-off tied to the method prevents higher placement.</question>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade>The bonsai labyrinth is described vividly in paragraphs 1, 15–16, 24, and 30 (final line), satisfying early signal and closure reprise. The labyrinth is said to represent epochs and "form a complex map of time," linking thematically to the core concept. However, the setting never constrains a choice, supplies a resource, or alters tactics—it is decorative backdrop. The piece could occur in any isolated mountaintop studio with minor edits. The reprise in the final line ("blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests waited") recharges the image lyrically but does not impose cost or tighten pressure. Functional thematic link and closure presence earn low-mid band.</question>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade>"After the town below had fallen silent" frames the entire piece (paragraphs 1, 6, 31) and is reiterated as permanent abandonment ("even the stray dogs had found their final resting places"). The timeframe creates atmosphere but does not tighten decisions—silence is backdrop, not ticking clock. No urgency or cost derives from the timing; Elias's routine would proceed identically if the town were bustling. The element is present throughout and links to motivation (preserving what is lost) but remains ornamental to on-page action. Thematic presence without tactical constraint.</question>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade>"To collect the textures of different times" is stated explicitly in paragraph 7 and restated in paragraphs 8–9. The motivation frames the entire action and appears in the final paragraph ("preserving textures of time"). However, it is told rather than dramatized through friction—no competing desire, no moment where cost threatens the goal, no choice where Elias must prioritize one texture over another. The motivation is singular and uncontested, functioning as backdrop rather than live pressure. Closure linkage and thematic coherence prevent lower scoring, but lack of on-page conflict tied to the desire caps the grade.</question>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade>"Incandescent restraint" is named explicitly in paragraph 21 ("The process required incandescent restraint—emotions held in perfect balance") and coheres with the measured, elevated diction throughout. The tone is stable and modulates subtly at the dawn climax (shorter syntax in paragraphs 17–20) and the closing smile (paragraph 27). However, the tone remains static rather than charging the final image with felt cost; the ending reaffirms calm rather than reweighting it. Coherence and purposeful control earn mid-band placement, but lack of tonal shift that pressures closure prevents higher scoring.</question>
