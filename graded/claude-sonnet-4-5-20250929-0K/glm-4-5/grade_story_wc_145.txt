<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elmsley's obsession with finding river origins is established but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("scientific," "methodical grace") rather than embodied contradiction. The journey and discovery unfold without genuine internal conflict—he suspects, confirms, understands in a smooth arc with no visible cost to his stance. The custodian and falcon remain props; no relationship pressure tests his choices. The final smile and realization feel delivered rather than earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: condensation patterns recur and the coordinates confirm prior suspicion, building toward the singular convergence discovery. Orientation anchors clearly (outpost, frozen lake, Elmsley). The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—Elmsley realizes humanity's need to seek origins—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page forfeiture or altered tactic is visible. The midpoint confirmation ("coordinates that merely confirmed what he already suspected") flattens pressure rather than tightening it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and auroras provide vivid atmospheric grounding. The condensation patterns on glass recur with shifted meaning and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is clean across the journey. However, occupational detail (atlas editing, measuring instruments) remains ornamental; the tools don't constrain a choice or reveal professional priorities under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where rivers begin—is clear and sustained. The coordinates confirmation and the physical discovery constitute meaningful moves, but escalation is muted: Elmsley "already suspected" the answer, so the journey validates rather than tests. No live option is foreclosed; the discovery adds knowledge without visible cost. The final report-gathering feels procedural rather than a choice that narrows future paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of origin-seeking and the intersection of myth/science emerges through the singular convergence and condensation motifs. "Rivers begin with intention" and the closing insight about why humanity seeks origins offer thematic weight. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt statement ("realizing he had not merely found where rivers begin, but why humanity needs to seek such origins") rather than letting the image speak. The phrasebook and falcon gain symbolic charge but border on decorative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "dry-witted," "worrying tranquility," "methodical grace." The narration filters detail through Elmsley's scholarly lens (phrasebook dog-ears, atlas patterns). Distance is consistent; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue to the custodian feels purposeful and character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("herald of discovery," "planetary hydrology") but remains broadly voice-motivated for an atlas editor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence rhythm and vivid images (auroras, inverted deltas, condensation). Minor scaffold appears: "Elmsley moved to the window" and similar choreography narration that could be compressed. "Worrying tranquility" is repeated verbatim without reweighting. The phrase "made his scholarly heart beat faster" and "edge of everything" edge toward stock. No major loops or opacity, but density could tighten in transit beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The inversion of river deltas and the "singular convergence" concept offer a fresh angle on hydrological origin myths. The falcon-messenger and phrasebook details add specificity. However, the scholar-discovers-mythic-truth-in-remote-place structure is well-worn, and the transformation relies more on atmosphere than on a non-obvious synthesis of character flaw and world logic. The final realization about humanity's need to seek origins gestures toward depth but doesn't fully surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elmsley is present throughout and his choices (following the falcon, consulting the phrasebook, writing the report) drive beats. However, "dry-witted" is asserted in the opening and never constrains a tactic or surfaces in dialogue; the trait remains label-only. He appears in the closure but his agency there (sealing samples, smiling at realization) is more summary than decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three distinct beats: pocket check at the outpost, consultation after the falcon message, and use during the journey to communicate with settlements. The dog-ear marking "water birth" terms is specific. However, the phrasebook enables rather than constrains; it never costs Elmsley a choice or limits his options. It's present in the journey's causal chain but swappable with any translation aid.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Singular convergence frames the quest from the opening ("where the rivers begin"), drives the coordinates confirmation, and is literalized in the geological discovery on day four. The concept shapes Elmsley's tactics (following the bird inland, consulting oral histories) and anchors the closure realization. The specificity—underground channels meeting visible springs—matters on the page. The concept is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is mentioned twice ("Subtly confident in his reading of terrains unseen" and "The subtle confidence that served him well") but remains label-only. The trait doesn't constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; Elmsley's decisions proceed smoothly without the attribute creating friction or tradeoff. It could be removed without altering any beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Herald" appears three times: the falcon's cry, the condensation dream, and the report that will "herald a new understanding." The word recurs but the action itself—announcing or signaling—doesn't turn the plot. The falcon delivers coordinates (enabling the journey) and the report is written, but these could function without the herald frame. The concept charges the final line but doesn't redefine earlier options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Condensation on glass appears in four beats: initial tracing, dream mirroring, and twice at the outpost's end with the inverted delta. The pattern's mechanics (droplets forming tributary shapes) are signaled and recur with reweighted meaning. The final appearance ("this time with a small, definitive source at its center") charges the closure image. However, the pattern confirms rather than constrains Elmsley's choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The rusted outpost by the frozen lake frames the opening and closing, providing atmospheric grounding and the condensation-window. The setting supplies the falcon post and shelter but doesn't pressure Elmsley's choices; he departs at will and returns to write. The lake and outpost are vivid but could be replaced by another remote research station without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the falcon returns" anchors the opening beat (the bird's cry signals its arrival, Elmsley retrieves the message). However, time is not tracked as a tightening constraint; the journey spans "three days" and "the fourth morning" in summary. The falcon's return doesn't create urgency or alter Elmsley's tactics; it merely delivers information he already suspected.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation to find where rivers begin drives every major beat: the outpost research, following the falcon, the four-day journey, and the discovery. Elmsley's obsession is stated and sustained. The motivation shapes his choices and is present at closure (gathering evidence, writing the report). However, it's never dramatized as conflicted; he pursues it smoothly without competing desires or visible friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is named twice: at the outpost (silence filled with microscopic sounds) and at the sacred convergence site (where it "felt different" and "meant reverence"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly between locations. However, it remains atmospheric rather than pressuring Elmsley's stance; the tranquility worries him in description but doesn't force a choice or charge the final image with tension.</comment>
