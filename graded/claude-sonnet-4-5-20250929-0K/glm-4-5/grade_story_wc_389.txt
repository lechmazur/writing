<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias remains a static observer throughout; no on-page micro-choices under pressure drive causality. His "motivation burned constant" but never faces dramatized contradiction or cost that forecloses a path. The story tells us he is visionary and patient, yet we see no embodied struggle, only retrospective summary of years already spent. The final smile is asserted satisfaction, not earned renunciation or alteration with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure: the story summarizes Elias watching history unfold "according to frequencies he alone had first interpreted" without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that lands with felt cost in the final image. The piece reads as extended exposition across years with no single scene window or tight causal linkage—only a retrospective catalog. Orientation is delayed; we learn "floatstone mountain" and "seven years" but no immediate stake or present-tense pressure emerges by ~120 words. The lens remains ambiguous (neither causal turns nor accumulative pattern-teaching nor situational crystallization coheres), violating the Drive Lens Rule and triggering Q2 cap at 7.2 and cross-caps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory, cobalt glass portico, and atmospheric storm imagery are vivid and specific, lending atmospheric texture. However, setting remains postcard description: no tool, environmental constraint, or micro-setting choice alters Elias's tactics or charges the final image. The "floatstone mountain" and airship access are mentioned but never pressure a decision on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>No dominant stake is tested on the page; the story summarizes Elias's seven-year vigil and the prophet's rise without a single reversal, tightening choice, or escalation beat. "Variant allegiance" and "shaping a new dawn" are declared but never force a live trade-off or foreclosure with visible cost. The final paragraph asserts success ("everything that would follow") rather than dramatizing pressure or price, deflating any sense of earned conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of isolation versus influence and scientific humility versus prophecy is present but remains abstract and told. The final image ("smiled at the fragmented radio frequencies...knowing his variant allegiance had been the key") is a thematic label, not a resonant reconfiguration of prior particulars. No motif recurs with reweighted meaning; the cobalt portico and frequencies are repeated without accumulating pressure or cost that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable third-limited with elevated diction ("lyrically prophetic," "gritty whimsy"), but register feels uniform and exposition-heavy rather than perceptually specific. Dialogue is minimal and serviceable ("The signals are free...") but does not advance plot through subtext or goal pursuit. No perceptual signature or psychic-distance modulation under pressure; the prose summarizes rather than inhabiting Elias's selective attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles: "Throughout his self-imposed exile, Elias had constructed his purpose" / "His motivation burned constant: to shape a new dawn"; "transmissions" / "frequencies" / "messages" churn without added pressure. Template stems ("Elias spent...," "Elias understood...," "Elias told...") recur across six sentences. Stock metaphors ("ancient shadows," "dawn...breaking") and filter-verb stacks ("had discovered," "had constructed," "had documented") dull immediacy. Applying cumulative artifact penalties: −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for filter stacks = baseline ~4.7 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—lone scientist decodes ancient weather messages—feels derivative of isolated-genius templates without fresh synthesis. The "cobalt glass portico" and "floatstone mountain" offer surface specificity but do not transform familiar tropes through causal pressure or moral calculus. The transformation test fails: swapping names and setting would leave plot and arc unchanged. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges toward median allegorical safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout but makes no on-page choices that create turns; he observes, adjusts dials, and smiles retrospectively. His "lonely visionary" trait is label-only with no dramatized cost or alteration. Missing middle development and closure participation caps score at 3.4; ornamental summary further lowers it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico appears in setup and is described twice (capturing light, casting cobweb patterns), but it never constrains a choice or evolves with reweighted meaning. No middle beat involves handling or tactical use; it remains scenic backdrop. Present in two descriptive passes but functionally ornamental; swappable with "stained-glass window" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is named twice and explained ("to frequencies...not to countries or gods") but never dramatized as a choice that narrows options or incurs cost. It exists as thematic label without on-page pressure. Missing middle development and closure participation; ornamental mention caps score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" appears once as external description ("Those who had glimpsed his charts described them as lyrically prophetic") with no on-page demonstration of the trait enabling or constraining action. Label-only; no cost or tradeoff tied to it. Missing all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unfold" recurs as verb (transmissions unfold, history unfolds) but is not dramatized as a distinct action that creates a turn. It reads as summary metaphor rather than a specific, irreplaceable beat. Swappable with "reveal" or "emerge"; no causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are present in setup and across multiple beats (Elias listens, documents, translates), shaping his method. However, the mechanics remain vague ("peculiar light patterns...transforming them into messages") and do not constrain a middle choice with visible cost. Present and functional but replaceable with "ancient signals" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is foregrounded in setup, appears in multiple beats (nights adjusting dials, tracing patterns, watching from above), and frames the ending ("In the stormlit observatory above clouds..."). It provides atmospheric coherence but does not pressure a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Lyric reprise (first line → final paragraph) offers some resonance, but the setting remains postcard description without micro-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Seven years" and "year became decade" establish timeframe, and "the rise of a prophet" spans the narrative, but elapsed time does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The piece summarizes across years without scene-level urgency. Present but vague; no tactic altered by temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated as Elias's motivation and repeated ("The dawn he had sought to shape was indeed breaking"), but it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost. Told-only; no on-page tradeoff or forfeiture tied to this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" is asserted once ("their gritty whimsy captivating a handful of believers") but the prose maintains uniform elevated register without tonal modulation or purposeful tension. No coherent blend of grit and whimsy charges the final image; the ending reads earnest and abstract, not tonally layered.</comment>
