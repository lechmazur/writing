<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eldrin's interior life consists largely of abstract self-recrimination ("accusations and regret echoed endlessly") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The transformation from guilt to redemption is asserted through summary ("tears were streaming down his weathered face, washing away months of accumulated guilt") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. The final stance—"he understood how to weave between worlds not for power or prestige, but for healing and understanding"—reads as therapeutic insight delivered wholesale, not earned through on-page struggle. No secondary character applies immediate pressure; the journey remains purely internal and reflective without genuine resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the second sentence; no penalty. Closure unit: the final paragraph offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Eldrin renounces control and accepts a healing role), but the cost is told rather than shown—"canyon hush remained within him" is asserted mood, not a visible forfeiture or constraint that alters options. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (driftwood ritual, sound layering, vision sequences build toward thematic reweighting), yet the escalation consists of repetitive reflective loops rather than a meaningful tightening or cadence shift. The flute's mechanics ("ancient patterns that opened pathways between realms when properly sounded") are declared but never tested or resisted on the page, flattening causal linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range supplies acoustic properties that enable the ritual ("the sound seemed to grow exponentially, bouncing back and forth"), and the driftwood markers anchor the spiral pattern, creating a purposeful micro-setting. Spatial choreography remains clear (edge of range, mountain stream, center of spiral, return to stream). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff; it merely provides a stage for meditation. The final image does not charge the mountains with new meaning—they "held his songs of regret and redemption" is metaphorical summary, not a concrete payoff that reweights prior particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—redemption through insight—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The driftwood arrangement and flute-playing constitute a single extended ritual without reversal, resistance, or cost; the visions "revealed new perspectives" without forcing a tradeoff or narrowing options. The transformation ("tears were streaming down") is asserted rather than tested by a decision that forecloses a path. No persistent constraint shapes tactics, and coincidence does not complicate. The ritual unfolds as planned, delivering the promised insight without friction, making the escalation procedural rather than agonistic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>A coherent theme emerges—pride versus humility, control versus acceptance—but it is over-articulated in the final paragraph: "he understood how to weave between worlds not for power or prestige, but for healing and understanding" is a thematic statement, not an earned insight arising from concrete particulars. The flute's shift from "burden" to "lighter, somehow, yet immeasurably more precious" is told emotion rather than resonant image. The driftwood markers glow and then are returned, but their recurrence does not reweight the premise; they serve as ritual props without conceptual friction. The ending offers a moral summary rather than a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the opening ("weight of his recent failure pressing against his shoulders like the ancient stones") but flattens into generic epic-fantasy register as the ritual progresses. Diction remains elevated throughout without modulation under pressure; peak beats use the same ornate syntax as calmer exposition. Purposeful compression is absent; instead, the prose pads ritual description with synonym churn ("avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush," "thunder-echo") that recycles atmosphere without advancing stakes. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Template cadence runs pervade: "As a driven relic keeper... As a method for navigating... After the guardianship... After the guardianship's unexpected..." and "he had come here... he had studied... he had believed" create mechanical stems. Paraphrase loops cluster: "the weight of his recent failure" / "accusations and regret echoed endlessly" / "months of accumulated guilt" restate emotional summary without added pressure. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh inflection: "ancient stones," "delicate fabric," "sacred gift," "boundary manipulation." Filter-verb stacks in reflective beats ("he had believed," "he understood," "he saw himself") dull immediacy. The final paragraph summarizes transformation in abstract language rather than concrete image, dulling the closure beat. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: −1.4 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—exiled guardian seeks redemption through solitary ritual—follows a widely used template (hero's journey exile-and-return) without fresh synthesis. The flute as world-bridging artifact, the driftwood spiral, and the vision-quest structure read as genre furniture assembled from familiar parts. Emotional specificity is lacking: "tears were streaming down his weathered face, washing away months of accumulated guilt" is cathartic cliché, not lived detail. The transformation is delivered wholesale rather than discovered through non-obvious moral calculus or world logic. No bold risk elevates stakes; the ritual proceeds without complication, and the ending restates the premise as lesson learned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eldrin is present throughout but makes few on-page choices that alter tactics or stakes. The decision to perform the ritual is made off-page; on-page, he kneels, gathers wood, arranges it, plays the flute, and returns the wood—all procedural execution of a pre-formed plan. No reversal or complication forces adaptation. The "driven relic keeper" label is asserted but not dramatized through conflicting impulses or difficult tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The flute appears in three beats: uncasing (paragraph 1), playing the ritual sequence (paragraphs 4–5), and feeling "different now—lighter" at the end (paragraph 6). The mechanics—"ancient patterns that opened pathways between realms when properly sounded"—are declared but not tested or resisted; the flute functions as intended without cost or complication. The final reweighting ("lighter, somehow, yet immeasurably more precious") is told emotion rather than a charged image that reshapes prior material. Present across beats but swappable with any ritual tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is the stated goal and method, mentioned in five distinct moments: the opening ("to play the melodies that would help him weave between worlds"), the study montage ("maps for those seeking to weave between worlds through music and meditation"), the vision sequence ("the boundary between worlds grew thin enough to permit passage"), the insight ("the flute's true purpose as a bridge between worlds rather than a key to control them"), and the final understanding. However, the concept remains thematic metaphor rather than on-page constraint; no stakes depend on succeeding or failing to cross a boundary, and no cost is paid for the crossing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" appears three times as atmospheric label: the opening ("avalanchingly quiet after yesterday's violent storms"), the vision sequence ("In the avalanchingly quiet space, the sound seemed to grow exponentially"), and the final reflection ("The avalanchingly quiet mountains had borne witness"). The phrase modifies setting mood but does not constrain or enable any action. No choice depends on the silence, and no tradeoff is forced by it. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Uncase" is the named action in paragraph 1: "Eldrin needed to uncase the flute one last time." The act of opening the leather bindings and lifting the flute into the light is dramatized and signals the ritual's beginning. However, the ritual could proceed identically if the flute were simply "drawn" or "retrieved"; the specific verb does not create a unique constraint or cost. The action appears early and launches the sequence but is swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Arranging driftwood as directional markers" is introduced in paragraph 2, elaborated in paragraph 3 ("each stick placed precisely where it needed to be according to calculations he had memorized"), and resolved in paragraph 6 when the markers are returned to the stream. The method shapes the ritual's mechanics: the spiral pattern "mirrored the complex diagrams he had studied" and the markers "began to glow with soft, ethereal light, directing his attention." However, the mechanics do not resist or complicate; the pattern works as planned, and no cost is incurred. Present across beats but procedural rather than agonistic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is named five times and supplies the acoustic property that enables the flute's ritual: "the sound seemed to grow exponentially, bouncing back and forth until it formed a rich chord." The mountain stream provides driftwood, and the "towering mountain walls" amplify sound. The setting does not constrain a choice—Eldrin executes his plan without environmental friction—but it enables the ritual and is charged in the final image: "thunder-echo range holding his songs of regret and redemption within its ancient stones." Present in setup, development, and closure; shapes mechanics but does not force tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the guardianship" frames the timeframe in the opening and recurs in paragraph 2 ("After the guardianship had ended in spectacular failure") and paragraph 6 ("After the guardianship's unexpected and painful end"). The temporal anchor establishes emotional stakes—Eldrin seeks redemption post-exile—but does not tighten on-page choices. No live clock or deadline pressures tactics; the ritual unfolds at the protagonist's chosen pace. The timeframe provides context but does not escalate or constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To harvest insights from failure" is stated explicitly in paragraph 2 ("Eldrin had spent months researching secret ways to harvest insights from his crucial mistake") and restated in paragraph 6 ("To harvest insights from failure was perhaps the most difficult work of all"). The desire drives the ritual and is present in the vision sequence, where "each melody... uncovered another layer of understanding." However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no friction appears between the desire for insight and a competing fear or cost. Present across beats and shapes the ending, but remains summary rather than lived struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Canyon hush" appears in three beats: paragraph 2 ("The canyon hush of the mountains"), paragraph 3 ("The canyon hush deepened as birds and animals retreated"), and the final line ("the canyon hush remained within him, a peaceful silence where harsh judgment had once dwelled"). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly as the ritual progresses—from external observation to internal state. However, the final image asserts mood rather than charging it with cost or new meaning; "peaceful silence" is emotional summary, not a resonant concrete detail. Coherent but static; does not escalate pressure or reweight the stake.</comment>
