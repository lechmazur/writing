<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Hemingway's synesthesia motivation is told rather than demonstrated through lived contradiction—he "needs to know why" but never faces a concrete choice where the gift costs him anything before the librarian hands him answers. The librarian exists solely to explain rather than pressure; no secondary character applies true resistance. Interior life consists of abstract wondering ("couldn't yet grasp what mysteries") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The ending grants a visual gift (multicolored flames) without foreclosing a path or revealing what Hemingway sacrificed to receive it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. The portal to the sunken library operates as pure convenience—no earned discovery, no cost to cross, and the librarian waits with pre-packaged answers rather than demanding a trade. The "luminous vow" dissolves into Hemingway's skin as a cosmetic mark with no visible price paid on the page; the ending shows new flame colors but no before/after alteration in Hemingway's options or relationships. Closure reads as reward without renunciation, failing the cost-legibility test for Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The pier, lighthouse, and sunken library are vividly sketched with sensory detail (weathered boards, dancing shadows, leather-bound glowing books). However, the underwater library imposes no constraint—water "didn't touch him"—rendering the setting decorative rather than a crucible that shapes tactics. The sky lanterns frame the night but never pressure a choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The stated stake ("why this gift was given to me alone") never faces on-page opposition or a trade-off. Hemingway walks to the lighthouse pulled by "inexplicable magnetic force," receiving answers and a cosmetic mark without relinquishing safety, ignorance, or a competing want. The librarian poses no test; the books open in unison as spectacle. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the ending grants new powers (multicolored flames) as pure accretion, not earned agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of sound-as-color and acknowledging rather than discovering gifts emerges clearly, but the librarian articulates it in thesis statements ("The color of sound isn't something to discover… It's something to acknowledge") rather than letting the final image embody the question. "Luminous vows" remain abstract; the ending's multicolored flames are asserted as resonant without prior dramatic cost that reweights the premise. The piece gestures toward humility ("honor the language of light") but awards Hemingway immediate visible validation, softening the conceptual price.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated registers incongruent with a working lamplighter ("origami," "manifestation," "acknowledge… honor—the language of light expressed through vibration"). The librarian's dialogue reads as expository rather than goal-driven; Hemingway's interior consists largely of received wonder rather than a distinct perceptual signature under stress. Dialogue mechanics are clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity holds throughout. However, figurative density clusters without payoff: "meteor hush of anticipation," "luminous vow of pure silver light," "threads of starlight and seawater," "layers of reality folded like origami" stack within a few beats, blurring rather than sharpening pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "The sounds do have colors" immediately follows Hemingway's prior description of sound-as-color. Several filter verbs ("seemed to signify," "couldn't yet grasp") dull immediacy in early beats. No major loops obscure causality, but cumulative drift lowers density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—synesthete discovers underwater library during festival—combines familiar quest-for-answers and magical-library tropes without a fresh friction or moral calculus. The librarian-as-wise-guide and the key-that-opens-magical-door read as stock genre furniture. Hemingway's gift is validated rather than tested, and the ending rewards him with new powers, following a template arc of discovery without transformation. No risk or counter-intuitive turn distinguishes the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Hemingway is present throughout and his occupation frames the setting, but his choices do not create key turns—he is pulled to the lighthouse by "inexplicable magnetic force," steps through the portal without hesitation, and receives answers rather than deciding under conflicting pressures. Observation and passive receipt dominate; no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The key tag appears in three beats: discovery in paragraph four, shown to the librarian in paragraph twelve, and dissolution into Hemingway's palm in paragraph twenty-four. However, it never constrains a choice—it glows, warms, transforms, and unlocks the door without requiring sacrifice or a trade-off. Its properties shift (brass → silver light → dissolves) as plot convenience rather than mechanical cost. Functionally swappable with any magical token.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" are explained by the librarian as "promises made visible" and appear as glowing books and a final constellation, but they do not shape Hemingway's stakes or tactics on the page. The concept remains thematic decoration—mentioned, described, visually present—but Hemingway never makes a vow under conflicting pressures or pays a price to honor one. His final "vow" is recounted in summary rather than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The librarian "hides behind truth itself—layers of reality folded like origami," but this trait is asserted in narration without constraining his actions or enabling a choice with visible cost. He speaks in straightforward exposition, never evasive or layered. The attribute exists as label only, not demonstrated through behavior or dialogue indirection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Signify" appears once in paragraph four ("seemed to signify something greater") as a vague wondering, then the word recurs in the final line as the flames "signify" his vow. The action does not drive a turn—Hemingway does not choose to signify under conflicting pressures; the multicolored flames are granted as spectacle. Easily replaceable with "reveal," "manifest," or "express" with no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hemingway "wanders purposefully toward the abandoned lighthouse" in paragraph nine, pulled by magnetic force rather than by deliberate method. The phrase describes his gait but does not shape his tactics—he does not choose a route, test alternatives, or face friction that his method overcomes. The method is mentioned once and does not recur or constrain later choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The sunken library is vividly described and appears in the middle third and at closure (books fly open, porthole view, constellation outside). However, it imposes no constraint—water doesn't touch Hemingway, and the librarian simply waits. The setting provides spectacle and the final porthole image charges the ending visually, but it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource Hemingway must discover or sacrifice to use. Early signal is present; causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The sky lantern festival frames the night and sky lanterns appear in three beats (paragraph three, penultimate paragraph's porthole view, final line). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Hemingway completes his shift "by midnight" with no urgency, and the festival's duration never forces a trade-off or deadline. The lanterns shift to match the library's music as visual spectacle, not as a constraint that alters Hemingway's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated clearly in paragraph seventeen ("I need to know why this gift was given to me alone") and drives Hemingway to seek the library. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—he does not face a want-versus-cost friction on the page. The librarian hands him the answer in exposition; Hemingway never sacrifices safety, ignorance, or a competing desire to gain the knowledge. Desire is present; friction and cost are absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The phrase "meteor hush" appears twice (paragraph eight and paragraph eighteen), establishing a tone of quiet anticipation and reverence. The tone remains coherent through the library sequence and modulates slightly when the symphony erupts, then returns to hush. However, the tone does not charge the final image with cost—the ending grants spectacle (multicolored flames) in the same reverent register without reweighting prior material or crystallizing pressure. Consistent mood, but static rather than charged at closure.</comment>
