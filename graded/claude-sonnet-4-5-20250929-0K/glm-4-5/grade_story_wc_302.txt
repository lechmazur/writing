<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer remains a cipher throughout—no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion beyond generic wonder, no micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("cautious exuberance," "trepidation and anticipation") and the protagonist never struggles or makes a mistake that compounds. The final departure carries no visible cost; the character simply walks away enriched, foreclosing no path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: we learn "veiled dreamer" at line one but remain spatially unanchored until "edge of a forest" arrives past the 20% mark, violating the ~120-word test without teaching a pattern (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece attempts an Accumulative lens (mist-cipher-library pattern) but no on-page cost appears at closure—the protagonist gains knowledge and departs unchanged, with no visible forfeit or reconfiguration that narrows options. The "second fateful letter" is mentioned as future threat but never materializes, leaving closure conceptually unearned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The forest mist and glowing library walls are vividly rendered and the watch recurs across beats, but none constrain a choice or alter tactics—the protagonist simply observes and transcribes. Spatial choreography is clean (approach, entrance, interior, exit) and the mist functions as atmospheric anchor. However, the setting remains postcard description without pressuring the central conflict, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("find the library") is signaled early, but no meaningful tightening or cost appears: the library materializes on cue, the protagonist enters without obstacle, examines manuscripts, transcribes findings, and leaves as the watch "warns" of a deadline that never bites. No reversal narrows options; luck and convenience resolve every beat. The "second fateful letter" is mentioned but does not arrive on the page, leaving escalation purely declarative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme—power of unspoken words, weight of silence—is stated rather than earned through scene pressure: "some words gain power only in the absence of their speaking" and "another unspoken truth in a world full of them" are direct thesis statements in the final third (−0.6). The library's mechanics (books hover, contain unsaid words) illustrate the concept but the protagonist experiences no friction between speaking and silence that would dramatize theme. The ending tells us transformation occurred without showing a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the diction ("diaphanous," "spectral garments," "ethereal glow") maintains elevated register throughout. However, the prose lacks a perceptual signature—observations are generic catalog ("tall as a cathedral yet organic," "walls made of condensed mist") without character-specific bias. The single line of dialogue ("I must find the library," "Until the next dream") feels declarative rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Multiple artifact clusters drag the score: paraphrase loops ("the library only appeared when the fog thickened to this impenetrable density, turning the ordinary woods into something otherworldly" restates the mist-appearance link already established), template cadence ("They had begun," "They realized," "They knew" as repetitive stems), and stacked modifiers without propulsion ("cautious exuberance," "trepidation and anticipation," "suppressed emotions and unrealized intentions"). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the library-entry beat without coherent pattern (−0.5 density penalty). The closure beat itself ("knowledge they had gained was now their secret") is summary rather than image, dulling the final line (−1.0 cumulative in Q7; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical library of unspoken words—reads as a familiar writing-prompt template (liminal space, cipher quest, transformative knowledge) without fresh inflection. The watch's backward-cycling mechanism and owl-delivered manifesto are token quirks that do not alter emotional or moral calculus. The protagonist's arc (seeker finds, gains wisdom, departs unchanged) lacks the non-obvious synthesis or risky choice that would distinguish this from genre exercise. No transformation test: swap "veiled dreamer" for "wandering scholar" and the plot runs identically.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer is present throughout but makes no key turns—decisions (approach library, touch manuscript, transcribe, leave) are sequential acceptances without friction or cost. Observation dominates; no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears in three beats (opening, forest arrival, library warning) and its backward-cycling is described, but its mechanics never constrain a choice—it serves as cipher clue and timer without forcing a trade-off. The final beat mentions it "ticked forward normally" (reweighting), but this carries no consequence. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with functional but replaceable integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher is named and shapes the quest structure (letter, watch, propagation delays, library appearance) but its mechanics remain ornamental—fragments "revealed themselves" without the protagonist decoding under pressure or making a wrong turn. The cipher enables access rather than constraining tactics. Functional but swappable with "magical map" or similar device.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cyclically reversed appears as the watch's trait and in the cipher patterns ("cyclically reversed patterns now making perfect sense"), but no on-page action hinges on reversing direction—it is descriptive flavor. No visible trade-off or cost tied to the reversal mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Document (transcribing discoveries) anchors the library-interior beat and the watch's vibration warns of deadline, tying the action to time pressure. However, the transcription itself is summarized ("With quick strokes, they transcribed") rather than dramatized, and no major turn traces to *what* was documented—it serves as task completion rather than pivot. One causal beat (middle development) with closure proximity, but replaceable with "memorize" or "photograph."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Propagation delays are mentioned as "moments when the world seemed to ripple like water" that revealed cipher fragments, but the mechanic is never shown on the page—no scene dramatizes a delay event or uses its mechanics to shape an attempt. Summary-only use without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is vividly described and houses the climax (manuscript examination, transcription), but it does not pressure choices—walls part silently, books float passively, and the protagonist simply reaches and reads. The setting enables rather than constrains. Present across setup, middle, and payoff (all three gates), but postcard function caps the score below 7.0 per the gate model.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Between two fateful letters is seeded early (first letter in hand, second mentioned as intuited closure) and frames the window, but time is not tracked or tightened—no clock alters moves, and the second letter never arrives on the page. The timeframe remains abstract container rather than live pressure. Setup and thematic closure mention present (two gates), but no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>To find the library of unspoken words is stated in dialogue ("I must find the library") and drives the quest structure, but the desire is never conflicted—no friction between wanting access and cost of seeking, no moment where the protagonist weighs retreat. The motivation is singular and unchallenged. Present across all three gates (setup, middle pursuit, payoff entry), but told-only without dramatized friction caps the score at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance appears as a label in the opening line and the tone attempts a balance of wonder and wariness, but it remains static—no modulation when the library materializes (all wonder, no caution) or when the deadline approaches (summary urgency, no embodied hesitation). The final image ("wondered what other impossible places existed") returns to exuberance without the caution half, suggesting the tone was ornamental rather than structural.</comment>
