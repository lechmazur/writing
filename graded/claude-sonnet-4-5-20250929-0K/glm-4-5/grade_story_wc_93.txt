<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is declared but never internally contradicted or complicated by on-page micro-choices under pressure. Her "precognitive curse" functions as a label rather than a dramatized constraint that forces trade-offs. The final transformation—visions no longer tormenting her—arrives through mystical absorption rather than earned struggle, and the emotional progression from torment to peace lacks intermediate embodied cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("trembling fingers," "in awe") without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (ritual intensifies toward pattern revelation), but the closure—star dust integrating with consciousness and visions becoming guidance—occurs off-stage as summary rather than a decisive on-page image with felt cost. The "lingering promise" is fulfilled by declaration in the final paragraph rather than through a visible choice or renunciation that forecloses a path. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the first paragraph, waiving that penalty, but the because/therefore linkage remains weak: placing stones triggers mystical effects without dramatized resistance or visible trade-off at the peak moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and painted stones establish vivid setting anchors early. However, the frictionless world—a major conceptual premise—functions as atmosphere rather than a constraint that alters tactics or choices on the page. The stones and vial are handled, meeting the micro-setting test, but their mechanics (how they constrain or enable) remain vague, and the environment does not pressure the protagonist's decisions in ways that shape the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns to prevent cosmic unraveling—is signaled early but never tightened by on-page resistance or cost. The ritual proceeds without impediment; the eels cooperate, the star dust responds, and the revelation arrives as reward rather than earned turn. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception rather than a decision under pressure that narrows her world.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the premise (patterns, harmony, understanding vs. control) and the final insight—respect rather than control—offers a coherent answer. However, the resolution is stated outright ("she finally understood what her mentor had tried to teach her") rather than arising from concrete, irreversible action. The painted stones and eels function as symbols introduced for thematic harvest rather than particulars that constrain choice, and the "borrowed dawn" phrase recurs without reweighting prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic ("in awe," "trembling fingers") rather than character-particular, and diction drifts into elevated fantasy register ("ethereal glow," "sinuous bodies") that flattens voice. The narration withholds no key facts, but the psychic distance stays uniformly remote, summarizing emotion rather than inhabiting it under pressure. Syntax shows some variety, though sentence stems recur ("The [noun] [verb]" pattern clusters in the middle third).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "the aurora's ethereal glow" / "borrowed dawn of the aurora"; "patterns were not meant to be controlled, but respected" immediately followed by thematic restatement. Template cadence runs in the stone-placement sequence ("The second stone followed, then the third… The fourth stone… then the fifth… The sixth stone"). Stock metaphors ("her weathered hands," "sinuous bodies") and filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she believed," "she watched") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: baseline −0.8 for loops and template runs, escalated to −1.1 because they touch the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The premise—frictionless reality, eel herder, precognitive curse, mathematical ritual—assembles prompt elements without synthesis; the eel herding and frictionless physics remain ornamental to the core ritual plot. The emotional arc (torment to peace through mystical understanding) follows a template structure, and the final insight ("respect rather than control") is a familiar fantasy trope delivered without fresh inflection. No bold risk heightens stakes; the resolution offers comfort rather than cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The elusive eel herder is present throughout and performs the ritual, but her choices do not create key turns—she executes a predetermined sequence without on-page resistance or trade-offs that alter tactics. "Elusive" functions as a label mentioned once without shaping plot pressure. Her precognitive curse is described but does not constrain her ritual choices. Present by setup, involved in the middle sequence, and present at closure, meeting two gates, but her agency is observational and procedural rather than decision-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Collapsed star dust is introduced early, handled in at least two beats (clutched in the vial, pulsing during the ritual, erupting at the sixth stone, returning to the vial), and present in the closure image where it integrates with her consciousness. However, its mechanics are vague—it responds to the pattern without clear cost or trade-off—and it could be swapped for "ancient crystal" or "sacred relic" with minor edits. The dust enables the resolution but does not constrain choices or impose a visible price.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The lingering promise is introduced in paragraph four, signaled by setup, and mentioned again at closure ("The lingering promise had been fulfilled"). It motivates the protagonist's presence on the bluff but does not shape on-page tactics or create friction between competing wants. The promise functions as backstory driver rather than a live stake that narrows options under pressure. Present in two beats (setup and closure summary) but not developed in the middle, missing the development gate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Precognitively cursed is mentioned early and mid-story ("the visions no longer tormented her"), but the curse does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. It provides atmospheric motivation (she sees the future, it haunts her) but does not force a trade-off or choice under pressure. The curse's resolution—visions becoming guidance rather than torment—is declared rather than dramatized. Ornamental use; label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Harness is signaled early ("attempt to harness the star dust's power") and the ritual sequence dramatizes the attempt across multiple beats. The action shapes the middle and culminates in the star dust erupting and integrating with her consciousness. However, the mechanics remain vague—placing stones causes the dust to respond without clear resistance—and the protagonist's agency is procedural rather than decisive. Present in setup, middle, and closure, meeting all three gates, with some causal pressure but low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Placing painted rocks in mathematical sequences is introduced in paragraph six, developed across the stone-placement beats (Fibonacci, golden ratio, infinity symbol), and directly triggers the closure event (sixth stone completes the sequence, star dust erupts). The method is specific, irreplaceable, and causally active. However, it arrives after the first third (~25% mark), applying a modest late penalty, and the mechanics are told rather than shown—the reader is informed the sequence mirrors constellations and galaxies but does not witness how this matters. Present in setup (late), middle, and closure; strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tidal bluff under aurora is anchored early and provides vivid atmospheric detail. The bluff's "smooth stone where friction had long since disappeared" ties to the frictionless-world premise, and the aurora's light interacts with the stones and star dust. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome—the ritual could occur on any elevated open space. The eels in the tidal pools below participate but are passive choreography rather than obstacles or enablers. Present across all three gates but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>After friction disappears is mentioned once in the opening line ("where friction had long since disappeared") and referenced obliquely ("their frictionless existence" in the final paragraph). The timeframe does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or impose tactical constraints—the ritual proceeds without clock pressure, and the absence of friction functions as thematic backdrop rather than a mechanical constraint that alters choices. The protagonist has practiced for years, so the "after" is ancient history rather than a live pressure. Present in setup and closure mention but does not shape middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To understand sacred patterns is stated early and drives the protagonist to the bluff. The desire shapes her presence and motivates the ritual, and the closure declares understanding achieved. However, the motivation is not dramatized through conflicted choices—she wants to understand, she performs the ritual, she understands—without on-page friction between competing wants or costs. The promise to her mentor adds emotional weight but does not create a trade-off. Present in setup, implied in middle action, and resolved at closure, meeting all gates, but with low internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Borrowed dawn appears early ("under the borrowed dawn of the aurora's ethereal glow") and returns in paragraph twenty-four ("The borrowed dawn of the aurora began to fade"). The phrase is poetic and tonally consistent, but "borrowed" is not developed—the aurora is natural, not stolen or lent. The tone remains reverent and mystical throughout without modulation under pressure, functioning as static mood rather than a device that charges the final image with cost. Lyric reprise present but does not reweight the stake.</comment>
