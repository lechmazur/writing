<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation to "discover what ceilings hide" drives his visit, but internal contradiction is thin—his obsession feels declared rather than embodied in conflicting impulses. The decision to engage spirits with the device lands quickly without visible cost foreclosing a prior path; acceptance replaces fear in a single move. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("weightless burden" repeated, "practiced caution") and the final choice reads more like fulfillment than renunciation. Embodied emotion is present in the warming device and materialized ghosts, but the pivot lacks the friction of competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—dust patterns, fluorescent timing, and the mainspring barrel build toward the 4:17 PM threshold when spirits materialize. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus raises the device, accepts his burden as calling, and the ticking cleaves the barrier, allowing dialogue with spirits. Cost is conceptual—he commits to his role—but the final image ("space between worlds...waiting for someone with the right tools") states rather than charges the reweighting. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (Marcus, ticket office, afternoon), and the lens holds, but the closure beat summarizes the transformation instead of dramatizing a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned ticket office is anchored with sensory specifics (decades-old popcorn, grimy windows, collapsed counter) and the fluorescent buzz serves as a recurring constraint that times the spirit appearance. Dust accumulation patterns guide Marcus's investigation and the ceiling focus reflects his elevator-tech POV. The mainspring barrel discovery beneath debris is tactile and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean (office interior, counter, ceiling view) and the setting pressures the 4:17 PM timing choice, charging the final image when reality cracks.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering what ceilings hide / bridging to spirits. The tightening occurs when the fluorescent buzz dies at 4:17 PM, thinning the barrier and materializing ghosts—one meaningful pressure point. Marcus's agency is active (he plans the visit, retrieves the device, raises it toward the ceiling), but the engagement choice lacks a visible trade-off; acceptance supplants fear without dramatized cost. Coincidence does not resolve—Marcus's research and timing earn the moment—but the final beat tells us the barrier closed rather than showing a foreclosed path or altered tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme: accepting the unseen as calling rather than curse. The "weightless burden" phrase recurs and the "cracks in the façade" motif threads through walls and reality, but both are stated more than dramatized at closure. The final paragraph moralizes ("the space between worlds wasn't empty...merely waiting") instead of letting the ticking device and spirit dialogue resonate. The horologist legend and dust patterns build specificity, yet the ending's epiphany is asserted rather than earned through image. Subtext operates in the device warming and spirits moving like clockwork, but prompt labels ("weightless burden," "cracks in the façade") appear without full transformation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Marcus with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: ceiling focus, vibration sensitivity, dust-pattern reading. Diction is controlled but leans on stock phrases ("practiced caution," "perfect environment," "occupying the same space") and therapy-speak creeps in ("weightless burden," "acceptance instead of fear"). No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (rising tension toward 4:17, materialization of ghosts), and free indirect style is clean. Register drift is minor; the voice remains Marcus's technical observer throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the setup (elevator tech, ghost sight, dust patterns, horologist legend compressed efficiently). Paraphrase loops appear: "the space between worlds" is restated across paragraphs, and "weightless burden" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "Marcus + [verb]" or "The + [noun]." The final two paragraphs pile figurative language (heat waves, music box, heartbeat cleaving) and declare rather than show the closure effect. Filter-verb stack in one passage ("Marcus knew...understood...believed") dulls immediacy. Clarity is maintained, but scaffold and summary blunt the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elevator repairman who sees ghosts is a fresh synthesis; coupling vertical-space expertise with spectral sight offers a novel angle. The dust-analysis method and horologist's dimensional device add specificity. Yet the core arc—reluctant medium accepts calling—follows a familiar template, and the ending's "answers whispered from above" and "space between worlds wasn't empty" lean on stock spiritual-journey phrasing. The 4:17 PM fluorescent timing and mainspring barrel details are particular, but the emotional turn (fear to acceptance) resolves without bold risk or non-obvious calculus. Transformation is present but incremental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus (elevator repair technician who sees ghosts) is present throughout and his observation skills (ceiling focus, dust patterns, fluorescent timing) shape his investigation. His ghost-sight enables the ending when spirits materialize. However, his choices are straightforward: visit, examine, engage—no key turn hinges on a decision with visible cost. The character's dual traits frame the premise but do not constrain tactics or force a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The horologist's mainspring barrel appears at mid-story (beneath the counter), is examined in Marcus's hands, warms in response to spirits, and is raised toward the ceiling at closure to bridge worlds. It is handled across three distinct beats and its dimensional-rift calibration is specific. The device's ticking "cleaves through the barrier" at the ending, charging the final image. Strong integration, but it does not constrain a prior choice or impose cost—it enables the resolution without friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" is mentioned in paragraph one (spiritual energy leaking), paragraph eight (reality shimmering), and the final paragraph (closing the cracks). It functions as a recurring metaphor for the barrier between worlds but does not shape an on-page choice or alter tactics. The phrase is thematic rather than causal; Marcus does not navigate or negotiate the cracks, he accepts them. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is signaled early (paragraph two) and demonstrated through dust-pattern analysis, fluorescent-buzz tracking, and the 4:17 PM timing plan. The trait enables Marcus to locate the mainspring barrel and time his visit, shaping two beats. However, no visible cost or trade-off is tied to his observation skill—it functions smoothly without constraint. Functional and purposeful but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Engage" is the climactic action: Marcus decides to "engage with the spirits...as fellow travelers" and raises the device to bridge worlds. This choice frames the ending and shifts his stance from observer to participant. However, the decision is told rather than dramatized with competing impulses or visible cost, and the engagement itself (dialogue with spirits) occurs off-page. The action is present at closure but does not redefine prior options or impose friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is introduced early (paragraph three) as Marcus's method for detecting supernatural activity and guides his investigation of the ticket office. He scoops a vial sample and observes particles defying physics. The method shapes his arrival and search but does not constrain a mid-story choice or reappear at closure. Present in two beats (observation, sample collection) but does not drive escalation or the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is anchored early with sensory detail (popcorn smell, grimy windows, collapsed counter) and the fluorescent lights provide the 4:17 PM timing constraint that tightens Marcus's plan. The setting supplies the mainspring barrel (beneath debris) and the ceiling focus aligns with Marcus's elevator-tech POV. The office pressures the ending by confining the spirit encounter to a specific time and place. Strong integration across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off at 4:17 PM" is signaled in paragraph three, tracked ("He checked his watch: 4:16 PM"), and triggers the spirit materialization at closure. The timeframe tightens Marcus's decision to visit and creates urgency. The 4:17 threshold is specific, recurring, and causal—without it, the barrier does not thin. The ticking at the end extends the time motif. Essential to escalation and ending; removing it would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" is stated in paragraph one and drives Marcus's obsession, leading him to the ticket office and the horologist legend. The motivation frames his research and timing plan. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction; Marcus pursues discovery smoothly without cost or renunciation. The desire is consistent but not tested by a competing impulse at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" appears three times (paragraphs four, eight, fourteen) as a label for Marcus's ghost-sight. The phrase modulates from curse to calling at the ending, supporting the thematic arc. However, the tone is declared rather than embodied in prose rhythm or image; the burden never feels visceral or contradictory. The motif is present across beats and reprised at closure but remains abstract, not charged by specific sensory or syntactic pressure.</comment>
