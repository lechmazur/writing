<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes early, but her interiority remains abstract and declarative rather than embodied. The progression from solitary turner to community teacher feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses or visible struggle. Key moments like "quietly inspired" appear as labels without the micro-choices under pressure that would reveal hierarchy of values. The ending's communal turn lacks the foreclosed path or felt cost that would validate transformation at this scale.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece violates the orientation test: who/where/when anchors appear early but "what" (the jar's discovery, the prophecy's nature, why buttons matter) remains vague past the 120-word threshold and never resolves into clear causal pressure. The drive lens is ambiguous—accumulative patterning is suggested but the buttons-to-prophecy mechanism remains opaque, preventing legible closure. The ending delivers thematic declaration ("wisdom grows when shared") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. No meaningful tightening or deepening under any identifiable lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is signaled early and recurs throughout, providing atmospheric consistency. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—buttons could be cataloged anywhere, the cliff proximity never pressures choice, and spatial choreography remains generic. The amber light and canyon echo create mood but don't alter tactics or charge the final image with spatial specificity. Micro-setting (buttons, jar) comes closest to functional integration but still feels ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unscrambling a prophecy—is declared but never tested with meaningful opposition or cost. The cataloging succeeds without friction, failure, or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed. The prophecy's "transformation" from fixed to malleable happens through assertion rather than protagonist struggle. Visitors arriving feels like expansion rather than escalation. No visible price is paid, no tactic altered by constraint, and the resolution grants symmetric satisfaction without agency-driven reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The button-as-choice metaphor is explained directly ("Each button represented a choice") instead of accruing meaning through image and action. The final paragraph's "wisdom was shared, prophecies were transformed" reads as thematic summary rather than resonant, non-literal answer. The canyon echo's timeless message is delivered as platitude without the specific experience that would earn insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable throughout with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent but lacks perceptual signature—Elara's noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. Diction stays clean but uniform across emotional beats without rhythmic modulation under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The prose maintains baseline competence but offers no syntactic variety or voice texture that would reflect the focalizer's particular mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence: runs of "As [subject verb], [subject verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" across adjacent sentences create drumbeat rhythm without taught pattern. Paraphrase loops cluster in the opening third and final quarter—"quietly inspired" recurs label-only; "shared wisdom" cycles through synonym variants without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt," "found herself") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock phrasing: "profound connection," "timeless message," "unfolding story" reduces specificity. Cumulative artifact debt at closure triggers disallowance of 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Core premise (prophecy, buttons as metaphor for choice, communal wisdom) reads as template material without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The hourglass-turner occupation remains decorative rather than integral to the prophetic mechanism. Prophecy-to-possibility and button-cataloging beats follow predictable arcs with no risky inflection or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The ending's community-gathering resolution is stock inspirational fare. Derivative premise without meaningful transformation warrants −1.2 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara observes, arranges, and teaches but her choices do not create key turns—the prophecy unscrambles through her methodical work without friction or decision under pressure. Present throughout but largely passive receptor of the echo's guidance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar appears early, recurs in multiple beats, and is present at closure. However, its function remains static—it whispers, responds to organization, grows brighter—without evolving use or mechanics that constrain Elara's attempts. Description outweighs dramatized handling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is declared thematically and drives the ending's communal turn, but it does not shape on-page tactics or alter middle-beat options. The concept is told rather than tested through choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" appears as a label in paragraph 5 and recurs descriptively in paragraph 17 and 22 without constraining or enabling action with visible tradeoff. No on-page cost or friction tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unscramble" is signaled early (paragraph 8), occupies the middle span as Elara catalogs buttons, and is referenced at closure. One major turn traces to this action—the prophecy's message becoming clear. However, the mechanics remain opaque and the action could be replaced with another methodical task without deep structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is signaled in paragraph 10, shown methodically in paragraphs 10–15, and continues at closure as others contribute. The method shapes Elara's attempts and the ending's communal activity. However, the why (how arrangement unscrambles prophecy) remains unexplained, reducing irreplaceability. Present across all three gates but swappable with minor edits to another sorting mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is established early and recurs throughout, providing spatial continuity. It transforms thematically from solitary to communal space but does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter outcome. Postcard consistency without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears in paragraph 12 and closure but functions as thematic phrase rather than tracked clock. No tightening of decision window or urgency that alters tactics. Time remains vague and unthreatening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is declared in paragraph 7 and referenced at closure. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice—no friction between want and cost, no competing impulse that complicates pursuit. The goal succeeds without visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" is invoked in paragraphs 14 and 23, contributing to atmospheric cohesion. However, the tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image. The phrase functions as mood label without functional reprise that reweights stakes.</comment>
