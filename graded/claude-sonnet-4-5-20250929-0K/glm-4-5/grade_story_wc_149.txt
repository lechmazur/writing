<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride's motivation is told entirely in backstory blocks rather than dramatized through present choices. Her actions are passive observation and mechanical fulfillment of a declared debt; no contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure appear on the page. The groundskeeper remains a camera, Thomas exists only in summary, and the bride's "elation" is asserted rather than embodied. Interiority is absent; the piece substitutes poetic description for character agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors emerge slowly across the first 25% without clear present-scene framing, and the disorientation does not pay off at closure (−0.4). The closure unit—bead crumbles, bride fades, bloom appears—occurs entirely off-stage (morning discovery by groundskeeper); no decisive change, stance crystallization, or felt cost lands on the page. The dominant lens is ambiguous (lyric accumulation vs. causal wish-fulfillment) and unearned; the ending substitutes symbolic satisfaction for dramatized pressure. Backstory comprises ~40% of the text but never anchors in a present choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse supplies vivid sensory detail (bioluminescent blossoms, frost patterns, terracotta pots) but functions as postcard description rather than constraint. No environmental element narrows a choice or charges the final image with cost; the setting remains static decoration. Spatial choreography is vague—bride "drifts," groundskeeper "finds"—with no lived-in handling of tools or objects that affect outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("repay a debt across lifetimes") is declared in backstory but never tested on the page. The bride performs a single uncomplicated action (releasing seeds) with no trade-off, opposition, or visible cost; the bead crumbles as automatic consequence, not choice. No escalation, reversal, or tightening occurs; the piece moves from setup to resolved in a single gesture. Coincidence (celestial alignment) triggers the resolution rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly in the final paragraph ("debts could be paid, love could transcend death") rather than emerging from particulars. The carved bead and bloom carry symbolic potential but are not dramatized as choices with cost; they arrive as wishful payoff. The "lovingly venomous" motif is a repeated phrase without thematic friction or reweighting at closure. Subtext is absent; every meaning is glossed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece maintains third-person omniscient distance with no head-hopping, but psychic distance is uniform and detached throughout—no perceptual signature anchors the ghost bride's perspective. Diction drifts into elevated register ("immeasurable tenderness," "unprecedented bloom") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("could almost feel," "thought he could hear") stack without voice justification, dulling immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "almost feel… almost… nearly recall" (line 18–19) and "debts of the past had finally been settled" / "the debts had finally been repaid" across paragraphs (−0.4). Template-cadence runs of "The [noun] [verb]" sentence openers pervade the piece without pattern-teaching (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("morning fog," "skeleton weeds") and elevated diction ("immeasurable tenderness") in the closure beat muddle immediacy (−0.3). Figurative language ("lovingly venomous," "resonant awakenings") is repeated as labels rather than dramatized images. Information density is low; many sentences restate setup or theme without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The ghost-bound-to-greenhouse and tragic-lovers-reunited premises are familiar templates executed without transformation. "Lovingly venomous" is a striking phrase but never gains specific mechanics; "resonant awakenings" remains abstraction. The ending—bloom as reunion symbol—feels preordained rather than earned in hindsight. No risk-taking in structure, voice, or moral calculus; the piece hedges toward sentiment without surprise.</comment>
