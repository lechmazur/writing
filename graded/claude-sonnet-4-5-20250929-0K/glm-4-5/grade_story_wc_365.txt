<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains abstract throughout—"sensory map maker" functions as a label rather than a character with embodied wants and contradictions. Motivation is declared ("to discover the weight of a withheld truth") but never tested by competing desires or visible cost; each jump cycles through spectacle without forcing a trade-off. The ending's "determination burned brighter" is stock emotional assertion unsupported by prior micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority consists of generic wonder ("energy they had never encountered") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test fails: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, but "sensory map maker" remains vague (no name, no embodied detail) and the repair bay's spatial layout never coheres. Drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative (reality-fraying, parallel visions), but no meaningful tightening occurs—each jump is a static tour, and the mysterious door appears in the final third without setup, breaking causality. The ending recedes into "half-remembered dreams" with no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; the shard goes dim and tomorrow's retry erases present cost. Cost proof test fails: no sentence makes a visible price legible at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The repair bay is anchored early with "dust motes," "workbenches," "tools frozen in mid-project," establishing atmosphere. However, spatial choreography never coheres—objects and distances do not track across the protagonist's movements or between realities. The green shard is handled repeatedly and its warmth/heat modulates with story beats, qualifying as micro-setting that constrains one choice (preventing contact with the red shard). Sensory detail leans visual; the alternate timelines (hospital, art gallery) are told rather than shown through texture or choice-altering features.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("discover the weight of a withheld truth") is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The jumps between realities occur "cyclically and spontaneous" without protagonist agency driving escalation—the shard dictates timing, reducing the map maker to passenger. The red-shard moment could tighten pressure, but the green shard's heat simply prevents contact with no visible cost or tactical shift. The ending postpones resolution ("tomorrow, they would try again"), refusing to foreclose a path or crystallize a stance with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge and fragmented identity is declared ("weight of a withheld truth") rather than emerging from concrete choice and image. The green shard recurs across beats but its meaning does not shift—it remains a key/tool throughout. The final image (shard dim, protagonist's determination) asserts emotional state without a non-literal answer or resonant reconfiguration of prior material. Subtext is thin; most concepts are stated outright ("weaving between worlds," "architecture of existence").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "energy they had never encountered," "shimmering possibilities," "whispers echoing from another dimension" rely on stock SFF phrasing rather than character-particular noticing. Diction remains consistent but bland, with frequent abstract nouns ("motivation crystallized," "persistence," "revelation"). No dialogue on the page. Prose modulates little under pressure; the final paragraph's "determination burned brighter than ever" repeats earlier register without syntactic or rhythmic shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "half-remembered dreams"/"murmur of half-remembered dreams," "weight of a withheld truth" (repeated three times), "cyclically and spontaneous" (repeated twice identically). Template cadence: runs of "In [timeline], they…" structure across paragraphs 8–9. Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "reality began to fray," "world dissolving into shimmering possibilities," "currents of possibility like seasoned sailors" in adjacent lines. Filter-verb stack in final third: "they sensed," "ready to finally redirect," "receded like." Apply −1.2 in Q7 for loops, template stems, and metaphor muddle; artifacts touch closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—protagonist journeys through parallel realities seeking hidden truth—closely matches template quest-for-knowledge plots without fresh synthesis. The "sensory map maker" occupational detail never constrains a choice or supplies a skill; it could be swapped for "archaeologist" or "psychic" with no structural change. Parallel-universe mechanics (green shard as key, red shard as blocked goal) follow familiar SFF logic without a non-obvious inflection. The ending's "tomorrow, they would try again" postpones consequence, avoiding risk. No turn or final image feels inevitable in hindsight; the mysterious door appears late without prior grounding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character is named/described in opening line and recurs across all beats (setup, development, payoff gates met). However, the "sensory map maker" makes no decision that alters tactics—each jump is passive, driven by the shard's timing. The protagonist observes realities without acting on what is learned; no choice creates a turn. Late first-person action ("reaching for the handle") is immediately undone by the dream fading. Swappability high: role could be "traveler" or "seeker" without changing structure. Apply cap for ornamental presence (≤3.8) and late-arrival penalty for first agentive moment in final paragraph: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Green glass shard appears in opening line (setup), is handled across multiple beats (opening, reality-fraying, red-shard encounter, ending), and returns dim in final image (payoff). Its warmth/heat modulates to prevent protagonist from touching red shard, constraining one choice. Specificity is modest—"green glass" could be swapped for "crystal" or "stone" with minor edits. The shard enables jumps but its unique properties (why green? why glass?) do not matter causally. Present in closure image but not reweighted; it simply goes dim. Two-beat involvement, one constraint, closure cameo: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is named by paragraph 6 (late setup, −0.3) and described as concept but not dramatized as choice-shaping mechanic. The protagonist does not direct the weaving—"cyclically and spontaneous" means it happens to them. Alternate timelines provide spectacle but do not alter protagonist tactics or options; each jump is observation without consequence. The concept is present thematically across beats but does not constrain action or enable a turn. Swappable with "shifting realities" or "dimension-hopping." Cap for ornamental thematic use: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is named twice (paragraphs 7, 16) but remains label-only; no on-page beat shows the trait enabling or constraining an action with cost. The transitions "came without warning," but this does not force a tactical adaptation—the protagonist simply experiences each jump. No visible tradeoff tied to spontaneity versus control. Summary-only mention, no middle development or closure participation, high swappability. Cap for label-only use (≤3.0): 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Redirect" appears twice: paragraph 11 ("redirect the flows between worlds") as learned skill, and paragraph 21 ("redirect their path toward revelation") as intent at door. Neither instance shows the action creating a turn—in both cases, the shard or dream mechanics override agency. The final "redirect" is interrupted by dream fade, foreclosing consequence. Action is present in setup and attempted at closure but does not causally drive a beat. Swappable with "navigate" or "guide." Cap for no middle beat and no causal pressure: 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through parallel universes" is described across paragraphs 8–10, shaping the story's central mechanic (development). The method enables all middle beats (alternate-timeline visions). However, the protagonist does not choose to enter universes—the shard dictates timing—so the method does not constrain tactics. It is necessary for the plot but could be swapped for "across dimensions" or "between timelines" with no structural change. Present in setup, drives middle spectacle, absent from closure action. Functional but replaceable: 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>Abandoned spaceport repair bay is anchored in paragraph 2 (setup) and recurs as location throughout. However, it never pressures a choice—the protagonist could conduct these jumps in any large, atmospheric space. The tools and workbenches are described but never used or referenced tactically. The mysterious door (paragraph 19) is setting-specific but appears late without prior signal, breaking the "no late rule change" principle. Spatial choreography unclear (body positions and distances do not track). Cap for postcard description without tactical pressure: 3.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears in opening (paragraph 3) and recurs in final third (paragraphs 13, 19, 22). However, "murmur" functions as metaphor for memory rather than a timeframe that tightens decisions. The protagonist's actions do not occur within a dream until paragraph 19 ("depth of a dream-state"), and even then no clock pressure shapes choices. The ending's "waking in the abandoned repair bay" retroactively frames prior action as dream, but elapsed time never constrains tactics. Lyric seed-to-reprise present, but time remains untracked and does not alter moves. Cap for vague time without tactical cost: 2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To discover the weight of a withheld truth" is stated in paragraph 12 (late setup, −0.3) and motivates exploration across middle beats. However, the desire is never dramatized in a choice where wants conflict with cost—each jump is observation without friction. The protagonist's "determination burned brighter" (final line) asserts motivation but does not show a tradeoff or tactical adaptation shaped by the withheld truth. The motivation is told, not tested. Present in setup and invoked at closure, but no middle beat shows it constraining a competing desire. Cap for told-only friction: 4.6.</comment>
