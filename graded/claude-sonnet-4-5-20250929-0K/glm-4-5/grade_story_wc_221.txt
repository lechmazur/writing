<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is presented through label-heavy exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Her "blessed pariah" status, temporal perception gift, and motivational arc are asserted across eighteen paragraphs of summary without a single micro-choice under pressure that reveals character through action. Internal conflict is told ("gift and a curse," "duality") rather than dramatized through simultaneous competing wants. The final "smile" and discovery that "true north had been within her all along" reads as unearned epiphany without prior causality compelling the insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks on-page closure with visible cost. Elara begins sketching star charts and ends having completed one, but no decision, renunciation, or stance crystallization occurs that forecloses a path or reconfigures meaning with felt price. The "understanding" she reaches in the final paragraph is asserted rather than earned through causal pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive immediately, but the accumulative lens suggested by the ritual never tightens or deepens; each paragraph restates her isolation and purpose without escalation. The ending's "true north had been within her all along" is a thematic echo, not a dramatized closure unit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observation deck setting is named and described (dormant equipment, echoing silence) but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Spatial details remain generic: "worn jacket," "dim light," "pencil against paper." The temporally stretched perception is told as trait rather than shown through concrete sensory distortion that would ground her unique way of seeing. The gilded compass rose receives repeated visual mentions but is not handled, used, or spatially tracked in a way that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving cosmic knowledge for future generations—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful choice narrows options or changes knowledge. The sketch ritual proceeds without obstacle, cost, or alternative path; nothing threatens to prevent her from completing the map. Her motivation "evolved from survival to something greater" in summary, but no on-page beat dramatizes that shift. The piece offers outline-like declaration of stakes ("cartographer of hope," "bridge between what was and what could be") without pressure that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emerging from image and choice: "turn confusion into exploration," "true north...within her all along," "those who dared to turn confusion into exploration." The final paragraph offers explicit moralizing that replaces scene pressure with thesis. The compass rose recurs as label rather than accruing new meaning through use; its "pulse" and "warmth" are asserted without embodied grounding. No thematic irony or counter-reading exists; the piece affirms its premise in identical language across paragraphs without complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Narrative voice is consistent but relies on template cadence and abstract diction that flatten immediacy: "the weight of her isolation but also the pull of purpose," "the ghosts of past discoveries." Perceptual signature is missing; Elara's temporally stretched perception is told but her way of noticing remains generic. Eighteen consecutive paragraphs open with subject-verb patterns (She/Elara/The/Her), creating syntactic monotony. Free indirect style is attempted but drifts into expository summary that explains rather than dramatizes: "a gift and a curse that defined her existence." No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: paragraphs 2–4 restate "blessed pariah/gift and curse" without added pressure; paragraphs 10–11 recycle "keeper of memories/bridge between what was and what could be." Template cadence runs appear in consecutive subject-verb openings and recycled stems ("She was," "Her motivation," "The compass rose"). Stock metaphors cluster without concrete grounding: "plunged civilization into uncertainty," "scattered humanity to the winds," "beacon of hope." Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations dull immediacy: "allowing herself a glimpse," "the pull of purpose," "the weight of responsibility." The final beat restates the opening's "blessed pariah" frame without fresh density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "lone scientist after apocalypse" premise closely matches widely used templates; transformation through specific lived detail is minimal. Elara's temporal perception gift is declared but never demonstrates unique consequences or tradeoffs. The compass rose, star charts, and "true north" motif echo familiar symbolic conveniences without fresh inflection. The ritual of sketching on anniversaries could anchor specificity but remains generic description. Emotional beats default to abstract phrasing ("weight of isolation," "pull of purpose") rather than character-particular idiom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "blessed pariah" label is present throughout but Elara makes no choices that create turns. She is described as shunned and invaluable, yet no on-page interaction tests that status. Her isolation is asserted, not dramatized through decision or renunciation with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose applique appears in five paragraphs (3, 9, 12, 18, 19) but is never handled or used; it "caught the dim light," "seemed to pulse," "warmed against her chest," "glinting in the starlight." These are static descriptions without evolving function. No action involves touching, consulting, or relying on the object; it does not constrain or enable a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"True north" appears as metaphor in paragraphs 3, 13, and 19 ("quest for true north," "true north she sought," "her true north had been within her"). It remains abstract theme rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics. The final "true north had been within her all along" is asserted epiphany, not a realization that changes options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" appears as label in paragraphs 2, 4, 10, and 15 but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The text tells us it allows her to "see patterns others missed" and perceive "starlight that had traveled millennia...in what felt like seconds," yet no beat dramatizes a tradeoff or tactical choice enabled by this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Glimpse" appears once in paragraph 5: "She closed her eyes briefly, allowing herself a glimpse of the world as it once was." This is a passive moment of reflection, not an action that creates a turn. The sketching ritual proceeds unchanged; the glimpse neither redefines options nor incurs cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky on anniversaries is introduced in paragraph 6 and executed in paragraphs 9, 14, 16. It frames the ritual and recurs across beats, but its mechanics do not shape attempts or create friction. The sketch completes without obstacle; the method is present but does not constrain choice or charge the closure image with new cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The time dilation observation deck is named in paragraph 1 and referenced in paragraph 7 ("once bustling...now echoed with silence"). It provides location but never pressures choices or supplies resources that affect outcome. Spatial details (dormant equipment, silence) are atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" is established in paragraph 1 and referenced throughout (paragraphs 2, 5, 10, 13, 17, 19). The timeframe provides backstory context but does not tighten decisions or tactics in the present scene. No live clock or deadline alters Elara's moves; the anniversary ritual proceeds without temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"To turn confusion into exploration" is stated in paragraph 8 and echoed in the final line. The motivation is declared but not dramatized through conflicted choices. Elara's goal to "map not just the stars but the possibilities" faces no friction between wants and costs on the page; the sketch completes as intended.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in paragraphs 7 and 17. The tone of solitude and quiet reverence is coherent and recurs, modulating slightly from "lonely" (paragraph 17: "no longer lonely but filled with whispers"). It does not sharply intensify under pressure or charge the final image with new cost, remaining a static atmospheric layer.</comment>
