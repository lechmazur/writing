<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The traveler's interiority is abstract and therapeutic ("geography of healing," "explained absences") rather than embodied. Internal conflict is stated as past wounds rather than acting simultaneously on the page. The turn toward writing his own obituary arrives but feels like conceptual resolution rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Motivation remains largely reflective summary without contradictory impulses pressing in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; no penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the traveler begins writing his own obituary, moving from observer to participant), but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page action or forfeiture that alters later options. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode (density of reflection, cadence shift at the end), but the final image restates theme without undeniable pressure or visible price. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is vividly rendered with sensory detail (earth, decay, vanished blooms) and returns in the final third to anchor the closure image. The weft thread is handled across multiple beats, but neither element constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. Micro-setting (body, thread) is present but ornamental; the garden frames reflection without pressuring action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding healing through writing obituaries—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the traveler sits, reflects, writes. The shift to writing his own obituary is a thematic deepening rather than a decision with visible cost. Agency is attention and endurance, but no path is foreclosed with legible price. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one cadence shift is present but cost clarity is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the traveler's vocation and the weft thread motif. The final image reweights prior material (writing for the living who still have life) without stating a moral. However, the piece leans on prompt labels ("explained absences," "geography of healing") rather than letting theme arise purely from concrete particulars. The obituary conceit invites reflection, but the ending risks thematic echo by articulating the story's thesis directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled cadence. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("intimate communion with nature," "healing geography of human hearts") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Repetitive phrasing across beats: "shadowed garden" appears six times, "weft thread" and "palace carpet" recur without functional variance. Paraphrase loops in the final third restate the same transformation ("writing for the living," "life left to live") without added pressure. Figurative language is dense but generic ("spirits preparing for winter," "river of explanations"). Template cadence in the closing paragraph: "He was the traveler who... but in this moment, he was finally beginning to..." Applying −0.8 for loops and scaffold that dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The obituary-for-the-living premise is compelling but not transformed through specific lived detail; the emotional arc could apply to any reflective loner. The weft thread and palace destruction are generic symbolic anchors. The turn to self-examination is telegraphed and resolved tidily without risk. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis elevates the familiar arc of self-discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The traveler is present throughout and makes a choice to write his own obituary, but the decision is interior and conceptual. No on-page action or forfeiture alters tactics. Setup: present by opening. Development: he writes for Thomas in the middle third. Payoff: begins his own obituary at closure. Two gates met, closure participation is weak (conceptual only). Causal pressure is minimal; the element shapes one beat (writing for Thomas) and reappears at the end but does not narrow options with visible cost. Swappable with another reflective profession. Applying cap 6.0 for two-gate presence, then −0.6 for ornamental closure role and −0.6 for swappability = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The weft thread appears in paragraphs 2, 11, 20, 24, 29 (five mentions across distinct beats). Setup: paragraph 2. Development: paragraph 11 (traced while writing), paragraph 20 (lies beside notebook). Payoff: paragraphs 24, 29 (transforms into compass, reappears in final image). All three gates met. However, the thread is described and contemplated but never handled in a way that constrains choice or enables tactics. The transformation ("anchor and burden" to "compass") is asserted thematically rather than dramatized through action. Eligible for ≥6.1 with all gates, but applying −0.5 for ornamental use (description without action pressure) and −0.4 for swappability (any keepsake could serve the same function) = 5.2, rounded to 5.9 for lyric resonance (early seed → charged final reprise that reweights the stake).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The concept "explained absences" appears explicitly in paragraphs 5, 13, 19, 23, 27. Setup: paragraph 5. Development: paragraphs 13, 19 (explanations for absence from lives and demise). Payoff: paragraphs 23, 27 (his own explained absence becomes clearer). All three gates met. However, the concept is thematic and reflective rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics on the page. It echoes as label throughout without constraining choices. Eligible for ≥6.1 with all gates, but applying −1.0 for summary-only use (key involvement recounted, not dramatized) and −0.5 for swappability (any metaphor for grief/guilt could replace it) = 4.6, adjusted to 4.2 for label-only deployment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The attribute "vividly descriptive" is demonstrated on the page through sensory detail (earth, decay, perfume, starlight, crimson weft) rather than stated. Setup: paragraph 1 (autumn leaves, shadowed garden). Development: paragraphs 9, 14, 21 (scents, shadows deepening, stars emerging). Payoff: paragraph 29 (lonesome splendor of autumn in the shadowed garden). All three gates met. The attribute enables the traveler's work (sensory saturation to project presence) and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it enriches texture without altering tactics. Applying +0.8 for early signal, +0.9 for two distinct beats, +0.7 for closure linkage, −0.5 for ornamental use = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The action "intimate" appears thematically but is not embodied in a major turn. Paragraph 9: "intimate communion with nature." Paragraph 18: "projection of presence allowed him to feel Thomas's hands in the soil." Setup: paragraph 9. Development: paragraph 18 (empathic projection). Payoff: the final paragraphs describe an internal shift but no physical act of intimacy. Two gates met (setup, development), missing closure participation. The action is recounted rather than dramatized; no on-page scene of connection or touch. Applying cap 6.0 for two-gate presence, then −0.5 for summary-only use and −0.4 for swappability (any empathic act could serve) = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The method "by projecting presence" is mentioned in paragraphs 8, 18, 27 but never shown in action. Setup: paragraph 8 (introduced as a gift). Development: paragraph 18 (allowed him to feel Thomas's hands). Payoff: paragraph 27 (projection had become a defense). All three gates met, but the mechanics are not dramatized; the method is asserted as capability without on-page demonstration. The reader never sees how the projection works or constrains his attempts. Applying cap 3.8 for swappability (any empathic skill could replace it with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn is established in paragraph 1 and recurs throughout (paragraphs 4, 10, 14, 16, 21, 25, 29). Setup: paragraph 1. Development: paragraph 21 (shadows growing, daylight surrendering). Payoff: paragraph 29 (lonesome splendor of autumn in the shadowed garden). All three gates met. The setting charges the tone and frames reflection but does not constrain a choice or supply resources that alter tactics. It is postcard-descriptive rather than pressuring. Applying +0.8 for early signal, +0.9 for two distinct beats, +0.7 for closure linkage, −0.5 for ornamental use = 6.9, adjusted to 6.3 for lyric resonance without mid-scene tactical use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last ship had sailed" appears in paragraphs 4 and 25. Setup: paragraph 4. Development: absent. Payoff: paragraph 25 (repeated in the closure section). Only two gates met (setup, payoff), missing middle development. The ship's departure does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; it is atmospheric context. The element is ornamental and swappable. Applying cap 4.6 for missing middle development, then −0.8 for ornamental use and −0.8 for swappability = 3.0, adjusted to 2.4 for summary-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the geography of healing" is stated in paragraphs 10, 21, 29. Setup: paragraph 10. Development: paragraph 21 (mapping the geography of healing). Payoff: paragraph 29 (something beginning to heal within his geography of self). All three gates met. The desire is told and thematically reinforced but not dramatized in conflicted choices; no on-page friction between wants and costs. Applying +0.8 for early signal, +0.4 for one beat, +0.7 for closure linkage, −0.8 for told-only deployment = 5.1, adjusted to 5.6 for thematic consistency across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone "lonesome splendor" is coherent from opening ("lonesome, yet splendid" in paragraph 4) through the final image ("lonesome splendor of autumn" in paragraph 29). Setup: paragraph 4. Development: paragraphs 14, 22 (shadows, quiet majesty). Payoff: paragraph 29 (charges the final image). All three gates met. The tone modulates subtly with pressure (shadows deepening, stars emerging) and remains consistent without flattening. Applying +0.8 for early signal, +0.9 for two distinct beats, +1.8 for closure linkage, +0.5 for causal pressure (tone shapes perception under stress) = 7.1, capped at 7.1 to avoid over-crediting a single well-executed element.</comment>
