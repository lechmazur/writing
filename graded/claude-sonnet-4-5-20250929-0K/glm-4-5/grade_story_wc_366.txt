<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's reticence is labeled rather than dramatized through meaningful silence under pressure. His interior journey from isolation to connection is mapped, but the final choice (adding his stone, writing his letter) arrives as ceremonial confirmation rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The "warmly observant" trait remains decorative; observation never constrains or enables a pivotal action. Embodied contradictions are absent—loneliness is named ("luminescent ache") but not shown through simultaneous competing impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered discoveries (sea glass, letters, stone stacks) deepen the stake and reweight Elias's solitary existence through connection across time. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elias joins the chain, accepting fellowship with visible cost (carrying the vial, protecting silence). Orientation anchors early (lighthouse, Elias, supply run). One meaningful deepening occurs when he discovers the hidden compartment and realizes the tradition's scope. The cost at closure is felt but oblique—he commits to the chain, yet no prior path is dramatized as foreclosed on the page, weakening the before/after contrast.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse interior is vividly rendered ("salt, oil, and something like the pause between thunderclaps") and the sea glass functions as micro-setting object that charges the final act. Spatial choreography is coherent (dock, spiral staircase, lantern room, control panel, floorboard). The lantern room's "haunted" reputation sets tone but does not constrain a choice; the lamp's failure provides discovery access, not tactical pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency during the blackout. The recurring sea glass and stone stack anchor closure, meeting the 9+ gate narrowly, though the haunted element remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: emotional isolation versus connection across time, signaled early and sustained. The lamp's failure provides discovery access but does not narrow options under pressure—Elias faces no competing choice or trade-off. The single tightening (realization of the keeper chain's continuity) deepens understanding but does not force a decision with visible cost; his final acts (stone, letter, vial) are adoptions of ritual rather than wrestled choices. No reversal tests commitment; the letters welcome him without friction. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of fellowship transcending solitude emerges organically from the letter chain, stone stacks, and sea glass marker. The final image (vial of seawater, shrinking tower) offers a resonant non-literal answer to the loneliness question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the "luminescent ache" and the silence Elias protects. One slip: "his purpose clear" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though it stops short of sermon. The sea glass and stone motifs constrain the ending and accumulate pressure, avoiding token recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature reflects Elias's maritime experience and reticence. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("weathered by sea and time," "pause between thunderclaps"). One register slip: "luminescent ache" recurs as a label rather than an embodied sensation, edging toward elevated abstraction at odds with a taciturn skipper's idiom. The phrase "Consensus reality" anti-pattern appears subtly: the letters' collective wisdom aligns too neatly without friction or misinterpretation. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and clarity is generally maintained, but several artifacts accumulate. Paraphrase loop: "the lantern room was haunted" (paragraph 4) and "the supposedly haunted lantern room" (paragraph 18) restate without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The" + noun constructions in close succession (paragraphs 3, 9, 18, 22, 35). Stock metaphor: "white tower piercing the morning fog like a solitary promise" is functional but borrows familiar imagery. Filter-verb stack: "seemed to move," "smelled of," "something caught his eye" cluster in the discovery sequence. Applying −0.6 baseline for spread and −0.2 for paraphrase loop totals −0.8, with minor added pressure from the template runs. Information density is high in the discovery beats; the vial moment (paragraph 31) adds a beat that does little causal work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain premise is specific and emotionally grounded, but the "lighthouse keeper fellowship across time" frame echoes familiar narrative templates (hidden messages, lineage of guardians). Transformation is partial: the stone-stacking method and sea glass marker add texture, yet the emotional arc (lonely man finds connection through discovered tradition) follows a well-trodden path without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that makes it irreplaceable. The "luminescent ache" phrase and vial of seawater offer lyric specificity. Risk is modest; the piece executes its premise cleanly but does not subvert or deepen it in hindsight. Applying −0.7 for derivative premise within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his role as supply skipper provides access, but his reticence does not constrain a key choice—observation dominates over decision. Setup clear (paragraph 1); development weak (he discovers but does not wrestle); payoff ceremonial (joins the chain without visible friction). Two touches across beats (discovery, final ritual) but no causal pressure that narrows options. His choices at closure (stone, letter, vial) are adoptions rather than turns. Swappable with "solitary caretaker" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in three beats: discovery beneath control panel (paragraph 14), explanation in final letter (paragraph 23), return to floorboards (paragraph 30). Setup mid-story (~40% mark); development as marker of unbroken chain; payoff as seal on commitment. The object's jade-green specificity and polished-by-tides detail anchor it, and its return charges Elias's commitment. It does not constrain a choice under pressure but accumulates symbolic weight across beats and participates in closure. Late first appearance (−0.3) and ornamental use in discovery beat (−0.2) lower the score; closure linkage and irreplaceability (unique marker role) elevate it into the 6.5–7.0 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anonymous letter chain is the conceptual spine: signaled early (paragraph 6 "strange writings"), discovered mid-story (paragraph 17), and drives Elias's final acts (paragraph 29 "wrote his letter"). Setup early; development reshapes his understanding of solitude and fellowship; payoff integral (he joins the chain, protecting its silence). The chain changes his options (from isolation to lineage) and forecloses his prior solitary stance with felt cost (carrying the responsibility to protect). Three beats, high causal pressure, closure active. Irreplaceable; the stone stacks and sea glass are extensions of this core concept. Strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is labeled in paragraph 2 and implied in his noticing details (sea glass, loose floorboard), but the trait never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Setup present; development label-only; no payoff choice where warmth or observation forecloses a path. His observations lead to discovery, but any attentive character would notice the same cues. Swappable with "attentive" or "careful" without structural change. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Protect" is signaled early (paragraph 7 "Elias maintained the lighthouse system") and crystallizes at closure (paragraph 34 "he would protect its silence just as he protected the light"). The action shapes his final choices: protecting the letter chain's anonymity, returning the sea glass, carrying the vial as talisman. Setup early; development implicit in maintenance role; payoff explicit and thematic. Two beats (maintenance role, final vow) with closure linkage. The dual object (light and chain) is specific and irreplaceable. Cost visible (he accepts the keeper's burden). High causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stone stacking is introduced mid-story (paragraphs 19–21), explained as a silent conversation method, and Elias recreates it with his own stone at closure (paragraph 28). Setup ~55% mark (late, −0.4); development as generational message system; payoff active (he adds his stone, joining the chain). The method's mechanics (balance, formations conveying meanings) are described but not tested under pressure—no scene where decoding or stacking choices matter to tactics. Two beats (discovery, recreation) with closure participation. Lyric resonance (first mention → final act) reweights the fellowship stake. Late arrival and lack of tactical constraint limit the score; closure charge and irreplaceability (unique communication form) elevate it to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room is named early (paragraph 4), provides discovery space when the lamp fails (paragraphs 12–16), and is referenced at closure (paragraph 33 "ghosts of the lantern room had finally found their peace in him"). Setup clear; development as discovery vessel; payoff thematic (ghost metaphor resolved). The "haunted" reputation sets atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias would discover the compartment regardless. The lamp failure is mechanical, not supernatural. Two beats (intro, closure callback) with symbolic closure participation. Postcard haunted-lighthouse description trends low; the lantern room as physical setting (spiral staircase, control panel, floorboard) does more work than the "haunted" modifier. Mid-band for atmospheric resonance without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the lamp flickers out" is precise: lamp dies (paragraph 12), discovery unfolds in darkness (paragraphs 13–24), lamp restored (paragraph 26), final acts follow. Setup at ~35%; development during blackout discovery sequence; payoff implicit (restoration enables departure with new understanding). The blackout creates discovery urgency (his handheld beam, searching for fault) and tightens the window, though the story does not track elapsed minutes or show time pressure altering tactics. Two beats (failure, restoration) with the discovery window between. The timeframe is specific (continuous darkness) and irreplaceable (no lamp flicker, no hidden compartment access), but it functions as a discovery gate rather than a live clock that narrows options under pressure. Causal role in one major beat plus closure setup earns mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Bottle the feeling of safety" appears once (paragraph 31) near closure: Elias fills a vial with seawater and sand as "his attempt to bottle the feeling of safety the lighthouse provided." Setup absent until final third (−0.7); no middle development; payoff present but told rather than dramatized. The desire is asserted in summary ("feeling wasn't just physical protection from shipwrecks, but emotional shelter") without friction or conflicting cost. Single beat, late arrival, summary-only use (−0.3), swappable with "preserve the memory" (−0.4). The vial itself has symbolic closure charge, but the motivation is narrated rather than shown through choice under pressure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears three times: paragraph 24 ("luminescent ache of loneliness and kinship washed over him"), paragraph 36 ("The luminescent ache would remain"), and implicit in the tone throughout (e.g., "pause between thunderclaps," "warmly observant," sea and memory motifs). Setup as label mid-story; development as emotional through-line; payoff as final thematic anchor. The tone is coherent and modulates from isolation to tentative connection, supporting the Accumulative lens. One friction: the phrase itself is elevated and label-like, not fully embodied—"ache" is named rather than shown through contradictory impulses or physical sensation. Two explicit mentions plus atmospheric coherence; closure linkage strong. The tone charges the final image but edges toward stock lyricism. Coherence and closure charge earn mid-6s; label-only embodiment (−0.3) prevents higher band entry.</comment>
