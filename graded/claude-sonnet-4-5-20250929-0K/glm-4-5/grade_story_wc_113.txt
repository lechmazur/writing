<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (to unravel a ghost's code through music) is clear and drives his return to the flooded theater, but his interior life relies heavily on abstract concepts ("familiar pull," "in between spaces") rather than embodied contradiction. The decisive choice to play the composition is foreclosed more by atmospheric inevitability than by competing impulses acting in scene. Emotional states are declared ("strange kinship," "growing confidence") without the contradictory layering or micro-hesitations that would demonstrate genuine struggle under pressure. The final dissolution of the program provides closure, but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear orientation (orchestra pit musician in flooded opera house) and follows a single continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elias discovers the program, deciphers its patterns, plays the composition, and completes the ghost's unfinished performance. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the ghost's suspended performance is completed, the liminal space resolved). However, the escalation reads as atmospheric intensification rather than a tightening of options or a meaningful reversal—Elias never doubts, reconsiders, or faces friction that narrows his path. The cost at closure (program dissolving, peace achieved) is legible but feels more symbolic than viscerally earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (ankle-deep water, gilded walls, pearls-in-the-deep keys) that sustains atmosphere and filters through Elias's musician's perspective. The grand piano "miraculously untouched" in shallow water constrains the final choice (he must play it to complete the ritual), and the translucent ghost figure in the wings charges the ending image. Spatial choreography (wading, approaching stage, positioning at piano) remains clear throughout. The setting does more than backdrop; it provides the material conditions (water damage, preserved piano) that enable the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—completing the ghost's unfinished performance to resolve her liminal suspension—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Elias's agency is present (he chooses to return nightly, lift the program, play the composition), but pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating through reversals or tightening choices. No moment forces a trade-off or narrows options; the path from discovery to playing to resolution unfolds without friction or cost-bearing hesitation. The ending reconfigures the space from suspended to peaceful, but the transformation lacks a visible price that would elevate the stakes into higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of liminal spaces and unfinished conversations emerges organically from the flooded opera house, suspended performance, and water-damaged notation without overt statement. The "wordless conversation" motif recurs purposefully (musician-to-ghost dialogue through music) and the final image (peaceful hush after completion) offers a resonant answer to the central question of how art and presence persist across death. However, the theme skews abstract—"in between spaces," "暧昧 possibility," "universal language of melody"—leaning toward thematic echo rather than being anchored in irreducible particulars. The ending avoids moralizing but also lacks the conceptual friction or ambiguity that would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual filtering through Elias's musician lens (keys "gleaming like pearls," stains forming "musical notation"). However, diction drifts into elevated register incongruent with immediate crisis ("capricious nature of water and time," "暧昧 possibility," "transcended spoken words and touched the soul directly") that reads more like authorial meditation than a musician's embodied perception under pressure. Sentence rhythm is consistent but leans toward uniformity—long, layered constructions with similar cadence across beats. No dialogue appears, so that bullet is not applicable. The voice lacks the perceptual signature and syntactic modulation under stress required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and carries atmospheric density, but suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Adjacent sentences restate concepts without adding pressure: "the space that existed in between—the liminal threshold" (para 2), "hauntingly familiar yet utterly alien" echoed by "ancient and new, like a memory of something never experienced" (para 14). Figurative language clusters heavily in reflective beats ("pearls in the deep," "shimmering stars in a midnight sky," "sanctuary of sound") without pattern-teaching or payoff tied to closure. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("暧昧 possibility," "transcended spoken words," "mortal and eternal") occurs repeatedly. These artifacts accumulate across the piece, dulling momentum and clarity at key moments, triggering deductions under the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—musician discovers ghost's code in water-damaged opera program and completes her suspended performance—is recognizable as a template (haunted-artist-solves-mystery-through-art). The flooded opera house and water-created notation offer vivid particulars, but the emotional arc and resolution follow predictable beats without a non-obvious turn. The piece does not transform the premise through lived detail, unexpected friction, or moral calculus; Elias proceeds smoothly from discovery to resolution without complication. Specificity in setting partially offsets derivative structure, but the lack of risk or synthesis keeps the score in mid-bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias (orchestra pit musician) frames the story and makes the key choice to play the composition, but his professional identity does minimal causal work. The fact that he is specifically a pit musician rather than any musician does not constrain or enable beats; "musician" alone would suffice. He is present at setup, middle (lifting program, approaching piano), and closure (playing the final chord), satisfying all three gates. His choice to play is the climactic action, but it feels inevitable rather than hard-won, and the cost tied to his musicianship is not made distinct on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The antique opera program appears early (para 4), is handled and examined in multiple beats (lifting it, noticing stains as notation, positioning it on the music stand), and dissolves at closure to signal completion. It enables the climactic action (playing the ghost's composition) and its water-damaged images drive the middle beats. However, the program does not return with reweighted meaning—it simply fulfills its function and vanishes. The mechanics of how it encodes the ghost's code remain vague ("water-stained images aligning into measures"), reducing specificity. Strong beat involvement and closure participation earn mid-7s eligibility, but lack of cost and swappability (any coded artifact could serve) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is declared repeatedly as theme (para 2, 8, 13, 16, 19) but does not shape on-page tactics or constrain choices. Elias is drawn to liminal thresholds, but this pull never forces a decision with cost—he simply acts on it. The concept colors atmosphere and narration but remains ornamental to the plot. It appears across beats as label rather than pressure, fitting the 3.0–4.9 functional-but-replaceable band. Removing "in between" language would not alter the story's logic or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Lately inspired by dreams of melodies never fully formed" (para 3) motivates Elias's repeated returns but does not constrain or enable a beat with visible cost. The attribute is mentioned once and then absorbed into general motivation; no scene tests or dramatizes this trait through a trade-off or friction. It seeds his presence but could be swapped for any artistic compulsion ("curiosity," "obsession") without structural change. Present at setup, absent in development and closure—fails two gates and remains label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Disrupt the silence" (para 11) frames the climactic choice: Elias realizes he must break the suspended quiet by playing. This action is signaled at midpoint, drives the final third (approaching piano, positioning program, playing), and defines the closure beat (music fills the space, ghost appears, peace returns). The disruption is causally necessary—without it, the ghost's performance remains incomplete. However, the act itself is smooth and uncontested; no friction complicates the execution, and the cost is atmospheric rather than felt. Strong causal role and closure participation place it in the 7.0–8.4 band, but lack of on-page struggle or visible price prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is introduced early (para 5: "water damage had created peculiar images") and examined in detail (para 6: "stains formed what looked like musical notation"). The mechanics matter—water and time co-author the ghost's code—and Elias must decipher this unusual composition to proceed. However, the method is passive (damage already occurred) and does not shape his attempts or tactics; he simply reads and plays. It appears at setup and middle development but does not return or reweight at closure. Two gates satisfied, modest causal role, no closure charge—mid-5s fit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns is established immediately and sustained across every beat, providing both atmosphere and material constraint. The ankle-deep water forces Elias to wade (para 1, 4), the preserved piano enables the climactic performance (para 12), and the lanterns' light reflects off water to charge the final image (para 15). The setting is not swappable—remove the flood and the water-damaged program disappears; remove the preserved piano and the resolution fails. Spatial choreography (pit → stage → piano) remains clear. All three gates satisfied, strong causal and closure participation, but the cost tied to environment is implicit rather than dramatized, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" (para 2) is lyric phrasing that colors tone but does not function as a timeframe. No clock, deadline, or temporal pressure tightens decisions. Elias has returned "night after night," but the present scene unfolds without urgency or time constraint. The phrase recurs in the final line ("once-unstruck chords that had finally found their voice"), offering weak lyric reprise, but it does not shape tactics or escalation. Ornamental, no gate participation, trends low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to unravel the ghost's code (para 8: "he had come to believe she had left behind a code") is seeded early and drives Elias's choice to decipher the program and play the composition. It is dramatized through on-page action (lifting, studying, playing) rather than told-only. However, the desire faces no friction or competing impulse—Elias never doubts, fears consequence, or weighs cost. The ghost's code is resolved at closure (program dissolves, aria completed), but the ending feels more atmospheric release than hard-won insight. Setup and closure gates satisfied, middle development present but smooth, lacks visible struggle—mid-6s fit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" is declared as tone (para 9, 17: "wordless conversation stretching across the years through the language of music") and recurs at closure (para 19: "the conversation that silence had interrupted"). The tone is coherent—quiet, reverent, lyric—and modulates slightly as music begins (para 15: lanterns brighten, figure appears). However, the tone remains a single static mood rather than charging the final image with fresh pressure. The phrase functions more as thematic label than tonal control. Lyric reprise earns mid-band eligibility, but lack of modulation under pressure and ornamental use cap the score.</comment>
