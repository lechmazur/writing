<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation to translate isolation into independence is declared but never tested through meaningful choice-points with visible cost. The "brittle awakenings" feel ornamental—label-only rather than embodied struggle that constrains her options. Her final understanding arrives as summary epiphany ("her independence had been waiting within her all along") rather than earned through on-page friction between contradictory impulses. Interiority remains abstract throughout, leaning on therapy-speak like "raw and exposed" without specific bodily sensation or micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The piece offers no clear closure unit—Elena's realization in the final paragraph is told rather than shown through a decisive act, renunciation, or charged image with legible cost. The narrative is entirely retrospective summary with no present-tense scene pressure; "today's awakening" is declared but never dramatized in a continuous beat. Causality is vague: the reincarnation memory "flooded her consciousness three moons ago," yet no on-page event tests or changes her stance now. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, but the final line delivers abstract assertion instead of a resonant image that reweights prior material with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal library is vividly rendered—shelves breathing, books flowing on currents—and the brass sundial and atomically reflective surfaces supply memorable visual anchors. However, none of these elements constrain a choice or charge the final image; they remain postcard descriptions. Spatial choreography is coherent (corridors, crystal window, stone circle foundation), but Elena never interacts with the environment in a way that alters tactics or forecloses a path, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early but never escalates through on-page pressure or reversal. No concrete choice narrows options; Elena's journey is recounted in summary rather than dramatized in beats with rising cost. The "hum of the stone circle" and her hand on the reflective wall occur in a static tableau without agency or trade-off. Closure lacks visible price: she "finally understood" is an assertion, not an earned shift shaped by protagonist decision under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—coexistence, identity, memory—emerges from the concept but is over-articulated rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "her independence had been waiting within her all along" reads as prompt thesis rather than resonant image. The brass sundial's return and the golden-light mosaic offer symbolic gestures, but they do not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext is minimal; most meaning is stated directly, flattening complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person close is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature exists—Elena notices the library's tides, the sundial's cosmic rhythm—but diction drifts into elevated register ("phantoms of all her former selves dancing") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Sentence stems repeat ("The library," "These," "Elena," "The brass sundial") across adjacent paragraphs, creating template cadence. No dialogue is present; voice modulates minimally across emotional beats, maintaining a consistent lyric distance without embodied urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Prose is legible but loops and scaffolds proliferate: "atomically reflective" appears three times, "coexist/coexistence" four times, and adjacent paragraphs begin with identical stems. Paraphrase loops are evident—paragraphs 6 and 16 both describe Elena before reflective surfaces with near-identical content. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "breathing lungs," "flowing currents," "phantoms dancing," "golden light" stack without causal payoff. Information density is low; most sentences restate mood rather than advance situation. The final image ("stood… and finally understood") is abstract summary, dulling closure impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tidal library above clouds and the Aethenian last-survivor premise offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc—lonely figure achieves self-acceptance through mystical insight—is a template resolution. No fresh inflection transforms the material; the reincarnation memory and ancient stone circle arrive as convenient catalysts rather than particulars that complicate stakes. The final turn is generic: acceptance of isolation as connection. Proximity check passes, but the story reads as a prompt fulfillment rather than a singular artistic vision with lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout as "the last known Aethenian," but her status as contemporary of an extinct species shapes backstory context rather than forcing on-page choices. She observes and reflects; no decision in the text hinges on this attribute or its trade-offs. The element is functional but replaceable—any isolated protagonist archetype could occupy her role without altering the story's beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in three beats: paragraph 2 (description), paragraph 15 (chimes midnight), paragraph 20 (casts no shadow). It marks phases rather than constraining action; Elena does not interact with it, and its "purpose served" is asserted rather than shown through a choice. The final mention reweights it symbolically (her internal clock replaces it), lifting it slightly above ornamental, but it remains swappable with any timekeeping device.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" is named in paragraph 7 and echoed in paragraph 17 ("brittle fragments… coalesce"), but the concept remains thematic decoration. No on-page awakening is dramatized with specific sensory cost or tactical constraint; Elena wakes "feeling new and fragile" in summary. The concept does not shape her choices or alter options—it is a label for a mood rather than a stake-driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Atomically reflective surfaces" appear in paragraphs 5, 6, and 16. Elena touches one in paragraph 5 (triggering the reincarnation memory offstage) and again in paragraph 16 (feeling the hum), but the attribute itself—atomic reflectivity—does not constrain or enable action beyond serving as a mirror. The trait is present but ornamental; any mystical surface would work equally well.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Coexist/coexistence" is signaled in paragraph 11, developed in paragraphs 12–14 via the stone circle's hum teaching balance, and reprised in paragraph 18 ("learned to coexist"). The action shapes Elena's method of engaging the library's forces and ties to the ending's synthesis. However, the coexistence is recounted rather than tested through a choice with visible cost; it drives mood but not a decisive turn, placing it in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "hum of an ancient stone circle" is introduced in paragraph 13, described as teaching balance in paragraph 14, and felt again in paragraph 16. It signals the method early and connects to the ending's harmony. However, the hum is passive sensation rather than a means Elena employs to solve a problem; its mechanics do not shape attempts or tactics in a dramatized beat, limiting it to functional background.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "tidal library above the clouds" is established in paragraph 1, elaborated with breathing shelves and flowing books in paragraph 3, and referenced throughout. The setting supplies vivid atmosphere and anchors Elena's isolation. Its tides metaphorically mirror her journey, and the stone circle's foundation plays into the ending. The library does not pressure a choice directly, but its coherent presence and thematic resonance lift it above mere backdrop, reaching lower 6-band territory.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory" is the timeframe anchor, stated in paragraph 4 ("three moons ago"). It frames the backstory but does not create urgency or tighten on-page decisions—no countdown or escalating consequence tied to elapsed time. The piece operates in a timeless reflective mode; the timeframe is context rather than constraint, scoring low-mid functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To translate isolation into independence" is declared in paragraph 10 and reprised in the final line. The motivation structures Elena's arc and the ending image reweights it (isolation becomes connection). However, the desire is told rather than tested through conflicted choices with visible friction; no on-page beat forces her to sacrifice one value for the other. The motivation is present and shapes theme, earning solid mid-band integration, but lacks the dramatized cost needed for higher scores.</comment>
