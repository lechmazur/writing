<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clearly rooted in his late wife's memory and his craft philosophy, but his interior life relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("the weight of small moments," "haunted euphoria") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice—turning away from the jetty—reads as acceptance rather than a decision with visible cost that forecloses a path; he's simply acknowledging what has already been decided for him (digitization). Embodied emotion is present in physical details (calloused fingers, knees creaking) but the peak beats lean on conceptual labels instead of showing degraded perception under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear temporal anchor (twilight, fortnight of visits, final night before digitization) and maintains spatial coherence on the jetty. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the archivist layers ritual actions (mixing powders, drawing, sealing the vial) to deepen his relationship with analog preservation. However, the closure unit—turning away with the locket and journal—reconfigures meaning only subtly; the "haunted euphoria" and acceptance were already present from the opening, so the final image intensifies rather than decisively shifts his stance. Cost is implied (loss of purpose, transition to obsolescence) but not felt as a visible forfeiture on the page; he packs up and walks forward without dramatized resistance or renunciation that would qualify as Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: wildflowers pushing through weathered planks, twilight's fading light, the transition to proper night. Sensory details are filtered through the archivist's Naturalist perspective and reflect his priorities (observing patterns, mixing flower powders). The setting constrains his ritual by providing the raw materials (seven flower types) and charges the final image as he takes "one final look" before leaving. Spatial choreography is clean and the environment evolves causally (sunset to darkness) in step with his emotional arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving analog craft and meaning before digitization—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. Pressure accumulates through layered ritual actions and temporal countdown (final night), consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is more textural than causal; no reversal or tightening narrows his options, and the resolution (packing and walking away) stems from external forces (archive transition) rather than a protagonist choice that forecloses a path. The "regenerated covenant" process demonstrates craft but does not face on-page resistance or complication that would test commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the archivist's actions and the jetty setting: the tension between preservation and obsolescence, the weight of memory, the transition from analog to digital. The regenerated covenant motif recurs and shifts meaning across beats (restoration technique, philosophical stance, final sealing of the vial). However, the ending inches toward explicit statement—"how precious it is to hold anything at all"—rather than letting the final image answer the thematic question non-literally. Subtext operates in gestures (tracing the locket, the warm photo against his chest) but the piece occasionally articulates its thesis ("when context changes, new possibilities emerge") rather than trusting dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and the archivist's perceptual signature (methodical observation, chemical precision, Naturalist pattern-seeking) remains consistent. Diction is controlled and vocabulary fits his character ("proximate causes," "walnut-ink formula"). However, several phrases edge into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-particular: "haunted euphoria," "the ghost of satisfaction amidst the anxiety of transformation," "unfamiliar territory of tomorrow." Under peak emotional pressure (the final packing and departure), syntax remains measured and philosophical rather than compressing or fragmenting in ways that would reflect genuine stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful detail and varied sentence rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "The haunted euphoria intensified" / "The haunted euphoria remained"; "steep documents in a solution" / "dipped his brush...letting it steep"; "blooming jetty" recurs seven times without functional variation. Template cadence is visible in repeated "as" constructions across adjacent sentences ("As he opened," "As he mixed," "As the last stroke fell," "As twilight surrendered"). Stock metaphor "winds of change" appears without transformation. Information density is moderate; some beats do double work (locket warming + memory acknowledgment) but others rehearse the same emotional note (euphoria, preservation philosophy) without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—analog archivist on the eve of digitization—is familiar but grounded in specific craft detail (walnut-ink formula, flower powders, ninety-second steeping). The "regenerated covenant" concept and the Naturalist lens offer modest freshness. However, the emotional arc and resolution (acceptance of change, carrying memory forward) follow a well-worn template without sharp inflection. The locket photo and blooming jetty function as expected symbolic anchors; no turn or image subverts the forecast trajectory. Transformation test: the core conflict and emotional resolution could transfer to other obsolete craftspeople with minimal alteration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist is present throughout and his occupation frames the stakes. His choices (mixing powders, drawing the jetty, sealing the vial, turning away) are demonstrated on the page across multiple beats. However, these choices enact a pre-determined ritual rather than creating reversals; the archive transition is externally imposed and he does not alter tactics or forfeit a live option. He observes and preserves but does not face dramatized resistance that would force a decision with cost. Scores in the functional-but-replaceable band: the role anchors setting and tone but the character's agency does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in three beats: opening (smiling image, crinkling eyes), midpoint (grows warm against his chest), and near the end (tracing with blurred vision, tucked against his heart). Its presence signals his motivation and returns with slight emotional reweighting (warmth as acknowledgment, blurred vision under emotion). However, handling is static—he opens, traces, tucks—without evolving use that constrains a choice. It charges the closure by being present in the final packing but does not decisively shape the ending action. Scores in the mid-band: purposeful early–final reprise with cost connection but no middle development that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "regenerated covenant" is introduced early as the archivist's painstaking restoration technique using walnut-ink formula, then recurs as a philosophical stance ("not between ink and paper, but between what was and what might be remembered") and finally as the sealed vial—"a final archive of the analog world." It shapes his motivation and frames the ritual actions. However, it remains more thematic echo than mechanical stake; the covenant does not narrow his options or face on-page complication. The concept is present across beats and participates in closure (sealing the vial) but functions primarily as motif rather than causal constraint. Scores at the lower edge of "shapes one key turn" because it charges the final image without driving a decision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is applied twice: "His approach to his craft was gently thorough, never rushing" and the closing "gently thorough until the very end." It describes his methodology (ninety-second steeping, careful attention to each wildflower) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is consistent with his choices but could be swapped for "meticulous" or "patient" without structural change. Label-only usage trends low; no tradeoff where being gently thorough forecloses speed or efficiency in a moment of pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Steep" appears multiple times: steeping documents in the walnut-ink solution (the regeneration technique), letting the brush steep for ninety seconds, and the closing metaphor "steep one more time in its memories." The action is integral to his craft and recurs with reweighted meaning (literal chemical process → metaphorical immersion in memory). It shapes the ritual middle beat (precise timing, compound bonding) and charges the final philosophical turn. However, it does not create a major reversal or alter options under pressure; the steeping succeeds without complication. Scores in the mid-band: causal role in one major beat plus charged closure reprise, but swappable with other craft verbs (mix, distill) without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is named twice: the walnut-ink technique works "through proximate causes—each chemical reaction predictable, deliberate, necessary" and the protagonist's dedication has carried the weight of moments "through proximate causes of love, loss, and dedication." The method is signaled and shapes his Naturalist worldview (seeing patterns, trusting causality). However, its mechanics do not constrain an attempt or choice; it functions as thematic label rather than tactical tool. If removed, the story's ritual and closure remain intact. Introduced early but remains ornamental in application; no beat depends on this exact method to succeed or fail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is established immediately and recurs across all beats: wildflowers provide the seven powders, weathered planks ground his ritual, twilight's fading light tracks emotional pressure, and the jetty is named in his final drawing and departure. The setting supplies essential resources (flowers for the ink formula) that enable his regeneration process and charges the final image ("one final look at the place where he had nurtured his regenerated covenant"). Spatial details are specific (violet and crimson petals, stems pushing toward light) and filter through his Naturalist lens. However, the setting does not constrain a choice with cost; it supports rather than complicates his ritual. Scores solidly: present in setup, middle, and closure; provides resources and charges the ending but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When context changes" is the explicit timeframe: "Tomorrow, everything would change—the archive would be digitized" and "when context changes...new possibilities emerge" and "the context changed again—sunset gave way to proper night." The temporal deadline (final night before digitization) tightens the ritual with urgency and the twilight-to-darkness transition tracks emotional progression. However, the countdown is more backdrop than active pressure; no beat shows him racing the clock or altering tactics because time is running out. The transition happens on schedule without complication. Scores in the mid-band: frames stakes and modulates across beats but does not drive a decision under time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of small moments" is stated explicitly ("I must preserve...") and dramatized through his actions: developing the regeneration technique, mixing flower powders, drawing the jetty, sealing the vial. The motivation is rooted in his wife's memory and drives the ritual across beats. However, it is told more than conflicted; no on-page friction tests whether preservation is worth the cost of isolation or whether letting go might be healthier. The desire shapes choices but faces no opposing want or fear that would create authentic tension. Scores in the mid-band: present, coherent, and causal but not dramatized as internal conflict with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named five times and described as "the ghost of satisfaction amidst the anxiety of transformation" and "joy and sorrow entwined." The tone is coherent and modulates with the twilight-to-darkness transition and his packing ritual. However, it remains a declared emotional state rather than emerging from scene pressure; the prose maintains steady philosophical register instead of shifting cadence to embody euphoria's contradictions. The tone charges the final image (remains "a constant companion") but does not degrade or sharpen under peak stress. Scores in the mid-band: consistent and purposeful but static mood rather than tone that evolves with pressure and reconfigures meaning at closure.</comment>
