<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Archie's motivation—loneliness—is declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The "desperately jocular" trait appears as a label without constraining choices; we see him practice laughter in a mirror but never witness the trait forcing a costly trade-off under pressure. His plan unfolds via summary (rumor spreads through taxi drivers, baristas) rather than on-page micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The moon rock gambit succeeds offstage, leaving the protagonist's agency passive; no visible cost forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the rumor mechanism suggests causal linkage, but the piece accumulates texture through list-like beats. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit—Archie realizing connection comes from sharing rumors, not the rock itself—lands as Conceptual Repricing, but cost is asserted rather than shown; no visible price paid on the page. The rumor's spread is summarized in montage fragments rather than dramatized, weakening the because/therefore chain. One tightening occurs (rumor ignites community interest), but it lacks on-page agency or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The disused railway station overgrown with ivy is established early and returns in multiple beats, anchoring Archie's operations. Ivy-choked windows and cracked mirror supply tactile detail. The setting functions as "neutral ground" and sanctuary, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric. The moon rock fragment (a body-scale object) is handled across beats and its fake nature charges the final realization, lifting the score slightly via micro-setting function.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—curing loneliness—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Archie's plan succeeds via summary montage (taxi driver → chef → newsletter → café strangers) without reversal, complication, or visible cost. No on-page moment where the protagonist must choose between competing goods or pay a price that narrows options. Coincidence (the rumor spreads perfectly) resolves the conflict rather than protagonist agency. The final insight ("the cure wasn't the rumor but the sharing") is told, not earned through a dramatized choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—loneliness and human connection—emerges clearly but relies on explicit statement in the closing lines: "the cure he'd sought wasn't the rumor but the sharing of it." The moon rock's transformation from pumice to symbol operates at the conceptual level, offering a non-literal answer, but the thematic turn is delivered via summary rather than a resonant final image. Reciprocity as a motif is mentioned repeatedly but does not constrain choices or accumulate pressure. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; most meaning is stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Archie; no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture ("desperately jocular," "polite anarchy") but diction is uneven: "catalyze," "plausible deniability," "meticulously constructed" drift into corporate register not motivated by Archie's disaster-relief idiom. Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance remains consistent. The perceptual signature is generic; Archie's noticing does not reflect his logistician expertise or his loneliness in a character-specific way. Free indirect style is clean when used.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "His laugh echoed" / "his voice cracking" / "his briefcase clutched"; "The first taxi" / "Fifteen minutes later" / "Three days later" / "By week's end" creates a mechanical time-stamp pattern. Figurative language is sparse. Some scaffolding remains: "such was the paradoxical reciprocity that defined his existence" tells rather than dramatizes. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job. Grammar and punctuation are clean. The montage structure compresses transit efficiently but also flattens momentum in the middle third. No severe opacity, but rhythm is sluggish.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—spreading a fake moon-rock rumor to catalyze connection—offers a quirky angle, but the execution leans on template wish-fulfillment: the plan succeeds without friction, transforming strangers into a "community of believers." The railway station hideout and "polite anarchy" network gesture toward originality but remain vague. Emotional specificity is low; Archie's loneliness is asserted, not embodied through lived detail. Transformation test: swap Archie for any lonely protagonist with a fake artifact and the arc holds unchanged. Risk-taking is moderate; the story avoids bold structural or moral calculus choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Archie is present throughout and initiates the rumor plan, but his choices are summarized rather than dramatized. He adjusts his tie, practices his laugh, exits the station, makes follow-up calls—none of these actions create a key turn under pressure. The story tells us he "meticulously constructed" a network and "began planning his next move," but we do not witness the decisions that alter tactics. Present and functional, but swappable with any other lonely logistician. Missing middle development (no on-page choice that narrows options) and weak closure participation (the realization is told, not acted).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The moon rock fragment appears in beat one (in briefcase), is described as "keepsake from distant astronaut father," returns in beat two (photographs and certificates prepared), and is revealed in the final third as spray-painted pumice. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (the fake rock's transformation charges the thematic turn) +1.0, specificity (its fake nature matters) +0.5. Deductions: the rock is never handled on the page with tactile detail, and its transformation is told rather than shown in a dramatized moment (−0.8). The father connection does not constrain a choice (−0.3). Rounds to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Reciprocity is mentioned in beats one and three ("bound by reciprocity since childhood," "believing every good deed must eventually circle back," "the paradoxical reciprocity that defined his existence") but functions as thematic echo rather than shaping stakes or tactics. It does not constrain an on-page action or force a trade-off. Setup present +0.4, but ornamental use (−0.9) and swappability (the story works if the concept is removed; −0.7) cap the score. Label-only trait (−0.3). Functional presence but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is labeled in beat one ("practiced his desperately jocular demeanor," "forced mirth," "Archie's desperately jocular exterior," "His desperately jocular voice now carried genuine hope") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. We are told the performance is essential, yet no scene shows it failing or succeeding under pressure. Setup present +0.4, but label-only (−0.8), no causal pressure (−0.6), and swappable (the story functions if the trait is removed; −0.5). Template phrasing on this element's beats (−0.3). Rounds to 3.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is introduced in beat two ("attempt to catalyze something new") and the rumor does ignite community interest by the end, but the action is summarized rather than dramatized. Early signal +0.5, one beat (the ending result) +0.4, closure linkage (the catalyzed community is the payoff) +0.9. Deductions: the mechanics are summary-only (−0.7), and the action could be swapped for "inspire," "spark," or "create" with minimal edits (−0.7). Late appearance in setup (second paragraph) (−0.2). Rounds to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Improbable rumor chains are signaled in beat two ("Through improbable rumor chains involving taxi drivers, gossiping baristas, code-talking librarians…") and the montage in beats three through five traces the rumor's spread. Early signal +0.5, two beats (planning and spread) +0.9, closure linkage (the rumor creates the community) +1.0. Deductions: the mechanics are list-like summary rather than dramatized (−0.8), and the method is swappable with "social media" or "word of mouth" without structural change (−0.7). No causal pressure on tactics (−0.6). Rounds to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The disused railway station overgrown with ivy is anchored in beat one and returns in beat four ("his railway station sanctuary"). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, specificity (ivy-choked windows, cracked mirror) +0.5. It functions as "neutral ground" and "heart of an operation," but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome (−0.9). The setting is atmospheric postcard description rather than tactical pressure (−0.6). Micro-setting allowance: the moon rock (handled object) partially compensates. Rounds to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"When the story changes" appears in beat two ("When the story changed, as all stories eventually must") and beat five ("As when all stories change, the ending wasn't what he had expected"). Setup present +0.4, two beats (thematic reprise) +0.9. Deductions: the timeframe is metaphorical rather than a live clock that tightens decisions (−1.2); it does not alter tactics or pressure choices (−0.8). Swappable with "when the plan succeeds" or "eventually" (−0.6). Label-only use (−0.3). Rounds to 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Finding the cure for loneliness is stated in beat two ("His secret motivation— finding the cure for loneliness— had finally coalesced into a plan") and returns in beats four and five. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (the realization about connection is the thematic payoff) +1.0. Deductions: the motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants under pressure (−0.9); no on-page friction between desire and cost (−0.8). Summary-only involvement (−0.6). Rounds to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" is introduced in beat two ("The polite anarchy of his operation") and returns in beat four ("polite anarchy in action as people gathered"). Setup present +0.5, two beats +0.9. Deductions: tone is declared rather than enacted through modulation under pressure (−0.9); the narration does not embody anarchic rhythm or polite restraint in sentence structure or diction (−0.8). Swappable with "unconventional coordination" or "grassroots chaos" (−0.6). Label-only (−0.3). Rounds to 4.1.</comment>
