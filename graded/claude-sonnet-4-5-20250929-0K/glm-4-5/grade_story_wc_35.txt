<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's gift is established but his interior life reads generic: "blessing and curse," "hollow and trembling" are stock phrases without embodied contradiction. The motivation to "sandpaper rough memories" is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. His final emergence with "hands trembling but heart lighter" reads as label-only emotion without causal cost on the page—we never see what he forfeited or how the work altered him beyond summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where anchor by the second paragraph, but "at the close of an unspoken dream" remains opaque past 120 words without payoff at closure (−0.4). The closure unit—Kael emerging "lighter"—lacks visible cost: no tactical forfeit, no foreclosed path, only asserted relief. Under a Causal lens the journey and work do not narrow options or change knowledge in a legible way; under Accumulative the final image does not reweight prior material with felt pressure. The pavilion visit reads as a complete success without dramatized sacrifice, violating the cost-proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coral icebound pavilion and tidal pool formations provide vivid, specific anchors. Sensory selection is purposeful: damp sand, icy sheen, mirror-pool surface. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Kael finds what he seeks without obstacle, and the pavilion's "brittle walls" threaten collapse but never do, leaving the detail ornamental rather than pressuring the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—smoothing stored remorse—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Kael journeys, finds the pavilion, and completes his task without friction; no credible loss or complication forces a trade-off. The pavilion's threat to collapse and the tide of regret are declared but not realized on the page, resulting in escalation that remains abstract. The final "lighter heart" is told outcome without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of transforming remorse through craft is coherent and emerges from the premise. However, the final image—"hands trembling but heart lighter"—asserts resolution without a non-literal answer or resonant reweighting of prior material. The phrase "unspoken dream" recurs but its meaning remains vague, and the ending summarizes relief rather than charging the question with particulars. No insight arises from concrete struggle; the piece tells its thesis rather than embodying it in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and the prose carries a consistent fairy-tale register. However, diction often drifts into generic fantasy phrasing: "blessing and curse," "hollow and trembling," "heart lighter than it had been in years." Perceptual signature is weak—Kael's chef expertise and his gift's mechanics are told but do not color his way of noticing under pressure. No dialogue to judge; internal voice remains serviceable but not distinctive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the middle: paragraphs 6–7 restate Kael's gift and risk of submersion with synonym churn ("stored remorse," "emotionally contagious," "become subsumed") without added pressure (−0.6). Template cadence in paragraphs 19–23: repeated "Kael [verb]" openers and "the stored remorse [verb]" constructions (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("blessing and curse," "hollow and trembling") appear in peak beats (−0.4). Closure beat ("hands trembling but heart lighter") uses label-only emotion. Combined artifacts total −1.5; loops and cadence touch multiple paragraphs, justifying the cumulative deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of chef-as-memory-worker with desert pavilion and tidal-pool divination offers a fresh premise. However, execution leans on fantasy templates: the legendary hidden place, the transformative descent, the triumphant return. The emotional arc—burden to relief—follows a predictable path without a non-obvious moral calculus or turn. Specificity in tidal-pool analysis and coral pavilion elevates slightly, but the piece does not transform its tropes through grounded choice or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's chef role and memory-tasting gift are introduced early (setup gate met) and frame his journey (development gate met). He uses the gift to locate and work with memories at the pavilion (payoff gate met). However, the gift does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off—he succeeds without complication. His chef tools are mentioned but not used on the page. The element is functional but its unique properties do not create causal pressure or visible cost. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, swappability −0.6, no cost −0.4, summary-only use of gift mechanics −0.4. Starting anchor 3.0 + 0.0 net = 3.0, but all three gates met raises floor to ~4.0; final ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coral icebound pavilion is established as a goal in paragraph 3 (setup), discovered mid-story (development), and houses the climactic work (payoff). It appears across multiple beats: tidal pools predict it, Kael uncovers it, he descends and works within. Its unique coral-ice nature is specific and irreplaceable. However, it does not constrain a choice—Kael finds and uses it without obstacle—and its "brittle walls" threaten but never collapse, leaving the closure linkage passive. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure participation (location) +0.7, specificity +0.5, no causal pressure −0.8, ornamental threat −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.0 net = 5.0, but strong multi-beat presence and closure setting lift to ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Stored remorse is named early (setup), motivates the journey and pavilion's function (development), and is the substance Kael transforms at the end (payoff). It appears in six paragraphs and shapes the dominant stake. However, the concept is mostly told—"stored remorse," "emotionally contagious," "bitter taste"—without dramatizing how it narrows options or alters tactics on the page. Kael submerges and emerges without visible friction. Early signal +0.5, three+ beats +1.4, closure substance +1.0, swappable with "trauma" or "grief" −0.5, summary-only use −0.5, no visible cost −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.5 net = 4.5; concept centrality lifts to ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Emotionally contagious touch is introduced in paragraph 5 (setup), mentioned when Kael presses palms to earth and dips fingers in water (development and payoff). The trait is named in three beats but never visibly constrains a choice or imposes cost—Kael succeeds despite the contagion risk. The pavilion's remorse is "emotionally contagious even across the chamber," yet Kael's method overcomes it with no dramatized struggle or trade-off. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, swappable (generic empathy) −0.6, label-only in peak use −0.5, no cost −0.4. Base 3.0 – 0.2 net = 2.8; all gates met raises floor to ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Subsume appears in paragraphs 6, 15, and 22: Kael has "become subsumed" before, refuses it mid-journey, then allows partial submersion to work. It recurs with slight reweighting (risk → control) but does not drive a major turn—Kael's mastery is asserted, not tested. The action could swap for "absorb" or "merge" with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, partial closure link +0.5, swappability −0.6, summary-only (past tense in para 6, successful management in 22) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.8 net = 3.8; recurrence across journey and ending lifts to ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations is introduced in paragraph 7 (setup), shown in paragraph 8 where pools tell Kael the pavilion has risen (development), and the method frames his approach in paragraph 15 (payoff: "analyzing the patterns as he would the tidal pool formations"). The mechanics are told but not dramatized—we do not see him read the pools on the page, only the result. The method enables the journey but does not constrain a later choice. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal enabler +0.8, summary-only execution −0.6, swappable (divination) −0.5, no cost −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.9 net = 3.9; all gates met lifts floor to ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Desert fortress after rain is established in the opening (setup) and the rain creates the tidal pools that guide Kael (development). The fortress inhabitants and Kael's role as chef anchor the start. However, the fortress does not return at closure—Kael emerges in paragraph 26 with no spatial anchor—and the desert journey is generic (shifting sands, damp surface). Rain matters for pools but the fortress itself is postcard setting. Early signal +0.7, one beat (pools) +0.4, no closure participation −0.7, generic journey −0.5. Base 3.0 – 0.1 net = 2.9; two gates (setup, development via pools) raise floor to ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase "at the close of an unspoken dream" appears in paragraphs 3 and 24, framing the story. It is poetic but vague—what dream, how does its "close" shape urgency or tactics? The phrase recurs without reweighting meaning or clarifying the stakes. Time inside the pavilion is explicitly vague ("hours passed, or perhaps only moments"), undercutting any pressure. Setup present (para 3), no clear development (time does not alter a mid-journey choice), lyric reprise at closure (para 24). Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise +0.5, vague mechanics −0.7, no tightening −0.6, ornamental use −0.4. Base 3.0 – 0.8 net = 2.2; two-gate minimum (setup + payoff reprise) lifts floor slightly to ~2.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to sandpaper rough memories is stated in paragraph 10 (setup), enacted in his method paragraphs 20–23 (development and payoff), and the result—"heart lighter"—closes the story. The desire is told ("simple yet profound") but the work is shown across multiple beats. However, no friction between want and cost is dramatized—Kael succeeds as planned. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure result +1.0, told desire −0.5, no visible trade-off −0.5, summary success −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.6 net = 4.6; strong closure linkage and multi-beat presence lift to ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sturdy brittle appears seven times: walls (paras 1, 4, 17, 24), emotions (para 4), surface (para 11), nature (para 17). The pairing recurs with consistent meaning (strength + fragility) and charges the pavilion's atmosphere. However, tone does not modulate under pressure—brittle walls threaten collapse throughout but never do—and the final image ("hands trembling but heart lighter") shifts to relief without tonal cost. Early signal +0.7, four+ beats +1.4, closure presence (para 24 walls) +0.7, specificity +0.4, static mood (no modulation) −0.8, ornamental threat −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.9 net = 4.9; strong recurrence and closure participation lift to ~5.9.</comment>
