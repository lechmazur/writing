<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Eleanor remains label-only across the entire text—her "expectantly resigned manner" is asserted but never embodied in a contradictory micro-choice. The choir members are summarized in abstract groups ("different backgrounds, languages, and beliefs") rather than individuated with distinct voices or competing impulses. The final "transformation" into "hopeful determination" is told, not earned through on-page struggle with visible cost. No moment shows Eleanor choosing between incompatible goods or enduring a foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece is a multi-year summary, not a scene or two-shard window—it violates Track B/C structure without teaching a legible pattern or maintaining one contiguous pressure window. Closure is purely summarized ("legacy," "transformation," "reborn") with no decisive on-page change, no felt cost, and no before/after tension. Causality is outline-level: "through months of practice" and "by spring" compress all pressure into exposition, leaving no tightening moment visible. The Drive Lens remains uninferable because no single stake is tested on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The velvet library recurs as a frame and "planning space," but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters Eleanor's tactics. The zither rosette is handled on-page ("fingering the aged rosette") and appears in the final beat as a gift, earning modest micro-setting credit. Autumn and winter are mentioned but do not affect action. Spatial choreography is absent—no bodies move through defined space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts—is declared early but never tested with a visible cost. No on-page reversal narrows Eleanor's options; the choir's progress is summarized in transit phrases ("through months," "by spring"). The final baton-passing is coincidental convenience, not a choice forced by prior pressure. Agency is absent: Eleanor teaches and the world changes around her with no trade-off or foreclosed path visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme—harmony through subtraction—is overtly stated multiple times ("by subtracting noise," "harmony doesn't eliminate diversity; it elevates it") rather than emerging from image and action. The final paragraph moralizes with a thesis summary ("vanishing arts need not disappear completely"), applying a −0.6 penalty. The zither rosette recurs with slight reweighting (continuity, hope), earning modest thematic credit. No earned insight arises from a specific on-page struggle; all wisdom is pre-packaged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Distance is stable third-person limited, but Eleanor's interior voice lacks perceptual signature—her thoughts read as generic wisdom ("Music has the power to denote what words cannot express"). Dialogue is functional but generic, without subtext or character-specific idiom ("Each rehearsal begins the same way"). The narration uses elevated abstractions ("traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned") that feel imposed rather than voice-motivated. No POV leakage, but no distinct texture either.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy scaffold and paraphrase loops pervade the text: "through months of practice" and "across unlearning hatred" recur as transit clichés; "expectantly resigned" appears three times without variation. Template cadence runs dominate ("Eleanor believed... Eleanor taught... Eleanor explained"). Figurative language ("traveled stillness," "braiding voices") is stock and muddy, triggering overwriting penalties. The final third is purely expository summary, flattening all momentum. Combined artifacts and loops justify −1.4 in Q7, with an additional −0.3 for final-third scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—teacher unites divided choir through music—is a recognizable template without fresh inflection. "Subtracting noise" is asserted as method but never demonstrated with specific, non-obvious tactics. The zither rosette is a token heritage object without surprising use. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; all emotional beats (suspicion → unity, resignation → hope) follow predictable arcs. The "traveled stillness" phrase aims for originality but remains abstract.</comment>
