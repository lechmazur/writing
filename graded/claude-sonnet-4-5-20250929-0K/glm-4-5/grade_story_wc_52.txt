<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Clara's interiority is concrete and anchored in embodied detail—the weight of wood, the tactile memory of her husband's teaching. Her contradiction between "hauntingly practical" and grief-haunted operates throughout, and the carving choice embodies a genuine micro-decision that forecloses momentum toward forgetting. However, the final resolution feels predetermined rather than earned by escalating pressure; her stance never truly shifts because she began in rust-hued peace and remains there. The lack of a visible internal struggle or foreclosed alternative path limits the felt cost of her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (skylight loft, rain, carving blank, widow). The accumulative/textural lens holds: layered images of rain, carving, and memory build toward the final constellation moment that reweights "here and gone" with conceptual cost. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the menagerie on the mantel and the new carving crystallize her method of holding loss differently. However, the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized; we're told she has transformed grief but see no on-page moment where something is genuinely forfeited or a live option rejected. The kettle framing hints at time pressure but never tightens tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, ash wood grain, and loft-to-kitchen ladder create vivid micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy is clear: rain patterns shift from "fractured light" to "constellations," anchoring Clara's perceptual arc. The wood grain constrains her first cut ("tentative, then growing confident as she found the grain's direction"), charging the ending when the carving joins "its brothers" on the mantel. The kettle's whistle marks time but doesn't alter spatial choices. Strong work; the recurring skylight and wood texture both pressure and charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Clara's method of holding her husband's memory—clear and signaled early. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: her shift from "tentative" first cut to placing the finished form among a menagerie, crystallizing her ongoing practice. However, escalation lacks a visible price or foreclosed option; nothing in the scene tests whether this method costs her something live. The kettle's five-minute frame is declared but never tightens her choices. Under the accumulative lens, pressure should reweight options or reveal cost; here the ending arrives as continuation rather than crystallization of sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Here and gone" emerges organically through carving, rain patterns, and the mantel menagerie—no thesis statement. The final image of "love…both here and gone simultaneously" reweights prior material through the closed-eyed lion (serene, not snarling) and the constellation Clara traces. Subtext operates in "hauntingly practical," the paradox of "nothing moved…yet nothing remained the same," and the untranslated "指纹" that subtly marks her husband's absence. The piece resists moralizing and the rust-hued peace feels earned by accumulated particulars. Minor slip: "In the brief time while the kettle boiled, she had captured eternity" edges toward overt articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: Clara notices through tactile and visual filters ("rain-beaded," "curl of ash wood"), and diction stays consistent ("hauntingly practical," "rust-hued peace"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("running her fingers") to reflective remove ("Clara had learned"). Free indirect style is clean. One slip: "指纹" (fingerprints in Chinese) appears untranslated and unexplained, breaking POV unless Clara code-switches internally—possible but not anchored. Otherwise, rhythm and lexicon remain character-specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear with varied rhythm and strong sensory anchors. However, overwriting clusters in key beats: "rain-beaded skylight" recurs three times, "hauntingly practical" and "rust-hued peace" function as label shortcuts rather than dramatized states, and "crystallized time" appears twice without clarifying its mechanism. Template cadence in paragraph five: "The loft itself was…yet nothing remained…a paradox she inhabited" stacks abstract claims. The kettle framing is invoked but never propels a sentence-level choice. Figurative density ("fractured light," "tiny prism," "crystallized pocket," "constellations") competes for attention in high-pressure beats. Deduction: −0.6 for density and label reliance, −0.4 for template phrasing = baseline ~7.9, adjusted to 6.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The widow-carver premise is familiar, but the ash wood menagerie and the kettle-as-timeframe offer specific anchors. "Hauntingly practical" as paradox and the shift from snarling to serene lion show transformation of trope. However, the emotional arc—grief held in creation—follows a well-worn path without a non-obvious turn. The untranslated "指纹" hints at risk but feels unearned. The piece commits fully to its rust-hued tone, but the closure reconfirms rather than reweights expectation. Mid-band: thoughtful execution of familiar material without bold synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Clara is present throughout and makes the carving choice that structures the story. Setup: immediate (paragraph one). Development: her first cut and growing confidence (paragraph four) constrain her method. Payoff: placing the carving on the mantel charges the ending. However, her widow status is mostly contextual; the lion-tamer detail colors atmosphere but doesn't generate a distinct on-page choice or cost tied to that specific loss. She could be any artist-widow. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.6 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ash wood blank is handled in multiple beats: paragraph one (in her lap, smooth), paragraph four (first cut, grain direction), paragraph five (curls falling), paragraph six (rough lion form placed on mantel). Setup immediate, development (grain constrains cut), payoff (menagerie). The wood's grain enables her confident carving and the half-finished form charges the closure image. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (ash, grain) +0.5 = baseline ~7.7, adjusted for mid-level irreplaceability to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is seeded in paragraph two ("been here and gone for twelve months"), recurs as whispered phrase in paragraph six, and anchors the final image ("both here and gone simultaneously"). Setup present, no middle beat where it alters a tactic, payoff present. It functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page choices. Score: setup +0.4, closure appearance +0.7, thematic echo without causal work −0.8, late full articulation −0.2 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" is attributed in paragraph two (husband's past description) and referenced in the final paragraph via "rust-hued peace" and "holding differently." It labels Clara's approach but never constrains a visible choice with cost. Setup present, no middle development, payoff is thematic reprise only. Score: setup +0.3, label-only −0.7, ornamental reprise +0.4, swappability −0.6 = ~3.2, capped at 3.4 for missing middle development, final 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Contain" appears explicitly in paragraph one ("to contain within this brief window what mattered most") and implicitly in paragraph seven ("containing memory…in creation"). It frames the story's method but doesn't drive a turn; Clara's carving embodies containment, yet the action of containing is more thematic wrapper than escalation catalyst. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, swappability (could be "preserve" or "hold") −0.6 = ~5.7, rounded to 6.4 for lyric reprise that reweights the kettle frame.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" appears in paragraph three ("Through crystallized time, she preserved moments") and paragraph six ("time in this crystallized pocket had moved differently"). It's asserted as method but never demonstrated mechanically on the page—no moment shows how crystallization works or alters her carving tactic. Setup present (paragraph three), no middle beat, payoff is summary only. Score: setup +0.4, summary-only −0.8, ornamental use −0.6 = ~2.8, capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The skylight loft is anchored immediately and recurs: paragraph one (rain-beaded, fractured light), paragraph four (under the skylight), paragraph eight (rain shifted patterns, constellations). The shifting rain patterns charge the final image where Clara traces shapes. Setup immediate +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (constellation moment) +1.1, micro-setting (rain on glass pressures her perception) +0.6, specificity +0.4 = baseline ~7.4, adjusted for modest causal pressure to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The kettle is introduced in paragraph one ("five minutes perhaps"), whistles in paragraphs two and four, and is silent but still hot in paragraph seven. It frames duration but never tightens a choice—Clara doesn't race the clock or adjust tactics as time runs out. Setup immediate +0.5, three beats +1.4, swappability (any timer) −0.6, no causal pressure on tactics −0.7 = ~4.6, adjusted to 4.3 for time remaining vague and untested.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Harvest lessons from loss" is stated in paragraph three and enacted through carving across paragraphs four–six, culminating in paragraph seven's "holding differently." Setup clear, development (carving as harvest) present, payoff present. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflict—no on-page moment shows Clara wrestling with an alternative desire or paying a visible cost to continue harvesting. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, told-more-than-shown friction −0.8 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" is named in paragraph five and recurs in paragraph eight ("not with joy exactly, but with rust-hued peace"). The tone is coherent throughout—neither devastated nor pretending—and modulates subtly as Clara moves from tentative first cut to serene final tracing. Setup mid-story (paragraph five, ~60% mark) −0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (charges final smile) +1.0, tone consistency under pressure +0.7 = baseline ~6.6, adjusted for late first naming to 6.1.</comment>
