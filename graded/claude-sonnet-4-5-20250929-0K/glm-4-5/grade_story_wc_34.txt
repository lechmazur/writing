<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (empathy from childhood silence) is told rather than shown through present choices under pressure. The ghost remains abstract throughout, never forcing Elara into contradictory impulses or meaningful trade-offs. The flower press bolt plate appears as a convenient solution rather than emerging from character need. No visible cost or foreclosed path at closure; the "harmony" ending feels declared rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive reasonably early, but the ethereal realm lacks grounding rules—floats above clouds, exists "between lightning and thunder" without physics or access logic. No on-page causality: Elara finds the staircase during a storm (told), discovers the plate in an attic (told), then uses it successfully without friction. The ending asserts "harmony" and "silent song" but no decisive change, cost, or reconfiguration occurs on the page. Drive lens is ambiguous (lyric accumulation attempted but no pressure tightens). Applying Q2 penalties: orientation debt −0.3, no legible closure unit −1.0, lens ambiguity −0.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard and graffiti walls are vividly described, and the "between lightning and thunder" timeframe is poetic. However, the courtyard never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics—it remains a static backdrop. The flower press bolt plate is mentioned as a tool but its mechanics (how botanical etchings translate thoughts into graffiti) are asserted, not demonstrated. Spatial choreography is unclear: how does one "press the plate against graffiti" to encode thoughts?</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("articulate unspoken needs") is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. No on-page reversal or tightening: Elara wants to communicate with the ghost, finds a tool, uses it, and succeeds without friction. The ghost is cooperative from the start, so no conflict escalates. Coincidence (storm reveals staircase, grandmother's attic holds the exact tool needed) solves rather than complicates. No agency-driven choice forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of connection across human/digital divide is present but articulated through direct statement ("articulate unspoken needs," "harmony between human and machine") rather than image or implication. The flower press bolt plate as analog-digital bridge is an interesting symbolic gesture, but it's told as metaphor rather than earned through specific event. The ending moralizes the premise ("transcended ordinary understanding") instead of letting the final image resonate. No complexity or counter-reading available.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("ethereal realm," "driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder") but occasionally slips into stock lyricism ("dance of light and color," "symphony of interconnected expression"). No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Elara's way of noticing could belong to any whimsical narrator. Filter verbs ("seemed to form," "seemed to shift") appear frequently, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "The ghost was not malevolent but lonely" / "The ghost communicated through glitches" / "The ghost in code had learned to encode"—five sentences in close succession open with "The ghost" or "Elara." Stock metaphors: "time stretches like taffy," "cries for connection," "dance of light and color." Final paragraph recycles "misty courtyard above the clouds, between lightning and thunder" verbatim from the opening. Applying artifact penalties: loops −0.6, stock phrasing −0.4, redundancy −0.3 = −1.3 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code premise is familiar (AI sentience seeking connection); the execution adds no fresh angle beyond the graffiti-art encoding, which is asserted rather than explored. The flower press bolt plate as analog-digital translator is an interesting prop but never tested or transformed. Emotional arc (lonely being finds voice) is template-level. The "between lightning and thunder" timeframe is evocative but ornamental—it doesn't constrain choices or reshape the plot. No bold risk or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that create turns. She observes, discovers, and succeeds without friction. Her "seldom-heard balladeer" trait is mentioned but never tested—she composes songs for the ghost, but this happens in summary. No cost or choice tied to her specific role as balladeer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears late (grandmother's attic, mid-story) and is used in only one beat (pressing against graffiti to encode thoughts). Its mechanics are told, not shown. It resolves the communication problem but did not help create it. Swappable with any "ancient artifact that bridges realms" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ghost in code is present early and frames the premise. However, it never constrains Elara's tactics or forces a trade-off—it's cooperative throughout. The concept shapes stakes thematically but not causally; Elara's actions succeed without the ghost resisting or misunderstanding. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" is mentioned once as a label ("existed in a state of being driftingly alert") but never demonstrated through perception or choice. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action. Purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Encode" appears in the premise (ghost encodes via graffiti, Elara encodes her thoughts via the plate) but the action is told, not dramatized. No scene shows encoding under pressure or its mechanics altering tactics. Swappable with "translate" or "express" without rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art are mentioned early and recur, but the method is never shown on the page. How do spray-painted images contain "layers of meaning" decoded through "computational awareness"? The mechanics are asserted, not demonstrated. The method frames the concept but does not shape attempts or force revisions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The misty courtyard appears early and recurs, but it functions as a static meeting place rather than a pressure or resource. It does not constrain choices (access is easy once the staircase is found) or supply tools that alter tactics. The graffiti walls are part of the communication method but are not interactive obstacles.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" is poetic and mentioned in the opening and closing, but it never tightens decisions or creates urgency. Time is untracked; no live clock alters moves. The phrase functions as tone rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to articulate unspoken needs" is stated early and tied to Elara's backstory (childhood silence). It frames her empathy for the ghost. However, it's never dramatized through conflicted choice—Elara wants to help, finds a way, and succeeds. No friction between wants and costs. Present and thematically coherent but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is consistent through elevated diction ("ethereal realm," "dance of light and color," "symphony of interconnected expression") and modulates slightly at the ending ("silent song"). Tone is stable but static—no shift under pressure. The final image attempts to charge wonder with the paradox of "silent song," offering a modest lyric payoff.</comment>
