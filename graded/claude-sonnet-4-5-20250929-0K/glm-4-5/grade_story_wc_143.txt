<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clearly stated but never genuinely tested or complicated on the page. Her "purposefully curious nature" and determination are told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The character remains static through the arc—no internal contradiction or meaningful cost shapes her action beyond completing a checklist task. The final moment offers no renunciation, transformation, or visible foreclosure of options; she simply finishes and leaves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear early (moonlit summit, crater inspector, lunar surface), satisfying the basic test. The inferred lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elena waits, the fireflies appear, she photographs them, they vanish. However, the closure lacks felt cost—she completes her mission exactly as planned with no complication, reversal, or deepening that reweights prior material. The "dawnlit melancholy" and sense of purpose are asserted in summary rather than earned through on-page pressure. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs; the ending simply reports satisfaction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moonlit summit and lunar surface are anchored early with sensory specifics (rocky ground, bulky space suit, crater valley). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The setting provides vantage and isolation but does not constrain a key choice or materially alter tactics—Elena's plan unfolds without friction from the environment. The final image references the "now-sunlit summit" but the shift is descriptive rather than causally charged, keeping the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—photographing the last lunar fireflies before extinction—is signaled early but never escalates or tightens. Elena faces no opposition, complication, or cost; the fireflies appear on schedule, she photographs them, and the mission succeeds exactly as intended. The timing device and chemical reaction add procedural texture but impose no pressure or trade-off. No reversal, deepening, or agency-driven choice narrows options or charges the outcome. The story is a completion rather than a conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of loss and preservation in the space age emerges clearly from the premise but remains abstract and asserted rather than tested through dramatic irony or character friction. "Dawnlit melancholy" is labeled repeatedly without embodied contradiction or subtext. The final paragraph offers direct thematic statements—"the beauty would live on," "triumphs and losses," "guardian of memories"—that replace scene pressure with moralizing summary. No resonant image or non-literal answer reweights prior material; the ending explains rather than charges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and distance is controlled throughout. The narrative voice carries a consistent register—earnest, mildly formal, exposition-heavy—but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythm modulation under pressure. Repeated syntactic stems ("The dawning hush," "Elena [verb]ed," "The [noun] was/were") create template cadence. Filter verbs ("began to," "started to") and expository summary flatten immediacy in key moments. The voice reads competent but generic, lacking the idiom or selective bias that would anchor it to Elena's particular mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean but heavy with scaffold and paraphrase loops. Repeated phrases recur without tightening: "dawning hush" (three times), "moonlit summit" (four times), "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" (five times in near-identical constructions), "purposefully curious" (twice). Adjacent sentences often restate the same content: "She was determined to document their beauty before they vanished forever, a testament to what was being sacrificed" immediately echoes the prior mission statement. Template cadence appears in runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "Elena [verb]ed" openings. Information density is low—many sentences perform a single expository job without layering action, perception, or subtext. Figurative language is absent; concision and propulsion are compromised by redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The premise—documenting the last of an endangered lunar species before mining destroys their habitat—draws on familiar conservation and elegy templates without transforming them through lived detail, moral calculus, or a non-obvious angle. The protagonist's arc is a straight line with no complication or surprise; the fireflies appear, she photographs them, mission complete. The "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" and "chemical reactions for timed messages" are presented as curious devices but their specificity is ornamental—they could be replaced by any timer without altering the story. No fresh inflection or earned synthesis emerges; the execution reads as a response to prompt elements rather than a singular artistic vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The crater inspector role frames who Elena is and places her on the summit, but her occupational expertise does not constrain or enable a key choice. She observes and waits; inspection work is mentioned but not dramatized in a way that alters tactics or outcomes. The role is functional setup but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The sand grain appears in three beats: retrieval from pocket, placement in solution, and dissolution. However, its use is procedural rather than causal—it triggers the timer as planned with no complication, cost, or reweighted meaning at closure. The mechanics are explained but do not shape a turn or charge the final image. Present and functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" is repeated as atmospheric description and thematic label but does not constrain options or alter tactics on the page. It functions as tone rather than stake-shaping concept. Mentioned frequently but ornamental; swappable with "approaching dawn" or similar phrasing without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is stated twice as a character label but never enacted in a micro-choice with visible cost or trade-off. Elena's actions (photographing, adjusting camera, scanning) are procedural rather than driven by curiosity that complicates her mission. The trait is told, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Outlast" appears in two key beats: Elena must outlast the darkness for the fireflies and outlast her emotions for steady photography. The action shapes her stance and is tied to the mission's temporal pressure. However, the wait unfolds without complication—she simply succeeds—so the verb's constraint is present but not tested. Solid middle integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The chemical timing method is explained and used once when Elena places the grain in solution. It signals the optimal photography moment, shaping the sequence. However, the reaction proceeds exactly as intended with no friction, and the method could be replaced by any timer (watch, alarm) without altering the story's logic. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The moonlit summit provides vantage over the crater valley where the fireflies gather, making it essential to Elena's observation. The setting is anchored early and referenced throughout, including at closure ("sunlit summit"). However, the summit does not constrain a choice or impose tactical cost—Elena's plan unfolds without environmental friction. Present in setup, middle, and ending, earning mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The space age is mentioned as context ("the space age had brought humanity to the stars") and frames the mining threat, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create temporal pressure beyond the single lunar night. The era is backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes tactics. Functional setup but replaceable with other futuristic contexts.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The desire to photograph the last fireflies before extinction is stated early and drives Elena's presence on the summit. The motivation is clear and consistent, but it is never conflicted or tested—she wants to document, she does, mission accomplished. No friction between competing wants or visible cost complicates the execution. The motivation shapes setup and middle action but lacks the dramatic tension required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" is named three times and described through Elena's emotional state ("heart swelled," "weight settled over her like a shroud"). The tone is coherent but static—melancholy is asserted rather than modulated through turns in pressure. The final image shifts to "sense of purpose" and "smiled behind her visor," breaking the tonal consistency without earned transition. Present throughout but does not charge the closure image with undeniable pressure.</comment>
