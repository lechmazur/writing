<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elior's motivation crystallizes through reflection rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The night-long conception is summarized ("ideas flowed," "concepts that felt ancient yet revolutionary") without showing the contradictory impulses or genuine struggle that would earn the transformation. The final certainty ("heart filled with the certainty") reads as declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. Internal experience lacks the degradation under stress and embodied emotion required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by the opening paragraphs, satisfying the test. The closure unit—Elior posting notices and the community beginning to arrive—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: options crystallize, potential awakens), but the cost remains abstract and largely told ("difficult work of creating something meaningful together") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or tactical shift. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of reflection building to a manifesto and public invitation), yet the decisive tightening lacks an on-page action that forecloses a prior path with legible price. The ending reads more as preamble than earned closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paper-lantern Cove is anchored early with the amber bottle, workshop bay window, and restored lampposts. The sensory detail (paper lanterns glowing softly in dawn light, moon rising over the bay) creates atmosphere but remains largely visual and decorative. The amber bottle constrains Elior's contemplation and charges the final walk to the town square, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test and earning passage into the 6-band. Spatial choreography (workshop → town square) is clear, though the environment does not materially narrow options during the conception sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving the ghost town's spirit—is signaled early, but escalation occurs through summarized reflection ("spent the night sketching plans") rather than on-page choices that narrow options or force trade-offs. The "last wish" backstory introduces a reversal (infrastructure without spirit), yet the night of conception is recounted without visible struggle or cost. No on-page action tests Elior's commitment or alters his tactics; the arrival of others in response to notices happens off-page and deflates tension rather than intensifying it. Agency is decision (posting notices) but the price paid is abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme—transformation through shared purpose rather than passive consumption of magic—emerges from the premise and is explored through Elior's reflections on the amber bottle and the town's dormancy. However, the closing lines ("true transformations begin not from wishes or magic, but from the choice to reject false comfort") state the moral directly, violating the anti-pattern of final-paragraph moralizing and triggering a −0.5 deduction. The amber bottle shifts from literal puzzle to metaphor ("contained potential within everything") in a purposeful reweighting, but the epiphany is asserted rather than earned through concrete scene pressure. Thematic resonance is present but diluted by exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, anchored in Elior's perception. The narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register appropriate to an alchemist ("deserted alchemist," "beacon of rebirth in a fragmented world"). Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("alchemical principles of transformation, connection, and shared purpose") that flattens urgency. The prose texture is purposeful but suffers from repetitive sentence stems ("Elior [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]") across multiple paragraphs, creating mild template cadence without severe momentum loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high; sentences are grammatically clean and information flows logically. However, pervasive scaffold and synonym loops reduce density: "students and colleagues had filled these crumbling streets, but they had all deserted their craft" / "others had been waiting for precisely this invitation to reimagine their world" echoes the same conceptual ground without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in runs of "Elior [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. Figurative language is sparse but mixed: "beating heart of true community" is stock; "amber bottle with no opening" is concrete and purposeful. Paraphrase loops (e.g., paragraphs restating that wishes brought infrastructure but not spirit) and thematic summary in the final third trigger −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ghost-town-revival premise is familiar, and the alchemist-as-agent-of-renewal follows a recognizable template: solitary expert waits, reflects, then invites community. The amber bottle as "contained potential" metaphor is clear but conceptually tidy rather than surprising. The ending—community members arriving in response to posted notices—feels predictable and lacks the specific friction or non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate originality. The piece does not transform the template through lived occupational detail or a fresh angle on the emotional stakes. Proximity to writing-prompt templates without meaningful inversion or specificity triggers a −0.8 adjustment within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elior is present throughout and his choices (contemplating the bottle, conceiving the plan, posting notices) structure the narrative. However, the key turns arise from summarized reflection rather than on-page decisions under pressure; the night of conception is recounted, not dramatized. The final walk to the town square and posting of notices is a decision, but it arrives after the conceptual work is complete and carries no visible cost or tactical constraint. The character is functional but his agency does not create reversals that alter options in scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears in three beats: opening contemplation, the metaphor realization ("suddenly made sense to him"), and the final walk to the town square. Its properties (no opening, swirling shadows, no seam) are specified early and it returns with reweighted meaning (from literal puzzle to symbol of contained potential). However, the bottle is handled passively—Elior traces its surface and carries it—without tactical use or cost. The reprise at closure charges the image ("amber bottle with no opening remained sealed, but its mysteries had unlocked something far more valuable") but does not constrain the final action. Two gates (setup, closure participation) are met; development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the dominant stake, signaled in the title echo and framing the entire narrative. The concept shapes Elior's motivation and the contrast between infrastructure improvements (wishes) and cultural renewal (his vision). It directly informs the night of conception and the manifesto. However, the revival itself occurs off-page (people "began to arrive") and the on-page action—posting notices—is a preparatory step rather than a moment where the concept's mechanics narrow options. The concept structures the story but does not create a mid-scene turn with visible cost. All three gates are met (setup, development as motivation, payoff as outcome) but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is stated early ("Elior had resisted the lure of modern conveniences") and reprised at closure ("the choice to reject false comfort and embrace the difficult work"). The trait justifies his solitary perseverance and frames the thematic stance. However, the rejection is asserted rather than tested through an on-page choice with visible cost—no scene dramatizes Elior turning away a convenient solution or suffering a trade-off due to this stance. The attribute shapes motivation but does not constrain action in a moment of pressure. Setup and thematic payoff are present; middle development is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Conceive" drives the narrative arc: Elior spends the night conceiving a new vision, and by morning the "conception was complete." This action is the story's hinge, transforming his stance from contemplation to public invitation. However, the conception itself is summarized ("ideas flowed," "spent the night sketching plans") rather than dramatized beat by beat, and the mechanics of conception (working memory, alchemical texts) are invoked but not shown constraining or enabling tactics. The action is central and irreplaceable but executed through telling rather than scene pressure. Setup, development (the night), and payoff (manifesto complete, notices posted) are all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through working memory" appears once: "Through working memory, he recalled the ancient texts he had studied, the experiments he had conducted, and the conversations with long-departed colleagues." This method is invoked to explain how Elior synthesizes his knowledge but is not dramatized—no scene shows him struggling to recall, cross-referencing mental notes, or adapting when memory fails. It does not constrain or shape attempts in a visible way. The method is functional (it explains the source of his ideas) but swappable with "he remembered" or "he drew on his studies" without structural impact. Setup is present; development and payoff are absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Paper-lantern Cove is named and anchored with specific details: crumbling streets, bay window, restored lampposts, paper lanterns glowing at night and in dawn light. The setting provides atmosphere and a recurring visual motif. The cove's emptiness (ghost town) and recent improvements (infrastructure, clean water) supply context for the dominant stake. However, the setting does not materially constrain Elior's choices or provide resources that alter tactics—his night of work could occur in any workshop. The final walk to the town square uses the setting to charge the closure image but does not force a tactical adjustment. Setup, thematic presence, and closure linkage are met; middle pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"After the last wish had been granted six months ago" anchors the timeframe and establishes the premise (infrastructure is done, spirit is not). This timeframe creates a "before" that shapes the present situation. However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock or deadline pressures Elior's night of conception or his walk to post notices. The phrase "by morning, the conception was complete" marks passage but imposes no cost or urgency. Setup is clear; development and payoff do not use time as a lever. The element is contextual rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is Elior's stated motivation, crystallized explicitly: "His motivation crystallized: if he could demonstrate a new way of living...Paper-lantern Cove might become a beacon of rebirth." This desire drives the night of conception and the public invitation. However, the motivation is declared and explained rather than tested through friction—no scene shows Elior wrestling with doubt, temptation to settle for less, or a cost imposed by the ambition's scale. The motivation shapes the arc and is present at closure (the blueprint for renewed civilization) but lacks embodied conflict. Setup, thematic presence, and payoff are met; dramatized cost is absent.</comment>
