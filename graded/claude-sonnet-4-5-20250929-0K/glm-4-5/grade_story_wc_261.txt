<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's trait (telepathy with plants) and motivation (reading scars) are declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The "closure seeker who opens wounds" label is asserted in exposition but never dramatized—no on-page moment shows her actively choosing to expose rather than integrate until the final pivot, which arrives as epiphany rather than earned struggle. Interiority relies heavily on therapy-speak ("integration, not excavation") and diagnostic self-awareness that flattens urgency. The final change feels unearned because no prior beat forces her to confront the cost of her wound-opening habit with visible consequences.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: anesthesia fog and tower placement remain vague past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens is ambiguous—initially causal (hourglass mechanics, coffee-ring map), then shifts to lyric-accumulative (plant voices, integration theme) without teaching the pattern early or holding it cleanly at closure. The ending offers a Conceptual Repricing (scars as testaments, not puzzles), but cost is asserted rather than shown: no on-page forfeiture or visible alteration of Elara's options. The "displaced miracle" returns to earth, but what Elara sacrificed or lost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tower, hourglass, and coffee cup anchor early, but spatial choreography is vague—wall texture, arrow-slit positions, and tunnel entrance lack coherent geometry. The frosted hourglass constrains one beat (it glows when gripped), meeting the 9+ gate minimally, but sensory selection is generic: "sharp chill of stone," "meteor hush," "ancient memories" recycle placeholder atmosphere without POV-specific filter. The Q2 orientation penalty caps this category at 7.0, preventing higher placement despite the hourglass's functional role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to heal rather than open wounds—is declared but never tested with a live choice that narrows options. Elara's realization ("integration, not excavation") arrives as epiphany rather than escalation: no prior beat forces her to choose between exposure and honoring stories with visible cost. The plants' plea and coffee-ring map offer complications, but coincidence (the wall shimmers exactly where spirals intersect) resolves access to the tunnel without agency. One tightening (hourglass warming, sand flowing) occurs, but it follows rather than drives her stance shift, and the cost (what path she foreclosed) remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—closure via integration rather than excavation—emerges from repeated assertion ("like scars," "testaments to survival, not puzzles to solve") rather than image and action. The coffee rings, plants, and hourglass recur but function as symbolic markers rather than particulars that constrain choice or charge the final image with earned friction. The ending moralizes explicitly: "a closure seeker who had found her own peace," "a creator of new beginnings"—therapy-speak that replaces resonance with tidy resolution. No counter-reading is invited; the thematic answer is stated rather than implied through cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly, but diction drifts into elevated register ("meteor hush," "displaced miracle," "testaments to survival") that sits uneasily with the anesthesia-fog opening and tower-waking urgency. Perceptual signature is thin—Elara's noticing (coffee rings, stone scars) lacks character-specific bias or selectivity. Psychic distance remains stable, and no head-hopping occurs. The Q2 orientation penalty does not directly cap Q6, but line-level loops and therapy-speak in peak beats ("integration, not excavation") flatten voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The tunnel had taught her that healing wasn't about opening wounds but learning to live within their stories" restates prior lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs cluster in the second half: "The coffee rings had shown her the method, but her heart had finally shown her the meaning" / "The plants whispered not of pain now but of belonging, the displaced miracle returned to the earth from which all healing grows." Stock metaphors (dawn stretching fingers, meteor hush) and therapy-speak labels ("integration," "testaments to survival") appear in peak beats without embodiment. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, stock metaphor strings −0.4, total −1.5 in Q7, plus the final-third artifact presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—telepathic plant whisperer learns to read scars via time-travel hourglass and coffee-ring map—assembles disparate fantasy elements without transformation. The core emotional arc (learning to integrate rather than excavate wounds) follows a widely used therapeutic template without fresh angle: no specific lived detail, non-obvious moral calculus, or risky structural choice elevates the familiar journey. The coffee-ring method and frosted hourglass feel ornamental rather than inevitable. Applying the Derivative Premise Guardrail: −1.0 for close match to template plot without sufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "closure seeker who opens wounds" trait is declared in exposition but never drives an on-page turn. Elara's realization that she should integrate rather than excavate arrives as epiphany in the tunnel, not through a prior choice where opening a wound created visible cost. Setup gate met (trait mentioned early), development gate weak (no middle choice tests the habit), payoff gate missed (the trait is renounced in summary, not dramatized at closure). Late first thematic use (~60% in) and ornamental mention through most beats. Swappable with "truth seeker" or similar labels. Applying: setup +0.5, one beat involvement +0.4, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6, summary-only payoff −0.6, missing payoff gate (cap 2.8) → 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears early (setup gate met), is handled in two distinct beats (she grips it, it glows; she carries it into the tunnel, it warms), and returns at closure (sits empty, purpose fulfilled). Its warming signals the miracle's return, charging the final image with modest resonance. However, its mechanics remain vague—why frozen sand? why does it warm when she accepts integration?—and it could be replaced with another symbolic object (a frozen compass, a sealed lantern) without breaking story logic. Applying: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.5, ornamental first use −0.4 → 5.8, capped by three-gate eligibility at 6.9 maximum but reduced by replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "displaced miracle" is named early (setup gate met) and shapes the final action (Elara returns it to earth, payoff gate met), but it never constrains a middle choice or tactic (development gate missed). Its nature remains abstract—what is the miracle? why displaced? how does she "return" it?—and it functions as thematic label rather than on-page pressure. The hourglass "holds" it, the tunnel leads to it, but no beat shows Elara choosing to pursue or protect it at cost. Applying: setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, ornamental use −0.7, abstract/label-only −0.3, missing development gate (cap 3.4), late causal use (~75%) −0.4 → 4.1 capped at 4.6 by introduction timing, but net 4.1 by accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The plant telepathy is declared early (setup gate met) and used once in a middle beat (plants whisper "take us back," prompting Elara's understanding of the tunnel, development gate met weakly), but it does not appear in or shape the closure image (payoff gate missed). The trait enables information (plants as scar-like memory carriers) but imposes no visible cost or constraint—no moment where hearing plants forces a difficult choice or tradeoff. Applying: setup +0.6, one beat involvement +0.4, causal enablement +0.6, label-only trait mention −0.3, missing payoff gate (cap 2.8), summary delivery −0.4 → 2.8 baseline, adjusted to 3.6 by weak middle use lifting slightly above the cap threshold when the middle beat provides modest information pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tunnel appears at the midpoint (Elara presses the wall, a section shimmers, she enters), drives one major turn (descent teaches her integration lesson), and frames the closure (she emerges "forever changed"). All three gates met. However, the tunnel's mechanics are coincidental—the wall shimmers exactly where coffee rings intersect—and it could be replaced with a mirror, a hidden chamber, or a vision without breaking the arc. The tunnel itself does not impose cost; it simply houses the epiphany. Applying: setup +0.5 (midpoint signal), two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, moderate causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.6, coincidental access −0.8 → 6.2, eligible for higher band by three gates but capped by replaceability and convenience.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The coffee rings are mentioned early (setup gate met), examined once ("patterns emerged… lines, intersections, spirals"), and credited at closure ("The coffee rings had shown her the method"). However, the examining action is summarized in one line without dramatized process—Elara does not trace, test, or struggle with the rings' meaning on the page. The rings' pattern matches wall formations "exactly," but this match is declared, not discovered through error or cost. Applying: setup +0.6, one beat (weak) +0.4, closure mention +0.5, summary-only use −0.7, ornamental middle beat −0.5, swappability −0.4 (could be runes, symbols, etc.) → 4.3, capped by summary delivery and missing dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn anchors early (setup gate met) and provides the hourglass, coffee cup, plants, and wall—modest resource pressure. Dawn light through arrow-slits marks time's passage at closure (payoff gate met weakly). However, the tower itself does not constrain choice: Elara could wake in a cottage, a cave, or a library without altering her arc. Spatial choreography is vague (table, wall, arrow-slits lack coherent geometry), and "quiet" functions as mood label rather than tactical pressure. Applying: setup +0.7, minimal resource provision +0.4, weak closure reprise +0.4, swappability −0.7, postcard description −0.5 → 4.7, eligible for ~6.0 by two gates but reduced by replaceability and vague choreography.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The anesthesia-wearing-off timeframe is mentioned in the opening line (setup gate met) but never constrains a choice or tactic. No clock tightens Elara's decisions; her fog clears immediately, and the rest of the story unfolds without time pressure or tracking. The timeframe could be "after waking from a dream" or "at first light" with no structural change. Applying: setup +0.5, no development or payoff gates (cap 4.6 by missing setup alone is not triggered, but missing both mid and end caps at 2.8), ornamental mention −0.5, swappability −0.6 → 2.9, capped by missing development and payoff gates and zero causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to learn to read stories in scars—is declared early (setup gate met) and shapes her attraction to the hourglass and coffee rings (development gate weakly met). At closure, she renounces the desire to "read" scars and instead honors their stories (payoff gate met via inversion). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized: no beat shows her attempting to read a scar and failing, or choosing between reading and honoring with visible cost. The pivot to "integration" is asserted in summary, not earned through friction. Applying: setup +0.6, weak middle involvement +0.4, closure inversion +0.7, told-only friction −0.6, summary payoff −0.5 → 4.8, eligible for ~6.0 by three gates but reduced by lack of on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The "meteor hush" tone label appears once ("A meteor hush fell over the tower") and again at closure ("In this meteor hush of understanding"). The phrase is poetic but static—no modulation with pressure, no clear sensory or emotional anchor. The tone could be called "quiet reverence" or "contemplative stillness" with identical effect, and it does not charge the final image beyond mood assertion. Applying: setup +0.4 (appears early-mid), closure reprise +0.5, static mood −0.6, swappability −0.5, label-only use −0.3 → 3.7, eligible for lyric-resonance allowance (~5.5–6.3) but undercut by lack of pressure modulation and ornamental function.</comment>
