<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is present—grief, guilt, research—but key choices feel more narrated than earned through on-page contradiction. The brother's death is told in backstory rather than dramatized friction that alters present stance. The final choice (playing the accordion, crying) reads as ceremonial rather than a wrestle between competing impulses. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "gift and a curse," "raw solace washing over her."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late: Elena's profession and the brother's accident emerge past the opening third, creating initial fog. The closure unit—playing the accordion beside the underground river—lands as a symbolic tableau rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. The river discovery and graffiti clues function as coincidental plot conveniences rather than causally earned turns. Drive lens wobbles between Accumulative (graffiti as texture) and Causal (map references leading to the river), never fully committing, and the ending dissolves into lyric assertion without a legible before/after in Elena's options or knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The disused railway station is vividly rendered—ivy, dust motes, peeling paint—and the underground cavern finale provides a charged spatial payoff. However, much of the setting functions as backdrop; the bathroom graffiti and tunnel descent are more plot devices than constraints that shape Elena's choices. The accordion (patched bellows, yellow tape) does return at closure and gains symbolic weight, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is declared early but never tested by a competing pressure or sacrifice. Elena descends to the river without on-page obstacle or cost; the graffiti provides answers rather than complicating her path. No meaningful tightening or reversal: she seeks, finds, and accepts in a smooth arc. The final gesture (tears, music) reads as ceremonial release rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief, diversion vs. natural flow, charting vs. drowning—emerges through concrete images (accordion, river, medication, tape). The final metaphor "some currents cannot be charted until we are ready to drown in them" skirts the edge of thesis statement but is anchored by prior river imagery. The parallel between railway diversion and medication is elegant, though the ending leans toward tidy emotional resolution rather than unresolved complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("raw solace," "archaeological strata," "meandering course") that jars against a grieving protagonist's immediate perceptual stream. Elena's professional idiom (river chronicler) is asserted but not consistently embodied in her observational texture. Sentence stems repeat: "She…" opens nine lines in close succession mid-story, flattening rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is mostly intact, but paraphrase loops proliferate: paragraphs 14–15 restate the diversion metaphor; paragraphs 27–28 recycle "self-forgiveness" without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She had…," "The…") appear in clusters. Figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching: "raw solace," "tears in bellows and hearts," "drowning in currents" all arrive in the final third, blurring instead of sharpening the closure image. The phrase "市政府 papers" is a mistaken character insertion that breaks immersion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—grief-stricken researcher finds wisdom in bathroom graffiti leading to a hidden river—combines familiar elements (urban exploration, symbolic catharsis, underground water) without a sharp twist. The accordion and railway station are vivid particulars, but the emotional arc (denial → descent → acceptance) follows a well-worn template. The graffiti-as-map device reads more as convenient plot scaffolding than an organic extension of Elena's research expertise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena as "truth-seeking river chronicler" is named and her research frames the plot, but her professional expertise functions as backstory rather than a live skill tested on the page. She transcribes graffiti and consults schematics, but no river-chronicler decision drives a key turn. Setup present, no middle development choice, closure participation is passive (she arrives).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The accordion appears in the opening (patched bellows, yellow tape, brother's instrument), is carried through the station, and is played at closure beside the river, creating a clear early-to-final reprise. It belonged to her lost brother, tying directly to the grief stake. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as symbolic payload rather than causal lever. Setup strong, closure linkage present, but no middle development beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Map references" appear in the graffiti and schematics Elena studies, driving her descent to the tunnel. They shape one key turn (the discovery path) and are mentioned at setup and middle. However, they function as plot convenience—clues conveniently present—rather than a contested or risky interpretive act. Swappable with "coded messages" or "archived notes."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Daringly methodical" is asserted twice as a label but never demonstrated through on-page tradeoff. Elena's approach is cautious and linear; no moment shows daring (risk under pressure) balanced against method (systematic rigor). The trait exists as descriptor, not as constraint or enabler of a specific choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Allude" appears explicitly once in the penultimate section: "allowed herself to allude to the truth she had never before acknowledged." The action is named but not dramatized as a decisive gesture. It does not drive a turn; it restates the internal shift already narrated. Easily swappable with "accept" or "acknowledge." Late first appearance, summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Bathroom graffiti wisdom" is discovered mid-story and provides the map references Elena uses to find the river. It shapes the descent (middle beat) and is referenced at closure as having "led her." Setup in second third, clear middle involvement, closure callback. However, the graffiti is convenient rather than contested or decoded through professional skill, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "disused railway station overgrown with ivy" is introduced early, houses the graffiti, and provides the tunnel descent route. It frames all action and the ivy image bookends the piece. The underground cavern is the closure location. Setup strong, middle pressure (descent), closure linkage clear. However, the station does not constrain Elena's choices; it serves as atmospheric container rather than tactical puzzle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After stopping the medication" is stated in paragraph three and provides the inciting clarity that drives Elena's journey. It shapes the setup (returning clarity as both gift and curse) and is referenced at closure as enabling her to "flow with" pain. However, no mid-story beat dramatizes withdrawal symptoms, temptation to resume, or time pressure tied to medication absence. Setup present, thematic closure link, missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To find a path to self-forgiveness" is stated early and restated at closure. It drives Elena's descent and frames the final image of tears joining the river. However, the motivation is told more than tested: no on-page moment forces her to choose forgiveness over another want (vengeance, denial, escape). The friction between guilt and forgiveness is summarized in reflection rather than dramatized in competing pulls.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is named once explicitly and the tone attempts a blend of grief and tentative peace. The ending images (music, tears, river acceptance) support this hybrid affect. However, tone remains static—melancholy throughout—rather than modulating with pressure or deepening at the final turn. The label "raw solace" feels imposed rather than emergent from the scene's texture.</comment>
