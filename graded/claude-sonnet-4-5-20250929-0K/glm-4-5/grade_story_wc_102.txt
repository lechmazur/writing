<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to find where unused love is stored") but never tested by a concrete dilemma that forces a trade-off. Her "spiritually curious" trait appears as a label without constraining any choice. The healing epiphany arrives without on-page struggle or contradictory impulses; she simply breathes and receives answers. The final paragraph's diagnostic language ("breathing method," "healing") flattens interiority into therapy-speak at the moment that should carry embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story opens with orientation debt—who Elara is, where she stands, and what she seeks emerges slowly across the first 15% without spatial grounding. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of images and breath leading to reweighted meaning), but the closure effect is told rather than shown: "unused love...stored...in the space between breaths" is assertion, not dramatized reconfiguration. No visible cost appears on the page; the pearl dissolves, faces smile, and Elara feels peace without foreclosing a path or paying a price. The second half (weeks later) shifts to summary mode, recounting reputation and a client's healing rather than delivering a present-tense closure beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct and wisteria are vividly rendered in the opening, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara could perform the same revelation anywhere. The camera obscura projects an image, yet its mechanics (how breath alters the lens, what the rough-hewn wall contributes) remain vague. The "foggy lucidity" tag is asserted but not embodied through selective sensory detail that narrows perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is declared early but never encounters resistance or a choice that narrows options. Elara adjusts her breath, the pearl warms, faces appear, and the answer arrives without escalation or trade-off. The "weeks later" coda recounts her new role as healer but does not dramatize a tightening or cost; the young woman's breakthrough is summarized in a single line. No on-page moment forecloses a live option or charges the final image with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme—unused love as transformative force—is stated explicitly in the final paragraph ("not where unused love is stored, but how to release it") rather than earned through image and action. The pearl, breath, and past-life motifs recur but function as decorative tokens rather than particulars that constrain choice. The ending moralizes rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer; "a world that so desperately needs its healing" is earnest but generic.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but the voice lacks distinct texture—diction is elevated and even across calm and revelatory beats without modulation. The line "Elara no longer felt like a pilgrim of sparks but rather a keeper of light" exemplifies register drift into generic spiritual idiom. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's artist eye does not shape what she notices under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops mar key beats: "unused love began to transform into light" / "love never disappears, it simply changes form" / "where unused love is stored" / "how to release it back into a world that so desperately needs its healing" recycle the same concept across four paragraphs without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the coda: "When others asked...she would simply smile...Sometimes she would place...As they breathed deeply, their posture would soften, their eyes would clear, and stories would tumble forth." Stock metaphors—"purple waterfalls," "keeper of light," "pilgrim of sparks"—populate the closure beats, dulling specificity. The final third carries the highest artifact density, disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—past-life memory triggers spiritual healing through breath and camera obscura—assembles familiar New Age elements (Kwan Yin, reincarnation, energy work) without transformation. The camera obscura, a promising technical anchor, is used generically; its optical mechanics do not shape the revelation. The question "where does unused love go?" and its answer arrive via assertion rather than a non-obvious synthesis earned through character choice. The young woman's echo of Elara's question in the coda is on-the-nose rather than fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara adjusts the camera, inhales differently, and lowers it at the end—actions of observation and receipt, not decision. No choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. She appears in all three sections (setup, middle, coda) but as a vessel rather than an agent who drives turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The tear appears in her palm (setup), warms during the revelation (middle), and dissolves into her skin (closure beat), meeting all three gates. However, its function is symbolic comfort rather than causal constraint—it does not enable or block any choice. The crystallized version in the studio (coda) is placed on clients' chests but we do not see it alter an outcome. Present across beats but swappable with any talisman.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>The phrase "pilgrim of sparks" is used twice as a poetic label (opening and coda) but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Elara is described as seeking, not as navigating a trial that tests the pilgrim identity. The concept is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is mentioned once in exposition ("As a spiritually curious person, she felt drawn...") but does not constrain a choice or enable an action with cost. It is a character label without friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Heal" appears in the middle revelation ("the ability to heal wounds across lifetimes") and the coda recounts Elara's reputation as healer. However, no on-page healing act is dramatized at the closure beat; the young woman's breakthrough is summarized. The action is present but does not drive the key turn—breathing and receiving do.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Breathing is signaled early ("breathe differently as her method") and executed in the middle beat ("breath patterns shifted," "each exhale," "breath became slower"). It appears in the coda when Elara guides the young woman. However, the mechanics remain vague—how breath alters the camera obscura's projection is unexplained—and the method does not constrain a failed attempt before success. Present and functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The viaduct appears in all three sections: Elara stands there at twilight (setup), performs the revelation there (middle), and returns in the coda. However, it supplies atmosphere rather than constraint—the rough-hewn wall receives the projection, but any surface would suffice. The blooms "seemed to glow brighter" (middle) and "seemed to hold its breath" (closure) are metaphoric rather than tactical. Lyric reprise present but the setting does not alter choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored early: "Her past life memory had surfaced yesterday" establishes the inciting proximity. The present-tense revelation unfolds "tonight," then jumps to "weeks later." The memory's recency does not tighten tactics—Elara does not race a deadline or wrestle urgency. The time element frames the sequence but does not escalate pressure within the dominant scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The question "to find where unused love is stored" is declared in paragraph three and repeated in the coda when the young woman asks it. Elara's desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. She seeks, receives an answer via breath and vision, and the question resolves without friction. The motivation is present across all three sections but never tested by a dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named twice and the mist is mentioned in the opening. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure—the prose remains equally elevated and declarative in calm setup and peak revelation. The charge at closure comes from summary assertion ("finally at peace") rather than image or cadence that embodies simultaneous clarity and mystery. Present as label, not enacted.</comment>
