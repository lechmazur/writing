<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kai's proprioceptive enhancement and trauma responses are consistently rendered through embodied sensation—tremors, copper taste, mapped spatial awareness—rather than diagnostic labels. The protagonist makes micro-choices (bracing, examining the strap, positioning it) that reveal values under pressure. However, the final "understanding" that mercy is "a function of time over pain" arrives as abstract epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, weakening the earned-change requirement. Internal contradiction is present (displacement vs. rootedness) but the resolution feels conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Kai waking in an ultraviolet forest post-anesthesia) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory details and memory fragments build toward the pewter-strap revelation and the mathematical-mercy insight. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the final line reweights survival as "the first variable"—but the cost is asserted ("discovery" rather than redemption) rather than felt through a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options. The ending image is evocative yet the transition from physical examination to abstract equation feels more told than shown, limiting closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered with specific sensory markers (blue-violet hues, glowing bark, unusual light revealing hidden truths) and the setting actively constrains Kai's perception and choices—he uses the forest's light properties to decode the pewter strap. Micro-setting (the forest floor, the ancient tree he braces against) grounds action. The setting charges the final image by providing the necessary context for revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate test. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("systematic deconstruction of his humanity") that pulls away from concrete environmental detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the mathematics of mercy to make sense of survival—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens as Kai progresses from disorientation to memory mapping to physical decoding of the strap. However, escalation is gradual accumulation rather than a turn that narrows options; the climactic "understanding" is intellectual insight rather than a choice with visible cost. The "positioning the strap" moment promises agency but delivers epiphany, leaving the cost conceptual ("not redemption, but framework") rather than dramatized as a trade-off or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (mercy as a calculable function versus an abstract ideal) emerges organically from Kai's proprioceptive mapping and trauma-response navigation. The pewter strap's mathematical patterns and the forest's revelatory ultraviolet light interweave concept and image effectively. The final line—"survival was the first variable"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the penultimate beat's explicit articulation ("mercy was a function of time over pain") borders on thematic statement rather than image, and the phrase "mathematics of mercy" is repeated enough to feel thesis-driven. Strong thematic coherence with minor overstatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and the perceptual signature (proprioceptive precision, sensory dissonance as trigger) is character-specific and consistent. Diction is elevated but mostly voice-motivated ("ultraviolet penance," "compass pointing relentlessly toward pain"). The single line of dialogue—"Mercy isn't the absence of pain, but the presence of meaning despite it"—feels slightly expository, articulating theme rather than advancing scene pressure. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with memory waves. Minor penalty for one instance of diagnostic-adjacent phrasing ("altered awareness," "enhanced senses") that edges toward label-speak, though embodied context mitigates this.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear and propulsive with strong sensory specificity ("copper taste of fear," "shards of glass"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 9–10 restate "allowing the forest's atmosphere to seep" and "ultraviolet penance where everything hidden would be revealed"; paragraphs 16–17 repeat the forest-as-participant idea. Template cadence in the mid-section (repeated "His [noun] [verb]" stems) and a cluster of filter verbs in peak memory beats ("seemed to," "felt like") dull immediacy. The stock metaphor "drowning creature breaking water" and elevated register ("proprioceptively enhanced senses mapping") clash slightly with urgency. Deductions total approximately −1.0 for loops and templates, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of proprioceptive enhancement, trauma-response navigation, and ultraviolet forest as revelatory space is specific and non-generic. However, the core arc—survivor seeks meaning through symbolic object in liminal landscape—follows a familiar template: disoriented awakening, memory fragments, epiphany via artifact. The "mathematics of mercy" conceit offers conceptual freshness but remains abstract; the emotional journey (trauma → understanding) does not transform the template through unexpected choice or cost. The ultraviolet spectrum and pewter-strap mathematics are inventive details but function more as ornament than structural necessity. Transformation test: the plot would survive with different props and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kai's status as enhanced interrogation survivor is present throughout (tremors, mask strap, memory responses) and shapes his perceptual mode. Setup is immediate. Middle development: his trauma responses serve as "pathways to memory" and "compass." Closure: the final realization about survival as "the first variable" ties to his survivor status. However, the element enables perception more than it drives decisions; Kai's choices (examining the strap, kneeling, positioning it) are investigative rather than survivor-specific trade-offs. Causal pressure is moderate; the trait is essential context but not the pivot of a key turn. Two gates met, closure linkage present but not transformation-level.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The pewter mask strap appears in multiple beats: paragraph 5 (touch triggers memory), 14 (tightens as he remembers interrogators' use), 19 (traces mathematical patterns), 24 (removes and examines), 27 (positions to decode), 28 (warms and activates), 31 (slips from fingers at understanding). Setup immediate, middle development strong (constraints breathing, holds mathematical key), closure participation direct (final understanding occurs as strap slips). The strap's specific properties (mathematical patterns, ultraviolet activation) matter causally. However, the mathematical decoding is asserted more than shown step-by-step, and the "hidden function" reveal feels convenient. Three gates met, causal pressure solid, but swappability risk (another artifact could serve) and the off-page mechanics of activation lower the score slightly below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance is introduced paragraph 9 ("ultraviolet penance, where everything hidden would be revealed") and frames the forest's function as revelatory crucible. Middle: the concept recurs (paragraphs 16, 21, 29) to explain the setting's pressure. Closure: the forest's ultraviolet properties activate the pewter strap's hidden function, enabling Kai's final understanding. The concept shapes the setting's stakes and the protagonist's interpretive lens. However, "penance" as a thematic label is more atmospheric than mechanical; the exact cost or ritual the concept imposes is abstract. Setup early, middle development thematic, closure participation functional but not irreplaceable—another revelatory environment could substitute. Three gates met, moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement is introduced paragraph 4 ("proprioceptively enhanced senses mapping his body's position in space") and recurs in paragraphs 8, 13, 19, 25. Setup immediate. Middle: the trait allows Kai to "sense the mathematical precision" in the strap's design (paragraph 25) and serves as "new sensory input, recording coordinates of pain" (paragraph 13). Closure: the trait enables decoding the strap's patterns under ultraviolet light. However, the enhancement is primarily perceptual flavor; it does not visibly constrain a choice or impose a cost. The trait is label-heavy ("proprioceptively enhanced") and its mechanics are told rather than dramatized through a specific tradeoff. Two gates met, but ornamental more than causal. Cap at 4.6 for weak middle development and no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Bracing appears in paragraphs 7 (against ancient tree as knees threaten collapse), 15 (another wave of memory), and 27 (bracing himself for revelation). Setup early, middle reprise under pressure, closure adjacency (paragraph 27 is penultimate beat before activation). The action embodies vulnerability and physical cost, but it is reactive—supporting rather than driving turns. Swappability test: "steadied himself" or "collapsed" could replace without structural loss. The action signals state more than it narrows options. Two gates met, purposeful recurrence, but causal pressure is moderate. Lyric reprise with emotional charge but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses is introduced paragraph 6 ("not through thoughtful recollection, but through automatic trauma responses—sweat, tremors, copper taste") and shapes the middle (paragraphs 12, 20: "trauma responses that served as pathways to memory"). Setup immediate, middle development clear, but the method does not appear in the final beat—decoding happens via the pewter strap and ultraviolet light, not via a trauma-response trigger. The method enables access to memory but does not constrain the climactic choice or revelation. Two gates (setup, middle), no closure participation; cap at ~5.0–5.5. The method is functional but ultimately swappable with another memory-access mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is present throughout: setup paragraph 2, middle beats (paragraphs 9, 12, 16, 21, 26), and closure (paragraphs 28–29 where the forest's ultraviolet properties activate the strap). The setting supplies the necessary wavelength to decode the pewter strap's hidden function—without this exact setting, the climax fails. The forest pressures Kai's perception ("amplifying echoes of trauma," "revealing unseen truths") and participates actively in the ending ("seemed to lean closer," "properties activated its hidden function"). Setup immediate, middle causal (forest as laboratory and confessional), closure indispensable. Three gates met, strong causal linkage, high specificity. Slight deduction for occasional abstraction ("active participant") that tells more than shows.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening (paragraphs 1–2: "anesthesia dissipated," "consciousness surfaced") and explains Kai's disorientation. However, the element does not constrain choices or shape tactics beyond the opening beat. No clock pressure, no time-limited decision. The anesthesia reference does not return or tighten the ending. Setup gate met, middle and closure gates absent. The timeframe is functional context but swappable (could awaken from sleep, emerge from trance) without structural loss. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure gates; actual score reflects minimal causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the mathematics of mercy is introduced paragraph 11 ("he had survived with a new purpose... to discover the mathematics of mercy"), reinforced in middle beats (paragraphs 10, 23, 30), and the climax delivers the sought insight (paragraph 29: "mercy was a function of time over pain"). Setup explicit, middle development sustained, closure delivers on the quest. However, the motivation is more thematic than dramatized—Kai investigates rather than faces a choice between competing wants. Friction is intellectual (seeking framework vs. redemption) rather than embodied cost. Three gates met, strong coherence, but the motivation does not force a visible sacrifice or trade-off at closure, limiting felt impact.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Displaced rooted tone is signaled paragraph 17 ("displaced sensation... warred with an inexplicable rootedness") and maintained throughout: Kai feels alien yet connected, disoriented yet purposeful. The tone modulates with pressure—early disorientation (paragraphs 2–8), gradual grounding (paragraphs 18–22), final synthesis (paragraph 30: "displaced yet rooted in this strange sanctuary"). Setup mid-early, middle cohesion strong, closure crystallization clear. The tone charges the final image by reconciling the two poles. However, the tone is somewhat static—more a sustained duality than a progression—and the final articulation ("exactly where he needed to be—displaced yet rooted") borders on summary. Three gates met, coherent modulation, solid closure linkage.</comment>
