<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is declared through grandmother's backstory but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("anchors of intuition," "between-worlds translator") rather than embodied contradiction. The final "unfasten the barrier" moment arrives without prior micro-choices that narrow options or reveal a hierarchy of values. Agency reads as passive recognition rather than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with a lyric frame (childhood → adult → future child), but the closure unit—touching fragment to painting and "histories long overlooked flood into the present"—asserts transformation without showing visible cost or a legible before/after. The narrative compresses two decades into summary without causal linkage; key turns (finding the lens, studying paintings, arriving at the market) are told rather than dramatized. Orientation is delayed: who the narrator is and what stakes are live remains unclear past the 120-word threshold, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly sketched ("rope bridges and wooden platforms," "swaying stalls") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint; no choice is shaped by proximity, access, or environmental pressure. The lighthouse lens fragment recurs across beats and charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting that elevates the score. Spatial choreography remains coherent, and sensory detail is selective without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early but never tightened by a reversal or choice that forecloses an option. The climax ("touch the fragment to the painting") is uncontested and costs nothing on the page; no resistance, trade-off, or price appears. The "eternal instant" and "final breath" gestures attempt intensity without causal escalation. Accumulative pressure requires a meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the resolution is declared, not earned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme of intergenerational knowledge transmission and honoring silenced histories is present but stated rather than embodied in concrete struggle. The final paragraph moralizes with "somewhere, another child will find their own fragment," replacing resonance with thesis. Recurring images (lens, lighthouse, paintings) are ornamental rather than constraining choices or shifting meaning through pressure. The piece avoids a non-literal answer to the central question, opting for direct thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register and first-person distance throughout. Perceptual signature is generic ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition") rather than character-particular; diction drifts toward elevated abstraction ("between-worlds translator," "eternal instant") that flattens immediacy. Psychic distance is stable, and no head-hopping occurs. Syntax varies purposefully, and the prose reads clean, but lacks the specificity and embodied texture required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "elusively tangible" appears three times with synonym churn ("seeming to shift between solidity and vapor," "difficult to study, yet impossible to ignore," "no longer elusively tangible but fully present"). Template cadence runs through the final third with repeated "As" and "The" stems across adjacent lines. Stock metaphors ("colors swirl and merge," "constellations in a night sky") and abstraction ("anchors of intuition humming") dull clarity at peak beats. Applying −0.8 in Q7 for loops and template artifacts; additionally −0.3 for figurative density without payoff in the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise—mystical translator using inherited object to decode hidden art—closely matches template fantasy-quest structures without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Turns (finding lens, grandmother's deathbed clue, final painting) follow stock beats. The "between-worlds translator" role and "alchemist's market" read as generic portal-fantasy furniture. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the circular frame (child → adult → future child) is conventional. Derivative premise penalty of −0.8 applied.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Character is present throughout and labeled repeatedly, but decisions that alter tactics are absent; the protagonist observes, remembers, and finally acts without on-page resistance or cost. Setup and closure participation are met, but middle development lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Object appears in opening, recurs across multiple beats (child discovery, market, climax), and is handled on-page in the final action. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9. However, its use is largely decorative (warmth in pocket, glowing at end) without constraining a choice or enabling a tactic under stress. Swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Concept is invoked as a label ("anchors of intuition") in five lines but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. It functions as thematic echo without altering options or creating pressure. Ornamental use −0.8, late payoff −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Attribute is described three times ("seeming to shift between solidity and vapor," "elusively tangible nature made it difficult to study") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. Label-only mentions without on-page tradeoff. Setup met, but no middle or closure participation in causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Action appears in the climax ("unfasten the final lock," "unfasten the barrier") and connects to grandmother's teaching, but it could be replaced with "unlock," "open," or "break" without structural impact. Closure linkage +1.0, but swappability −0.6 and late appearance −0.4 limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Method is signaled in grandmother's deathbed teaching and reappears in the climax ("hidden details in paintings—a series of almost invisible dots"). Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.8. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated; no attempt or failure occurs, and it resolves a problem it did not help create. Cap at 3.0 lifted slightly by early setup.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Setting is vividly described and frames the final act but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. Postcard description without tactical consequence. Setup met, closure framing present, but no middle development where the environment alters options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Timeframe structures the narrative (childhood memory → adult moment → future cycle) and is explicitly invoked ("between childhood and now," "eternal instant"). Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9. However, no ticking clock tightens decisions; time is conceptual rather than pressing. The frame is lyric resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Motivation is declared in grandmother's teaching and restated at closure ("histories long overlooked flood into the present, their stories finally honored"). Setup +0.5, closure echo +0.6. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. Summary-only use −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Tone of timeless suspension is maintained through diction ("eternal instant," "suspended in an eternal instant," "stretches around me") and modulates minimally across beats. Setup +0.5, recurring invocation +0.6, closure charge +0.7. However, the static mystical register flattens rather than heightening pressure at the climax. No clear cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>
