<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Anya's internal state is articulated through consistent metaphors (furious tranquility, wild serenity) but her motivation remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The biological clock revelation "after the egg hatched" reads as symbolic shorthand rather than embodied experience with on-page micro-choices that test conflicting desires. Her actions at closure—reaching toward the vortex—feel more ceremonial than earned by prior struggle between competing wants. The final epiphany ("texture of herself") lands as label rather than concrete realization forged through visceral cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Anya arranges seeds in decreasing entropy order, building toward the vortex manifestation. However, the closure unit—her touching the vortex and realizing "the texture of borrowed time was...the texture of herself"—leans heavily on abstraction rather than a concrete, legible transformation with visible cost. The final image delivers conceptual repricing but the cost remains atmospheric ("her own days were numbered") rather than foregrounding a specific forfeiture or trade-off that alters her state on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The icebound atrium, starlight, frost, and seed jars create a vivid, consistent atmosphere filtered through Anya's professional lens. The oak acorn cap functions as both tool and anchor, warming against her skin at the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear—spirals expanding outward from center—and the environment directly enables the vortex opening. The setting charges the final image with its accumulated details (ice walls pulsing, starlight responding), meeting the 9+ gate's constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reopening the vortex to understand borrowed time—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the arranging task, each placement described as requiring "intense focus" that deepens her tranquil state. However, no live reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the spiral completes without complication, and the vortex manifests on schedule. The cost (mortality awareness) is told in backstory rather than tested on the page through a trade-off that forecloses an alternate path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images—seeds as genetic memory, entropy as time's flow, the vortex as connection—and avoids overt moralizing until the final beat. The oak acorn cap and spiral arrangement build a coherent motif of order versus chaos, preservation versus experience. However, the ending delivers an explicit thematic statement ("the texture of borrowed time was...the texture of herself") that names rather than shows the resonance, and "finally understood" reads as earned wisdom asserted rather than discovered through specific, irreversible experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a consistent elevated register ("furious tranquility," "wild serenity," "heirloom seed saver"). Diction stays within an archival-lyric idiom that suits the atrium setting and Anya's profession. However, the prose relies heavily on paradoxical pairings (furious/tranquil, wild/serenity, substance/transparency, past/present) that create a patterned echo rather than perceptual signature shifting under pressure. No dialogue present. Free indirect access remains clean with no head-hopping, and the narrative certainty matches what Anya can plausibly know.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries figurative density throughout—"dancing shadows," "captured fireflies in a universe of contained possibilities," "inverted tree seeking its roots"—without always advancing pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraph 3 tells us the egg changed everything (connection, understanding, purpose), then paragraph 4 repeats the change as seeking to reopen inheritance. Template cadence recurs with stacked paradoxes (furious tranquility, wild serenity, chaos/calm, substance/transparency) in high-pressure beats, creating a drumbeat rhythm rather than varied propulsion. The final two paragraphs compress the vortex manifestation and Anya's realization into back-to-back abstractions ("texture of borrowed time," "bridge between preservation and experience") that summarize rather than dramatize the closure moment. Cumulative artifact penalty (paraphrase loop, template cadence in peak beats, figurative density without momentum payoff): −1.2 in Q7, with additional impact from abstraction at closure pushing toward the lower 5-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of heirloom seed saving, entropy manipulation, and time-vortex inheritance offers a fresh premise that feels specific to this character and world. The icebound atrium and oak acorn cap ground the concept in tactile detail. However, the emotional arc—midlife reckoning with mortality leading to self-discovery—follows a familiar template, and the final revelation ("texture of borrowed time was...texture of herself") resolves into a tidy unity that hedges narrative risk. The egg-hatching metaphor for biological clock reads as symbolic convenience rather than lived-in transformation with messy consequences.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Anya (heirloom seed saver) is present throughout and her professional identity shapes her approach—arranging seeds by dormancy duration. Her choices (selecting the arrangement system, placing jars in spirals, reaching toward the vortex) drive the narrative's key beats. However, her decisions feel more procedural than conflicted; no moment forces a trade-off where her seed-saver instinct (preservation) clashes with her new desire (experience). The closure sees her shift from recorder to participant, but this change is told rather than enacted through a difficult on-page choice with visible cost. Setup: present from opening. Development: she arranges seeds in middle third. Payoff: she reaches toward the vortex at closure. Causal pressure is moderate—her professional method enables the vortex but doesn't narrow options or impose a price. Closure linkage is present but declarative. Swappability: moderate; another preservation-oriented role could function with minor edits. No late penalty. Band: functional across beats but lacks the costly trade-off needed for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The oak acorn cap appears in paragraph 5 ("rested in her palm as the key"), paragraph 13 ("warmed against her skin"), paragraph 17 ("directly above the oak acorn cap"), and implicitly in the final beats as the center of the spiral. It functions as the literal key to the vortex and carries generational texture ("worn smooth by...handling both physical and temporal"). The warming detail in paragraph 13 signals the vortex's approach, giving the object a responsive role. However, its use remains largely static—Anya holds it—rather than requiring a difficult choice about how or whether to deploy it. Setup: signaled by paragraph 5 (~25% mark). Development: warms at midpoint, anchoring the spiral. Payoff: the vortex rises from it at closure. Beat involvement: three distinct beats. Causal pressure: moderate; it enables but doesn't constrain. Closure linkage: strong, as the vortex's origin point. Irreplaceability: high; the generational and temporal properties are specific. No late penalty. Band: essential across beats and ending, with strong closure linkage and specificity, but lacks a trade-off tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The vortex inheritance is named in paragraph 4 and described as "a swirling gateway...to another time—the moments before each seed's dormancy began." It manifests on-page in paragraph 17 as "substance and transparency, as past and present swirling." The concept frames Anya's goal and shapes her method (decreasing entropy to reopen it), but its mechanics remain abstract; we don't see her wrestle with competing inheritance theories or face a cost unique to this power. The vortex solves the problem it was introduced to solve without complicating her path. Setup: present by paragraph 4 (~20%). Development: mentioned as her goal but not tested. Payoff: manifests at closure. Causal pressure: low; it appears when summoned. Closure linkage: present but passive. Swappability: moderate; another portal or threshold could function with edits. No late penalty. Ornamental use penalty: −0.5 (described rather than tested). Band: functional but replaceable, shapes one key turn (manifestation) without prior friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" / "furious tranquility" appears in paragraphs 1, 8, and 19, paired with "wild serenity" in paragraphs 14 and 19. The trait is asserted as Anya's state but never constrains or enables a specific on-page action with visible cost. We're told each seed placement "required intense focus and yet brought profound peace" (paragraph 8), but no moment shows her tranquility enabling a delicate task or her fury driving a risky choice. The attribute functions as atmospheric label rather than lever. Setup: present in opening line. Development: repeated in paragraph 8 but not tested. Payoff: echoed at closure. Beat involvement: one (opening framing). Causal pressure: none; it's a mood descriptor. Closure linkage: thematic echo only. Label-only penalty: −0.3. Ornamental penalty: −0.5. Band: present but ornamental, mentioned without affecting choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reopen" appears in paragraph 4 ("sought to reopen the vortex inheritance") and is fulfilled in paragraph 17 ("the vortex manifested") and paragraph 19 ("Anya...finally reopened what she had always sought"). The action structures the entire narrative—her goal, her method (arranging seeds), and her closure moment (reaching toward the reopened vortex). However, the reopening itself is achieved by completing the spiral without complication; no failed attempt or mid-course correction tests her commitment. Setup: goal stated by paragraph 4 (~20%). Development: arranging seeds in middle third works toward it. Payoff: vortex reopens at closure. Beat involvement: three (goal statement, method execution, manifestation). Causal pressure: moderate; the action frames all tactics but doesn't narrow options. Closure linkage: strong; the reopening is the climax. Irreplaceability: high; the entire plot serves this verb. No late penalty. Band: essential across beats and ending, drives the arc, but lacks a reversal or complication tied to the reopening itself that would push above 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"By decreasing entropy" is named in paragraph 6 ("If she could decrease the entropy") and enacted in paragraph 8 ("arranging the seeds...by the precise duration of their dormancy requirements—a decreasing scale of entropy made manifest") and explained in paragraph 11 ("By decreasing the entropy...essentially reversing the natural flow of time"). The method is specific and shapes her approach—sorting by dormancy duration rather than species or date. However, the mechanics remain asserted; we don't see entropy measurement, don't witness a failed arrangement that increases entropy, and the method succeeds on first attempt without cost. Setup: signaled by paragraph 6 (~30%, slightly late). Development: executed in paragraph 8. Payoff: result explained in paragraph 11, vortex manifests in paragraph 17. Beat involvement: two (method statement, execution). Causal pressure: moderate; it defines her tactic but doesn't create friction. Closure linkage: indirect; the method enables the vortex but isn't reprised at the ending image. Late signal penalty: −0.3 (introduced at ~30%). Summary-only penalty: −0.3 (mechanics told, not tested). Band: functional, shapes key tactic, but replaceable and lacks cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is established in paragraph 1 ("icebound atrium...bare feet...ancient frost...subzero temperature...crystalline ceiling"), sustained throughout (paragraphs 2, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19), and charged at closure ("icebound atrium under the spell of starlight"). The setting pressures Anya's body (bare feet on frost), supplies the spatial logic for the spiral arrangement, and the ice walls pulse responsively in paragraph 10. The starlight modulates (paragraph 9: "growing brighter and more deliberate"), making the environment an active participant. Setup: opening paragraph. Development: ice walls pulse (paragraph 10), starlight responds (paragraph 9). Payoff: "icebound atrium" reprised in final paragraph with accumulated charge. Beat involvement: four or more (body pressure, spatial logic, responsive environment, closure frame). Causal pressure: high; the cold and geometry constrain her method. Closure linkage: strong; the setting is named and reweighted in the final image. Irreplaceability: high; the ice and starlight are specific to the vortex mechanics. Cost connection: her bare feet on subzero frost is a visceral price. Band: essential across beats and ending, constrains choices, charges final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the egg hatches" appears in paragraph 3 and is explained as "her biological clock striking midnight at forty-seven." The timeframe orients the reader to a post-transformation state but doesn't create urgency or tighten decisions on the page. No ticking clock pressures Anya's arranging; she works at her own pace until the spiral completes. The hatching is a symbolic backstory marker rather than a live constraint. Setup: present by paragraph 3 (~15%). Development: not tracked or referenced in middle action. Payoff: mortality awareness echoed in paragraph 12 ("her own days were numbered") but not tied to immediate time pressure. Beat involvement: one (backstory frame). Causal pressure: none; the timeframe contextualizes but doesn't alter tactics. Closure linkage: thematic only. Swappability: high; another life-stage marker could replace it. Summary-only penalty: −0.3 (told, not dramatized). Band: functional but replaceable, provides context without shaping choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of borrowed time" is stated in paragraph 7 ("what she truly sought: the texture of borrowed time") and resolved in paragraph 19 ("the texture of borrowed time was...the texture of herself"). Paragraph 12 adds urgency ("her own days were numbered"), tying the desire to mortality. The motivation frames her entire arc and is fulfilled at closure. However, it's articulated through exposition rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no moment shows her tempted to preserve rather than experience, or weighing the cost of discovery. Setup: stated by paragraph 7 (~35%, slightly late). Development: urgency added in paragraph 12. Payoff: desire fulfilled in final paragraph. Beat involvement: two (goal statement, resolution). Causal pressure: low; the desire is told and satisfied without friction. Closure linkage: strong; the final line answers the desire. Swappability: moderate; another existential quest could function. Late signal penalty: −0.2 (stated after first third). Told-only penalty: −0.5 (friction between wants not shown). Band: shapes the arc and lands at closure but lacks on-page conflict between desire and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Wild serenity" appears in paragraphs 14 ("Wild serenity filled the space") and 19 ("the wild serenity of the universe flowing through her furious tranquility"). The tone is asserted as a paradoxical blend of chaos and calm, mirroring the setting ("forest...in the heart of a hurricane") and Anya's state. However, the prose maintains a steady elevated register throughout without modulating in response to escalating pressure; the tone at closure feels identical to the tone at opening, creating static mood rather than dynamic charge. Setup: introduced at paragraph 14 (~70%, late). Development: not tested or varied. Payoff: echoed in final paragraph. Beat involvement: one (thematic frame). Causal pressure: none; tone is atmospheric. Closure linkage: present as reprise but doesn't reweight. Late penalty: −0.5 (first appears in final third). Static mood penalty: −0.3. Band: functional, coherent, but introduced late and not modulated under pressure.</comment>
