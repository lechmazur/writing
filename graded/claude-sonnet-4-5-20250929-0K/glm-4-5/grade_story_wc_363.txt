<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is dominated by abstract, poetic narration ("raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivations are told via grandmother's deathbed instructions, not dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. The journey's sacrifices (memories, sensations) are summarized rather than shown as embodied costs that force difficult trade-offs. The final "able to weave not just threads but the very fabric of sound itself" reads as unearned epiphany, a convenient power-up rather than a credible change rooted in prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with lyric compression, but orientation remains vague: Elara's spatial relationship to the orchard, the market's distance, and the journey's temporal window are never anchored concretely (Orientation Test penalty −0.4). The closure—sound returning and Elara "able to weave" sound—lands as a Conceptual Repricing, yet the cost is asserted rather than shown; the bead "reborn on her chest" undercuts the prior claim that it "stopped glowing entirely," creating a soft reset. The puzzle-piece journey introduces a magical mechanic late without prior setup, and causality blurs: why does touching the bead to the bamboo shoot reverse the silence? The lens holds loosely, but the closure image lacks the undeniable cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bamboo forest and forgotten orchard establish a vivid lyric setting with "green-gold" light and "mossy forest floor," but spatial choreography is vague—Elara's exact location within the forest, the market's distance, and the final bamboo shoot's relation to her starting point remain unclear. The amber bead functions as a recurring object that charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. Sensory detail is selectively vivid (the bead's warmth, the forest's silence) but does not constrain a key choice; Elara's path is guided entirely by the bead's glow, not by environmental obstacles. The setting remains atmospheric rather than a tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—carrying the grandmother's message to restore sound—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara encounters the puzzle pieces, but their discovery is coincidental ("something magnetic drew her") rather than driven by her agency. The sacrifices ("a memory, a sound, a sensation") are summarized in a single sentence without on-page embodiment or a visible cost that alters later tactics. The bead's dimming and the eventual restoration of sound occur passively; the final bamboo shoot appears without prior setup, and touching it solves the problem it did not help create. No escalation or trade-off is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring amber bead and the puzzle journey, and the final line offers a resonant image: "silence is not absence, but a different kind of presence." However, this insight is stated directly rather than implied through scene particulars, and the message's content is never specified, making the thematic payoff abstract. The motif of "raveling silence" recurs frequently but does not constrain choice or accumulate pressure—it remains decorative. The ending grants Elara a convenient new power ("weave not just threads but the very fabric of sound itself") that reads as thematic statement rather than earned consequence, and the bead's rebirth undercuts the prior sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("stoically sparkling," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "crystalline prison") that creates a fairy-tale tone but occasionally drifts into abstraction that obscures concrete action. POV is stable third-person limited, yet psychic distance is inconsistent: "something magnetic drew her" and "the bead pulsed with urgency" externalize agency rather than filtering through Elara's perception. The prose teaches its pattern of poetic compression, but filter verbs ("she noticed," "she touched," "she knew") stack in high-pressure beats without embodied immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose features pervasive patterned artifacts: template cadence runs ("Each morning, as her loom stood idle…another sound would vanish"; "She had no map, no sense of direction—only the bead's steady glow"), synonym loops ("raveling silence," "profound quiet," "growing quiet," "perfect silence," "silence…all-encompassing"), and stock metaphors ("threads of undetectable sound," "tapestry of time"). Mixed metaphors appear: silence "ravels" (unweaves) yet also "stretches" and "deepens," and the bead "dimmed" then was "reborn" without clarifying its state. Register drifts into elevated diction ("latent possibility," "crystalline prison") that does not match the POV's idiom. Paraphrase loops blur momentum: the bead's guidance is restated across multiple paragraphs without advancing knowledge. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("the bead reborn on her chest"), triggering the high-penalty routing (−1.7 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a character must restore lost sound by journeying with a magical object—closely follows widely used fantasy quest templates without transformation through lived detail or world logic (Derivative Premise penalty −1.0). The "raveling silence" concept and the amber bead as guide are vivid images, but the puzzle-piece path and the grandmother's deathbed instructions are familiar tropes executed without fresh synthesis. The sacrifices (memories, sensations) are summarized rather than dramatized, and the final restoration—touching the bead to a bamboo shoot—introduces a late rule change to solve a problem it did not help create. The ending's "weave…the very fabric of sound itself" grants a convenient new power that reads as allegorical rather than earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her desire to carry the message frames the journey, but her choices are passive: the bead guides her path ("only the bead's steady glow"), the puzzle pieces appear coincidentally ("something magnetic drew her"), and the final act—touching the bead to the bamboo shoot—is intuitive rather than a deliberate decision that narrows options. The sacrifices are summarized ("she offered her first clear memory") without on-page embodiment. She is present in the closure but does not drive it through a difficult choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber bead is introduced early (paragraph 4), handled across multiple beats (Elara touches it nightly, it guides her journey, it pulses with urgency, it glows and dims, and finally she touches it to the bamboo shoot), and returns with reweighted meaning in the closure ("the bead reborn on her chest"). However, the bead's mechanics shift inconsistently: it "stopped glowing entirely" after giving "all its energy," yet at the end it is "reborn," which undercuts the prior cost. The bead constrains the journey (she follows its glow) and is causally active in the closure, but the contradiction in its state lowers the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "raveling silence" is established early and recurs throughout, but it functions primarily as atmosphere rather than a stake that shapes tactics. Sounds vanish progressively (sparrows, leaves, breath, loom), yet Elara does not adapt her behavior in response; the silence does not narrow her options or force a difficult choice. The concept charges the thematic closure ("silence is not absence"), but it remains abstract rather than a tactical constraint. The silence is present at closure but does not alter the final action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" is mentioned once as a descriptive label for the bead ("the stoically sparkling tree sap amber bead") without constraining or enabling any on-page action. The attribute does not create a trade-off or shape Elara's choices. It remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Recommence" appears once in the middle of the journey ("she would need to recommence her journey through jigsaw puzzle edges") to describe resuming the path via the puzzle pieces. It marks a transition beat but does not drive a major turn or redefine options; Elara's journey continues in the same mode (following the bead's glow, offering sacrifices). The action is functional but replaceable with "continue" or "resume" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The jigsaw puzzle pieces are introduced in the middle (paragraph 10, ~40% mark) when Elara finds them in a rummage sale box, and their mechanics (step on pieces, offer sacrifices) are explained immediately. They shape the journey's method for the final leg, but the puzzle is not set up earlier, and its glowing edges echo the bead's glow without distinct properties. The puzzle enables the journey but is not causally linked to earlier beats. Present in development and closure but introduced late and somewhat swappable with another magical path.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest" is named early and recurs at the end ("the whisper of bamboo leaves in the forgotten orchard"), creating a purposeful lyric frame. However, the orchard does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics; it remains a backdrop. The bamboo forest supplies the setting for the journey and the final bamboo shoot, but spatial details are vague and the environment does not pressure decisions. The setting is present at setup and closure with some resonance but does not shape action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"The hush of time's unraveling tapestry" appears as a poetic label for the silence's temporal effect, and the story mentions "Time blurred strangely as she traveled—sometimes minutes, sometimes years seemed to pass." However, time remains abstract and does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The "seventh day" of silence triggers action, but no clock pressure shapes Elara's choices during the journey. Time is present thematically but does not function as a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to carry a message across impossible distance" is established early via the grandmother's deathbed instructions and frames the journey. The motivation drives the plot (she sets out when the bead pulses, she follows the puzzle path), but it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The message's content is never specified, and Elara does not weigh the cost of carrying it against other desires. The motivation is present at setup, development, and closure but lacks friction or embodied choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Latent sacrifice" is named once explicitly ("its latent sacrifice becoming apparent") and echoed in the journey's structure (Elara offers memories and sensations, the bead dims). The tone of quiet loss and inevitable cost is coherent through the journey and modulates slightly at the end when sound returns. However, the sacrifices are summarized rather than embodied, and the bead's rebirth undercuts the final cost, softening the tone. The tone is present and purposeful but does not fully charge the closure image.</comment>
