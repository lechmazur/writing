<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains an abstraction throughout—her "chaste courtesan" identity is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choice. The piece tells us she has "preserved her essence" and "defied conformity," but we never witness an actual internal conflict or micro-choice that reveals competing desires under pressure. Emotions are labeled ("alarming serenity") rather than embodied in gesture or perception. The final "step through" is a passive fulfillment of destiny, not a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation test fails: who Elara is, where the courtyard is, and what world we inhabit remain vague past the 120-word mark, creating a persistent abstraction debt (−0.4). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (lyric intensification toward a threshold moment), but the closure lacks legible cost—Elara "steps through" into the prism sanctuary with no visible price paid, no path foreclosed, no before/after tension. The piece offers Conceptual Repricing language ("lock and key to her own freedom") but the conceptual cost is asserted, not demonstrated on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "silver courtyard under snow" recurs and brackets the piece, providing a lyric frame, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a backdrop. Sensory detail is selective (snowflakes, moonlight, breath), but no environmental feature pressures Elara's decision. The micro-setting allowance (threads, prism) is invoked yet remains metaphorical without spatial or physical grounding that would reach 6+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the prism sanctuary—is signaled early, but escalation is absent: Elara kneels, performs the ritual, and succeeds without complication, reversal, or visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the "seven generations failed" setup promises difficulty, but on the page she faces no resistance. Agency is passive (studying, waiting, being chosen) rather than a decision that narrows paths. The threads "sing as they loosened" without cost or consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of defying conformity emerges from repeated assertion ("rebellion," "defiance," "liberation") rather than from dramatized particulars. The final image ("thunder of a woman reborn") states the thematic payoff instead of letting it resonate through a non-literal image. The "harvest of echoes" device gestures toward resonance but remains abstract—we never see a concrete echo or specific story that reweights Elara's choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register and a distinct perceptual signature (silver, threads, echoes), but the voice flattens under pressure: every beat uses the same lyric-declarative cadence without modulation. Purposeful compression is evident, but the piece does not teach its pattern early enough to waive orientation debt. No dialogue appears. The recurring phrase "between sigh and smile" and "prism sanctuary under starlight" create a pattern, but they loop without reweighting meaning until the very end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn undermine density: "threads of fate" / "silvery strands" / "threads that bound her spirit" cycle without new information; "chaste courtesan" appears nine times, often in adjacent beats as a label rather than dramatized constraint. Template cadence runs ("The chaste courtesan had…" / "The courtesan's chastity…") across the final third (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("lullaby of conformity," "harvest of echoes") lack specificity. Mixed metaphor: threads "sing" as they loosen, then Elara hears her "voice" as "thunder"—vehicles clash without earned payoff. Cumulative artifact debt in Q7: −1.4, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—unlocking a mystical sanctuary through spiritual purity—follows a familiar template (chosen-one ascension, seven generations prophecy) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 for derivative premise). The "chaste courtesan" juxtaposition hints at originality but remains a label rather than a lived contradiction. No turn feels inevitable in hindsight; the piece moves through its arc without fresh inflection or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "chaste courtesan" character is present throughout and her identity is declared as central, but she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or stakes. She studies, waits, and performs the ritual without complication. Her chastity is told as spiritual preservation, not shown through a choice that costs her something tangible. Late first-third establishment and no middle development beat where chastity constrains an option. Label-only trait (−0.3). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; swappability and ornamental use lower further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "prism sanctuary under starlight" appears early (setup ✓), recurs at midpoint as a goal (development ✓), and materializes at the ending (payoff ✓). It enables the final beat (Elara steps through), giving it causal pressure. However, it remains abstract—never handled, never described in spatial or sensory terms that would make it irreplaceable. Swappability: "portal," "gate," "threshold" could substitute with minor edits (−0.5). No visible cost tied to the prism itself; it simply appears when conditions are met.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" is mentioned five times but functions as thematic decoration rather than a stake or tactic that shapes on-page action. Elara "absorbs" the echoes in the sanctuary, but this is summary, not dramatized beat involvement. No choice hinges on the echoes; no cost is tied to harvesting them. Ornamental use (−0.7); summary-only (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" appears three times as a descriptive label ("bodily poetic form," "bodily poetic expression," "bodily poetic movements") but never constrains or enables a choice with cost. It describes her gestures but those gestures face no resistance and produce no trade-off. Label-only trait (−0.3); no middle development or closure participation beyond cameo mention. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; label-only and swappability lower further.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unlock" is signaled early as the goal, structures the middle attempt (kneeling, untangling threads), and delivers the ending (the sanctuary solidifies, she steps through). It meets all three gates and drives the plot. However, the unlock itself is passive—threads "respond to her touch" without resistance or cost—so causal pressure is moderate. Specificity is low: the mechanics of unlocking are metaphorical, not particular. Two beats + closure linkage + early signal reach 6.1, but swappability and lack of visible cost prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"By untangling threads" is the stated method, present in setup ("threads of fate"), executed in the middle beat (kneeling, fingers moving), and referenced at closure ("final thread came undone"). Mechanics are signaled: she studies patterns for months, then performs the action. However, the untangling itself is abstract—no specific knot, sequence, or friction is shown—so it remains partly ornamental. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability (could be "weaving," "severing," "reordering" threads) −0.6 and summary-only execution −0.4 lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "silver courtyard under snow" opens and closes the piece (setup ✓, payoff ✓) and provides the physical location for the middle ritual beat (development ✓). It supplies sensory anchors (snow, moonlight) and recurs with slight reweighting at the end ("held its breath no longer"). However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara could perform the ritual anywhere. Lyric reprise reweights the stake modestly, lifting it into the 4.8 range, but postcard description and lack of causal pressure cap it below 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The phrase "between sigh and smile" recurs five times but functions as a lyric tag rather than a live timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock pressure is felt; Elara waits for "the moon reached its meridian" and then completes the ritual without urgency or cost tied to timing. Vague and untracked time. Ornamental use (−0.7).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To defy the lullaby of conformity" is stated early and repeatedly as Elara's motivation, and the piece tells us she has succeeded in defying it. However, the desire is never dramatized through a conflicted choice—no on-page moment where conformity tempts her or where defiance costs her something tangible. The motivation is declared, not enacted. Setup ✓ (early mention), but no middle beat where defiance alters tactics, and closure merely asserts the result. Told-only trends low; label-only (−0.3), summary-only (−0.4). Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; frictions lower further.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" appears twice, labeling the tone rather than modulating through the pressure arc. The prose maintains a single elevated, declarative mood without variation: even the climactic "step through" and "thunder of a woman reborn" use the same lyric cadence as the opening. Static mood throughout. No coherent tonal shift that charges the final image. Label-only tone claim (−0.3); single static mood trends mid-low.</comment>
