<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tutor's motivation to forgive himself is stated repeatedly but rarely embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. His "productive fidgeting" is labeled often yet never constrains a beat or forces a visible tradeoff. The prince's hand-in-reconciliation moment arrives without prior friction, delivering an epiphany the tutor has not earned through on-page struggle. Internal conflict reads as summary rather than simultaneous pulls.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words—no clear spatial anchor or "who is speaking when" until well into the piece. The closure hinges on the prince appearing in a chamber, but no prior beat establishes the prince as alive, accessible, or part of the labyrinth's mechanism, creating a causality gap. The four-minute lull is declared but never tightens a choice; time pressure evaporates. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the ending delivers a tidy reconciliation rather than a charged reconfiguration of cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are vivid anchor points. The time-frozen village supplies a strong atmospheric constraint. However, the labyrinth's interior—where the prince waits—materializes only at closure without prior spatial grounding, and the four-minute lull never alters the tutor's movement or tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page choice forces the tutor to sacrifice pride, memory, or safety. The tapestry-decoding is described but never escalates or narrows options. The prince's sudden appearance and outstretched hand resolve the conflict via coincidence rather than protagonist agency, and no visible cost accompanies the reconciliation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption and self-forgiveness emerges clearly but leans on direct statement: "he had only needed to forgive himself enough to reach for it." The recurring motifs—woven hush, productive fidgeting, platinum labyrinth—are named frequently yet do not accumulate pressure or shift meaning at closure. The final image offers emotional resolution without a non-literal answer or conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a meditative, elevated register appropriate to the tutor's scholarly background. However, several sentences ("fierce repose," "woven hush") repeat across paragraphs as thematic labels rather than fresh perception. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the ending drifts toward summary omniscience when describing time restarting and villagers awakening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "woven hush" appears in five separate sentences with minimal variation, and "productive fidgeting" is restated three times without added detail. Template cadence appears in multiple "His fingers…" and "The [noun] had…" sentence stems across the piece. Several beats stack filter verbs ("began," "felt," "seemed") where directness would sharpen. Mixed metaphors appear: walls "shimmer like liquid metal" yet also form a door "invisible to all but someone who understood," blurring the logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, chess-tutor exile, and labyrinth-as-redemption combine familiar fantasy templates. The twist—reconciliation with the prince—arrives without groundwork and reads as wish-fulfillment. The "productive fidgeting" detail is specific but underused, and the tapestry-decoding method is mentioned without transformation or fresh execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor is the named protagonist and POV throughout. He approaches the tapestry and decodes threads, but these actions do not force a choice or narrow his options on the page. His final act—walking toward the labyrinth entrance—happens after the problem is solved rather than creating the turn. Present in all three gates but his agency is passive; events resolve around him.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is introduced early, returns at the midpoint when it "responds to his focused energy," and appears again at closure when the door forms. However, it is described rather than used; the tutor never navigates it, tests its walls, or pays a cost tied to its properties. It functions as setting more than object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The woven hush is seeded early ("enveloped the village," "absorbed all sound"), recurs at midpoint ("had been his constant companion"), and lifts slightly at closure when "the first sound in decades echoed." It constrains the tutor by enforcing silence and stasis, shaping the story's atmosphere and the urgency of the four-minute lull. It does not, however, force a tactical choice or alter his decoding method.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The attribute "fidgets productively" is labeled in paragraph two and echoed three times across the story, but it never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The tutor's fingers "trembled" and "flew" during the tapestry work, yet the text does not show how fidgeting itself shapes his success or failure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Winnowing appears once in paragraph four as metaphor ("winnow the truth from fiction") and is echoed by "separating each thread" at paragraph nine. The thread-separation is the tutor's main action, but it is summarized rather than dramatized, and the outcome—reconciliation—does not depend on which threads he chose or discarded. Swappable with "discern" or "decode."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method of "decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border" is signaled early ("tapestry's frayed threads told stories") and executed at midpoint ("separating each thread…following the subtle patterns"). The final beat shows "the last frayed thread found its proper place," creating a direct link to closure. However, the mechanics remain vague—no wrong thread, no cost of error—so the method does not shape attempts or raise stakes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is anchored early (paragraph one) and its suspended inhabitants supply atmospheric pressure and the tutor's isolation. The four-minute lull is the enabling condition for all action. The setting directly shapes the dominant stake (freeing the villagers) and reappears at closure when time restarts. However, spatial choreography within the village is minimal; the tutor's location and movement remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the lull of distant thunder" is introduced in paragraph three and returns twice to mark the passage of time ("two minutes remained," "the distant thunder resumed"). It creates urgency in principle, yet the tutor completes his work without visible acceleration or sacrifice tied to the shrinking window. The clock is present but does not tighten a choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to forgive himself for past mistakes" is seeded early ("driven by a desperate need to forgive himself") and restated at closure ("he had only needed to forgive himself enough to reach for it"). It drives the tutor's goal, but no on-page choice dramatizes friction between self-forgiveness and pride, safety, or another want. The reconciliation is granted rather than earned through visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The tone phrase "fierce repose" appears once near the end and is echoed by "woven hush" and "meditative" earlier. The story maintains a contemplative, elevated register throughout, but the tone does not modulate under pressure—decoding threads and awaiting judgment receive the same stately cadence. The final image does not charge or reconfigure the tone; it simply continues it.</comment>
