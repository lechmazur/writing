<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arion remains a competent vessel with minimal internal contradiction; his discovery feels received rather than earned through struggle. The arrow-tip revelation arrives via convenient glow rather than through difficult choice. Interiority leans toward stock adventure-pilot reactions ("dread and wonder") without embodied contradictions that would make the stakes personal. The mission completion feels like task fulfillment rather than a transformation that forecloses a previous path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative window-dressing. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Arion receives visions, understands the arrow's purpose, returns home—lands on the page but the cost is abstract: he gains knowledge without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option. The broken-arrow reveal at midpoint shifts from ornament to plot key via convenient magic rather than earned causality, weakening the because/therefore chain at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The floating arches, inverted rivers, and gravitational reversal create vivid sensory anchors and constrain navigation choices throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across the inversion sequence. The First Arch's embedded crystals and the "gathering of echoes" charge the final-third setting. However, the orchard planet itself remains somewhat generic; specific tree species, soil textures, or micro-climate details that would make Verdantis irreplaceable are absent, limiting the score's reach into higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discover resilience source—is signaled early and pursued. The gravitational inversion provides escalating environmental pressure and the arrow-tip's glow introduces a mid-story complication. However, agency is passive: Arion steers and observes while visions deliver answers without a trade-off or difficult renunciation. No live option is visibly foreclosed; the mission succeeds without cost, capping escalation impact. One meaningful tightening occurs (navigating inverted rivers) but resolution arrives via revelation rather than protagonist sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—resilience, adaptation, survival—emerges organically from the inversion mechanics and plant evolution. The arrow-tip as "fragment of the original seed" ties concept to action. Yet the ending explains rather than images its answer: "knowledge that would transform their colony's agriculture forever" is told, not shown through a concrete choice or image. The "gathering of echoes" whispers secrets in expository summary, flattening what could have been a resonant visual moment. No moral complexity or counter-reading pressure tests the too-tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Arion; no head-hopping. Diction is clean and consistent, though leaning toward generic adventure register ("practiced precision," "otherworldly green light"). The phrase "whirling silence" recurs but feels more like prompt echo than organic voice signature. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he knew") appear but remain controlled. Perceptual signature is competent yet not distinctive; Arion's noticing patterns don't reveal character-specific bias beyond basic pilot competence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied syntax and no major loops or scaffolding. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance setting or action. Minor template cadence appears in the opening third ("His mission today was urgent," "The silence of the approaching hour whirled around him") and the phrase "whirling silence" recurs without evolving meaning, creating small tonal redundancy. Stock metaphors like "silver serpents" and "ancient resonance" add modest texture without muddle. No artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting deduction impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion mechanic and navigating-by-water-flow offer fresh genre synthesis. However, the core arc—pilot on mission receives visions, gains knowledge, returns home—follows a familiar template without transformation. The broken-arrow-tip's late reveal as magical plant-growth catalyst feels convenient rather than inevitable in hindsight. Emotional specificity and risk-taking are modest; Arion's journey reads as competent exploration rather than a bold synthesis that reweights the premise through lived cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; frames setup and closure. Arion's piloting decisions (steering into the river, navigating between arches) shape two middle beats. However, his role at closure is passive observer; the echoes deliver answers without requiring a difficult choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Functional but replaceable with another competent explorer archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced early as heirloom ornament, reappears at midpoint with glow that accelerates plant growth, and at closure as "fragment of the original seed" that explains resilience. Three beats; causal pressure moderate (enables understanding but not a constrained choice). Specificity strong (arrow-tip shape, glow, throbbing). Closure linkage present but the element explains rather than charges the final action. Swappability moderate; another artifact could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Setup delayed until final third when Arion searches for "a gathering of echoes." Development absent; no middle choice constrained by this concept. Payoff present: the echoes deliver visions and knowledge at closure. However, the gathering functions as information dump rather than tactical constraint or choice catalyst. Ornamental integration; the story could deliver visions through the First Arch crystals alone with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Introduced at midpoint via the arrow-tip's glow causing "nearby roots to thicken and strengthen almost visibly." Development weak: one beat of visible effect without altering Arion's tactics or creating cost. Payoff moderate: the trait explains historical adaptation at closure but does not constrain the ending action. Functional label-only use; the story does not dramatize a trade-off where accelerated growth enables or complicates a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Discovery frames the mission from the opening and structures the arc. The act of seeking drives navigation choices in the middle third and the closure delivers discovered knowledge. However, discovery is passive reception; Arion does not pursue competing hypotheses or sacrifice an option to learn. The action shapes pressure but remains swappable with "seek" or "investigate" without fundamental structural change. Two beats, closure linkage solid, causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled early: "the only way to navigate during the inversion was by following the water flow." Mechanics appear in a distinct middle beat: "Arion steered his vessel into the upward rush of the Silvergard River, navigating by water flow as his ancestors had taught him." This method constrains tactics and enables progress through the inversion. Specificity high; removing water-flow navigation would require reworking the inversion sequence. Closure participation indirect but the method's success enables arrival at the First Arch.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Present from the title and first paragraph. The floating arches supply spatial constraints (narrow passages), sensory detail (latticed shadows, singing rocks), and the First Arch is the closure destination whose crystals enable the vision sequence. The arches shape navigation tactics in at least two middle beats and charge the final image. Specificity strong; ordinary terrain would not create the same pressure or resonance. Irreplaceability high; orchard-planet-with-floating-arches is the story's DNA.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The Hour of Inversion is named early and structures the mission window. Time pressure implicit: gravity's reversal creates the environmental stakes and the final paragraph notes "gravity began to reset," framing a closing window. However, no on-page countdown or tactic adjustment driven by diminishing minutes; the sixty-minute limit is told but not tracked. Two beats (start of inversion, end of inversion) with moderate causal pressure. The timeframe enables the mission but does not tighten choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stated mission from paragraph three: "to discover the source of resilience." This frames the search and is satisfied at closure when Arion learns the arrow-tip's role. However, the motivation remains professional duty without personal friction or cost that tests want versus fear. Setup clear, development weak (no mid-story choice where resilience-seeking conflicts with safety), payoff solid but expository. Functional but not dramatized through contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrase "whirling silence" appears three times: opening setup, inversion peak, and through-passage moment. Tone aims for awe and danger but remains static; no modulation that reflects Arion's internal shift or pressure escalation. The final paragraph shifts to "familiar sounds" and "breathing easier," offering mild tonal contrast. However, "whirling silence" reads more as prompt echo than organic voice motif; removing it would not collapse the story's atmospheric coherence. Present but ornamental.</comment>
