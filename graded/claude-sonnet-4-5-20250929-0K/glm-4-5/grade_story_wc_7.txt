<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias's gift is told rather than dramatized through concrete choices under pressure. The "informally wise nature" reads as authorial label ("informally wise eyes crinkling") rather than emergent voice. Interior monologue relies on therapy-adjacent phrasing ("gift and a burden," "necessary cuts") without embodied contradiction or visible cost. The planting decision feels declarative rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation arrives cleanly (greenhouse, Elias, celestial night). The piece establishes a situational frame—planting under cosmic alignment—but no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; Elias intends to plant, walks through reflection, then plants. The closure (seed in soil, smile, collection of tools) offers Charged Poise in theory, but the cost is asserted ("something important had been accomplished") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. Under a Situational lens, the stance crystallization is weak; under Causal, linkage is missing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly sketched (cracked glass, groaning structure, decay coexisting with renewal). Sensory details anchor early and recur purposefully. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as backdrop and thematic mirror rather than pressure source. The celestial alignment remains atmospheric description without mechanical consequence. Micro-setting (soil, seed) touches the final image but does not force a trade-off, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planting the knowledge fruit seed as gentle rebellion—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page obstacle or cost appears; Elias prepares, reflects, and plants without friction. Pruning overgrown matter reads as symbolic preparation, not a choice that narrows options. The ending asserts transformation ("relationship with food was about to be transformed") without dramatizing a visible price paid or path foreclosed. Pressure remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme (connection vs. efficiency, beauty from ruins) is stated rather than emergent. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "wasn't that the human story, repeated in different forms throughout time?" Subtext is thin; the greenhouse-as-decay and seed-as-renewal operate as overt symbols without complication. The closing line ("the seed that might someday share that gift") telegraphs future meaning instead of reweighting prior material through a charged image. Thesis intrudes where earned resonance should land.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (memory-tasting, sensory acuity) but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with "informally wise" framing: "synaptic plasticity," "coexisting in perfect balance," "once-in-a-lifetime celestial alignment" read as authorial rather than Elias's mind under pressure. Dialogue to plants ("Haven't we had enough...?") carries subtext but remains isolated. Filter verbs ("could feel," "could taste") cluster without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraph 10 restates gift-and-burden, paragraph 22 echoes synaptic plasticity from 11, and paragraphs 9 and 23 both declare "create something beautiful from the ruins." Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs with identical "The [noun] [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors accumulate without fresh angle: "dust motes dancing," "spark of life," "gentle rebellion" (repeated thrice). Figurative density in the celestial-alignment beats blurs causality. Combined artifacts touch closure (final paragraph loops "gentle rebellion"), triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Chef-with-memory-tasting and knowledge-fruit-seed premise aligns closely with magical-realism templates (quest object, mystical inheritance, cosmic timing). The greenhouse-as-ruin and gentle-rebellion frame feel familiar without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Synaptic plasticity as mystical method reads as borrowed scientific vocabulary rather than integrated world logic. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the arc follows a predictable prepare-plant-smile sequence. Derivative premise penalty (−1.0) applies; no compensating ingenuity in execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Chef who can taste memories is introduced early (paragraph 1) and recurs in reflection (paragraphs 10, 17), but the gift does not drive an on-page choice or turn. Tasting is told ("could taste the memories that would eventually fruit") rather than dramatized in a beat that alters tactics. The ability remains ornamental description; swapping it for another sensory gift would not break the planting sequence. Functional but replaceable; late penalty (−0.2), ornamental use (−0.7), swappability (−0.6) applied.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Knowledge fruit seed appears early (paragraph 5), is handled in preparation (paragraph 13), planted (paragraph 16), and referenced at closure (paragraph 26). Three distinct beats plus closure participation. However, the seed's unique properties (bridging flavors and memories) do not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it could be swapped for any heirloom seed with minor edits. Causal pressure is minimal; the seed enables the stated goal without friction. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+0.9), minus swappability (−0.6) and ornamental handling (−0.5) net mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion is thematically announced (paragraphs 4, 14, 20) and recurs at closure (paragraph 25), but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The rebellion is asserted as concept ("gentle rebellion against industrial food") without dramatized friction or trade-off. No antagonist or obstacle tests the stance. The element remains thematic echo rather than pressure source. Early signal (+0.4), closure mention (+0.3), minus ornamental use (−0.8) and label-only treatment (−0.3) cap below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Informally wise is label-only (paragraphs 3, 24: "informally wise nature," "informally wise eyes") without constraining or enabling a choice. The trait does not alter speech, tactics, or worldview in a dramatized beat. Swappable with "quietly thoughtful" or "gently perceptive." Present but ornamental; label-only (−0.5), swappability (−0.6), no causal work applied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prune appears once (paragraph 13) as preparation for planting and recurs metaphorically (paragraph 14: pruning habits and relationships). The action does not drive a turn; it serves as symbolic parallel rather than plot pivot. Removing "prune" and using "clear the soil" would not alter the sequence. One beat involvement (+0.4), metaphorical reprise (+0.3), minus swappability (−0.6) and ornamental use (−0.5) land mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Synaptic plasticity is named twice (paragraphs 11, 22) as explanation for memory-tasting mechanics, but the method does not shape attempts or tactics on the page. The term appears as scientific decoration rather than constraint. Late first mention (paragraph 11, ~44% mark; −0.3), summary-only (−0.6), ornamental (−0.7), swappability (−0.5) applied.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse anchors setting from paragraph 1, recurs across beats (paragraphs 2, 15, 25), and frames the final image (paragraph 25: "settled into its usual state of various decay"). The structure supplies soil and cosmic light but does not constrain a choice or impose cost; any garden space would serve. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.0), minus swappability (−0.7) and no tactical constraint (−0.6) net mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Once-in-a-lifetime celestial alignment is introduced early (paragraph 2), peaks at planting (paragraphs 7, 15, 16), and shifts away post-plant (paragraph 21). The alignment creates atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock; Elias's actions are not visibly altered by urgency. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), closure participation (+0.4), minus ornamental use (−0.7) and no tactical tightening (−0.8) land below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To create something beautiful from the ruins is declared (paragraph 9), echoed (paragraph 23), and frames the final image (paragraph 24). The desire drives the planting but is not conflicted on the page; no friction between want and cost appears. The motivation remains told assertion rather than dramatized struggle. Early signal (+0.6), closure linkage (+0.8), minus told-only (−0.6) and no on-page friction (−0.5) net mid-5s.</comment>
