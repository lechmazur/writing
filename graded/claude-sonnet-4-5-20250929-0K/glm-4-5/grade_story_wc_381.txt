<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The solitary summoner remains abstract—a generic ritual performer without distinct flaws, contradictory impulses, or embodied stakes. Motivation is declared ("to hush a prophecy") but never dramatized through choice or cost; the crane and origami wing function as ornamental props rather than objects that reveal character under pressure. Internal experience is rendered through stock mystical language ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") that substitutes elevated diction for particular perception. No micro-choice forecloses a path; the summoner completes the ritual without visible trade-off or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~120 words, meeting the baseline test. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the summoner performs a ritual that builds through layered imagery until the origami crane is released. However, no causal because/therefore linkage narrows options—each sentence adds ornament without tightening pressure or foreclosing alternatives. The ending releases the crane "into harmless dissolution," but this decisive change lacks on-page cost; the prophecy simply vanishes without visible sacrifice or tactical price paid by the summoner.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and quiet brook are described vividly and anchor the scene spatially. Sensory detail trends visual and generic ("moonlight weaving silver," "stars reflecting in the brook") without POV-specific filtering or constraint on action. The origami wing glows and transforms, but these changes do not alter the summoner's tactical options or charge the closure image—props remain decorative. No environmental or tool detail constrains a choice or shapes the final beat, capping the score below the 9+ gate despite competent atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing a disruptive prophecy—is signaled early but never tested by reversal or cost. The summoner proceeds through the ritual without opposition, complication, or trade-off; each beat adds ornamental description rather than narrowing options. The accumulative lens requires a meaningful tightening or deepening that reweights the stake with visible cost; instead, the prophecy is absorbed and released "into harmless dissolution" without any on-page price or forfeited alternative. Agency is absent: the protagonist observes transformation rather than making a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme remains abstract and asserted rather than emerging from particulars: "tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic," and "smoothed hush" are repeated labels without concrete grounding in choice or image. The ending presents the crane floating away as a resolution, but the prophecy's hushing carries no felt consequence or non-literal answer to a dramatized question. No epiphany is earned through struggle; the summoner simply completes a task without cost or complexity. Motifs (origami, silence, flow) recur decoratively but do not constrain action or reweight meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic forces mingled freely," "tranquil blaze") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular perception. Perceptual signature is generic—repeated mystical phrasing ("amid whispered secrets," "smoothed hush") substitutes template language for a distinct narrative voice. Psychic distance remains consistent but lacks the specificity or rhythmic control that would charge peak moments; the prose reads as one continuous drone without modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "quiet brook" appears six times, "solitary summoner" four times, and "terrestrially cosmic" three times within ~730 words, often in identical syntactic slots. Sentences recycle stems ("The origami wing...," "The summoner...") and restate content without added pressure—e.g., paragraphs 4 and 18 both describe the "smoothed hush" spreading outward with near-identical phrasing. Stock metaphors ("moonlight weaving silver," "water flowing...like blood through veins") and elevated diction clashes ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially balanced energies") obscure rather than clarify. Filter-verb stacks ("sensed," "felt," "knew") dull immediacy in peak beats. Applying the artifact penalty pack (−1.4 baseline for spread, plus −0.3 for final-third presence) and paraphrase-loop deductions yields this score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—lone summoner performs ritual to contain prophecy—follows a familiar template without fresh angle or transformation through lived detail. The origami crane, quiet brook, and mystical ritual are stock fantasy elements deployed decoratively; no specific, non-obvious synthesis emerges. Emotional arc is absent (the summoner simply completes a task), and the prophecy's "disruptive power" is told rather than dramatized, making the stakes abstract. The story could be rewritten with different names and objects (candle instead of crane, spell instead of origami) without altering the emotional or thematic logic, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout but makes no choices that create turns—he observes and narrates the ritual's progression without agency. Setup is immediate; development is ornamental (he "sensed," "recalled," "knew"); closure shows the crane floating away, but the summoner does not act or decide, only watches. No cost is tied to his person; the ritual proceeds without trade-off. Late penalty (−0.5) and ornamental use (−1.0) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in setup (paragraph 2), development (paragraphs 7, 14, 19, 23), and closure (paragraphs 25–26), meeting all three gates. It glows, unfolds patterns, absorbs the prophecy, and reconstructs into a complete crane—four distinct beats. However, the wing's properties are asserted rather than demonstrated through constrained choice or visible cost; the summoner places it and it transforms automatically. Causal pressure is weak (the wing does not narrow options), and specificity is moderate (paper folding is central but could be replaced with another ritual object). Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, minus swappability −0.6 and ornamental use in middle beats −0.7 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" appears as a thematic phrase in paragraphs 9, 18, and the ending, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—it remains a label for tranquility rather than a method or constraint. Setup is late (~paragraph 9, second third), development is descriptive only, and closure mentions it in summary. No cost or choice is tied to this concept; it functions as atmosphere. Late appearance (−0.3), ornamental use (−1.0), and label-only treatment (−0.3) yield ~2.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears three times (paragraphs 4, 10, 24) as a descriptor for energy or haven but never constrains or enables action. It is a label-only attribute with no visible trade-off or tactical implication. Setup is early (~paragraph 4), but development and closure are ornamental mentions. Deductions: label-only (−0.3), ornamental use (−1.0), swappability (−0.7) = ~1.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Flow" appears throughout (paragraphs 6, 12, 19, 22, 27, 29) describing breath, transformation, water, and tranquility. Setup is early (paragraph 6), and the word recurs in the closure beat ("resulting flow of tranquility," "flowing silence"). However, "flow" is used generically—breath flows, water flows, energy flows—without a specific action that the protagonist performs to turn the plot. No single beat depends on this verb; it could be replaced with "move," "spread," or "shift" without structural loss. Swappability (−0.7) and ornamental overuse (−0.5) lower the score despite closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced in paragraph 5 and revisited in paragraphs 13 and 20, framing the summoner's method. It appears in setup and development, but its mechanics remain abstract—"charting the invisible landscape of quietude" is poetic rather than tactical. The method does not constrain choices or fail in a way that forces adjustment. Closure does not hinge on it; the crane absorbs the prophecy regardless of whether silence was mapped. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, minus summary-only use (−0.7) and swappability (−0.6) = ~3.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is anchored in setup (paragraphs 1, 4) and mentioned in development and closure (paragraphs 10, 26, 29). The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure choices—no environmental constraint (weather, access, social intrusion) alters the summoner's tactics. The brook's sound harmonizes with his pulse (paragraph 16), but this is metaphorical rather than causal. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.7, minus ornamental use (−0.8) and lack of constraint (−0.5) = ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears in paragraphs 8, 17, and 26, functioning as a mood phrase rather than a timeframe. There is no ticking clock, deadline, or temporal pressure that tightens decisions. The ritual proceeds at leisure through thirty paragraphs without urgency or time-driven stakes. The phrase is ornamental and does not affect pacing or tactics. Late first use (~paragraph 8), ornamental treatment (−1.0), and absence of constraint (−0.6) yield ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To hush a prophecy spoken in code" is stated in paragraph 3 and referenced throughout (paragraphs 8, 13, 21, 23, 28). Setup is early; development reiterates the goal; closure shows the prophecy hushed. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction or cost—the summoner never faces a choice between hushing the prophecy and another desire. No visible trade-off or sacrifice is required to achieve the goal. Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure +1.2, minus told-only treatment (−0.8) and lack of cost (−0.7) = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears in paragraphs 15 and 27, labeling a tonal contradiction (calm intensity). The tone is static—serene mysticism—from start to finish without modulation under pressure. No moment of doubt, error, or urgency disrupts the placid ritual; emotional flatness pervades. The phrase itself is an oxymoron asserted rather than embodied through rhythm or image. Late first appearance (~paragraph 15), static mood (−0.8), label-only use (−0.3), and failure to charge the final image (−0.5) = ~3.2.</comment>
