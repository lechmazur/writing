<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The guide's "historically oriented ache" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Khira's defiance shows stronger embodiment ("gnarled fingers," "fierce concentration"), but her motivation remains surface-level—the bread remembers because she says so, not through on-page struggle. The guide's interior lacks genuine conflict; his motivations align too neatly with his actions. No visible cost forecloses a path for either character.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: "who" (museum guide) and "where" (grotto city) emerge gradually, "when" (after beekeeper's last visit) arrives late, triggering the −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The closure—bread and lens triggering the thaw—arrives on the page, but the causal chain is weak: the emerald lens reveals "dormant life force" and "cultural memory" through assertion rather than earned discovery. The lens's mechanics (why it attunes to bee energies, how it directs starter) are convenience shortcuts. Lens ambiguity past midpoint (blending mystical, cultural, and physical modes without a taught pattern) warrants −0.4; the dominant mode at closure reads Causal but rests on unearned magic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall, bioluminescent fungi, and baker's hollow provide vivid sensory anchors. The emerald lens charges the final image by revealing "movement… like slow roots finding light" in the dough, and the thaw's "distant cracking" ties environment to closure. However, orientation debt (applied in Q2) caps this category at 7.0, preventing higher scores despite the lens's late functional role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page choice forces the guide to trade one art for another or sacrifice a tool. The mid-story tightening (guide offers the lens) is a gift, not a costly decision. The thaw begins because the lens "reveals" latent energy, a coincidental resolution that undercuts protagonist agency. Khira's singing and the spreading warmth register as atmospheric payoff rather than escalation driven by her renunciation or the guide's forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—cultural memory persisting through craft—emerges concretely through the shaped initials and Khira's song. The emerald lens returns with reweighted meaning (from observation tool to catalyst), satisfying a basic reprise. However, the final paragraph's "proof that even displaced, they could shape their identity anew" tips into thesis statement, and the guide's satisfaction ("a spark igniting the long darkness") feels unearned given the lack of on-page struggle. No genuine ambiguity or counter-reading; the ending resolves into a tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third around the guide. His perceptual signature—"historically oriented," emerald-tinted observations—is consistent but generic. Khira's dialogue ("The bread remembers") carries subtext, yet her voice and the guide's converge in elevated register ("決心" appears untranslated, likely an artifact). Free indirect style is clean, but the guide's interior lacks rhythmic variation under pressure; syntactic patterns flatten during the climactic bread-shaping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Opening and closing images are vivid, but mid-story beats suffer from paraphrase loops: "the hive-mind consciousness… fading, leaving the displaced persons adrift" is immediately restated as "their unique expressions fraying at the edges." Template cadence appears in the guide's movement ("He moved past them… towards a cavern section") and Khira's shaping sequence. Purple clusters slow peak moments: "sweet and cloying as rotting rosewater" and "emerald light flaring briefly within the lens as the cultural bound within the bread reawakened" stack modifiers without clarity gain. Baseline −0.8 for loops and template stems, escalated to −1.0 for metaphor muddle in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The grotto-behind-waterfall and bee-maintained hive-mind offer fresh angles on cultural displacement, and the emerald lens as diagnostic/catalyst tool shows ingenuity. However, the core arc—outsider helps community rediscover latent power—is familiar, and the story does not transform it through genuine moral calculus or irreversible cost. The shaped-initial custom is specific but remains ornamental; Khira's "K" for her lost daughter is mentioned once without complicating her choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The guide observes, moves through the city, and offers the lens (~50% mark), which enables Khira's success. He does not face a choice that alters his tactics or forecloses a path; his role is facilitator. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but his agency is minimal. Swappable with any knowledgeable outsider bearing a useful tool.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The emerald opera glass lens appears early (opening paragraph), is used at ~60% to reveal dough's "slow roots," and charges the final image ("emerald light flaring"). Three-beat involvement and closure linkage earn solid credit, but the lens's mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated—its attunement to bee energies is told, not shown through prior failure or constraint. High irreplaceability but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Displaced persons" frames the opening stakes and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("the displaced persons pausing, heads tilting"). It shapes the guide's motivation but does not constrain his choices on the page; no tension between displacement and return, no cost of remaining versus leaving. Present in setup and closure mention, functional in one beat (Khira's daughter "lost to the surface world's indifference"), but middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Historically oriented" is applied as a label three times ("his voice was gentle, historically oriented as always") without altering the guide's on-page actions. It does not constrain his lens-sharing or compel a tradeoff between preserving the past and enabling change. Setup and thematic echo only; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Thaw" is signaled early (late seasonal ritual), used as metaphor ("thawing the ice of cultural death"), and literalized in the climax ("a distant cracking echoed—not stone, but ice"). It redefines the city's fate and charges the final image. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability, but the guide's actions trigger it through convenience (lens magic) rather than earned causality, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The custom of baking bread shaped like initials is introduced at ~40% ("baking bread shaped like initials, was more than sustenance; it was identity"), demonstrated with Khira's "K," and becomes the vehicle for the thaw. Present in middle and closure, with specific mechanics (kneading, shaping, directing lens focus). However, it is not signaled in the opening third, and its mechanics are asserted rather than tested under constraint. Late setup caps the score near 6.5 despite strong closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall anchors all action and supplies the baker's hollow, bioluminescent fungi, and damp walls. It pressures the community (isolation, dependence on bees) and the thaw's "distant cracking" ties setting to closure. Setup, middle constraints, and closure participation all present. However, spatial choreography is vague—distances, layout, and the waterfall's relationship to the core remain unclear—limiting functional pressure. Mid-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After the beekeeper's last visit" is mentioned early and again at ~30% ("months ago, marked a significant change"), establishing causality for the fading hive-mind. The thaw's lateness ("its absence gnawing at the city's vitality") tightens urgency. However, no on-page clock tracks elapsed time during the bread-shaping, and the guide's arrival timing is unexplained. Setup and one middle beat; closure references "months" but does not use the timeframe to narrow tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To rescue the dying arts" is stated early ("a profound, historically oriented ache to rescue the dying arts") and motivates the guide's lens-sharing. Closure references the motivation ("rescue the dying arts before the last threads snapped?"), but the guide never chooses between competing arts or sacrifices a resource to preserve one over another. Told motivation with one enabling action; no on-page friction between desire and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Rosewater dread" appears early ("the air thick with the rosewater dread of a culture slowly eroding"), recurs mid-story ("Despair, sweet and cloying as rotting rosewater"), and is pierced at closure ("the rosewater dread momentarily pierced by her defiance," "pierced by the vivid green of resilience"). The tone modulates from pervasive to contested, supporting the thaw. However, the metaphor is густо applied without variation, and "sweet decay" versus "vivid green" tips into thesis rather than image. Functional reprise with moderate closure charge.</comment>
