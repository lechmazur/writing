<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is defined primarily through label-only traits ("committed," "kindly decisive") and summary rather than embodied contradiction. The "forgiveness" backstory is told but never dramatizes cost or conflict—we're informed she forgave betrayal "decades ago" yet no micro-choice shows what that price looks like in the present. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("quest for contentment," "embrace of all experiences") and therapy-speak ("cycle of rebirth") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final "transformation" is asserted in summary ("as someone who had become the source herself") without a dramatized renunciation or foreclosure that makes a before/after legible with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative deepening is clearly taught by midpoint; the piece drifts between lyric description and summary assertion. Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, but the closure unit fails: Elara's final "understanding" is narrated in abstract summary ("not in one place but in embracing all parts") without an on-page decision, renunciation, or image that reweights prior material with legible cost. The protagonist descends "transformed" but no specific action or forfeiture on the page makes the transformation concrete. Applying Orientation waiver (anchors present), but closure remains invalid under all three definitions (DC/RR/CR).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The grotto is vividly rendered with specific images (clouds as solid ground, scallop-shell light patterns, umbral space), and the cedar tree provides spatial anchoring. However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara moves through the space without friction, and the environment serves as backdrop rather than crucible. The hairpin and grotto touch the final image, but their properties do not shape the outcome. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but ornamental. Applying the 9+ gate failure: no constraint on choice, no charge to final image via environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("find the source of contentment") is signaled early but remains abstract and static—no live options narrow, no tightening forecloses a path. The climb and grotto exploration proceed without reversal or complication; Elara encounters no resistance, doubt, or trade-off. The ending asserts transformation ("she finally understood," "journey complete") but no on-page choice or visible price dramatizes the shift. Escalation is missing under any lens: no because/therefore narrowing (causal), no density break or cadence shift that reweights cost (accumulative), no stance crystallization under coherent pressure (situational).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (cycle of rebirth, forgiveness as preparation) is stated explicitly rather than emergent from particulars: "destruction was merely preparation for rebirth," "the cycle continues yet never repeats." The final paragraph moralizes ("not as someone who had found the source...but as someone who had become the source herself") instead of offering a resonant image. The antique hairpin and scallop motifs recur but do not accumulate new meaning or constrain choice—they are decorative rather than weight-bearing. Thematic Echo penalty applies: protagonist articulates the story's thesis in prompt-like language in the final section (−0.5).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and the narrative voice carries a distinct texture ("vineyard hush," "umbral grotto"). However, diction frequently drifts into abstract, elevated register inconsistent with immediate perception under pressure: "a living testament to the rebirth it had witnessed," "the wisdom of the grotto," "all parts of the cycle." Purposeful elision is absent—facts are withheld (what "unforgivable betrayal"? what actual decision does she make?) without dramatized friction or payoff. No dialogue present to evaluate. Perceptual signature exists but is generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: multiple sentences restate "contentment/source/cycle/rebirth" without advancing pressure ("source of contentment," "embrace of all experiences as part of a larger pattern," "not in one place but in embracing all parts"). Template cadence: runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "she [verb]" stems across many lines. Stock metaphors: "quiet dawn," "threads of fate," "scalloped against the clouds." Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("millennia," "testament," "suspended place") clashes with embodied urgency. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("someone who had become the source herself"). Applying −1.2 in Q7 for loop/template/stock cluster, plus −0.5 additional for artifacts in final third. Disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Premise (mystical caretaker climbs sacred tree to spiritual grotto seeking enlightenment) follows a recognizable template without fresh synthesis: the journey-to-wisdom frame, the passed-down artifact, the "cycle of rebirth" concept are generic fantasy-spiritual conventions. The hairpin, cedar, grotto, and forgiveness backstory could be swapped for synonyms (amulet, mountain, temple, redemption) with minimal structural change. Emotional specificity is absent—"contentment" and "understanding" remain abstractions. The transformation is asserted rather than earned through a non-obvious turn. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 for unmodified template without lived-in transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is on the page throughout and makes the climb, but her choices do not create key turns—she moves through the grotto without obstacle or trade-off. The "decision" to understand is narrated in summary, not shown via a choice that alters tactics. Present in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) but causally passive. Mid-band ceiling applies: no causal pressure visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hairpin appears in multiple beats: holds hair during ascent, traced at temple mid-climb, removed in central chamber, glows to reveal etchings, implied in final "scalloped" image. Early signal present. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—its use is descriptive. Closure linkage is weak: mentioned but does not shape the final image's charge. Two-gate model (setup + payoff reprise) allows ~6.0 ceiling; swappability and ornamental use lower score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The cycle of rebirth is named repeatedly ("cycle continues yet never repeats," "rebirth it had witnessed," "part of the cycle") but remains thematic echo rather than stake-shaping force. It does not change Elara's options or tactics on the page—no choice hinges on understanding rebirth mechanics. Present in setup (mother's words) and ending (summary assertion) but not developed in middle action. Missing middle gate caps at 3.4; ornamental use and label-only treatment lower further.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Kindly decisive" appears as a label ("The kindly decisive nature," "Decades of tending this space had taught her kindness, but also decisiveness") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. No moment dramatizes a trade-off between kindness and decisiveness. Label-only mention without causal work. Present in setup and ending summary but missing middle development; cap 3.4, label penalty −0.3, ornamental −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Scallop" appears three times: moonlight patterns "like scallop shells," scallop designs in grotto walls, movements "scalloped against the clouds." All mentions are metaphoric description without action or choice. The term is interchangeable with any decorative pattern. No gate is met (not present as an action that drives a turn). Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Climbing trees to think is mentioned in setup ("scaled the thousand-year-old cedar...to think better") and recalled in the central chamber ("climbing trees to think better had always been her path"), but the mechanics do not matter—the climb itself is unobstructed and does not shape attempts or generate friction. Present in two gates (setup, middle reflection) but swappable with any ascent. Missing closure participation caps at 2.8; lyric reprise adds +0.3, functional presence +0.4, but swappability and lack of causal pressure limit upside.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The umbral grotto is richly described and occupies the second half of the story. It provides the destination but does not pressure choices—Elara moves through it without obstacle, and no environmental feature alters her tactics or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Present in middle and ending (two gates), but postcard-description dominates. Setup gate weak (only named at midpoint). Two-gate model allows ~6.0 ceiling; ornamental use and missing causal constraint subtract.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After forgiving the unforgivable" frames the timeframe in the opening line and is revisited in backstory ("Yet forgiveness came like a quiet dawn"). However, the temporal distance does not tighten decisions—no live clock or urgency shapes Elara's choices in the present scene. The frame is static context rather than a pressure that alters moves. Present in setup and middle reflection (two gates) but missing closure participation; cap 2.8, lyric callback +0.3, thematic framing +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The desire to find contentment is stated early ("What was the source of true peace she sought") and recurs in the central chamber and ending. However, it remains told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between want and cost is visible on the page. The resolution is summarized ("she finally understood") without an on-page moment where options narrow or a price is paid. Present in all three gates but lacks causal friction; swappability (could be "peace," "wisdom," "purpose") and summary-only treatment limit score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Vineyard hush" appears twice as a phrase and the story maintains a quiet, contemplative tone throughout. However, tone is static—no modulation under pressure, no cadence shift that charges the final image. The mood does not tighten or break as stakes would escalate. Present in setup and ending but ornamental; single static mood caps mid-band per scoring guidance. Missing development gate (no tonal shift in middle action) caps at 3.4; lyric reprise +0.4.</comment>
