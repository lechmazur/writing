<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The guardian remains a cipher throughout, defined only by repeated abstract labels ("spiralingly calm," "silent empathy") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The visitor carries a "half-spoken secret" that is never dramatized or tested; it functions as a decorative stake with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interior access is absent—no misbeliefs, no hierarchy of values made legible through choice. The ending nod and departure leave no trace of transformation, only assertion that the secret was "somehow transformed."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates descriptive patterns (shutters, light, darkness) but never tightens or deepens the visitor's stake in a way that narrows options or changes knowledge. The "half-spoken secret" is mentioned repeatedly but remains abstract; no on-page reversal or choice alters what either character can or will do. The ending offers a gesture (the nod, the departure) without visible cost—the secret remains unspoken and its transformation is told, not shown. Orientation is adequate (who/where by ~120 words), preventing a deeper penalty, but the closure unit lacks the felt or conceptual price required for Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rainwater, and shutters are vividly rendered and recur throughout, creating a coherent sensory frame. The dental mirror is handled physically (catching light, redirecting it) and the shutters constrain the guardian's method, pushing this toward the 7.0 threshold. However, the environment never forces a trade-off or alters a tactic in response to pressure; it remains a backdrop for the guardian's unopposed work. Spatial choreography is clean, and the micro-setting (dock, water, shutters) charges the final image without requiring broader occupational systems at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching darkness the value of stars—is abstract and never tested by opposition or scarcity. The visitor's approach suggests potential conflict, but no reversal or tightening occurs; the guardian continues the shutter work uninterrupted, and the visitor simply watches, then leaves. No on-page choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The "stillwater tension" is asserted but not dramatized through escalation or a turn that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or cadence should shift to reweight the stake; here the pattern remains static.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme—light, shadow, empathy, unspoken understanding—emerges from imagery and motifs rather than direct statement, which is a strength. However, the ending does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question; instead it tells us the secret was "transformed" and the visitor "understood," bypassing the particular cost or realization that would reweight prior material. The repeating phrases ("teach darkness the value of stars," "silent empathy," "half-spoken secret") function as thematic labels rather than earned insights arising from specific struggle. The final image (the guardian moving on, patterns left behind) gestures toward resonance but lacks the concrete price or contradiction that would make the theme land with undeniable force.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited stance anchored to the guardian's perspective, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable, and the perceptual filter (light, pattern, calm) is coherent. However, the narrative voice leans heavily on abstract diction ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "silent empathy") and repeats these labels without embodying them through distinct sensory or cognitive choices. The visitor's interiority is glimpsed only in summary ("the burden of the secret," "shoulders relaxed"), not through idiosyncratic perception. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply. The voice reads as purposeful but not character-particular; it could belong to any contemplative observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates: "Each step was measured, each movement flowing"; "Opening some, closing others, adjusting angles"; "Cobalt mixed with gold and silver"; "trust, history, perhaps even the fate of the canal." Paraphrase loops recur—paragraphs 7, 13, 22, and 25 all restate "teaching darkness the value of stars" without advancing pressure. The phrases "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "half-spoken secret," and "silent empathy" each appear 3+ times, often in similar syntactic slots, creating synonym churn and conceptual redundancy. Peak beats (the visitor's approach, the final shutter click) are narrated in the same elevated register, dulling urgency. These artifacts pervade the piece, including the closure paragraph, triggering the Q7 artifact cap and global 9+ disqualification. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere rather than advance situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The core premise—a guardian using light and shutters to communicate empathy—offers a fresh image, but the execution relies on familiar beats: a mysterious figure, an approaching stranger with a secret, wordless understanding, departure without resolution. The "dental mirror" detail is specific but underused; it could be any reflective tool. The transformation test fails: swap the cobalt dock for any waterfront, the shutters for any adjustable surface, and the emotional arc (such as it is) remains unchanged. The ending's resonance is asserted ("the secret… somehow transformed") rather than earned through a non-obvious choice or realization. The piece avoids cliché but does not take the risk needed to make its synthesis feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The guardian is present throughout and performs the central action (adjusting shutters), satisfying the setup and development gates. However, the character makes no key choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The final nod is a gesture, not a decision with cost. The guardian's work proceeds uninterrupted from start to finish; the visitor's presence does not force adaptation. The character is functionally a conduit for the stated concept rather than an agent whose choices drive turns. Closure participation is present (the guardian completes the pattern and moves on) but passive. Late first action (weaving begins paragraph 5, past the first third) and swappability (any contemplative figure could perform this role) further limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in paragraph 3, is used to catch and redirect light in paragraphs 8 and 15, and "went dark" in the final paragraph—satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. It enables the guardian's method (redirecting starlight and city lights) and is mentioned across multiple beats. However, its specific properties (a *dental* mirror vs. any small mirror) are never leveraged; it could be replaced with a compact mirror or shard of glass without altering the story. No visible cost or constraint is tied to the object (e.g., it never breaks, is lost, or fails when needed). The final mention ("went dark") is atmospheric rather than causally active. The object is functional but replaceable, capping the score in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Silent empathy is named repeatedly (paragraphs 13, 22, 25, 28) and frames the guardian's approach, satisfying setup and thematic presence. It appears in the ending ("silent empathy that had passed between darkness and starlight"), meeting the payoff gate. However, it is never dramatized as a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The visitor's "understanding" is told, not shown through a shift in behavior or realization that alters tactics. The concept functions as a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping force. The guardian's silent work continues unchanged whether the visitor is present or not, and no moment hinges on empathy succeeding or failing. The concept is logically consistent but ornamental, trending toward the replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Spiralingly calm is mentioned in paragraph 2 ("spiralingly calm"), paragraph 17 ("the guardian's calm never wavered, spiraling outward"), and implied in the final beats. It satisfies setup and is thematically echoed at closure. However, it is never shown to constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The guardian remains serene throughout; no moment tests whether maintaining calm forecloses another option (e.g., speed, intensity, connection). The attribute is label-only, not embodied through micro-choices or trade-offs. It could be swapped for "unshakable composure" or "effortless grace" without structural change. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Weave is introduced in paragraph 5 ("they began to weave—not with thread, but with light, shadow, and the carefully manipulated shutters") and recurs throughout as the guardian's central activity (paragraphs 6, 12, 18, 24, 27). The action satisfies setup, development, and payoff gates. It shapes the method (creating patterns with shutters) and is causally tied to the concept (teaching darkness). However, no major turn or escalation hinges on weaving—the guardian simply continues from start to finish without adaptation, failure, or breakthrough. The action is specific and consistent but does not redefine options or impose a felt cost. It drives the plot forward but is not indispensable to closure in a way that another purposeful, patient craft could not replicate. Mid-band functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters is introduced in paragraph 5, demonstrated across paragraphs 6, 12, 18, 24, and 29, and is causally tied to the guardian's goal. The method is signaled early and recurs in multiple beats, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. The shutters' mechanics (opening, closing, adjusting angles) are described, and the resulting patterns ("stars forming and dissolving," "spiral galaxy") charge the final image. However, the method is never tested or constrained—no shutter jams, no light source fails, no pattern proves insufficient. The mechanics matter to the atmosphere but not to a turn or trade-off. The method is functional and specific but does not narrow options or impose cost, placing it in the mid-band of causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is established in paragraph 1 and recurs throughout (paragraphs 6, 14, 15, 19, 22, 27, 29). The wet surface and reflective planks enable the guardian's light-pattern work, and the canal's stillwater frames the tone. The setting satisfies setup, development, and payoff gates and is causally linked to the method (the dock's surface displays the patterns). The rain-wet environment provides a resource (reflective surface) that the guardian uses, pushing this toward tactical relevance. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or limit an option—the guardian's work proceeds unimpeded regardless of conditions. Micro-setting (dock, shutters, water) charges the final image but does not constrain. Solid functional integration with a minor tactical link.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is metaphorical and never operationalized as a live clock or deadline. The phrase appears in paragraphs 10, 16, 22, 25, and 27 but functions as a thematic label rather than a temporal constraint. No moment suggests urgency tied to time running out or the secret's imminent revelation altering stakes. The guardian works at a measured pace from night to dawn with no acceleration or forced choice due to time pressure. The visitor's approach and departure are undated, and the "half-spoken secret" remains static throughout. The timeframe is present in the text but ornamental, not shaping decisions or tactics. Largely decorative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach darkness the value of stars" is stated in paragraph 7 and recurs in paragraphs 17, 23, 27, and 28. It frames the guardian's goal and is present at setup, development, and closure. However, it is never shown to conflict with another want or cost. The guardian pursues this goal without friction, sacrifice, or trade-off—no moment where teaching darkness requires forgoing rest, safety, or connection. The motivation is told and reiterated but not dramatized through a choice that narrows options. It functions as a mission statement rather than a contested desire with visible stakes. Functional presence but replaceable with any patient, contemplative aim.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stillwater tension is named in paragraphs 9 and 19 and implied throughout via the canal's "calm surface… belying the currents underneath" and the visitor's restrained approach. The tone is coherent across beats and modulates subtly (the visitor's step forward then back, the shoulders relaxing). It appears in the ending thematically (the tension between spoken and unspoken). The tone supports the concept and is consistent with the guardian's spiraling calm. However, it does not intensify or shift decisively to charge the final image with undeniable pressure. The stillwater metaphor remains static rather than breaking or crystallizing. The tone is purposeful and coherent but does not escalate or reweight the closure moment, landing in the mid-functional band.</comment>
