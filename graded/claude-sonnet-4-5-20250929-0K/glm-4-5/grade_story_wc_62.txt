<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivations are signaled early (collective grief, family ritual, mentor guidance) but his interior remains abstract—"fiercely meditative focus" and "thundering calm" are labels without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final carving is an outcome stated rather than a choice forged under competing pressures; no on-page moment shows him sacrificing one value for another. Embodied emotion is thin: dust motes, rattling panes, and butterflies function as atmospheric tokens rather than perceptual filters tied to his grief. The spectral mentor is cited repeatedly but never constrains a present decision or generates friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—"greenhouse," "gravestone carver," and "spectral mentor" appear early but spatial and temporal anchors remain vague past the opening third, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The piece attempts an Accumulative lens (butterfly migration, poem ritual, ribbon as motif) but the accumulation never tightens: Elias walks, unspools ribbon, returns, and carves without a reversal or deepening that narrows options. The closure unit—villagers viewing the completed monument—is summarized ("drawn by rumors," "touched by something vast") rather than dramatized, and no felt cost is legible on the page. The inferred lens does not cohere at the ending, and the final paragraph delivers theme-claim rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse at dusk is vivid and recurring (ancient glass, rattling panes, dim light, butterflies), and the ribbon's tactile presence (unspooling, knotting, draped across stone) anchors several beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice: Elias moves freely between greenhouse and garden, and no spatial or material limit alters his tactics. The final image places the monument "in the greenhouse center" but the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; other senses (temperature, stone texture under hands) are underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs: Elias prepares, walks, recalls, carves, and succeeds without a complication that forces a trade-off. The spectral mentor approves, butterflies guide, and villagers arrive—all support rather than opposition. "Days passed with the measured pace" compresses the carving into summary, and the monument's completion is told ("rumors of its power") rather than shown with a visible cost. Pressure remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme (collective grief, transformation through shared experience) is stated repeatedly in the mentor's lines and the closing paragraph rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The woven ribbon and butterfly migration are symbolic tokens whose meaning is announced ("mirrored the collective grief," "what we carry together") rather than discovered through conflict. The final image—villagers in "thundering calm"—echoes the opening phrase without reweighting it through scene pressure. One thematic strength: the recurring "thundering calm" phrase attempts to crystallize a paradox, though it lacks embodied grounding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but elevated throughout ("fiercely meditative," "unsettled spirits," "amber wings catching the last light"), creating a lyric register that distances the reader from Elias's immediate experience. Filter verbs ("feeling the weight," "listening to the thundering calm") cluster in reflective passages. Perceptual signature is generic: dust motes, rattling panes, and butterflies recur without character-specific bias. The mentor's lines are italicized memory rather than dialogue, so voice distinction is not tested. One typo: "Thecompleted" (missing space).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Template cadence and paraphrase loops appear frequently: "The spectral mentor had taught him…" followed by "The spectral mentorship had begun…"; "thundering calm" recurs four times without evolving meaning; "woven ribbon" appears in nearly identical constructions across paragraphs. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "dust motes dancing above his workbench like unsettled spirits," "dusk fell in soft layers," "amber wings catching the last light." Register drift into abstract diction ("collective grief," "approach to life's inevitable losses") clashes with the tactile opening. The typo "Thecompleted" and the missing article ("to honor not a single life") are copy errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—carver learns from spectral mentor to honor collective grief through stone—follows familiar mentor-journey templates without a fresh inflection. The greenhouse, ribbon, poems, and butterflies are thematically convergent tokens rather than a synthesis that generates friction. Emotional specificity is thin: Elias's childhood grief is told ("unable to understand why his grandmother's death left him both empty and overflowing") in generic terms. The transformation test fails: the arc could run unchanged with a different craft, mentor, or symbol. One modest strength: the idea of carving a monument to collective grief rather than an individual is conceptually interesting but underdeveloped on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his occupation frames the story, but his on-page choices are minimal: he prepares, walks, recalls, and carves. The carving itself is summarized ("Days passed… Elias began carving his most ambitious grave marker yet") rather than shown as a decision under pressure. No turn is driven by his agency; the mentor approves, butterflies guide, and the monument simply materializes. Late-appearing resolution (villagers view the completed work) is told, not dramatized. Present but swappable; another craftsperson could execute the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The ribbon is introduced early (first paragraph) and appears in multiple beats: unspooled beside chisels, used to mark the garden path, knotted with poem stanzas, draped across the stone. However, its mechanics are vague—how does tying knots relate to poems or carving?—and it does not constrain a choice. The ribbon's "pattern of intertwined vines" is described but never leveraged. It recurs at closure ("woven ribbon roll now nearly depleted") but as scenery rather than a charged image. Functional across beats but replaceable with any marking tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The spectral mentor is introduced early and recurs in memory throughout. The mentor's words ("Grief is not yours alone to bear," "what we carry together") frame Elias's goal, and the mentor "observes from the corner" in the final carving scene. However, the mentor never constrains a present choice or generates conflict; all guidance is retrospective and supportive. No on-page moment shows Elias resisting, misunderstanding, or paying a cost for the mentorship. Present in setup and closure but ornamental—equivalent to recalled advice from any source.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" appears in the opening line ("worked with fiercely meditative focus") and is referenced once more ("fiercely meditative state deepened"). It functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains action: we are told Elias is focused, but no scene shows him choosing meditation over speed, or intensity over comfort, with visible cost. The attribute does not alter tactics or generate friction. Present as description, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias retraces the mentor's path through the garden in one beat, unspooling ribbon and encountering butterflies. The action is setup for the final carving but does not drive a reversal or decision. Removing it would compress the timeline but not break the story's logic; the carving could proceed without the garden walk. The ribbon left behind is mentioned at closure ("nearly depleted") but its trail is not used or revisited. Present and functional in one beat, but swappable with any preparatory ritual.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The poem-trading custom is mentioned in three beats: Elias prepares the ritual, opens the heirloom book, and ties knots "exchanged in his nightly poem ritual with family." However, no poem is quoted or enacted on the page, and the custom does not shape a choice or tactic. The knots on the ribbon are said to represent stanzas, but the link is asserted rather than dramatized. At closure, "each verse somehow finding its way into the stone" is told, not shown. Present but ornamental; the carving could succeed without it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse is signaled in the opening line and recurs throughout: ancient glass panes, dim light, rattling with thunder, filled with migrating butterflies, and the site of the final monument. It anchors all major beats (carving, ritual, walk, final viewing). However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias moves freely, and the structure functions as atmosphere rather than pressure. At closure, the greenhouse holds the monument and villagers, charging the final image. Setup, development, and payoff present; essential to setting but not to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The butterfly migration is introduced early ("Tonight marked the beginning of butterfly migration season") and recurs: monarchs brush Elias's face, cluster around the ribbon, fill the greenhouse, and frame the closing image. The timeframe is named but not tracked—no clock, deadline, or window tightens decisions. "Days passed with the measured pace of butterfly migration" compresses carving into summary. The migration provides symbolic resonance (journey across generations) but does not alter tactics. Present across beats but not a pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The desire to discover the shape of collective grief is stated in the opening ("the weight of each life he rendered in stone") and the closing paragraph ("discovered the shape of collective grief"). The mentor's teaching ("Grief is not yours alone to bear") frames the motivation, and the final monument embodies the answer. However, the motivation is never dramatized as conflicted: Elias does not weigh collective versus individual, or struggle with doubt. The goal is declared, pursued without friction, and achieved off-page. Setup and payoff present; middle development (a choice driven by this want against another cost) is missing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" appears in four beats: opening ("thundering calm that settled over the greenhouse"), mid-walk ("feeling the thunder beneath the calm"), the bench ("the thunder and the calm"), and closure ("stood in thundering calm before it"). The phrase is vivid but static—its meaning does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through new context. Tone remains lyric and elevated throughout without a shift that reweights the stake. Present and recurring, but the repetition does not deepen; it functions as a refrain rather than a developing motif.</comment>
