<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The historian remains largely observational and label-driven throughout. Interiority consists of stock phrases ("sensitively perceptive nature," "motivation burned brighter") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final smile and sense of purpose read as declarative summary rather than earned through dramatized cost. No agency shapes the ending—the historian simply records and feels purpose, with no path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure effect: the historian discovers connections, records them, and smiles, but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing occurs. The final lines offer vague hope ("Perhaps someday…dragons would fly again") without reweighting prior material or making cost undeniable. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when clarifies only after multiple abstract opening lines. The piece operates in summary mode—connections "emerge" and are "realized" off-stage—without a visible or felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The silo library is anchored early with sensory specificity (curved walls, bronze quiet, metal bones). Setting details recur (hearth, upper level, deepest chamber) and the "bronze quiet" modulates atmosphere across beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard description. The tapestry and diaries are handled, meeting the micro-setting option, but spatial choreography stays vague—no use of proximity or access pressures the historian's moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting stories before they fade—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the historian moves smoothly from silo to tapestry to diaries to recording without friction. The "connection" between tapestry and axis "emerges" passively, with no agency or tradeoff. Escalation consists of repeated assertions ("bronze quiet deepened," "motivation burned brighter") rather than causal pressure. No cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—dreams, displaced axis, mythic severance—is repeatedly stated rather than earned through particulars. The final lines offer explicit thesis: "stories continued to live," "dreams would return," "connection to something eternal." No resonant image reweights prior material; instead, moralizing summary ("honoring the stories," "sense of purpose that transcended") replaces scene pressure. The dragons function as symbolic convenience, introduced late without prior constraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Diction elevates at key moments ("bronze quality, heavy and resonant," "cosmic forces that had maintained the world's balance") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-particular. Repeated phrase stems ("The odd historian," "The bronze quiet") create template cadence. No dialogue to assess. The perceptual signature—detecting "faintest whispers"—is asserted but not dramatized through specific, idiosyncratic noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "bronze quiet" recurs decoratively in five paragraphs; "sensitively perceptive" restated multiple times; "fragment of a medieval tapestry showing dragons" repeated verbatim. Template stems: "The odd historian…" opens four beats; "The bronze quiet…" opens three. Figurative language ("like moth wings," "like worn fabric," "like stars at dawn") clusters without pattern-teaching. Final-third artifacts ("sense of purpose that transcended") dull the ending and disallow 9+ globally. Information density is low—most sentences restate atmosphere or motivation without advancing action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Premise—post-dream archivist in a silo library—reads as template mashup (The Road meets Name of the Rose). The displaced axis and dragons are introduced as abstract lore without transformation through character choice or world logic. Emotional beats rely on stock phrases ("reverence of a pilgrim," "cosmic shift"). No fresh inflection: the historian collects, discovers connections, and smiles in a sequence that could occur unchanged in any post-apocalyptic archive setting. The safety middle: solemn, atmospheric, resolved without risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The odd historian is present throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics. They move, detect, probe, record—all observational. The final smile is a reaction, not a choice that forecloses a path. No causal turn traces to the historian's agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Fragment of tapestry appears in three beats: discovery, connection to axis, preservation. It is handled and described but never used—no constraint on choice, no evolving function. The tapestry's meaning is told ("representations of cosmic forces") rather than dramatized. Present in closure paragraph but ornamentally, not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Displaced axis is mentioned in seven paragraphs as backstory and theme ("when the axis first began its slow displacement," "displaced axis had caused not just the end of dreaming"). It explains the world state but never shapes an on-page tactic or choice. The historian's work proceeds identically whether the axis is displaced or not.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Sensitively perceptive is a label repeated in three paragraphs ("sensitively perceptive nature allowed them to detect," "sensitively perceptive mind caught patterns"). No on-page action demonstrates the trait through tradeoff or cost—no missed detail, no sensory overload, no friction. It functions as authorial assertion rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Probe appears in three beats: "probe the tapestry's meaning," "probed deeper into the diaries," "probe the depths of what had been lost." The action is generic and largely interchangeable with "examine" or "study." No turn hinges on the mechanics of probing; it advances discovery passively without altering tactics or options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries in a fireplace appear in the second act and supply the connection between tapestry and axis. They are discovered, extracted, and read across multiple beats. The fire damage is mentioned ("pages fragile as moth wings and darkened by flame") but does not constrain reading or force a tradeoff. The method shapes one middle beat but could be replaced with any damaged text.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Reclaimed silo library frames the entire piece, anchored early with sensory and structural detail (curved walls, deepest chamber, upper level hearth, metal bones). The setting recurs across beats and charges the final image ("bronze quiet of the silo"). However, it never pressures a choice—no access constraint, no hostile environment, no resource limit. It enriches atmosphere but remains postcard rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>After the last human dream is dreamt anchors the world state in the opening and recurs in six paragraphs. It establishes tone and backstory but exerts no temporal pressure—no urgency, no clock, no progression. The historian's work proceeds at the same pace regardless of when the last dream was dreamt. Time is setting, not stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>To collect the stories walls have heard is stated as motivation in paragraph four and restated in five later beats. It drives the historian's presence but faces no friction or competing desire. The motivation "burned brighter" when the connection emerges, but this is told rather than shown through a difficult choice or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Bronze quiet recurs in ten paragraphs, establishing a consistent atmospheric texture ("heavy and resonant," "pressing against the eardrums," "seemed to deepen," "seemed to hum"). Tone modulates slightly with discovery but remains uniform—no sharp break, no pressure-driven shift. It charges the final image coherently and integrates across beats, though it does not constrain choice.</comment>
