<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are declared early ("patch holes in the soul") but her interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak ("fierce gentleness," "recklessness," "dusky resolve") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The protagonist moves through the catacomb with confidence, but there's no genuine struggle or blind spot that compounds before the memory-trammeling act. The final act of capturing the memory feels ceremonial rather than driven by a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost; we see ritual competence, not a trade-off that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who (Elara), where (catacomb orchard), and what (trammel a wandering memory) within the first third. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: patterns of roots, bones, light, and the burned card build density toward the final absorption of the memory. However, closure lands as a ritual completion without clear before/after cost—the card absorbs the sorrow, balance is restored, and Elara continues her vigil unchanged. The final image recycles the opening posture rather than reweighting it, so the Resonant Reconfiguration test is not satisfied with felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail: roots snaking between bones, fruit trees growing from ancestral remains, half-lit corridors. Spatial choreography is clean—Elara moves from alcove to the oldest tree at the heart—and the setting's life-from-death duality charges the atmosphere. The setting participates in the final beat (the orchard "breathes," trees "rustle in agreement"), lending weight to the closure moment and satisfying the Q3 9+ gate partially, though the choice itself remains externalized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to trammel an escaped memory and restore balance—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the memory "fought, desperate to remain free," but Elara's traced symbols and "fierce gentleness" subdue it without a visible price or tactical shift. The resolution feels preordained by her ritual competence rather than earned through a decision under pressure that narrows options. Agency appears as execution of a known method rather than a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (life sustaining death, renewal through sacrifice, meaning-making in darkness) emerges organically from the setting and Elara's task rather than direct statement. The burned tarot card—"The Tower once, symbol of upheaval; now, charred but intact, it represented something different"—offers a concrete motif that shifts meaning, and the final image of the card absorbing pain echoes the premise. However, the ending restates the opening stance ("fiercely gentle, recklessly hopeful, utterly resolved") rather than offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material, so the 9+ test is not met.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; focalization remains with Elara throughout. The narrative voice carries a distinct elevated diction ("dusky resolve," "trammel," "inlaying meaning") that reads as voice-motivated rather than register drift, and perceptual signature is consistent (she notices roots, patterns, dust motes). However, the prose leans on abstract labels ("fierce gentleness," "reckless idealist") at emotional peaks rather than embodied perception under pressure, and dialogue ("Fear not," "Rest now") feels ceremonial rather than goal-driven or subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries high information density with vivid concrete detail. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "patch holes in the soul, hers and others'" restates the mission introduced earlier; "fierce gentleness" and variants recur without added pressure; the final paragraph recycles the opening posture with near-identical phrasing ("reckless idealist," "fiercely gentle, recklessly hopeful, utterly resolved"). Template cadence is minimal, but the cumulative scaffold weakens momentum in the closure third, triggering penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting (roots intertwining with bones, life from death) offers a fresh synthesis, and the burned tarot card as ritual tool is specific. However, the core plot—lone healer in mystical underground realm performs ritual to capture wandering sorrow—follows a familiar template without transformation through non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that stakes a singular artistic stance. The "patch holes in the soul" mission and Elara's archetypal healer role read as median choices rather than bold risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "reckless idealist" in paragraph 3 and again near the end. Her choices (kneeling, placing the card, tracing symbols, murmuring reassurance) demonstrate ritual competence but not recklessness or idealism that constrains or enables action with cost. The trait is present functionally but swappable; removing "reckless idealist" would not alter the plot beats or closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The burned tarot card appears in beat 2 (paragraph 7: "hummed in her pocket"), beat 3 (paragraph 16: removed and placed on stone), and the closure (paragraphs 24–25: absorbs the memory). It is handled across multiple beats and its mechanics (pulsing, channeling power, absorbing pain) evolve. However, the card does not constrain a choice or introduce cost; it functions as a ritual tool whose operation is assured. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, supporting mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Bartered destinies" is mentioned once in paragraph 9 ("she had traded her old life for this purpose") and echoed in paragraph 21 ("when destinies had been bartered—hers for this ability to mend"). The concept frames backstory but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; the actual task (trammeling a memory) proceeds without reference to the barter's constraints or cost. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" is labeled in paragraph 5, recurs in paragraph 18 ("her gentleness cloaking her in protection"), and again in paragraph 22 ("fierce gentleness of Elara's purpose"). The trait describes her demeanor when addressing the memory but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible tradeoff. It is present functionally (the memory "recognizes" it) but could be replaced with a similar soothing-authority trait without altering plot beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Trammel" is signaled in paragraph 13 ("she would trammel a particular memory"), enacted in paragraphs 18–23 (raising hands, tracing symbols, the memory stilling and drifting), and completed at closure (paragraph 24: "the patch was complete"). The action drives the middle and ending beats and is causally central. However, the mechanics are ceremonial; the protagonist's competence is never in doubt, so the action does not redefine options or introduce friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is introduced in paragraph 8 ("finding significance in fallen petals, in root patterns, in dust motes") and appears again in paragraph 19 ("inlaying meaning into each gesture, each breath"). It describes Elara's perceptual habit but does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The method is present functionally in the ritual but swappable with "channeling power" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is established in paragraph 1, supplies resources (alcove with fruit trees, oldest tree with white roots, flat stone), and participates in the closure (paragraph 26: "the catacomb orchard seemed to breathe…countless bones and roots sighing"). The setting's life-from-death duality charges the final image and provides the physical stage for the ritual. While it does not constrain a choice with visible cost, it shapes tactics (Elara navigates by touch, places the card among roots) and is indispensable to tone and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Within the glow of half-lit corridors" describes lighting and atmosphere (paragraphs 4, 14, 27) but does not function as a timeframe or tighten decisions. No clock or urgency shapes the ritual; Elara moves at her own pace and completes the task without temporal pressure. Present as setting detail, absent as time constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To patch holes in the soul" is stated explicitly in paragraph 10, echoed in paragraph 24 ("the patch was complete"), and dramatized through the ritual (paragraphs 18–24). The desire drives the plot and is present across beats, but it is pursued with assured competence rather than conflicted choices. Friction between want and cost is told (paragraph 9: "traded her old life") rather than shown on the page, so the motivation is functional but not deeply tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" is invoked in paragraph 27 and echoed in descriptions of "dusky corridors" (paragraph 4) and "half-lit" spaces throughout. Tone remains coherent—solemn, measured, tinged with darkness—and modulates slightly when the memory fights (paragraph 20), but the final image recycles the opening mood rather than charging it with new weight. Cohesive but static; does not crescendo or shift decisively at closure.</comment>
