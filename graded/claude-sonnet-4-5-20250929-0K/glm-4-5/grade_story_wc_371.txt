<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eliza's interior voice carries some specificity ("creeping normality noticer"), but her choices lack visible cost or contradiction. The revelation about the bakers arrives via reading a letter rather than earned discovery through on-page friction. "Tenuous absolution settling over her own guilt" reads as label-only therapy-speak without embodied cost or dramatized struggle in the present moment. The final gesture of leaving bread is gestural rather than a choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The story opens with vague temporal anchor ("After the birds flew south") and deferred spatial grounding; who, where, and when cohere only after ~150 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). Closure lands as a reflective summary ("found her absolution... one small revelation at a time") rather than a decisive on-page change or charged final image with felt cost. The lens reads hybrid-accumulative but drifts into summary mode at the end, weakening cost legibility. The letter revelation is recounted, not dramatized, undercutting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard and tea house supply vivid sensory anchors (wisteria, tin roof, flagstones) and the guerrilla garden constrains Eliza's method across beats. However, spatial choreography inside the tea house remains generic ("low wooden table"), and the setting does not pressure the climactic choice—reading the letter could occur anywhere. The recurring bread object charges atmosphere but does not alter tactics at closure, keeping Q3 in mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the bakery mystery—is signaled early, but escalation is weak: Eliza moves from exploration to reading a letter without meaningful opposition or narrowing options. The resolution (bakers vanished to protect a girl) arrives via exposition rather than protagonist agency, and the "tenuous absolution" feels declared rather than earned through on-page cost. No reversal or tightening choice forecloses a live path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring images (bread, vanished bakery, guerrilla gardening) and the motif of "sacred in the ordinary" accrues modest density. However, the ending shifts into explicit thematic summary ("patient uncovering of truth, one small revelation at a time") rather than letting the final image do non-literal work. The bread's shift in meaning ("like forgiveness meant to be shared") gestures toward resonance but remains somewhat generic. Subtext in gesture and silence is present but underdeveloped at peak beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("heuristically gentle," "creeping normality noticer") that colors perception consistently. However, diction occasionally drifts into prompt-language ("tenuous absolution," "uncovering of truth") without full dramatization, and the whispered line "I'm here to uncloak the truth" reads staged. POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance compresses appropriately in the tea house scene, and perceptual signature (noticing decay, lost things) shapes what Eliza observes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose carries moderate clarity but suffers from paraphrase loops ("After the birds flew south" opens and closes; "creeping normality noticer" and "her particular sensitivity to lost things" restate the same trait). Template cadence appears in repeated "After..." and "The..." openers across paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("testament to nature's persistence," "hidden in plain sight") and elevated diction ("tenuous absolution," "guerrilla gardening") cluster in reflective beats, creating minor register drift. Figurative density is moderate but not overloaded. Artifact penalty (−0.6) applied for loops and template stems touching multiple paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" archetype and guerrilla gardening method offer modest specificity, but the core mystery (bakery vanishes to protect a child) follows a familiar humanitarian-secret template without transformation. The tea house setting and bread motif provide texture but do not produce a non-obvious synthesis. The ending's tidy emotional resolution (absolution through revelation) avoids bold risk, settling into the safety middle. No fresh inflection that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eliza's trait as a "creeping normality noticer" is labeled early and colors her perceptual filter (noticing decay, small changes). However, it does not constrain a key on-page choice or force a visible cost; observation remains passive description rather than decision-making pressure. The trait enables her to find the letters but does not narrow options at closure. Present in setup and payoff but replaceable in function.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bread appears in three beats: gift receipt (setup), tea house use (middle), and final leaving (payoff). It shifts meaning from memory to "forgiveness meant to be shared," reweighting symbolically at closure. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or impose visible cost; Eliza could have reached the same emotional resolution without it. Causal pressure is weak but reprise is purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly near the end and frames the emotional arc thematically, but it does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. The concept is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices or visible cost. Present in payoff but ornamental in execution, functioning more as thematic label than causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is labeled in the second paragraph and described as guiding Eliza's movement through the courtyard, but it does not enable or constrain a key choice with visible cost. The trait colors her approach generically without forcing a tradeoff or altering the outcome. Functional but swappable for any similar patience-adjacent descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is whispered aloud in the tea house and frames her stated goal, signaling intent at setup. However, the actual revelation (reading the letter) is passive reception rather than active uncovering, and the verb does not drive a major turn or redefine options. The action could be replaced with "reveal" or "discover" without structural impact. Present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is described in two beats (courtyard plantings, rain renewing the garden) and signals Eliza's method of "bringing life back to neglected spaces." It provides thematic texture and echoes her approach to the mystery, but it does not mechanically enable the climax or impose a constraint on her final choice. Present in setup and payoff with modest causal linkage to her philosophy, but the mystery resolution does not depend on it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tea house in the overgrown palace courtyard anchors two key beats (exploration discovery, final letter reading) and provides the spatial frame for closure. The wisteria curtain and tin roof add sensory specificity. However, the tea house does not supply a unique resource or constraint that alters the outcome; the letter could be read elsewhere. Strong setup and payoff presence with atmospheric charge, but swappable in function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the birds flew south" frames the opening and closing, establishing seasonal context (autumn into winter). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose urgency; Eliza's actions unfold at her own pace without temporal pressure. The phrase functions as lyric bookend rather than live clock. Present in setup and payoff but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To find the sacred in the ordinary" is stated explicitly and colors Eliza's perceptual filter and choice to persist when others lose interest. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. It shapes her general approach but does not force a specific tradeoff at closure. Present across beats but under-pressured.</comment>
