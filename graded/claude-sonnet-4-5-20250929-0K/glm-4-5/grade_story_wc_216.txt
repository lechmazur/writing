<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her "rediscovery" of the capsule's messages reads as convenient revelation without prior struggle or misbelief to overcome. The final smile and comfort feel unearned—no visible cost accompanies her understanding, and her journey from confusion to mastery happens off-page in summary ("spent days," "began to understand"). Interiority relies on abstract claims ("weight of her responsibility") rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No meaningful closure unit lands on the page. The story offers thematic arrival ("found her place in the tapestry") without a decisive change, visible cost, or stakes reconfiguration. The Orientation Test penalty applies: who/where/when anchors arrive but "borrowed-time timekeeper" and "after the Great Reckoning" remain abstract past 120 words without concrete grounding. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural in intent, but no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake—Elara's understanding deepens in summary rather than through on-page pressure. The fragment warming in her palm is gestural, not a felt cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo returns across beats and charges the final image through its glowing walls, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice or charging closure. However, spatial choreography remains vague (spiral staircase, "base," edge of settlements) and the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than tactical constraint. "Washed-out sky," "long shadows that seemed to bend," and the silo's temporal energy are vivid but not filtered through urgent POV priorities—they read as tourist catalog rather than lived pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. No on-page reversal narrows Elara's options; her discoveries accumulate without friction. The "suddenly timeless" suspension freezes the world but resolves without trade-off, and her embedding of messages is declared rather than shown altering tactics under constraint. Agency is observational (studying, feeling, realizing) rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The escalation from fragment study to message embedding to "finding her place" is a thematic deepening told in summary, not a pressure tightening driven by protagonist decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme—time as tapestry, not linearity—emerges through the fragment and capsule but arrives via direct statement rather than image or contradiction: "Time was not linear...but a tapestry of moments." The garage-sale-as-cipher concept is clever but remains ornamental; the embedded wisdom ("Measurements are relative, trust your senses") reads as fortune-cookie platitudes rather than earned insight. The final paragraph moralizes openly ("no longer a mystery but a comfort, a guide, and a friend"), replacing scene pressure with summary. No ambiguity or counter-reading survives the tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is stable third-limited with consistent diction, but perceptual signature is generic: Elara "traces," "examines," "feels," and "realizes" without character-specific idiom or bias shaping what she notices. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to freeze," "as if acknowledging") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The prose shifts into elevated register ("temporal resonance," "infinite possibilities," "constraints of measured time") that exceeds a lived-in POV lexicon. No dialogue appears; internal voice lacks rhythmic modulation under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "understand the texture of time passing" repeats across paragraphs; "borrowed-time timekeeper" appears in opener, midpoint, and close without reweighting. Template cadence dominates: "She was becoming...," "She was not merely...," "She knew there would be..." in the final third. Stock metaphors ("beacon against the washed-out sky," "key turns," "tapestry") lack fresh synthesis. The final paragraph is a scaffold summary that recaps theme and stake rather than dramatizing closure. Artifacts touch the ending, triggering the Q7 disallow-9+ rule and cap at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—post-Reckoning timekeeper decoding messages in mundane descriptions—is conceptually interesting but undercut by execution that reads like a writing-prompt response. The garage-sale cipher, cremation-urn fragment, and emerald silo feel checklist-assembled rather than organically synthesized. Emotional beats are generic (heart racing, smile at sunset) and the arc from mystery to mastery follows a familiar template without transformation. The piece hedges risk by withholding specifics about the Reckoning and Elara's actual struggles, retreating to safe abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but her choices are observational (studying, tracing, cross-referencing) rather than decisional. The key turn—embedding her own messages—is declared in summary without on-page tactical shift or cost. She does not create turns; she receives revelations.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cremation urn fragment appears in three beats (discovery, examination during suspension, final warming acknowledgment) and its symbols drive Elara's decoding work. However, its use remains static—she holds, examines, feels—without evolving function or visible trade-off. The warming at the end is gestural rather than causally charged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule frames the premise, supplies the messages Elara decodes, and shapes her understanding across multiple beats. It appears early and its "leaking moments" and fractured chronology constrain her method. The capsule is present at closure ("her teacher") but does not drive the final image's charge—Elara's stance shift happens in summary.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" enables the message revelation but functions as a one-beat convenience: the world freezes, she sees hidden text, the effect ends without cost or tactical consequence. It does not constrain later action or recur with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Rediscover" labels the key beat (finding the embedded messages) but the action is passive revelation rather than driven search. It could be replaced with "notice" or "decode" without structural loss. The rediscovery does not trace to prior causality or force a subsequent trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The garage-sale embedding method is signaled at midpoint and explained through examples, but its mechanics never constrain an on-page choice. Elara's own embedding is summarized in one sentence ("she began to embed her own messages") without showing the attempt, challenge, or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is named in the opening line and returns at closure, framing the story spatially. Its glowing walls and spiral staircase supply atmosphere, but the silo does not pressure a choice—Elara moves freely within it without spatial constraint altering tactics. The setting's temporal energy is atmospheric rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After numbers changed meaning" anchors the post-Reckoning world and explains Elara's role, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. "Years," "days," "one morning" pass without urgency. No live clock or deadline alters her tactics; time is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to understand the texture of time passing" is stated in paragraph one and restated at closure, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. Her motivation drives exploration but faces no friction—she seeks, finds, and shares without trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The tone of "anticipated mysteries" is signaled through "greatest discovery," "hidden," "secrets," and "anticipated mysteries had not disappointed," maintaining coherence. However, the tone remains static—wonder without modulation through doubt or fear—and does not charge the final image, which resolves to comfort rather than sustained mystery.</comment>
