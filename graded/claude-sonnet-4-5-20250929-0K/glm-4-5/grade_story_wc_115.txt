<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation ("to find the weight of a swallowed truth") remains abstract throughout, never dramatized through concrete choices with visible cost. His "religiously skeptical nature" is stated but never constrains an action; he surrenders to drowsy alertness and visions without resistance. The final insight—"some truths carry weight precisely because they remain unspoken"—arrives as label-speak epiphany rather than through embodied struggle. Interior states are asserted ("his heart pounding") but lack the contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure that would earn the character's arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Marcus is and why he's in this specific tunnel remain vague past 120 words, triggering the −0.3 penalty. The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via the "some truths... remain unspoken" realization, but no on-page cost is visible—Marcus walks away "lighter," contradicting the weight premise without foreclosing a path or paying a price. The radio confession and valve-wheel visions feel coincidental rather than causally linked to Marcus's choices, and the lens (attempted Accumulative/Textural) never coheres because the ending reverses rather than deepens prior material. No meaningful tightening narrows options before the stated epiphany.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel and valve wheel supply concrete anchors, and the tunnel's "oppressive darkness" and "damp air" ground the scene. The valve wheel is handled twice (knelt to examine, then clutched warm) and charged at the ending, allowing micro-setting credit. However, spatial choreography lacks clarity—Marcus moves "forward," kneels, stands, walks back without dimensional grounding—and the tunnel never constrains a choice or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to find the weight of a swallowed truth") is signaled but never tightens into a legible trade-off or forecloses an option with on-page cost. Marcus passively receives the radio confession and visions; no reversal narrows his choices. The ending grants him understanding and relief ("felt lighter") without dramatizing what he gave up or risked, undercutting escalation entirely. Coincidence (the radio broadcast) solves the mystery rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary—"some truths carry weight precisely because they remain unspoken"—that replaces scene pressure with a stated moral, triggering the −0.5 penalty for explicit moralizing. The "factory ghost shift" and "swallowed truth" motifs are introduced late and never constrain prior choices, reading as ornamental rather than emergent from concrete conflict. The ending offers a neat resolution (Marcus "felt lighter") that contradicts the weight premise without earned ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and Marcus's perceptual signature (drawn to "whispers of the past") is present but generic. The radio dialogue feels staged for exposition rather than natural speech, and the psychic's line ("Sometimes the heaviest secrets...") reads as thematic ventriloquism. Diction occasionally drifts into essay register ("surrendering to the drowsy alertness," "state of mind that allowed him to see beyond the surface") without clear voice motivation, and interiority relies on stock phrases ("his heart pounding against his ribs").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and thematic restatement pervade the final two paragraphs: "swallowed truth" appears three times with synonym churn ("secrets that need to be spoken," "truths that refuse to stay buried," "his own swallowed truths"). Template cadence runs across multiple sentences in the opening ("adjusted," "cutting," "formed," "moved") and ending. The final paragraph summarizes the entire arc in abstract terms rather than advancing through image or action, stalling closure momentum. Filter-verb stacks ("he'd learned," "he felt," "he realized") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The abandoned-mill explorer premise and psychic-radio device echo familiar urban-explorer and paranormal-investigation templates without transformation. The "factory ghost shift" and "swallowed truth" metaphors remain abstract, never grounded in specific occupational detail or lived consequences. The turn—understanding that silence can be meaningful—arrives through stated epiphany rather than earned synthesis, and the ending's relief contradicts the weight premise without offering a non-obvious angle. Risk-averse choices (passive visions, convenient radio confession) replace bold structural or perspectival invention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Marcus is labeled "reckless" but behaves passively, receiving visions and radio confessions rather than making risky choices. His exploration triggers no on-page consequence or trade-off; he enters, listens, and leaves unscathed. Present in all three gates but swappable for any curious protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel is handled in two beats (knelt to examine, clutched warm) and returns at the ending, where it "felt cool now, its secrets released." Early signal and lyric reprise reweight the stake minimally, but the object does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—Marcus could complete the same arc holding any artifact. Specificity (beaded brass surface) does not translate to causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "factory ghost shift" is summarized late (final third) as machines operating without human hands and a metaphor for unspoken truths, but it never alters Marcus's options or tactics on the page. Ornamental use only; closure occurs without this concept shaping the decision or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is stated once but never constrains an action—Marcus surrenders immediately to visions and supernatural interpretation without resistance or visible trade-off. Label-only trait with no cost or tension.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears in one beat (Marcus appraising phenomena by interpreting radio calls) but the action is passive observation, not a choice that narrows options. The ending's understanding does not trace causally to appraisal; coincidental radio content delivers the insight. Swappable with "listen" or "witness."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The method (interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics) is signaled early and present at the closure beat, but Marcus does not interpret—he hears one confession that conveniently solves his mystery. The mechanics of interpretation never matter; any broadcast would serve. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is introduced early and frames the action, but it supplies atmosphere without constraining Marcus's choices or altering tactics. He moves forward, kneels, and exits without spatial pressure or resource limitation. Present in all three gates but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.0</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush that follows a sudden confession" appears mid-story for one beat (Marcus freezes after the radio confession) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Time pressure is absent; Marcus can process visions and walk out at leisure. Missing setup and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" is stated early and frames the arc, but it remains abstract—no on-page friction between this want and competing costs. The ending grants understanding without forcing Marcus to choose what to sacrifice or speak. Functional signal but told-only desire with no dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is named twice and described as a "state of mind" that allows Marcus to see beyond surfaces, but the tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Static mood label rather than rhythmic or sensory coherence that evolves through beats.</comment>
