<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Ethan is defined by labels ("meticulous," "analytically artistic") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His transformation from route mapper to truth-seeker proceeds without visible internal conflict or cost—he accepts the phantom punch and his new calling with "trembling certainty" but no dramatized struggle. The final paragraphs summarize his future purpose in abstract terms ("unravel the mysteries that prevented humanity from understanding itself") without showing what he forfeits or how his old analytical nature resists this metaphysical leap. Embodied emotion is absent; we're told he feels things shift but never see him wrestle with doubt or make a micro-choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the first few paragraphs, so orientation debt does not apply. However, the closure unit lacks on-page cost: Ethan emerges "changed" and smiling, armed with knowledge, but no visible price is paid—he loses no capability, relationship, or prior identity trait in a legible way. The narrative summarizes his future ("each evening… he would return") rather than dramatizing a decisive change or renunciation. Under a Causal lens (the piece attempts because/therefore linkage: finding the box → entering the vault → understanding his purpose), the final turn is asserted rather than earned by a choice that narrows options. The ending reads as a mission statement, not a felt transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "starlit vault in mist" and "fortress of unspoken truths" are evocative but remain postcard description without constraining choice or altering tactics. Ethan walks through the space, notes constellations and crystalline structures, but never uses the environment's features to solve a problem or face a trade-off. Spatial choreography is vague—cracks form arrows, mist coalesces into emotions, yet we never track his body's position or the vault's physical limits. The phantom punch and the cracks guide him passively; the setting decorates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling mysteries / finding the fortress—is declared but never tested by an on-page dilemma or reversal. Ethan follows the cracks without obstacle; no choice forces a trade-off between his analytical nature and the metaphysical realm. The narrative asserts escalation ("the further he ventured, the clearer his motivation became") but no narrowing of options or loss occurs. Agency is passive: he is "summoned," "challenged," "chosen"—the environment acts upon him rather than his decisions driving turns. The resolution is a summary of future intent, not an earned shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated in the final paragraphs: "he was meant to find this extraordinary calling," "his purpose: to unravel the mysteries that prevented humanity from understanding itself." These are thesis statements, not emergent particulars. The phantom punch and the vault function as allegorical props (truth-seeking, hidden knowledge) without grounding in concrete human struggle. No particular image reweights prior material; instead, the ending iterates the same abstract mission in slightly varied phrasing. The hour that "divides bad habits and new starts" is named repeatedly but never dramatized as a moment of personal sacrifice or insight earned through specific loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains third-limited throughout with no head-hopping, and the "analytically artistic" framing attempts a distinct perceptual lens. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("闻所未闻 doorway," "metaphysical realms," "encrypted light") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, especially when Ethan's profession is mapping physical routes. Sentence stems recur: "The phantom ticket punch…" opens multiple beats without variation. Interior access is shallow—thought is often summarized ("he realized," "he knew") rather than shown through perception shifts under pressure. No dialogue is present to assess naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "The phantom ticket punch grew warmer… vibrating with a purpose" is immediately echoed by "with trembling certainty, he followed the pattern"; "his analytically artistic mind" appears verbatim in early and late paragraphs; the final five paragraphs repeat the mission statement in synonym cycles ("unravel mysteries," "truths he would gently bring to light," "extraordinary calling," "fortress of unspoken truths"). Template cadence runs throughout ("As if summoned…," "As Ethan approached…," "As the vault dissolved…"). Figurative language crowds some beats without clarity: "geometric symphonies," "dissonant harmony that called to him," "fortress of unspoken truths" are stacked metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. The −0.6 to −1.4 artifact penalty applies, and these patterns touch the closure, triggering the 9+ disqualification and high-band cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—a mapper discovers a supernatural object that grants access to hidden truths—follows a template hero's-journey structure without fresh inflection. The phantom punch, starlit vault, and fortress are genre furniture (portal fantasy / chosen-one motif) deployed without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "analytically artistic" trait is label-only and does not generate specific choices or voice texture. The ending's mission statement ("he was meant to find this extraordinary calling") confirms archetypal convenience rather than risk or surprise. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 within Q8 for close template adherence without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Ethan's profession as "meticulous route mapper" is mentioned early (setup gate met) and returns in the final line ("one mapped path at a time"), satisfying a lyric reprise. However, his mapping skill does not constrain or enable a middle choice—he follows the cracks passively rather than deploying his analytical toolkit to navigate the vault. No on-page decision traces to his route-mapping expertise; the trait is ornamental. Two gates (setup + payoff) met but mid-development absent; lyric reprise reweights minimally. Base ~5.0, minus swappability (−0.6) and summary-only use (−0.5), plus early signal (+0.3): 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phantom train ticket punch appears early (embedded in the wall, emits a chime, grows warm, vibrates, projects a beam at the fortress). Setup gate met. It enables one middle beat: the beam translates the fortress walls into symbols. Payoff gate met: it integrates with his hand at the end and is named in the closing vision. However, swappability is high—any magical decoder device would serve the same function. Cost connection is absent; possessing the punch grants only benefit, no tradeoff. Base ~5.0, plus early signal (+0.5) and two beats (+0.9), minus swappability (−0.7) and no cost (−0.6), minus summary-only integration at closure (−0.3): 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The concept "unraveling mysteries" is named early and recurs throughout, shaping the declared stake (finding the fortress of truths) and the final mission. Setup and payoff gates met. However, no middle choice is constrained by this concept—Ethan follows arrows without puzzle-solving or hypothesis-testing on the page. The mysteries are abstract ("unspoken truths," "landscapes of human secrets") rather than specific enigmas he solves. Base ~5.0, plus early signal (+0.6), closure linkage (+0.8), minus ornamental middle development (−0.6) and swappability (−0.4): 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The attribute "analytically artistic" is label-only; it never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Ethan's "mind" is said to transform journeys into "geometric symphonies" and to note how mist coalesces into emotions, but these observations do not alter his tactics or force a tradeoff between analysis and intuition. Setup gate met (early mention), but development and payoff gates missed—no middle choice or closure moment hinges on this trait. Base ~3.0, plus early signal (+0.3), minus label-only use (−0.5): 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The action "dare" is named once in the middle ("each step forward was a dare") and again near the end ("the dare had been accepted"). Setup gate missed (not present in first third), development gate weak (the dare is described, not dramatized as a risky choice), payoff gate met (the final paragraph confirms acceptance). No major turn traces to this action; Ethan's acceptance is told rather than shown through a high-stakes decision. Base ~3.0, plus closure linkage (+0.7), minus late first appearance (−0.4), ornamental use (−0.6), summary-only (−0.5): cap 3.0 (late arrival resolving without creating problem), round down 4.1 → 4.1 within allowed band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The method "cracks in pavement forming arrows" appears early (after he grasps the punch) and guides him through the vault, then forms "one final arrow" pointing to the surface. Setup and payoff gates met. Mid-development: the cracks resolve into "increasingly intricate pathways" and lead to the central chamber. However, the mechanics are passive—Ethan follows without deploying skill or facing ambiguity. Base ~5.0, plus early signal (+0.5) and two beats (+0.9), minus passive following (−0.6) and swappability (−0.5) and no cost (−0.6): 4.6 (introduced after ~15%, just past 40% mark if we count the vault entry, apply late cap 4.6).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "starlit vault in mist" is the primary setting after the tunnel. Setup gate met (materializes early). Mid-development: Ethan moves through it, observing constellations and the crystalline fortress. Payoff gate met: it flickers and dissolves as he leaves. However, the vault never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters his tactics—he walks freely, guided by cracks. Base ~5.0, plus early signal (+0.5) and closure linkage (+0.7), minus postcard description (−0.8) and no constraint on choice (−0.7) and swappability (−0.6): 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "the hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is named multiple times and tied to the vault's appearance and dissolution. Setup and payoff gates met. However, the hour is metaphorical and untimed—no clock tightens decisions; Ethan explores without urgency or deadline. The phrase functions as thematic decoration rather than a mechanical constraint. Base ~3.0, plus early signal (+0.5) and closure linkage (+0.7), minus vague tracking (−0.5) and ornamental use (−0.6) and swappability (−0.4): 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the fortress of unspoken truths" is declared early ("the further he ventured, the clearer his motivation became") and drives the final mission statement. Setup and payoff gates met. Mid-development weak: the desire is told but not dramatized through a conflicted choice—Ethan never weighs this goal against a competing want or cost. Base ~5.0, plus early signal (+0.6) and closure linkage (+0.9), minus told-only (−0.8) and no friction between wants and costs (−0.8): 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tone "trembling certainty" is named twice (mid-story and near the end) and attempts to modulate—trembling suggests fear, certainty suggests resolve. However, the contradiction is asserted in the phrase itself rather than enacted through scene texture; Ethan's perception and syntax remain steady, not oscillating under pressure. Setup gate met (first mention ~40%), payoff gate met (returns at closure). Base ~5.0, plus closure linkage (+0.8) and early signal (+0.3), minus static execution (−0.6) and label-only (−0.3): 5.2.</comment>
