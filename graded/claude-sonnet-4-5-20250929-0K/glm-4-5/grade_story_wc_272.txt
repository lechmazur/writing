<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("cloying sadness," "luminescent ache") rather than embodied perception. The descent into sorting threads shows concrete micro-choices, and the shift from paralysis to drawing demonstrates agency. However, the final portrait completion feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The therapy-speak register ("fragmented reality," "realigning") in peak beats undermines character-particular voice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Eleanor's thread-sorting intensifies her connection to her craft, culminating in a completed portrait that reweights her relationship to perfection. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she embraces fragmentation rather than fixing it), but the cost is conceptual and implied rather than dramatized with visible forfeit. The final insight—"fragmented reality had not been a problem to fix but a perspective to embrace"—is stated rather than shown through a choice that forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is vividly anchored with sensory particulars (dust motes, circular architecture, high window). The tarot box and threads function as micro-setting that constrains Eleanor's sorting process. The lighthouse's breathing walls mirror her emotional state, though this risks overt symbolism. The setting charges the final image (library walls as "gentle embrace"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but spatial choreography during the sorting sequence remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—regaining artistic confidence—is signaled early. The thread-sorting provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Eleanor's approach from "perfecting a single moment" to embracing fragments. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than dramatic; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The resolution (completing the portrait) feels smooth rather than forced by contradictory pressures. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient, but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—embracing fragmentation as truth rather than flaw—emerges from the tarot box and thread imagery. The rhetorical questions risk meta-commentary but mostly stay rooted in Eleanor's perception. The final image ("luminescent ache of existence, rendered visible on paper") attempts resonance but tips into abstraction. The piece avoids overt moralizing, though the penultimate paragraph ("Wasn't that, after all, what she had been trying to capture all along?") edges toward thematic echo. No single resonant image reweights prior material without explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, meditative texture with patterned rhetorical questions that risk becoming tic-like. Psychic distance is consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cloying sadness of failure settled deeper into her bones") that feels imposed rather than Eleanor-specific. No dialogue present. The perceptual signature (artist noticing light, shadows, portraits) is consistent but not deeply idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout, with mixed effectiveness: "charcoal into gray oblivion," "books that curled at the edges like forgotten memories," "luminescent ache." Several rhetorical questions recur without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating template cadence. Paraphrase loops appear: "fragmented reality" is restated multiple times across paragraphs without added pressure. The phrase "luminescent ache" appears three times, two as identical repetition. Filter verbs ("seemed to shift," "seemed to breathe") stack in middle paragraphs. Artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure beat. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops, template cadence (rhetorical questions), and filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist uses tarot box to rediscover creativity—is functional but follows a familiar self-discovery template. The "fragmented reality as artistic truth" insight is not freshly rendered; the final realization is stated rather than discovered through specific, non-obvious synthesis. The lighthouse library setting and thread-sorting method add texture but do not fundamentally transform the arc. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes. The derivative premise guardrail applies: core template is widely used and transformation through lived detail is limited.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eleanor is present throughout and makes the key choice to sort threads, then draw. She is causally active in setup, middle (sorting), and ending (completing portrait). However, her "crestfallen" state is more label than lived constraint; the sorting and drawing feel conceptual rather than tactically pressured. Two gates (setup, payoff) are strong; middle development is present but abstract. Swappability is moderate (another blocked artist could replace her with minor edits). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but label-only trait −0.3, summary-only interiority in places −0.3. Starting at 3.0 + 2.1 positives − 0.6 frictions = 4.5, raised to 5.8 for causal presence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tarot box appears in setup (discovery), middle (thread sorting), and ending (transformed, "no longer seemed broken"). It is handled in at least two beats and returns with reweighted meaning. All three gates satisfied. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (split panels, threads) +0.5. However, the box itself is passive; Eleanor acts on the threads, not the box. Swappability is moderate (another broken container could work). Starting at 3.0 + 3.2 positives − 0.4 swappability = 5.8, raised to 6.2 for strong closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fragmented reality" is declared early and recurs as a theme throughout. It shapes Eleanor's perception but does not concretely alter her tactical options on the page; she sorts threads and draws regardless of whether reality is "fragmented." All three gates present (setup, middle reflection, ending insight) but the concept functions as metaphor rather than actionable constraint. Early signal +0.4, closure linkage +0.8 (reweights meaning in final paragraph), but ornamental use (description without pressure) −0.8, summary-only −0.4. Starting at 3.0 + 1.2 − 1.2 = 3.0, raised to 4.8 for thematic coherence across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear throughout ("Had fate led her...?", "Wasn't creation...?", "Hadn't she always...?", "When had she forgotten...?", "Wasn't that, after all...?"). They recur in every major beat but function as narrative texture rather than a trait that constrains action. Eleanor does not "question" in a way that enables or costs her a choice; the questions are authorial rather than character-driven. Present in setup, middle, and ending (all three gates), but label-only without embodied tradeoff. Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4, but ornamental (no pressure) −0.8, label-only −0.3. Starting at 3.0 + 1.7 − 1.1 = 3.6, capped at 3.2 for swappability (could be removed with no plot impact).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Redesign" appears explicitly in two beats: Eleanor decides to "redesign her connection to the world" via thread-sorting, then "began to redesign not just her technique but her entire approach." The action is central to the middle and ending. All three gates satisfied. Early signal (implicit in her motivation) +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4 (final portrait is the redesign enacted), causal pressure +0.8. However, the term "redesign" is abstract; the concrete action is "sorting threads" and "drawing." Swappability is moderate (another transformation verb could replace it). Starting at 3.0 + 3.6 − 0.4 swappability = 6.2, raised to 6.4 for strong closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is the literal method in the middle sequence: Eleanor sorts multicolored threads, each representing an aspect of herself. The method is signaled early (threads spilling from the box), executed in the middle (sorting), and its result shapes the ending (portrait completion). All three gates satisfied. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (color-coded threads) +0.5. However, the untangling is described rather than shown with tactical friction. Starting at 3.0 + 3.0 − 0.3 summary-only = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The library inside the lighthouse is anchored early and remains the single setting throughout. The circular architecture ("walls closing in") and high window (sunlight illuminating dust) are vivid. The setting supplies resources (tarot box on the shelf, portraits on the walls) and the walls' "breathing" mirrors Eleanor's state. All three gates satisfied. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9 (walls become "gentle embrace"), micro-setting (box, candle) +0.4. However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice; Eleanor's process would unfold similarly elsewhere. Swappability is moderate. Starting at 3.0 + 2.9 − 0.3 swappability = 5.6, capped at 5.3 for lack of pressure constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" appears as a metaphorical timeframe: the library walls "seemed to be closing in" early, then "stilled" at the end. The timeframe is poetic rather than literal; no clock or urgency tightens Eleanor's decisions. Setup and payoff gates satisfied, but middle development is weak (walls "breathe" but do not escalate). Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, but vague time (no tracking) −0.6, ornamental (does not alter tactics) −0.7. Starting at 3.0 + 1.3 − 1.3 = 3.0, raised to 3.8 for lyric resonance in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To descend into necessary darkness" is stated explicitly in the third paragraph and recurs in the final third ("descended into the necessary darkness of her own soul and returned with understanding"). The motivation is dramatized through Eleanor's choice to engage with the tarot box and threads. All three gates satisfied. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.1, cost connection (facing failure) +0.4. However, the "descent" is conceptual rather than tactically conflicted; Eleanor does not resist or pay a visible price for the descent. Summary-only in places −0.4. Starting at 3.0 + 3.1 − 0.4 = 5.7, raised to 5.9 for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears three times: early (dust motes create "an atmosphere of luminescent ache"), middle (implicit in her emotional state), and ending ("The luminescent ache remained, but now it felt like inspiration"). The tone is coherent, modulates from despair to inspiration, and charges the final image. All three gates satisfied. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6 (reweighted meaning), specificity +0.6. However, the phrase is repeated verbatim without fresh embodiment in the final use. Template phrasing −0.3. Starting at 3.0 + 4.4 − 0.3 = 7.1, capped at 6.8 for lack of fresh rendering at closure.</comment>
