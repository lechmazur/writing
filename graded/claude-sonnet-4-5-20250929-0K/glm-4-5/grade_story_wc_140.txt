<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation (identity reconstruction through story-collection) is consistent but remains abstract. Internal contradiction is limited; the narrator reflects on erasure and fragments without embodied pressure forcing micro-choices under duress. The piece offers label-heavy interiority ("nameless identity, a reconstruction assembled from whispers") rather than dramatized impulses in scene. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the ending restates the premise without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>**Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural.** Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first few lines, so no Orientation Test penalty applies. The piece accumulates reflective layers but delivers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with legible cost at closure. The final lines ("I have found my purpose not in what was lost but in what remains") restate the opening stance without reweighting options or imposing felt consequences. No on-page closure unit is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly sketched and returns across beats, filtering perception through industrial scale and metal. Tides function as temporal rhythm but do not constrain a choice. The poison-bottle label is mentioned twice but remains symbolic rather than a lived constraint. Setting description is purposeful and POV-colored, yet no environmental feature directly alters a tactic or charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaiming identity through collected narratives—is signaled early but never tightened or tested on the page. No reversal, complication, or trade-off narrows options; the protagonist wanders, collects, and reflects without encountering resistance or cost. The ending reaffirms the journey without dramatizing a choice that forecloses an alternative. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost is required; none appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (erasure, reconstruction, bureaucratic vs. lived identity) emerges clearly from the container labyrinth and death-certificate conceit. The poison-bottle label and layered-history metaphor recur purposefully. However, the final paragraph moralizes ("we are all survivors of erasure") and summarizes theme rather than earning resonance through a non-literal image. No epiphany is dramatized with cost; insights are asserted rather than discovered under pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a consistent reflective register and metaphor-rich diction ("palimpsest," "nameless identity"). Perceptual signature (the narrator filters reality as layered text) is distinct and voice-motivated. However, sustained elevated diction and parallelism across most beats ("Each morning… By day… The tides dictate…") flatten rhythm and risk template cadence. Psychic distance remains constant without modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present to test differentiation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and sometimes striking ("palimpsest," "stories written in water"), but metaphor saturation in nearly every sentence dulls propulsion (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: lines 19–20 restate "I was once documented, now I am nameless" without advancing pressure (−0.2). Template stems recur: "Each morning…," "By day…," "The tides…," "Across the rhythm…" across six beats (−0.5). Stock phrases ("sweet then gone without trace," "histories written in water") and synonym churn ("erased…overwritten…dissolved") accumulate without fresh specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines poeticize rather than advance causality or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The death-certificate-error conceit and shipping-container setting offer a fresh spatial frame. The palimpsest metaphor is apt for the layering action. However, the emotional arc—wandering narrator collects stories to rebuild self—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn or cost that transforms prior material. The ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it. Execution is competent but risks the safety middle; no bold structural or perspectival choice heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The death-certificate survivor is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. The character observes and reflects without agency-driven turns. Setup is met (first paragraph), but middle development and closure participation are summary-only; the ending restates the character's existence without a choice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears in two beats (line 7, line 24) as a symbol of fragility and erasure. It is handled ("rests in my pocket") and its faded text is noted, but it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The label's meaning is asserted rather than reweighted by action. Setup and reprise are present; causal pressure and closure linkage are absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the dominant stake and anchor reflections across beats (administrative error, palimpsest metaphor, containers as erasure). The concept frames the narrator's pilgrimage and is signaled early. However, it remains thematic rather than tactical; no on-page choice turns on the mechanics of erasure. The concept is woven throughout but does not alter options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is mentioned once (line 4: "viewing the world as a palimpsest") and described but not dramatized. The trait does not constrain an action or impose a visible trade-off. It functions as a label for the narrator's perceptual stance without on-page cost or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Layering (collecting and incorporating overheard stories) is the protagonist's central action and recurs across beats (lines 5, 10, 12, 18). It is signaled early and shapes the pilgrimage structure. However, no major turn traces to this action; the narrator layers continuously without complication or cost. The action is essential to the premise but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Collecting fragments of overheard stories is signaled early (line 6, line 12) and anchors the protagonist's daily rhythm. The method is described and its purpose stated. However, the mechanics (how stories are gathered, what friction arises) remain vague. The method shapes the journey but does not alter a tactic under pressure or charge the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established in the opening line and returns across beats (lines 1, 5, 15, 18, 26). The setting supplies the pilgrimage route and frames the narrator's wandering. Tides and metal shadows create atmosphere. However, no environmental feature directly constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The setting is vivid and recurrent but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Tides are mentioned across six beats (lines 5, 9, 11, 23, 26) as a temporal rhythm that dictates the narrator's existence. The timeframe is poetic and recurrent but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. Time remains atmospheric rather than tactical; no clock narrows options or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation (to discover the texture of memories and rebuild identity) is stated in line 17 and reflected throughout. It drives the pilgrimage and collection behavior. However, the desire is asserted rather than dramatized in a conflicted choice with visible cost. The motivation frames the journey but does not face friction or force a renunciation on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tone—reflective, elegiac, layered with metaphors of erasure and reconstruction—is coherent and sustained. Diction ("nameless identity," "ghost with flesh," "reconstruction assembled from whispers") reinforces the tone. The tone modulates minimally; elevated register and parallelism persist across beats without pressure-driven shifts. The final image ("unlabeled by bureaucracy") echoes the opening without recharging prior material with cost.</comment>
