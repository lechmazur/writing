<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("calmly intuitive," "shadow-laced peacekeeper") without embodied contradiction. The shadows function as external threat-detectors rather than dramatizing internal conflict. The mirror solution feels authored rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure. Her competence is declared but never genuinely threatened—no moment where intuition fails or costs her something immediate.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: lighthouse spires with apple trees and ice floes create spatial confusion until the mirror mechanics appear mid-story. The closure—redirecting orchard heat through lighthouse shafts—arrives as exposition ("showing the Council how") rather than dramatized action with on-page resistance. Cost is asserted (the "weighted breath" released) but not felt; we never see what Elara loses or forecloses by choosing this path. The piece teaches an accumulative lens through its lyric cataloging of mirrors but the ending toggles to causal problem-solving without integrating the pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard-ice composite is vivid and specific, but spatial choreography wobbles: roots drinking mist "above" grinding floes creates contradictory verticality. The vintage mirrors supply the solution's mechanics and anchor the closure image, charging the final beat. However, the mirrors appear suddenly at the one-third mark without prior cue, and their scavenged history is told rather than discovered through Elara's tactile engagement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The binary stake (burn orchard vs. watch nomads die) is clear, but Elara's third-path solution bypasses rather than escalates the dilemma—no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The nomads and Council remain off-page abstractions; no secondary character applies immediate pressure or adapts to her moves. The mirror configuration offers ingenuity but lacks friction; it succeeds on first attempt without failure or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of "refusal to accept that mercy must remain passive" is stated rather than discovered through particulars. The phrase "courageous anomaly" recurs as a label without fresh inflection at closure. The crystal's reconstitution and the mirror triangle offer concrete images, but the ending explains its thematic import ("a peacekeeper who refused the violence of either/or") instead of letting the configuration speak. The piece gestures toward mapping empathy onto action but never shows a moment where empathy itself creates friction or unexpected cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("reconstitute the very foundation," "executable strategy") that clashes with the fairy-tale orchard and shadow-magic frame. Template cadence pervades: "She raised… She moved… She positioned… She shifted… She angled…" across five sequential beats. The shadows are described but never focalized—how they feel on her skin, whether they itch or chill. Elara's perceptual signature defaults to visual cataloging without bias or selectivity tied to her stated intuition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting in the opening sentence stacks five dependent clauses with mixed metaphors (roots drinking mist, ice grinding like giants). Paraphrase loop: "shadow-laced peacekeeper" / "threads of darkness that moved independently" restates the same idea. Figurative density saturates peak beats—"paper boats on a dark stream," "strange, heavy fruit," "compressed starlight"—without pattern-teaching or payoff. The phrase "weighted breath before reply" is repeated verbatim three times, twice in the final paragraph. Template stems ("She [verb] the…") run through the mirror-positioning sequence without variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard-ice composite offers fresh particulars, and the vintage mirrors as time-fracturing tools provide a non-obvious mechanics. However, the core dilemma (save lives vs. preserve ecosystem) and its resolution (find the overlooked third option via mystical optics) follow a familiar template. The shadows, crystal fragment, and mirrors accumulate as genre tokens without transforming their tropes. The ending's wisdom—"compassion became executable strategy"—reads as thesis statement rather than emergent discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara frames the story and makes the final mirror-alignment decision. She appears in every beat and her choice reconstitutes the crystal. However, her peacekeeper role and shadow-threads are described more than they constrain tactics; the shadows warn of danger that never materializes on the page. She does not fail, waver, or pay a felt cost. Present throughout and causal at closure, but her decision feels authored convenience rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fragment is handled in three beats: held in opening, used to catch mirror-glimpses mid-story, reconstituted whole at closure. Its jagged edge and aurora-catching properties enable the solution mechanics. The crystal's wholeness reappears as the final image, reweighting the broken/whole motif. However, its transformation happens off-page ("the crystal now whole") without dramatized process or visible cost tied to the act of mending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is named twice but functions as thematic label rather than on-page constraint. It does not alter Elara's tactics or create friction; she successfully executes her plan without genuine risk. The concept echoes at closure ("She had become the courageous anomaly she sought") as summary rather than discovered cost. Present as theme, absent as dramatized stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is declared in paragraph two ("She was calmly intuitive, feeling the currents of consequence") and restated once ("her fingers traced… calmly intuitive"). The trait is told, not shown through a moment where intuition enables a choice that calculation would miss, or where calm under pressure costs her speed or adaptability. No visible tradeoff or failure that would prove the attribute's limits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is named explicitly mid-story ("She needed to reconstitute the very foundation of the choice itself") and drives the mirror-alignment action that produces the final solution. The verb anchors the turning beat and distinguishes this resolution from simpler "fix" or "solve." Removing it would require rewriting the core mechanism. However, the reconstitution itself is told ("the crystal now whole") rather than dramatized with process and cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The vintage mirrors are introduced at the one-third mark, supply the glimpses of adjacent timelines, and enable the three-mirror triangle that projects the solution. Their mechanics—reflecting possibility rather than present image—are explained and used on the page. The mirrors shape two beats (discovery, alignment) and charge the closure image with their chiming resonance. Swappable with "scrying pool" or "temporal lenses" but the vintage-store provenance and era-specific frames (Art Deco, Victorian) add concrete detail that the ending reprises.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse-orchard-ice composite anchors all action and supplies the problem's geography: orchard as carbon sink, ice shelf trapping nomads, lighthouse shafts as the redirected-heat solution. The setting is present from the opening and integral to closure. However, spatial choreography is unclear (roots above floes?) and the geothermal mechanics are introduced only at the end as convenient off-page infrastructure. The setting pressures the choice but does not evolve or resist Elara's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" is named in the opening paragraph, repeated mid-story, and released at closure. It frames the story's temporal compression and matches the contemplative pacing. However, no live clock tightens decisions—Elara has unlimited time to position mirrors and the Council waits passively. The timeframe is lyric metaphor rather than pressuring constraint; removing it would not alter the sequence of moves or their costs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Map empathy onto action" is stated twice and frames the thematic goal. Elara's mirror solution is presented as enacting this motivation. However, empathy itself is never dramatized—she does not feel the nomads' cold or the orchard's fragility in embodied, conflicted ways that alter her process. The motivation is told as premise rather than tested through friction where empathy and efficacy pull in opposite directions with visible cost.</comment>
