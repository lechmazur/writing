<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's occupation is colorful but her interiority remains abstract—she "wonders," "realizes," and "knows" without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The missing-pieces motif is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final acceptance arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed; she simply continues her work in the same way. No secondary character applies pressure, leaving motivation unopposed and static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is delayed—"who" and "what she does" emerge gradually across the first third without concrete spatial or temporal anchors. The closure reads as thematic acceptance ("missing pieces would remain companions") without a decisive change, renunciation with cost, or a reconfigured stake; Elara ends as she began, harvesting memories. The "question" seed in the penultimate beat gestures toward openness but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The iridescent cave and crater glass are vivid and recur across beats, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara's choices are not shaped by access, proximity, or environmental pressure. The "cheerful gloom" and "warm crystal wall" establish atmosphere but do not alter tactics or charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, yet the setting remains postcard-descriptive rather than a lever for decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover why some paths disappear"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or narrowed options. Elara works "quickly, before memory fades," yet no clock visibly tightens her moves; the seeds dissolve cooperatively. The realization that "missing pieces weren't errors but necessary silences" arrives as epiphany rather than earned reversal. No live trade-off or foreclosed path; she simply continues her work with acceptance, leaving escalation flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—acceptance of incompleteness—emerges clearly from image (missing faces, gaps) and Elara's final stance. However, the insight is delivered as interiority ("she realized") rather than earned through a specific on-page choice or trade-off. The recurring "missing pieces" and "cheerful gloom" function as motifs but do not constrain decision or charge the closure image with felt cost. The final question-seed gestures toward openness but does not reweight prior material non-literally; the ending leans toward stated acceptance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited and the perceptual signature—"sea-foam hair drifting like mist," prismatic light—is lyrically consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("transliterate emotions," "conjecture," "conceptual repricing") that sits awkwardly with the mystical-artisan voice, creating mild distance wobble. Interiority relies on filter verbs and label-only feelings ("cheerful gloom," "comfortable sadness") without embodied contradiction. No dialogue to assess. Syntactic variety is present but rhythm flattens under stacked descriptive clauses in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Repeated phrases ("scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird" appears nearly verbatim four times; "before memory fades" three times; "cheerful gloom" four times; "crater glass" nine times) create paraphrase loops that dull momentum. Template cadence: "She [verb]" / "Elara [verb]" runs across a dozen sentences without variation. Stock metaphors ("like mist," "like breaking waves," "like home") and synonym churn ("transliterate," "conjecture," "recollection") cluster without adding pressure. Information density is low—many sentences restate thematic claims rather than advance situation. These artifacts pervade the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sea-foam recollectionist in a crystal geode offers surface novelty, but the emotional arc—solitary artisan accepts the limits of her craft—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The premise (harvesting memories via seeds from a bird) is ornamental; swapping it for any other mystical collection method would leave the acceptance arc unchanged. "Cheerful gloom" and "missing pieces" read as prompt-derived labels rather than synthesis inevitable in hindsight. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece plays safely in lyric mode without grounded specificity or verifiable detail that would anchor the fantastical elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation frames the premise, but her on-page choices are procedural (pressing seeds, holding glass, placing vessels) rather than decision-laden. The pivotal "realization" in paragraph 14 is interiority without a visible trade-off or path foreclosed. She begins harvesting and ends harvesting; no key turn traces to her agency under pressure. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is thematic only, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Crater glass appears in nine beats, is handled and used (pressing seeds, holding up to light, placing among others), and its "meteor scars" are noted as uniquely suited to holding memories. Its properties enable the transliteration process and recur with reweighted meaning ("grew hot," "glowing with understanding"). However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure or charge the final image with a cost tied specifically to its use. All three gates met; strong beat involvement but closure linkage is descriptive rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" is named six times and shapes Elara's stated motivation, but functions as thematic echo rather than on-page constraint. The gaps ("jagged absences where faces should be") are observed, not dramatized as a problem she must navigate with cost. Her realization that they are "necessary silences" is told interiority. Setup and thematic development present; no middle choice or closure participation beyond label. Swappable with "incomplete knowledge" or "fragmented past."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Transliterates emotions" is named twice and shown once ("converting grief and joy into crystalline patterns"). The ability enables her work but is procedural—no on-page moment where the trait constrains her action or imposes a visible cost. It could be replaced with "reads" or "captures" without altering any beat. Setup present; development and closure participation absent. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Conjecture" appears once as a verb ("She began to conjecture, spinning theories") and describes her internal process but does not drive a turn. The pivotal realization about missing pieces is framed as insight, not conjecture tested under pressure. Easily swappable with "wonder" or "reflect." Setup present in one beat; development and closure participation absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The migrating bird and its scattered seeds appear in five beats, frame the method of memory delivery, and recur in the final paragraphs with a new seed containing "a question." The method is signaled early and matters to the premise, but Elara's tactics do not change based on the bird's behavior; she simply waits and processes whatever arrives. Setup, development (as delivery mechanism), and closure participation (final seed) are present, but causal pressure is low—removing the bird and having seeds arrive by wind would require only minor edits. Lyric reprise elevates slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The iridescent cave is named in the opening and closing and described across six beats. It provides vivid atmosphere ("auroras trapped in ancient stone," "warm crystal wall") but does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that affect outcome. Time moves "differently" inside, yet no clock tightens her moves. Setup and descriptive development present; closure participation is scenic only. Postcard setting without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Before memory fades" appears three times, signaling urgency, but no on-page clock tightens Elara's moves—she works "quickly" yet proceeds methodically across 25 paragraphs without visible time pressure or a moment where delay would impose cost. The phrase functions as thematic reminder rather than live constraint. Setup present; development and closure participation absent. Vague, untracked time trends low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths disappear" is stated clearly in paragraph 9 and recurs in her final stance. However, it is told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between this desire and a competing cost, and no scene where her pursuit alters tactics or forecloses an option. Her "realization" in paragraph 14 delivers the answer without struggle. Setup and thematic presence; middle choice and closure cost absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Cheerful gloom" is named four times and establishes a paradoxical mood that recurs across beats. The tone is coherent but static—no modulation under pressure or cadence shift that charges the final image. It functions as label rather than felt texture. Setup and descriptive development present; closure participation is ornamental (paragraph 25 repeats the phrase without reweighting it). A single static mood trends mid-low.</comment>
