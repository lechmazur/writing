<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are clear and her internal conflict is established (oath vs. revelation), but the interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("bravely conflicted," "moral crisis") rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to upload occurs "within the blink that follows surprise" but the seventeen-year buildup compresses into a single choice without dramatized internal friction or visible tradeoffs in the moment. The final stance (peaceful waiting) feels earned by her archival role but lacks micro-choices under pressure that would reveal a hierarchy of values with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal/Situational hybrid. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph one (who, where, when). The inciting discovery and upload decision create a before/after, but the closure relies on conceptual repricing (seeds vs. tombs, truth melting) rather than on-page dramatized cost; the security alarms arrive thirty seconds later yet Mara's peaceful waiting abstracts the consequence. The causal chain (discovery → upload → spread) is clean, but the final image asserts transformation through metaphor rather than showing tactical or relational change, weakening the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cryogenic vault is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frosting breath, ice-coated keys, permafrost hum) and the setting constrains action (subzero preservation, dormant networks, buried blizzard). The "echoing library under snow" recurs purposefully and charges the final image (tombs → seeds). Spatial choreography is clean (eastern terminal, cryo-pod, vault center) and the environment's isolation amplifies moral stakes. The micro-setting (preservation unit, fiber-optic veins) shapes Mara's tactical choices, meeting the 9+ test for constraint and closure charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: suppress or reveal the contraband letter. The upload sequence tightens pressure once (networks awakening → replication → alarms), and the decision forecloses her archival neutrality with visible professional cost (security response). However, the escalation is linear rather than tested by reversal or complication; no mid-scene obstacle forces a tradeoff, and the choice itself unfolds without on-page resistance or visible tactical price beyond the abstract "crossing a threshold." The conceptual cost (guardian → liberator) is asserted more than felt in the final beats.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. suppression, preservation vs. liberation) emerges organically from the vault setting and Mara's archival role. The final image (frozen moments melting, seeds vs. tombs) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, phrases like "provoke an unspoken conversation" and "dialogue about peace" edge toward thematic statement rather than pure implication, and the manufactured-war revelation risks convenient symmetry (both sides equally culpable). The piece invites reflection on controlled history but the climactic epiphany is told more than earned through scene-specific friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, and perceptual signature (archivist's lens on "frozen memories," "cathedral-sized vault") is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register at peak moments ("contraband truths," "fever of revelation," "digital ghosts") that feel authorial rather than Mara's lived lexicon after seventeen years in isolation. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose at closure leans expository ("she had chosen to melt one") rather than immediate. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs, but voice under pressure loses specificity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Significant overwriting throughout: "dizzying quiet" appears four times, often in adjacent or near-adjacent paragraphs, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative density is high in emotional beats ("contraband truths," "fever of revelation," "electric potential," "digital ghosts") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.5). Template cadence in paragraph four ("accessing… awakening… coughing") stacks participles mechanically (−0.4). Mixed metaphor: "truth flow liquid and burning through the streets" conflates incompatible vehicles (−0.3). Information density is solid in action sequences, but scaffold phrasing ("the bravely conflicted archivist," "the dangerous liaison letter") recurs as labels rather than earned reference. Cumulative artifact penalties reach −1.2; closure beat ("waited peacefully") is touched by tellingness, preventing high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cryogenic-archive premise is specific and the manufactured-war revelation adds stakes, but the core frame (lone archivist discovers secret that upends regime) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived occupational detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The decision to upload is predictable once the letter is discovered; no counter-pressure complicates the choice. Sensory specifics (permafrost, fiber-optic veins) elevate the setting, but the final image (seeds, melting truth) relies on stock nature metaphors. Derivative premise adjustment (−0.8) for template adherence without a fresh ethical or tactical wrinkle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's discovery and upload decision drive both major turns (inciting discovery, climactic upload). She appears in all beats and her role as archivist seeds the stakes early. Her choice at the eastern terminal narrows options and forecloses her neutrality, meeting the causal test. However, the decision itself is compressed into a single paragraph without on-page friction or visible tactical cost, weakening irreplaceability. Present in closure (waiting peacefully), but the final image foregrounds metaphor over her active agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The letter is handled in three distinct beats: discovery in cryo-pod, scanning into system, and return to preservation. Its properties (wax seal, twin insignias, encoded truth) matter causally—without it, no stakes exist. It drives the inciting incident and climactic upload, and its digital replication enables closure. The final return to cryo-pod creates a purposeful reprise (original evidence preserved while ghosts travel). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the letter itself is somewhat generic (any contraband document could substitute with minor edits), capping irreplaceability shy of 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Contraband truths" frames the dominant stake (suppress vs. reveal) and the letter's content (manufactured conflict) narrows Mara's options by making neutrality untenable. The concept appears early (paragraph two) and recurs at closure ("contraband truths awakening minds"), reweighting the vault's purpose (preservation → provocation). However, the concept functions mostly as thematic backdrop; the specific truth (shared accounts, scheduled battles) could be replaced with other forbidden knowledge without altering Mara's tactical choice. Lyric reprise from setup to closure earns mid-band placement, but swappability and lack of unique mechanics limit higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" appears twice as a label (paragraph three, paragraph six) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The internal conflict (oath vs. revelation) is present, but the trait itself functions as descriptor rather than driver; Mara's choice compresses into "within the blink" without dramatized friction that would show the brave/conflicted duality shaping tactics. The upload proceeds linearly once decided, with no moment where her conflict alters a beat's outcome. Label-only use without on-page tradeoff or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Scandalize" drives both the climactic upload (paragraph five: "scandalize the capital") and closure consequence (paragraph seven: "scandalizing the outside world"). The action defines the story's major turn: Mara shifts from preservation to provocation, and the upload's success is the decisive change. Signaled early as potential effect (paragraph two: "scandalize… the entire foundation"), then executed on-page. Removing "scandalize" would require only minor edits (substitute "expose" or "reveal"), so irreplaceability is moderate. Strong causal role and closure presence, but swappability caps score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dormant networks are signaled in paragraph four, their mechanics detailed (servers sleeping fifteen years, fiber-optic veins, routers under permafrost), and their function enables the climactic upload. The method shapes Mara's tactical choice (she must access the eastern terminal and awaken the system) and carries constraint (networks were shut down by censorship). The means matters causally: without dormant infrastructure, no mass distribution occurs. Present in closure image ("traveling through dormant networks"). However, the networks could be replaced with another hidden channel (radio, courier) with moderate edits, limiting uniqueness. Two-beat involvement (awakening, replication) and closure linkage push into solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The vault's physical properties constrain and enable throughout: subzero preservation justifies the cryo-pod and letter survival, the eastern terminal provides the upload means, the buried blizzard isolates Mara and delays outside response, and the vault's size amplifies her sensory experience (heartbeat like thunder, dizzying quiet). The setting appears in every paragraph and recurs at closure with reweighted meaning (tombs → seeds, "echoing library under snow" shifts from oppressive to expectant). The vault's specific features (metal shelves, permafrost, sub-basement servers) matter tactically. Strong causal pressure, closure charge, and irreplaceability meet high-band tests.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Within the blink that follows surprise" is declared twice (paragraphs four and eight) but functions as metaphor rather than live timeframe. The upload sequence lacks timed beats; no clock tightens Mara's decision or constrains her actions before the alarms (which arrive "thirty seconds later" only after completion). The phrase labels compression rather than creating on-page temporal pressure. The actual elapsed time of discovery → upload is untracked, and no moment shows Mara racing against a closing window. Ornamental use without causal constraint or tactical impact; introduced mid-story and does not shape middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to provoke an unspoken conversation") is stated explicitly in paragraph six and frames Mara's choice: she seeks dialogue, not revolution. The desire explains why she uploads rather than destroys, and it differentiates her from simple whistleblower motives. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; the upload proceeds without on-page friction between wanting conversation and fearing chaos. The phrase "provoke an unspoken conversation" appears once, late (second half), and does not shape earlier beats. Functional and present at closure, but swappable with "truth" or "transparency" and lacks visible cost tied to the specific wording.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" recurs four times (paragraphs one, three, six, eight), establishing tone early and modulating with pressure (oppressive → expectant). The tone charges the vault atmosphere and amplifies Mara's sensory experience (heartbeat like thunder, blood rushing). At closure, "silence returned… dizzying and absolute yet somehow changed" reweights the tone, supporting the shift from tomb to seed. However, repetition feels over-deployed without functional variation, and the phrase becomes a label rather than embodied sensation. Coherent through turns and present in final image, meeting lyric-resonance allowance, but the overuse and paraphrase loop (synonym churn around "quiet," "silence") lower distinctiveness.</comment>
