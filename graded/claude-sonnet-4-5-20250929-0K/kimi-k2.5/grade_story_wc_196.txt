<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation—broken-hearted archivist seeking solace through examining lives—is clear and embodied through concrete actions (tracing dust, opening files, photographing patterns). Her interior progression from grief to hope is earned through discovery rather than declaration, and the transformation from "unable to discard" to "examined conviction" feels grounded in the accumulated evidence. Minor deduction: the final epiphany ("not merely a mausoleum...but a secret library") edges toward thematic articulation rather than remaining purely embodied, and the grief context could constrain more choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: the story builds through discovered patterns (dust gradients, circular clearings, multiple buttons) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya's broken heart is reframed within "this larger fabric of unknown histories." The closure lands as Charged Poise—she carries the button "not as an object, but as a method"—with conceptual cost legible (she has committed to bearing witness rather than culling files). Orientation is clean early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the sergeant's pattern is revealed across six other files, reweighting the single discovery into systemic mercy. Cost is felt but could be more visceral; the price is professional (task abandoned) and emotional (grief transformed) but not tested by immediate opposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The file room functions as micro-setting that constrains Maya's discovery method and charges the final image. Dust patterns operate as both atmosphere and evidence, with "gray film coating" and "gradients" providing tactile specificity. The basement archives feel lived-in through concrete details (metal shelving, manila folders, brittleness of creases) filtered through Maya's professional lens. The dust's "ghostly evidence" and the button she photographs before cleaning demonstrate how environment supplies both resource and constraint. The sergeant's fingertip wearing circular patterns makes the setting's physical traces integral to plot revelation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake clearly signaled: Maya seeks solace/meaning after abandonment by magnifying hidden mercies in orphaned files. The discovery of the sergeant's pattern provides one meaningful deepening—the anomaly becomes systemic care. Her choice to compile a supplemental index and preserve evidence rather than cull files shows agency with professional cost (supervisor's task abandoned). However, escalation is primarily Accumulative (pattern accumulation) rather than pressure-driven; no antagonist tests her new conviction, and the transformation occurs through discovery alone without forcing a difficult trade-off. The final stance crystallizes cleanly but the stakes remain personal/internal without external friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars: brass buttons as proof of care, dust patterns as archives of love's persistence, "the examined conviction that small kindnesses...could unfurl across time." The piece resists moralizing while offering a resonant answer to "whether mercy unwitnessed matters" through Maya's choice to bear witness. The button transitions from object to method, and "not the naive optimism of someone who has not suffered" demonstrates earned rather than declared wisdom. The closing image—carrying the button as methodology—reweights prior material without explaining its thesis. Minor note: "unknown histories" recurs frequently enough to approach thematic labeling, though each use adds specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Maya's perceptual signature consistent: she reads "like a historian interprets geological strata," notices "tactfully hopeful precision," and frames discoveries through archival language. Diction stays within her professional/emotional register. No dialogue present, appropriately. The prose rhythm modulates well—compressed during discovery beats, expansive during reflection. Minor deduction: some constructions edge toward elevated literary register ("her motivation crystallizing," "the examined conviction") that slightly exceeds immediate thought under emotional pressure, and the final metaphor chain (button as method/way of reading) tilts explanatory. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or emotional progression. Sentence rhythm varies appropriately with some strong images ("manila monuments," "fossilized into brittleness"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the "unknown histories" phrase recurs without always adding pressure; "tactfully hopeful" appears three times in similar contexts; and the closing two paragraphs restate the transformation concept through slightly varied metaphors (mausoleum→library, button→method, dust→map). Filter-verb density is moderate but acceptable ("she found," "she understood," "she realized"). The prose remains clear but could achieve greater compression in the final third where thematic synthesis becomes somewhat repetitive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dust-as-archive concept offers a fresh angle on institutional memory and provides specific investigative methodology (circular clearings, cross-referencing patterns). The sergeant's brass buttons as proof of care feel particular rather than generic, and the choice to photograph dust configurations before cleaning shows thoughtful world-building. The transformation of "broken-hearted archivist" through archival discovery has organic coherence. However, the premise follows a recognizable template—damaged professional finds healing through work discovering hidden goodness—and while execution is strong, the emotional arc follows predictable stations. The "examined conviction" framing and foster-care setting add specificity that elevates above template, but not radically.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya appears throughout, makes the key choice to preserve evidence rather than cull files, compiles a supplemental index, and shifts from grief to hope. Her discovery work drives all major beats and her final decision to carry the button "as a method" closes the arc. However, most movement occurs through passive discovery rather than difficult choice under opposition—she finds rather than decides between competing goods. Present in setup, middle investigation, and ending transformation, but agency leans observational until the final preservation choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The infantryman's button appears in the sergeant's letter discovery, is explained as proof of care, Maya finds three more in other folders, and she carries one in her pocket at the end as "method." It drives the central revelation (sergeant's pattern of care), enables the middle investigative beat (searching for similar tokens), and charges the closure by transforming from object to methodology. The button's specific properties (brass, dress uniform, proof someone uniformed stood beside the child) matter throughout. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with visible cost tied to Maya's transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" frames Maya's search from paragraph one, shapes her tactical choice to examine lives "swallowed by bureaucratic indifference," drives the discovery method (reading dust as evidence of forgotten care), and provides the thematic anchor for closure when she realizes the room is "not merely a mausoleum...but a secret library." The concept constrains her approach (she must find evidence) and enables her transformation. It recurs perhaps too frequently as a phrase, trending toward thematic echo, but remains causally active in each beat—she acts to uncover, preserve, and index these histories. Present in setup, active in middle beats, charges ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" appears three times: as Maya's approach to opening the file, the sergeant's rebellion as "tactfully hopeful declaration," and in the closing paragraph referencing both. It operates more as tonal descriptor than action-constraining attribute—Maya's carefulness is shown through photographing dust and preserving buttons, but the specific quality of "tactful hope" doesn't force a visible trade-off on the page. It colors her method but remains somewhat label-like. Setup present, modest middle use, lyric reprise at end, but cost connection is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Unfurl" appears at three pivotal moments: Maya unfurls the fossilized letter, "the unknown history unfurled further" during cross-referencing, and small kindnesses "could unfurl across time" in the closing conviction. Each use advances revelation—the letter contains the button/proof, the pattern expands to six other youth, the final image reweights care as transgenerational. The action is specific (physical unfolding, investigative expansion, temporal reach) and irreplaceable; swapping for "reveal" or "discover" would lose the layered material→temporal→thematic progression. Present in setup discovery, middle pattern expansion, and closure resonance with clear causal links.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dust patterns are signaled in paragraph one ("reading...like geological strata"), become the investigative method in paragraph seven ("anomaly in the dust patterns," "circular clearing"), enable the cross-referencing discovery ("dust patterns on adjacent files"), and are preserved as evidence ("photographed the dust configurations"). The mechanics matter: Maya can date visitation frequency, identify which files were touched, and trace the sergeant's returns. The method shapes her entire approach and supplies the crucial clue. Swapping for another archive trace (notes, logs) would require different mechanics. Setup, middle use with specific technique, preserved at end.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The foster care file room appears in every paragraph, supplies the investigative constraint (basement archives, shelving, emancipation files), provides the key resource (dust preservation on untouched folders), and transforms from "mausoleum of failed placements" to "secret library of accumulated care" in Maya's realization. The setting's specific properties—metal shelving that preserves dust, manila folders as monuments, the two-thousand-nine cohort files—enable the discovery and charge the closure. Maya's final act of locking the door grounds her transformation spatially. Removing this exact setting would break the entire investigative logic. Setup, middle constraint/resource, closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After emancipation" frames the context (2009 cohort released three months prior, Jericho Bell emancipated 2012) and establishes that care can persist beyond institutional endings—the sergeant's returns occurred after his advocacy duty ended. The timeframe matters thematically (love outlasting utility) and enables the dust-pattern dating method. However, it functions more as backdrop than live pressure; no ticking clock forces Maya's choices, and the "fourth Tuesday" and "by evening" markers are loose. Setup context clear, thematic weight present, but doesn't tighten decisions or alter tactics under time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maya's desire "to magnify small kindnesses" crystallizes in paragraph five, drives her choice to compile a supplemental index rather than cull files (paragraph nineteen), and resolves in her conviction that "small kindnesses, once magnified and honored, could unfurl across time." The motivation is dramatized through concrete actions—preserving buttons, photographing dust, updating documentation—with professional cost (supervisor's task abandoned). Friction exists between institutional directive (cull inactive files) and her emerging commitment. Setup slightly delayed but signaled, middle choice clear, closure pays off. Could show more immediate resistance or consequence to elevate further.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Examined" modulates throughout: Maya reads files "like a historian," opens the file with "tactfully hopeful precision," and achieves "not naive optimism...but the examined conviction." The tone balances grief with investigative distance, warming gradually as discoveries accumulate without losing intellectual carefulness. It coheres through turns—broken-heartedness → discovery → pattern recognition → hope—and charges the final image when examination becomes methodology. The tone supports Accumulative lens well. However, some phrases edge toward exposition of the tone itself ("examined conviction," "unknown histories") rather than purely embodying it. Modulates with pressure, supports closure, but slightly over-articulated.</comment>
