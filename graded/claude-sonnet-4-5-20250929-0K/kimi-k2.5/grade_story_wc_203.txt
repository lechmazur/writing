<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's character is established through concrete actions—climbing the ladder, reading dust patterns, handling the mainspring—with consistent occupation-specific perception. Her agency drives the key turn when she installs the barrel, foreclosing the ringmaster's liminal state. Internal contradiction is present but muted: she's observant of the supernatural yet emotionally flat about it, which reads more as trait than pressure. The final choice feels somewhat inevitable rather than costly; no visible renunciation or trade-off sharpens the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns, temperature drops, and the mainspring build density toward the installation beat that reweights the ringmaster's waiting into resolution. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the ghost finds peace, the crack seals—with conceptual cost (the transfer of burden to the machine). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya understands the mainspring's dual purpose, narrowing her action to installation. Cost is legible in the ghost's dissolution and the sealed crack, though the emotional price to Maya herself remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office provides vivid, purposeful detail: vintage ticket stubs, grime-coated windows, the elevator shaft behind the counter. Setting constrains Maya's search—the crack in the ceiling rosette, the shaft's vertical channel—and the mainspring's installation into the governor mechanism demonstrates tool-as-micro-setting. The dust accumulation patterns function as both atmosphere and plot driver, guiding her discovery. Spatial choreography is clean across ladder, ceiling, and shaft. The setting charges the final image of the humming elevator keeping time between worlds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what ceilings hide—is signaled early and tightens when Maya finds the mainspring and realizes the ringmaster has been anchoring it. One meaningful escalation occurs: her choice to install the barrel into the governor transforms the ghost's state. The stakes remain investigative rather than survival-urgent, which is consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (the transfer of burden) and spatial (the crack seals), but Maya herself pays no visible price; her action resolves the problem without personal forfeiture or struggle, which keeps the band from rising higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the mainspring as stored time, dust as accumulated regret, the elevator as liminal infrastructure. The ending offers a non-literal answer—buildings contain vertical passages between states of being—without moralizing. The final image of Maya driving home, watching for "the precise instant when the buzz dies off and cracks show through," reweights her vocation with thematic resonance. The metaphor of "weightless burden" accumulates across the piece and charges the closure. One minor slip: "cracks in the façade" occasionally tips toward overt symbolism rather than emerging organically.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Maya; perceptual signature is consistent with her technical observation ("hairline fractures," "dust accumulation patterns"). Diction is controlled and occupation-specific without filter-verb clutter in key beats. The ringmaster's dialogue is brief and functional; Maya's internal voice remains distinct. One phrase—"the weightless burden settled upon her shoulders"—edges toward stock metaphor but is then charged by recurrence. No head-hopping; distance is consistent. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately, slowing for analysis and quickening for the installation beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the dust-pattern analysis and mainspring discovery. Some overwriting appears: "the amber hush of late afternoon light filtering through grime-coated windows" stacks modifiers without urgency, and "the weightless burden" recurs as a phrase rather than evolving its vehicle. The metaphor "dust spoke in gradients" is vivid but borders on precious. A paraphrase loop near the end—"keeping time for no one and everyone" and "keeping time for those who existed outside it"—cycles without added pressure. Clarity remains intact; no causality breaks. The final paragraph's rhythm supports the thematic close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of elevator technician + ghost-seer + circus ruin + horologist's part is specific and purposeful; the dual-use shaft (moving bodies and keeping time) is a fresh inflection. The mainspring as anchor between worlds grows organically from setup. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars. One proximity concern: the ghost with a rope burn and unfinished business is a familiar archetype, though the resolution through mechanical installation rather than emotional catharsis elevates it. Risk-taking is present in the Accumulative structure and the refusal to dramatize confrontation, which heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout, her occupation enabling the discovery (analyzing the crack, reading dust patterns) and her ghost-sight enabling the dialogue with the ringmaster. Her choice to install the mainspring into the governor is the key turn that resolves the haunting. Two beats: discovery and installation. The element is causally indispensable and charges the closure. Early signal, middle development, and closure participation all met.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel is discovered mid-story, handled physically (withdrawn from the ceiling, examined for scratches), and installed into the elevator governor at closure. It drives two beats: discovery and installation. Its specific properties—coiled tension, tallying marks—matter causally; it anchors the ghost and enables the resolution. Irreplaceable: no generic object would serve. Cost is tied to its function (transferring burden). Early signal is weak (appears ~30% in), but closure linkage and causal pressure are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phrase "cracks in the façade" appears literally (the ceiling crack) and thematically (boundaries between worlds). It shapes Maya's search and the ghost's method of maintaining contact. The crack seals at closure, signaling resolution. Two beats: initial observation and final sealing. The concept enables the discovery but also operates as overt symbolism ("the façade healing now that its secret had been acknowledged"), which lowers specificity. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is demonstrated rather than labeled: Maya spots the hairline crack, reads dust gradients, notes scratches on the mainspring casing. The trait enables the discovery beat and constrains her method (she analyzes rather than stumbles). No visible cost or trade-off tied to the trait itself; it functions as pure enabler. Present across beats but lacks friction. Early signal, middle use, closure contribution indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Engage" is signaled early ("she chose to engage") and executed when Maya speaks to the ringmaster and later installs the mainspring. The action drives the resolution and is character-specific (she doesn't run). Two beats: dialogue and installation. Swappability is low; the resolution depends on engagement rather than banishment. Cost is conceptual (she assumes the knowledge of what she's witnessed). Early signal, middle development, closure participation all met.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dust analysis appears early and guides Maya to the crack: "analyzing dust accumulation patterns that drifted upward in spirals" and "The dust spoke in gradients." The method enables discovery but does not constrain later action; once the crack is found, dust is abandoned. One beat: the search. The mechanics matter (thick/thin layers reveal air currents) but the method itself is replaceable—any sign could lead her to the crack. Early signal, middle development present, but no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ticket office provides the ceiling crack, the elevator shaft, and spatial pressure (ladder, counter). Setting enables discovery, supplies the tool (the shaft as anchor), and charges the closure (the humming elevator). Three beats: arrival/search, discovery, installation. The circus context enriches the mainspring's backstory (the grand clock above the main tent). Irreplaceability is high: the shaft's dual purpose is essential. Early signal, middle development, closure participation all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The fluorescent buzz dying off is the inciting moment that allows Maya to perceive "the subtle frequencies of the dead." It is signaled early and returns thematically: "only in its absence could she perceive the machinery of hauntings." The timeframe tightens perception but does not constrain action or create a clock. Two beats: the buzz dies, Maya reflects on its absence. The element enables the premise but does not escalate pressure. Early signal and thematic reprise present; causal role moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maya's desire "to discover what ceilings hide" is stated early and drives her search through the ticket office. The motivation is fulfilled when she finds the mainspring and understands the ringmaster's anchoring. No visible friction or cost: she succeeds without trade-off. The phrasing is somewhat abstract ("what ceilings hide" reads thematic rather than urgent). Two beats: initial search and realization. Early signal, middle development, closure satisfaction all met, but the motivation lacks internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" recurs across the piece: the ghost's pressure on Maya, the transferred burden to the machine, Maya's final state ("feeling light, buoyant, a helium balloon tugging at her sternum rather than an anchor"). Tone is coherent and modulates: cool observation in the search, somber recognition at the dialogue, elegiac at closure. The phrase charges the final image by inverting weight into buoyancy. Early signal, development through reprise, closure participation strong. The tone supports the Accumulative lens and reweights the premise.</comment>
