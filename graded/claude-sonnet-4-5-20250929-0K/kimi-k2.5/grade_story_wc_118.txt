<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's "sensitively perceptive" trait is named but never constrains a choice with visible cost; her actions—moving through the library, reading, transcribing—proceed without dramatized internal contradiction or trade-off. The weeping moment ("Elara wept silently") is asserted rather than embodied through specific perception or gesture. Her transformation from probing to transcribing unfolds as a seamless glide rather than a decision that forecloses a path, leaving the closure shift feeling declared rather than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a conceptual premise (displaced axis, dreams stopped, walls as memory repositories) and Elara's goal early, satisfying basic orientation. However, the ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara beginning to read aloud—a stance crystallization—but the cost remains abstract: no on-page sentence shows what she sacrifices or forecloses by becoming the voice. The causality is accumulative-textural (gathering fragments toward a realization), yet the closure image "translating walls into words, dragons into deliverance" gestures at meaning without landing a felt or conceptual price, leaving the before/after legible but the cost implied rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The silo library is vividly rendered with "bronze quiet," "concrete curves," and "shafts of amber light," and the fireplace on the third sub-level provides spatial specificity. Elara's action of pressing her palm against the wall and feeling stored memories shows the environment as an active constraint that shapes her method of excavation. The setting charges the final image when the silo "held its breath," making the micro-setting (wall, fireplace, archive) integral to the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—collecting stories before they vanish—is signaled early and coherent. Elara's discovery of the tapestry and matching it to diary descriptions constitutes one meaningful tightening that deepens her understanding. Yet the escalation lacks a visible cost: she works "through the night" without fatigue, error, or trade-off affecting her tactics, and no live option is foreclosed by her choice to transcribe and read aloud. The final act feels like fulfillment rather than a decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—memory migrating from minds to architecture after collective dreaming ceased—emerges through concrete imagery: the displaced axis, the dragon tapestry as documentation, walls as repositories. The final image "translating walls into words, dragons into deliverance" attempts a resonant answer to the central question but leans toward abstraction ("deliverance") rather than a non-literal particular. The weaver's foresight and Elara's tears gesture at complexity, yet the piece never fully dramatizes a cost or counter-reading that would deepen the thematic stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated, poetic register with strong perceptual signature: "bronze quiet," "dust motes dancing," "mnemonically." Focalization is stable single-POV with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the repository of human experience from sleeping minds to waking walls") that dilutes immediacy, and the phrase "odd historian of the New Stillness" reads as convenient labeling. Under peak emotional pressure (weeping, dawn transcription), the voice texture remains uniform rather than compressing or shifting rhythm to reflect strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose carries strong imagery ("crumbled like dead leaves," "the dragon's eye a single knot of crimson"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the opening two sentences both describe the silo's transformation; "sensitively perceptive" is named and then immediately restated as "biological necessity." The phrase "the bronze quiet of a world turned sideways" and later "the bronze quiet deepened" recycle the motif without added pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("she found," "she realized," "she felt") in the discovery sequence dull immediacy. These artifacts lower density and create minor momentum drag without fully obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic memory shift, Cold War silo repurposed as archive, and medieval tapestry as foreseeing documentation is specific and non-obvious. The displaced-axis premise and "dreams stopped" conceit feel fresh within the speculative frame. The piece commits fully to its logic (walls as memory, sensitively perceptive trait as biological adaptation) and avoids hedging. Minor derivative echoes (lone scholar in archive, apocalypse via cosmic shift) are transformed through the particular image of the dragon tapestry and the mnemonic wall shudder, making the overall angle distinctive despite familiar building blocks.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her actions (moving through the library, opening diaries, pressing her palm to the wall, transcribing, reading aloud) advance the plot. However, her decisions do not create reversals or foreclose options with visible cost; she follows a linear path from discovery to transcription to vocalization without conflict or trade-off. The "odd historian" label is functional but the trait itself (observing, interpreting, speaking aloud) could be performed by any archivist or scholar with minor edits. Setup is clear; middle involvement is continuous but passive; closure participation (beginning to read) is present but not causally pressured.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears early (introduced in the first third) and is handled in multiple beats: Elara finds it between diary pages, examines the dragon's eye, realizes it represents the displaced axis, matches its weave against diary descriptions, places it in an archival case, and recognizes it may hold "the formula to restore what was lost." It returns with reweighted meaning across the sequence and charges the final image ("dragons into deliverance"). The fragment drives Elara's insight and shapes her transcription work, demonstrating necessity across setup, middle, and closure. However, the properties of the tapestry (silk, wool, crimson knot) remain descriptive rather than constraining a specific tactic or choice with cost, preventing entry to the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The displaced axis is signaled early ("the axis had displaced itself by seven degrees") and named as the cause of the dream-cessation and memory migration. Elara realizes "the dragons represented the displaced axis itself" and the concept frames the world-state and her mandate. However, the axis functions primarily as backstory and thematic backdrop; it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter Elara's tactics. The concept shapes stakes (urgency to preserve memory) but remains abstract rather than forcing a tactical decision or trade-off in the present action. Setup is strong; middle and closure participation are thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "sensitively perceptive" is named in the first third and described as "biological necessity when the magnetic fields shifted." Elara's use of it—feeling stories in the concrete, sensing the wall shudder mnemonically—appears in two beats (palm press, wall shudder) and is tied to her method. However, the trait never constrains a choice or imposes a cost; it enables discovery without friction or trade-off. The phrase is label-only without embodied demonstration of what "sensitively perceptive" feels like or costs her. Swappable with "empathic" or "attuned" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Probe" is signaled early ("she had come to probe the fireplace") and drives the inciting action: opening the diaries, finding the tapestry, pressing her palm to the wall, matching evidence, transcribing. Multiple beats trace to probing as method, and the final turn (reading aloud, translating) extends the probing into vocalization. The action is causally central and shapes Elara's sequence of discoveries. However, "probe" could be replaced with "examine," "investigate," or "excavate" with minimal structural change, as the specificity of probing (depth, penetration, resistance) is not dramatized with unique properties or cost. Strong causal presence and closure linkage, but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries in the fireplace are introduced early (first third), provide the tapestry fragment and textual evidence Elara matches, and are present across multiple beats (opening, reading, transcribing). The fireplace's role as a burial site for the weaver's foresight charges the discovery with purpose. The method (finding, reading singed pages, deciphering) shapes Elara's tactics and leads to the closure insight. However, the mechanics of reading half-burned text—challenges, gaps, risk of further damage—are not dramatized; the pages yield information smoothly without constraint or cost. Strong setup and development, moderate causal pressure and closure linkage, but limited specificity in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is established early and provides the physical and symbolic frame: Cold War missile silo repurposed as archive, "bronze quiet," three sub-levels, fireplace, control room. The setting supplies resources (books, diaries, tapestry) and charges the closure when "the silo library held its breath, waiting for her to speak." The wall shudder (mnemonic release) demonstrates the setting as active participant. Elara's palm press and the silo's history of stored fear and children's dreams make the environment integral to her method and final image. Strong causal presence, specificity, and closure linkage; the silo's transformation mirrors the story's theme and enables the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last human dream is dreamt" is signaled in the opening and establishes the world-state and urgency (no more internal dreaming, walls now hold memory). However, it functions as backstory and setting rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. Elara works "through the night" and "by dawn" she has transcribed, but elapsed time does not impose pressure or force trade-offs; she completes her task without fatigue, interruption, or deadline consequence. The post-dream era frames stakes but does not constrain tactics or alter the closure. Setup is strong; middle and closure participation are thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to collect the stories walls have heard" is named early ("this was her mandate, her hunger") and drives Elara's actions: probing the fireplace, reading diaries, pressing the wall, transcribing, reading aloud. The desire is consistent and her final act (beginning to read, "translating walls into words") directly fulfills it. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; Elara pursues it smoothly without friction, doubt, or sacrifice. No moment shows what she forgoes or risks to collect these stories, making the motivation functional but uncontested. Setup and development are clear; closure linkage is present but lacks the friction and cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tone "bronze quiet" is named early and recurs: "bronze quiet of a world turned sideways," "the bronze quiet deepened," Elara's voice is "low and bronze in the quiet." The metallic hush coheres with the post-dream stillness and the silo's Cold War origins. The tone modulates subtly (amber light, dust motes, silence, the wall shudder) and charges the final image when Elara begins to read, breaking the silence with purpose. However, the tone remains largely static across turns; no moment shows it intensifying or contrasting under peak pressure. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate development, but limited modulation to reflect escalation or emotional shift.</comment>
