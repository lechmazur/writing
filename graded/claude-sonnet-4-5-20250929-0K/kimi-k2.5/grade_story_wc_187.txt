<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority leans heavily on elevated diction ("preemptively nostalgic," "aching already for the moments she was about to preserve") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular under stress. The final transformation—"she was becoming the memory she had sought to preserve"—is told rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices (examining shadows, selecting the quill, using rainwater) are present but the stakes remain abstract; no genuine cost or forfeited path is visible on the page. The piece avoids stock phrasing but the emotional progression feels conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes atmospheric detail and thematic weight rather than causal turns. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—Elara joins the crystal chorus, becoming archive—but the cost is asserted ("sealing the story complete") rather than felt on the page. The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence shows what she forfeited or what path closed. The final image reweights prior material, but the lack of tangible sacrifice keeps this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, fog-as-wall, and crystal forecourt constrain Elara's movements and charge the atmosphere. The quartz floor "hummed with residual thunder" and whispers voices, creating a micro-setting that shapes her ritual. The shadow measurements depend on storm-flash illumination, so environment enables the method. However, the setting does not force a choice with visible cost at closure; it serves as backdrop for the thematic merge rather than a crucible. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (Elara notices angles, light, resonance) and the spatial choreography is clean.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the founders' memories before they "belong to history"—is signaled early. The piece deepens through accumulation (moving stone to stone, measuring shadows) rather than reversals. Agency is present (she chooses to use rainwater, to write on her skin) but these actions do not foreclose a live option or force a trade-off with on-page cost. The final merge is presented as inevitable transformation rather than earned sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification occurs (the tallest monument's anomaly) but it does not narrow options or crystallize a price that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—the fluid self, memory as transformation—emerges organically from the shadow measurements and the crystal chorus. "To sculpt identity from experience meant accepting that the self was not fixed, but fluid as weather, mutable as shadow" is a thematic statement but it follows from the ritual and the anomaly. The final image (Elara's voice joining the founders) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a stated moral. However, "preemptively nostalgic" and the self-aware epiphany ("she was both archivist and archive") lean toward articulation rather than implication. The piece resists tidy resolution but edges toward explaining its own metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (angle measurements, storm-light, geometry) and voice remains elevated but stable. Diction is controlled: "susurrus," "actinic white," "conjecture" fit the archivist role. However, the prose reads more like lyric exposition than interior particularity under pressure—phrases such as "preemptively nostalgic for the stories she had not yet transcribed" feel crafted for the reader rather than thought by Elara. Psychic distance is stable but the narrator's certainty about transformation ("she understood that she was both archivist and archive") asserts insight without dramatizing the cost. No dialogue; voice is coherent but lacks a sharp perceptual edge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in descriptive passages but several lines loop thematically without advancing situation: "preemptively nostalgic" appears twice, and the archivist-archive conceit is restated in multiple forms. The metaphor "stormlit clouds that churned beneath the tower like a silver sea" is clear, but "a wall of pearl" and "solidified fog" are repeated without evolution. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Grammar and tense are clean. The final paragraph summarizes the merge rather than enacting it through concrete image, which dulls propulsion at closure. Minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "belong to history and no longer to her private discovery" vs. "becoming the memory she had sought to preserve") cost momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—memory as weather, archivist as archive, shadow geometry encoding emotion—is specific and non-obvious. The stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt offer fresh texture. However, the transformation arc (individual merging with collective past) echoes familiar transcendence templates. The shadow-measurement method and summer-quill are inventive details but remain ornamental; they do not drive a non-obvious moral calculus or turn. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and resists the safety middle, earning credit for coherence and risk. Proximity to "archivist becomes the archive" tropes in speculative fiction is notable but the execution through weather and geometry provides enough specificity to avoid derivative flagging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her actions (examining shadows, selecting the quill, writing on her skin, using rainwater) structure the piece. Setup by the opening; development through the measurement beats; closure participation when she joins the crystal chorus. However, her choices do not create key turns—she follows the ritual without opposition or cost-bearing decision. Observation dominates; the final merge is described rather than chosen. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is present but does not constrain a choice. Band guidance: functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is introduced in paragraph 5 and its mechanics (humming with residual thunder, whispering voices, activated by rain) are established immediately. It appears in multiple beats: Elara kneels among the monuments (para 7), the forecourt whispers louder (para 18), she sits cross-legged in its center (para 23), and the forecourt whispers her name in closure (para 27). The rain unlocks memories, and the quartz transmits fragments, shaping her ritual. Three gates met; causal pressure (the forecourt enables the memory transfer) and closure linkage (final whisper) are strong. Cost connection is present but implied rather than specific to the object's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Collective memory is named in paragraph 3 as Elara's archival charge and recurs as "the collective past" (para 11), "collective memory" (para 25), and the founders' voices (para 27). It shapes the dominant stake (preserving shared experiences before they slip away). However, it remains thematic rather than tactical—no on-page choice hinges on the mechanics of collective memory versus individual memory. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is conceptual (the founders' farewell speech) but does not constrain an action. Band guidance: shapes one key turn (the anomaly revelation) and charges the ending image, but swappable with "ancestral memory" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Preemptively nostalgic" appears in paragraph 4 ("she felt preemptively nostalgic for the stories she had not yet transcribed") and paragraph 17 ("the preemptively nostalgic ache deepen"). It colors Elara's emotional state but does not constrain an action or force a trade-off. The attribute is told twice without on-page cost. Setup present; no middle development or closure participation beyond mood. Late first full articulation (~15% mark). Band guidance: ornamental use; label without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Conjecture" is named in paragraph 10 ("she would conjecture the emotional weight of each memory") and paragraph 21 ("she conjectured that the founder's final memory had been…transformation"). The method is central to her ritual and the anomaly discovery turns on conjecture. Three gates met: setup (para 10), development (the tallest monument, para 21), payoff (the realization feeds the merge). However, "conjecture" is easily swappable with "interpret" or "infer"—the mechanics are not unique. Band guidance: shapes one key turn and contributes to closure, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Examining shadow lengths at monuments" is introduced in paragraph 8 and recurs: measuring the tallest monument's shadow (para 19–20), calculating with brass protractor (para 20), and "one final time" (para 27). The method enables the anomaly discovery (para 21) that triggers the transformation insight (para 22). Three gates met; causal pressure (shadow geometry encodes memories) and closure linkage (final examination precedes the merge) are strong. Specificity is high (angles, brass protractor, storm-flash timing). Cost connection is present (the method exhausts itself, sealing her fate). Band guidance: essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is introduced in paragraph 1 and remains the sole location. It is "an island suspended between earth and heaven," sealed by fog (para 1), with an iron spiral (para 5) and a glass dome (para 2, para 24). The setting enables the shadow measurements (storm-flash illumination, para 8–15) and the rain activates the forecourt (para 5–6). Three gates met; causal pressure (environment supplies light and rain) and closure linkage (the observatory is named in the final paragraph, para 24). However, the setting does not force a choice with visible cost—it is a stage for the ritual rather than a crucible. Band guidance: essential across beats but not indispensable to the transformation logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After fog becomes solid" is established in paragraph 1 ("three days prior") and recurs in paragraph 19 ("the solidified fog that had seeped through the observatory's lower levels") and closure (para 27, "the fog below solidified further, sealing the story complete"). The timeframe anchors the isolation but does not tighten decisions—three days have passed, but Elara's ritual is not shown to be racing a deadline. Setup and payoff present; no middle tightening. Band guidance: functional but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To sculpt identity from experience" is articulated in paragraph 14 ("to shape who she was by understanding who they had been") and paragraph 22 ("to sculpt identity from experience meant accepting that the self was not fixed"). It colors Elara's motivation and the thematic insight. However, it is told rather than dramatized through friction—no on-page moment shows her wanting one identity and paying to claim another. Setup mid-piece; payoff in the thematic statement and merge; no middle conflict. Band guidance: shapes theme and colors closure but lacks visible cost tied to this exact desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Deepening hush" is introduced in paragraph 23 ("the deepening hush that fell between lightning strikes") and recurs subtly throughout: the forecourt whispers grow louder (para 18), then the world "held its breath" (para 23), and the final motionless beat (para 27). The tone modulates from storm-flash intensity to quiet merge. Setup late (para 23, ~85% mark); payoff in the final stillness. Coherent through turns but the single phrase anchors a mood rather than driving pressure. Band guidance: charges the final image but late arrival and static application cap the score.</comment>
