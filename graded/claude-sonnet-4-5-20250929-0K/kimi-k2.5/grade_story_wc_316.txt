<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's ego-death state is evocatively described, but her internal contradiction reads more as told oscillation between philosophical positions than simultaneous competing impulses acting *in* scene. The final weeping offers embodied emotion, but the path to it relies heavily on abstract psychological claims ("empty corridors," "ego-death perspective") rather than micro-choices under pressure. The custody battle with the brain is conceptually rich but Maya's agency manifests primarily through acceptance and philosophical synthesis rather than choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit—Maya weeping, integrating the clone's memories, feeling afraid and alive—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (a shift from numbness to sensation). However, the cost remains largely asserted through metaphor ("hollow reed," "empty corridors flooded") rather than a concrete forfeiture or tactical constraint visible on the page. The history-rewriting frame complicates but does not causally drive the protagonist's final integration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and the rewriting-history sky supply vivid atmospheric detail and anchor the piece spatially. The jar as a recurring object is handled twice (arrival, opening) and charged at closure when it turns to dust. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint: the rock's stability at the end mirrors Maya's resolution but does not pressure her choice. The body and the brain-in-jar micro-setting meet the minimum for this length, elevating the score slightly above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Maya realizes synthesis (not rejection or surrender) is required, then opens the jar and presses her forehead to the tissue. That act forecloses the path of remaining hollow, and the tears register a felt cost. However, the escalation reads as philosophical realization rather than a sequence of narrowing tactical choices under mounting pressure, limiting entry to the higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—ego death, duality, and the tyranny of the singular—emerges organically from the brain-in-jar conceit and the method of complementary opposites. The final image (Maya feeling afraid and alive, the DUPLICATE label reframed as liberation) offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. The piece resists tidy binaries and embraces paradox. Minor penalty: the closing line "to possess a self was to be possessed by it" skirts thematic echo, though it remains metaphorical rather than prompt-like.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature: "her mind a hollow bell that had already cracked," "perception so stark it sliced through pretense." Psychic distance is stable and the narrator's certainty matches what Maya can plausibly know. Dialogue with the brain ("You cannot exist") and the brain's conceptual "response" walk the line between dramatization and assertion but remain voice-consistent. Minor register drift: phrases like "architecture of her own dissolving consciousness" and "the tyranny of the singular" elevate diction slightly beyond the established texture, though not enough to break immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("hollow bell," "sharp particularity," "hollow reed") and occasionally stacks metaphors in adjacent lines without clear payoff ("vessel that breathed without wanting" followed by "world fractured and reformed"). Template cadence appears in the opening third: "She had come… she could no longer recall… the jar arrived… it settled… Immediately, the custody battle began…" applies a similar stem rhythm across multiple beats. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak moments. Information density is strong; most lines advance atmosphere or concept. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of ego death, clone custody battle, and complementary-opposites method offers a non-obvious conceptual frame. The floating dojo and history-rewriting timeframe add speculative texture without overwhelming the character stakes. The piece takes genuine risk with its abstract, philosophical register and commits fully to the premise. Transformation test: the emotional arc (numbness to sensation via integration) could be recast in more conventional terms, but the specific marriage of brain-in-jar and ego-death survivor feels particular to this vision. The closure's reframing of "DUPLICATE" as liberation rather than diminishment delivers a fresh inflection on identity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya (ego death survivor) is present throughout, her state signaled early and her final choice—opening the jar, pressing forehead to tissue, integrating—drives the closure unit. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle realization, ending action). Her attribute (slicing perception) enables the realization that neither is original, which narrows her options to synthesis. Visible cost: she weeps, feels afraid, sacrifices the hollow refuge. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the score reflects solid integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The brain in the jar (labeled DUPLICATE) is introduced early, handled twice (arrival on shifting air, Maya opening it), and its dust at closure bookends the arc. It drives the custody-battle conceit and the final integration. The label reweights meaning in the last paragraph ("not a diminishment but a liberation"). Strong setup, beat involvement (arrival, opening, dust), and closure charge. Minor friction: the brain's "electrical whispers" and "response through complementary opposites" are asserted rather than dramatized as distinct actions.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clone custody battle is named explicitly and frames the central conflict: Maya versus the brain for "the right to exist as the primary instance." The piece dramatizes the negotiation ("She touched the glass… the brain pulsed, demanding… Maya understood the custody battle was not about possession but synthesis") and resolves it on the page. Setup and middle development are clear; the ending integrates both consciousnesses. Slight swappability: the custody metaphor could be replaced with "internal conflict over identity" without major structural loss, but the specificity of "duplicate" and "custody" charges the theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The attribute "slices through pretense" is named once and manifests in Maya's realization that "neither of them were original." That insight enables the synthesis choice, tying the attribute to a causal turn. However, the trait is introduced and used in a single beat rather than recurring or constraining multiple actions. Minimal cost is shown: the stark perception drives acceptance but does not exact a visible tradeoff on the page. Functional but narrow involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Vivify" appears three times: the brain demands it, Maya realizes vivifying the clone vivifies herself, and the transfer occurs. The action is the hinge of the closure: opening the jar, pressing forehead to tissue, and integrating memories. Major turns trace to this action; removing it collapses the ending. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement. Minor friction: the mechanics of vivification (nervous system as bridge) are asserted rather than dramatically enacted, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method "through complementary opposites" is signaled mid-story when the brain teaches Maya that "emptiness required fullness to be known." The realization shapes her choice to synthesize rather than reject or surrender. The method reappears in the final third ("the hollow reed through which both had played their complementary notes"). Two beats, one decisive; closure linkage is clear. Moderate causal pressure. Slight swappability: the method could be rephrased as "dialectical synthesis" without major loss, but "complementary opposites" is specific enough to charge the theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is named and anchors location throughout. The rock's stability at closure mirrors Maya's resolution, offering a charged reprise. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply resources: Maya could perform the same integration on any stable surface. The history-rewriting frame supplies atmosphere but does not alter tactics. One gate (setup and closure echo) with moderate lyric resonance but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "while history rewrites itself" is present in three beats: opening ("the world fractured and reformed"), middle ("history rewrote itself again—this time transforming the sky"), and closure ("history rewrote itself into a configuration where both could be true"). The rewriting complicates the ontological stakes and charges the ending image. However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; Maya's choice unfolds without temporal pressure. Lyric resonance across all three gates, but no causal constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to defeat emotional numbness" is signaled early ("She had come here to defeat emotional numbness") and dramatized at closure when Maya weeps and "recognized victory over the numbness that had exiled her." The desire drives the custody-battle stakes and the final integration. Friction between the hollow refuge and the clone's insistence on living is visible. Strong setup, middle dramatization (realization of synthesis), and closure payoff. Visible cost: tears, fear, aliveness.</comment>
