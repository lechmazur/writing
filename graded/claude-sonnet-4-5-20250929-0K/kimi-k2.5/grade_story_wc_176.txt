<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior world is concrete and rooted in embodied craft—fingers stained, movements technically gentle, grief transformed to purpose. The backstory of the failed death-mask is purposeful and directly motivates present action. However, her emotional arc moves too smoothly from frozen regret to flowing purpose without messy contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final smile and "ice in her heart finally melted" reads as a tidy emotional resolution that lacks the ambiguity and cost visibility required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through density of imagery, ritual work, and the convergence of light, rope, and punched card toward the closure moment when names glow on ice walls. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's forgiveness materializes as preserved names, reweighting her failure and the village's loss—with felt cost (her years of grief, the night's work). One substantive issue: the ending extends past the climactic projection into reflective summary ("Tomorrow the villagers would come...") that explicates rather than trusts the image, diluting closure impact by ~0.4.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (aurora leaking through translucent ice, breath fogging, packed-ice workbench) that reflects Elara's craft priorities. The rope as conduit, the bronze cradle, and the light-as-instrument setup all constrain her method and charge the final image. The setting enables and pressures her work throughout. Minor issue: "glacial moraine where the old music-hall had collapsed decades past" introduces a past location that adds context but doesn't shape present choice, a small efficiency slip in a piece already dense with purposeful detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names to complete what she failed before—is clear early and drives all action. The work itself (undoing braids, aligning perforations, casting the cradle) provides concrete tactical progression. The tightening occurs when the reconfigured rope captures aurora light and projects names, a meaningful deepening that reweights her past failure. Cost is visible (the night's labor, the years of self-forgiveness, the technical precision required) but the piece avoids a live choice or renunciation moment that would narrow options under pressure; instead we watch skilled execution more than agonized decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: creation through negation (lost wax), preservation through transformation (rope reconfigured, memory translated from sound to light), forgiveness as the heat that makes bronze flow smooth. The final image of names glowing like stars trapped in wall offers resonance without moralizing. However, the ending paragraphs over-articulate theme: "They would remember that the dead are not lost, only waiting to be cast in new forms" and "forgiveness was the heat that made the bronze flow smooth and true" state what the image already shows, reducing subtext to text. This thematic echo in the final third prevents entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: lyric density, technical vocabulary (lost wax, sinew, tensile history), metaphoric precision ("meltwater finding cracks," "circuit...conduit...mechanical medium"). POV remains stable in Elara's focalization. Distance is consistent—close third that accesses her perception and purpose without head-hopping. The prose modulates effectively between craft detail and emotional reflection. One persistent pattern: nearly every sentence in the middle third uses a three-part construction (noun, elaboration, metaphoric reweighting) that creates a drumbeat rhythm where variation would sharpen pressure, e.g., "The rope was not just fiber; it was a circuit, a conduit...a mechanical medium."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer craft detail with emotional stakes. Figurative language is purposeful and mostly coherent. However, overwriting appears throughout: "snowmelt ardor had thawed the glaciers in her chest, turning frozen regret into flowing purpose" stacks three metaphors for one concept. "Each perforation a letter in a name, a note in a life, a breath suspended in paper" repeats the pattern. The final two paragraphs loop thematically—"reconfigured like rope, translated like memory, held in light rather than sound" restates what prior action showed, creating paraphrase drag. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" across the middle section. These artifacts appear in peak beats and touch closure, triggering the artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 plus −0.3 for final-third presence, total −1.1 applied here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost wax casting, aurora physics, rope as light conduit, and street organ memory is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of tropes (dead mentor, artist's redemption) through the particulars of glacial preservation and light-rope mechanics adds freshness. However, the emotional arc—artist haunted by past failure finds redemption through solitary craft project—follows a well-worn template. The piece does not fully transform this premise; the villagers' arrival tomorrow is promised but not dramatized, leaving the human stakes abstract. Risk-taking in the dense lyric mode and technical vocabulary elevates within band but doesn't overcome the derivative redemption structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's on-page choices (placing scrap on workbench, undoing rope braids, fitting scrap into cradle) drive all three major beats and enable the closure projection. Her prior failure and present skill create the causal spine. Present in setup, development, and payoff with high specificity—her craft identity is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The punched card appears in setup (villagers give it to her), development (she uses its perforation pattern to guide rope reconfiguration), and payoff (fitted into cradle, it projects names). Its specific property—holes encoding names—is causally essential and shapes two distinct beats. High irreplaceability; removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" frames the premise (music-hall card as frozen archive, names as sound made visible) and appears in the ending (memory translated, preserved). It shapes stakes conceptually but does not constrain a choice or create visible tradeoff. Mostly thematic rather than tactical; present early and at closure but not in middle pressure beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" constrains her handling of the fragile card ("violence would shatter the fragile archive") and the rope work ("fingers moved with the precision of meltwater finding cracks"). It enables success and reflects her learned discipline post-failure. Present in setup and development with visible cost (precision required, time invested). The trait matters to outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is the story's central action: light passes through punched holes to project names onto ice walls, making the forgotten visible. This act constitutes the climax and closure, redefining Elara's failure as transformation. Present in method (rope captures aurora light), peak beat (projection occurs), and ending (names glow, villagers will see). Irreplaceable—swapping for another verb ("preserve," "record") would require major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reconfiguring rope braids is signaled early ("began reconfiguring"), detailed through development ("undoing complex weaves and retying them according to geometric pattern"), and enables closure (rope becomes lantern, captures light). The method's mechanics—braids as circuit aligned with perforations—matter causally. Present in all three gates with high specificity; removing this exact method breaks the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum provides the packed-ice workbench, translucent ceiling that admits aurora, and ice walls as projection surface. It enables her work (cold preserves the card, aurora supplies light) and charges the final image (names glow in frozen chamber). Present in setup, constrains method, and participates in closure. Strong integration though not as causally indispensable as character or object.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" anchors Elara's emotional starting point (post-failure, post-thaw) and contrasts with "before" in the opening paragraph. It shapes her present capability—she can now complete what grief once broke—but does not create a live time pressure or deadline. Lyric reprise (frozen → flowing, past failure → present success) that reweights the stake, though the time element itself remains static. Setup and payoff present; middle development is implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Preserving forgotten names drives every on-page action: receiving the card, studying its perforations, reconfiguring rope, projecting names. The motivation is dramatized through her hands-on work and contrasted with her past failure. Visible cost (the night's labor, years of self-forgiveness, technical precision required). Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure; the story would collapse without this exact desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor"—steady thaw, persistent warmth against cold—appears explicitly in the opening and closing paragraphs, coloring the aurora's intensification and the final image ("snowmelt ardor fill the space"). The tone modulates from reflective (opening) to focused (craft work) to resonant (ending). It charges the closure by contrasting frozen regret with flowing purpose. However, the phrase itself is somewhat ornamental; the tonal effect would survive without the exact label. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but mid-level indispensability.</comment>
