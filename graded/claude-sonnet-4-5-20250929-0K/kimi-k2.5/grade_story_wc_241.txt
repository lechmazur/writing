<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's interior texture is established through her profession and father's legacy, but her choices on the page remain observational rather than decisive. The heart attack provides embodied constraint ("fingers trembled," "cautious tempo"), yet the evening's action is fundamentally passive—she follows scrawls, arrives at the library, calculates a probability without dramatized cost. The final choice to "teach differently" is asserted rather than enacted through a micro-decision that forecloses a path. Internal contradiction exists (father's desperation vs. her discipline) but does not drive a visible tradeoff in this single evening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately (professor, subway/library, post-heart-attack) and sustains an Accumulative lens throughout. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of carrying contradictions "like a lantern against the dark" reweights the opening tremor and her father's legacy with felt cost (her body's fragility, the acknowledged brutality of chance). However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—no single on-page sentence makes the price undeniable in action or forfeiture. The lens holds, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than a charged image that forces the reader to feel the loss.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "rainwashed library," "books swollen with moisture," "mica pane casting striped shadows." The lantern's mica functions as micro-setting, refracting light into "four distinct ghosts" that embody the lucid contradiction theme. The subway scrawls and library stacks provide atmosphere but do not constrain a pivotal choice—Maya's evening unfolds in observation rather than navigation. The setting charges the final image (rain, candle, fractured light) and thus crosses into the 7.0+ band, though it stops short of altering tactics or options on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding meaning in randomness after near-death—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Maya's reflections on her father, her discipline, and her damaged heart, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options with visible cost. The evening's "rebellion" is theoretical; she walks, observes, calculates, and decides to "teach differently" without dramatizing what she sacrifices or forecloses. The Accumulative lens tolerates this design, but escalation remains interior and declarative rather than enacted through a decision that alters her stance or tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between her father's gambling and her probabilistic discipline, anchored in concrete images (tarnished lantern, mica pane, subway scrawls). The final image—"carrying the contradictions like a lantern against the dark"—reweights prior material but edges toward direct statement rather than non-literal resonance. The line "losing could also be a form of necessary, lucid grace" risks thematic summary. Subtext operates in the fractured light and the four-leaf clover motif, yet the piece occasionally names its thesis ("lucid contradiction," "beautiful violation") rather than leaving it implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Maya's perceptual signature is filtered through her academic lens ("Bayesian inference," "statistical likelihoods"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("verdant poetry," "lucid contradiction demanding rigor and surrender") that, while voice-motivated by her profession, can feel more essayistic than embodied under pressure. Rhythmic control is present but repetitive sentence stems ("She understood," "She traced," "She remembered") create minor template cadence. The prose reflects her mind but does not degrade syntax or perception under stress, missing an opportunity for dynamic modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences layer image, theme, and character. However, paraphrase loops appear: "chance was not merely chaos but a lucid contradiction" is restated in multiple forms across the piece. Template cadence is visible in repeated "She [verb]" constructions and parallel "to widen perspectives," "to traverse the random" infinitive phrases. Figurative language is dense ("clover melancholy," "mineral window that fractured light") but occasionally stacks without breathing room. The final paragraph compresses multiple closures ("teach differently," "necessary, lucid grace," "carrying the contradictions") in a way that dilutes each beat's distinctness.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of probability theory, personal grief, and post-trauma meaning-making is thoughtfully specific. The mica lantern and subway scrawls provide fresh particulars that avoid stock symbols. However, the core arc—academic learns to embrace uncertainty after health crisis—is a familiar template, and the piece does not fully transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or visceral tradeoff. The conceptual layering (gambler's daughter, heart attack survivor, probability professor) is well-integrated, but the evening's action remains observational rather than risk-taking in structure or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Maya's dual identity as compulsive gambler's daughter and probability professor frames her interior conflict and appears in reflections throughout (father's bets, her teaching, the lantern). She makes no key on-page decision that turns on this identity—her choices are to follow scrawls, reflect, and resolve to teach differently. Present by setup, involved in reflective beats, but does not constrain a middle or closure choice with visible cost. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lantern appears early (canvas bag), is handled at the library desk, and returns in the final image ("carrying the contradictions like a lantern"). The mica pane's light-fracturing property embodies the "lucid contradiction" theme and charges multiple beats. However, Maya does not use the lantern to make a choice or alter her tactics—it functions as symbolic backdrop rather than causal tool. Three gates present; thematic resonance is strong but agency link is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is named explicitly multiple times and structures Maya's reflection on probability vs. chance, discipline vs. wildness. It shapes her evening's conceptual stake but does not force an on-page tradeoff or decision. The mica pane and fractured light visualize the concept, and the final image reweights it. Present in setup and closure; constrains thought but not action. Mid-band for thematic work without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is mentioned once in the opening third ("theoretically rebellious against the certainty of her own mortality") and informs her decision to traverse the city by scrawls. It does not constrain a later choice or carry visible cost—her rebellion is more conceptual stance than enacted tradeoff. Label-only use; no middle beat or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears in both physical and conceptual forms: she traverses the city by subway scrawls, and the piece closes with "to traverse the random." The action frames the evening's structure and the final realization, but the traversal itself is not pressured—no blocked path, no cost to moving. The concept reweights at closure but the physical traversal does not drive a turn. Early signal, lyric reprise, but low causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Interpreting subway scrawls is introduced early ("Look left at the clover," "All paths converge at water") and motivates her route to the library. The mechanics are not detailed—how she chooses which scrawls to follow, what alternatives she rejects. The method seeds the evening but does not constrain a middle choice or reappear in the closure image. Setup and one functional beat; missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer provides vivid atmosphere ("glass walls weeping," "books swollen with moisture," "green, luminous water") and anchors the second half of the story. The setting does not pressure Maya's choices—she could reflect and calculate anywhere. The storm drums "in rhythms that matched her pulse," offering thematic resonance, but the library supplies no resource or obstacle that alters her tactics. Setup and ending presence; no middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The heart attack is referenced throughout as embodied constraint (trembling fingers, cautious tempo, damaged heart) and motivates her evening's quest. However, "after" is a static frame rather than a live clock—three months have passed, and no immediate post-attack pressure tightens her decisions tonight. The timeframe informs her motivation but does not escalate within the evening's window. Present in setup and reflections; no tactical tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To widen perspectives responsibly" is named explicitly and drives Maya's conceptual stake: she seeks meaning in randomness while honoring rigor. The motivation is told more than dramatized—her actions (following scrawls, reflecting, calculating) enact the desire, but no on-page friction tests it. No moment where widening conflicts with responsibility in a choice with visible cost. Setup and thematic echo; weak middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is introduced early ("the clover melancholy of such accidental, verdant poetry") and modulates through wistful reflection, grief over her father, and quiet acceptance at closure. The tone is coherent and charges the final image of walking through rain with contradictions as lantern. It breathes with pressure (heart attack weight, father's loss) and supports the Accumulative lens. Present across beats and ending; strong atmospheric work but stops short of indispensability.</comment>
