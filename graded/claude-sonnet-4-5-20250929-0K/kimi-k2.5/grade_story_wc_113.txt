<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are clear and embodied through sensory detail (water pulsing at her boots, tracing stains), and her musical intuition drives the climactic choice. Internal contradiction appears subtly: she documents decay yet seeks creation, though this tension could deepen. The choice to play feels somewhat inevitable rather than a difficult fork with visible cost; she faces no meaningful obstacle or renunciation. Minor deduction for the ghost's "acknowledgment" reading as external validation rather than internal change with foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (water receding, hush shifting from unstruck to completed chords) with visible cost—the program dissolves, the conversation ends. Escalation proceeds through pattern accumulation: lantern placement, spiral matching ripples, ghost materializing. One meaningful deepening when her playing answers the century-old question. Cost is legible: the antique program's final dissolution and the "in between space collapsing." Minor slip: the resolution feels assured rather than hard-won; no live obstacle threatens failure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flooded pit, submerged bench, and lantern-lit reflections are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's musical profession (unstruck chords, liquid harmonies, resonating chamber). The setting constrains choice: lantern angles dictate her position, water depth signals progress. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The "in between space" motif charges the final image when it collapses into coherence. Minor limit: occupational detail (cellist, conductor's podium) remains atmospheric rather than technically specific in ways that test her skill.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing Vane's interrupted composition—is signaled early and maintained. One meaningful tightening: discovering the stains are deliberate language, then positioning lanterns to reveal shadow instructions. Her agency (playing the implied melody) drives the climax, and the water's six-inch recession offers visible payoff. The cost is the program's dissolution and the ghost's departure. Weakness: no live complication threatens her attempt; the collaboration proceeds smoothly once she commits, reducing tension. A single reversal or obstacle would elevate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of unfinished work seeking resolution emerges organically through water-damaged hieroglyphs, unstruck chords, and the "in between space" motif. The antique program's dissolution at closure reweights prior material without moralizing: the conversation ends because it succeeded, not because of a stated lesson. Subtext operates in the wordless exchange and the program's "fresh bleeding" during performance. The final image—hush of completed chords replacing unstruck ones—offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor limit: the ghost's acknowledgment risks overt symbolism, though the image remains concrete.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: musical metaphors (unstruck chords, sympathetic vibration), focus on patterns and harmonies. Diction is elevated but mostly voice-consistent ("hydraulic ghost," "liquid cartography"). Weakness: register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("wordless conversation conducted through the medium of organic decay") that sits uncomfortably against sensory immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate. The piece teaches its lyric compression early and sustains it, though some phrases feel slightly over-written for the POV's urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance atmosphere and situation. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the performance. Clarity remains strong through complex spatial choreography. Weaknesses: overwriting in multiple passages—"in between space where the boundary between liquid and air dissolved into silver shimmers," "hydraulic ghost finally heard"—stacks metaphor without added meaning. Paraphrase loop: "unstruck chords" concept recycled across opening, middle, and close without fresh angle. Template cadence in several beats: "She understood... She was meant to... She positioned..." Minor filter-verb stack in the climax paragraph. These artifacts don't obscure causality but reduce propulsion. Deduction: −0.8 for density issues and loops touching multiple beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The water-damage-as-code premise offers a fresh angle on ghost communication, and the flooded opera house as instrument is specific. Emotional specificity in the "hush of unstruck chords" elevates familiar haunting tropes. Weaknesses: the collaboration proceeds without friction or surprise once Elara commits; the ghost's immediate acknowledgment and water recession feel too tidy. The core framework—artist completes dead artist's work via discovered artifact—is a recognizable template not fully transformed by new particulars. Proximity check passes; no close echoes detected. The story executes its premise cleanly but safely.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (orchestra pit musician, specifically cellist) is present throughout, drives two key beats (decoding the program, performing the implied melody), and her professional skill enables the closure. Her choices—arriving early, tracing stains, positioning lanterns, voicing the melody—create all major turns. The final resolution depends on her musicianship. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor limit: her role as "resident cellist for the restoration society" frames expectation but the restoration work itself doesn't constrain her ghost-hunting choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The antique opera program appears in beat one (withdrawn from podium), beat two (tracing stains, realizing they're code), beat three (positioning lanterns per its instructions), and closure (grows damp, creates new instructions during performance, dissolves into receding tide). It constrains her actions (lantern angles) and charges the final image (dissolution as satisfaction). Strong causal involvement and irreplaceability—no other object could hold Vane's water-damaged code. Cost linkage: its dissolution signals completed exchange. Excellent setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"In between spaces" shapes the premise (flooded pit as neither aquatic nor terrestrial) and the dominant stake (breaking the loop, collapsing the in-between into coherence). It appears in the opening imagery, the "boundary between liquid and air" motif, and the closure line where the space "collapses into a singular, coherent moment." The concept drives her goal to resolve stasis. Weakness: mostly atmospheric and thematic; it doesn't materially constrain her tactics or create a trade-off. Strong thematic integration but moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" appears early ("inspired by dreams filled with liquid harmonies") and enables her choice to arrive earlier and persist in decoding the program. It's necessary for her heightened receptivity but functions more as background motivation than a trait that constrains a specific on-page choice with visible cost. The inspiration doesn't force a trade-off or create friction; it simply explains why she's receptive. Functional but somewhat replaceable with "obsessed" or "compelled." Present in setup and vaguely in development; limited payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is explicit in her realization: "She was meant to disrupt the stasis that had calcified here, to break the loop of that unstruck chord." The action drives the climax—her performance disrupts the century-long silence—and the payoff (water receding, ghost departing). It shapes her goal and the resolution. Minor limit: the verb "disrupt" appears as internal narration but isn't tested against resistance; the disruption succeeds smoothly. Strong presence in middle realization and closure, moderate causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is the core mechanic: introduced early (stains resolving into face, hand, spirals), developed through tracing and interpretation (new images appearing where light intersects water), and drives the climax (program bleeds fresh instructions during performance). The method is irreplaceable—dry ink wouldn't work—and constrains her tactics (lantern positioning per stain angles). It enables discovery, guides action, and transforms at closure (fresh bleeding, then dissolution). Excellent setup, development, payoff, and specificity. Strong causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns is established immediately and maintained throughout. The setting supplies resources (water as resonating chamber, lantern angles revealing shadow instructions) and constrains her position (partially submerged bench, lantern placement dictated by stains). The water's six-inch recession is the visible proof of success, making the setting causally active at closure. The flickering light creates the shadow-puppet effect that directs her. Strong setup, functional development (multiple choices shaped by the space), and charged payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" establishes tone and the temporal quality of suspended anticipation. The phrase recurs at closure ("not of unstruck chords now, but of completed ones"), reweighting prior material. However, it functions thematically rather than as a live clock; no deadline tightens her choices, and the passage of "hours rather than seconds" is atmospheric rather than tactical. The timeframe shapes mood but doesn't constrain decisions. Present in setup and payoff with thematic charge, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unravel the ghost's code is clear, signaled early ("compelled by a creativity she could not name," discovering the program is "a language, a code left by a ghost"), and drives her actions across multiple beats: tracing stains, positioning lanterns, performing the implied melody. The goal faces no significant obstacle but it shapes the arc and finds resolution (the code answered, ghost heard). The desire is embodied in her choices rather than merely stated. Strong setup, consistent development, clear payoff. Minor limit: the want doesn't conflict visibly with a competing need or fear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" is established early ("wordless conversation conducted through the medium of organic decay") and maintained throughout: the program's silent instructions, the exchange "without words" during performance, the ghost's "silence that nonetheless conveyed recognition." Tone is coherent and modulates appropriately—quiet attention building to performance intensity, then resolution hush. The tone charges the final image (conversation completed "across the flooded darkness"). Strong thematic consistency and closure integration. Minor slip: the phrase "wordless conversation" appears as direct narration, slightly over-articulating the effect.</comment>
