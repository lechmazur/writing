<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is specific and her profession shapes perception, but her decision-making remains abstract. The narrator's motivation is clear yet their choices stay passive—observing rather than driving turns. The jade cicada exchange provides embodied weight, but the final "keep this" gesture feels more symbolic than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (Maya's need to document margins versus commitment) but never forces a costly micro-choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as Charged Poise: the jade cicada exchange crystallizes options (stay/leave, dissolution/solidity) with the cost felt in the week-long suspension and the narrator's acceptance of uncertainty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the grotto-pool-cicada-transition layering, and the final image reweights "transition period" from threat to threshold. Causality is clean within the reflective mode; the narrator's question → Maya's indirect approach → cicada gift → mutual agreement to wait forms a motivated sequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator shifts from demanding an answer to accepting the liminal space.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto is concretely anchored (limestone basin, open ceiling, starlight through jade) and constrains the conversation's intimacy. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting: its translucence and warmth are handled across beats and charge the final exchange. Sensory detail is purposeful—starlight casting emerald shadows, cool stone, the grotto's breathing air—and filtered through Maya's professional attention to margins. The water's edge as a spatial metaphor for their relationship is integrated without becoming overt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Maya will stay through winter—is signaled immediately and pressure deepens when the narrator reframes the ask from answer to acknowledgment. The tightening is genuine: the cicada gift transforms the stakes from binary (stay/leave) to textured (testing the transition). However, the escalation is more conceptual than visceral; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the cost remains prospective ("next week") rather than paid on the page. One meaningful turn occurs when the narrator releases the demand for resolution, altering the terms of their negotiation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tidal-pool/grotto/cicada/transition cluster without thesis statements. The core concept—transition periods as both loss and possibility—is embodied in Maya's work and the cicada's metamorphosis metaphor. The ending offers a resonant answer: continuation rather than resolution as "the most honest transition period of all" reweights the opening question. Subtext operates in Maya's tangential approach and the narrator's shift from demand to patience. Minor slip: "warmly observant" in paragraph four reads slightly label-like, though Maya's gaze on water and anemones earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (watching Maya's indirection, understanding her "tangential path") is consistent. Free indirect style blends cleanly when channeling Maya's philosophy. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Maya's cicada story advances through indirection, the narrator's final offer shifts the conversational stakes. Minor weakness: some phrasing ("the delicate negotiation between them," "the most honest transition period of all") edges toward essayistic register during peak moments, slightly distancing the reader from lived experience. Psychic distance otherwise modulates purposefully.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences do double work (setting as metaphor, object as choice). Rhythm varies and propulsion is steady. However, two adjacent sentences in paragraph nine paraphrase each other: "I spend my life in the margins" followed by extended explanation of margins is near-redundant (−0.2). Figurative language occasionally stacks: "between stone and pool, between solid and reflection" then immediately "margins...dying ecosystems...clock running out...texture" risks density without clear escalation (−0.3). The final "stars turned slowly, indifferent...yet somehow witness" is a stock construction. No loops touch closure, limiting deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The tidal-pool chronicler as protagonist and the grotto-as-liminal-space frame offer specific, earned synthesis. The cicada's translucence is a fresh detail that charges the exchange. However, the broader arc—a difficult relationship conversation in a symbolic natural setting where one partner deflects and the other learns patience—follows a recognizable literary template. The "years underground, then a brief singing life" cicada metaphor, while apt, is close kin to well-worn metamorphosis symbolism. Transformation is present but incremental; the story commits fully to its premise without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her profession shapes her observational method (studying the pool as she would tide pools, her philosophy of margins). Her choice to give the cicada and set the week timeline alters the narrator's tactics in the final beat. However, her key decisions occur mostly in dialogue and reflection rather than physical action; the profession constrains perception more than it drives plot turns. Present in setup, middle (tangential approach), and payoff (cicada gift), earning all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The jade cicada appears in three distinct beats: introduction with starlight detail, placement at water's edge, and transfer to the narrator as a trust token. Its translucence and warmth are handled concretely. The object's metamorphosis symbolism directly informs Maya's explanation of transition periods and its transfer enacts the closure: the narrator holding it as proof of continuation. The cicada's return next week is promised, reweighting it as a test of their bond. Causal pressure is strong; the object enables the final negotiation and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Transition periods" is named early and shapes every layer: Maya's tidal-pool work, the cicada metaphor, the pause in conversation, the grotto as threshold, and the narrator's realization that they inhabit a liminal space. The concept constrains tactics—Maya refuses a binary answer, the narrator shifts to accept the in-between—and charges the closure ("continuation—the most honest transition period of all"). However, it risks becoming a thematic echo rather than a unique mechanical constraint; the word "transition" appears frequently enough to approach over-articulation (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is attributed to Maya in paragraph four and demonstrated through her attention to the pool, anemones, and the cicada's details. It enables her tangential approach (observing rather than answering directly) and informs her professional identity. However, the trait is more label than lever; it does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The attribute is consistent and embodied in her gaze and speech, but it could be replaced with a near-synonym ("attentive," "perceptive") without altering plot structure. Setup and middle presence are clear; closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Foresee" appears once in Maya's dialogue: "I can foresee the way this water will recede by morning." The verb characterizes her professional skill but does not drive a turn or redefine options. The water's predicted recession serves as metaphor (stranded memories) rather than a plot mechanism that alters the present conversation. Swappable with "predict" or "anticipate" with no structural loss. Present in middle dialogue but absent from setup and closure participation, capping at 4.6 per the missing-setup rule.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through tangential approach" is signaled early ("approaching my question tangentially, circling it like water around stone") and demonstrated throughout: Maya responds with the cicada story instead of a direct answer, discusses her work to frame her need for time. The method shapes the entire conversational tactic and is named again when the narrator understands it. However, the approach is more thematic architecture than a mechanical constraint with cost; it does not narrow options so much as characterize Maya's style. Present in setup, middle, and understood at closure, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient grotto frames the scene from the opening and supplies concrete resources: the water basin Maya studies, the starlight that illuminates the cicada, the cool air and echoing walls that enforce intimacy. The setting constrains the conversation's privacy and pace; the grotto's "breathing" and the stars as witnesses charge the negotiation. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling by the basin, standing, kneeling together). The setting participates in closure when the narrator touches "the cool stone beside the jade carving" and the stars turn above. Strong setup, middle, and payoff presence; causal pressure is solid.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—"across the pause in a difficult conversation"—is signaled in the opening line (the question "suspended in the cool air") and tracked as the pause deepens, becomes its own language, and finally ends "not with resolution but with continuation." The pause tightens decisions: the narrator must choose whether to press or wait, and Maya uses the silence to frame her answer. However, the pause is more conceptual duration than a live ticking clock; no urgency from the night deepening forces the exchange. Present in setup, middle turn, and explicit at closure; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is Maya's stated motivation in her long dialogue turn and is demonstrated through her profession (documenting evaporating ecosystems, seeing "how time has texture—rough in some places, smooth in others"). The desire drives her refusal to answer immediately and her request for the week to test whether time "will flow smooth between us or catch like barnacles on rock." However, the phrasing edges toward theme statement rather than embodied want; we see Maya acting on the need but the language is abstract. Setup, middle, and closure presence are clear; friction between the want and the narrator's need for an answer creates modest cost.</comment>
