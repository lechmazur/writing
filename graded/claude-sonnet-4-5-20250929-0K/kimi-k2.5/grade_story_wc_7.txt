<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to create beauty from ruins is signaled early, but her interior life is dominated by label-heavy abstractions ("informally wise," "synaptic plasticity," "phantom pains") rather than embodied contradiction. The final planting reads as executed ritual rather than a choice under pressure; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The chef's gift is told through metaphor ("tasting memories") but never dramatized in a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values or genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mara, greenhouse, eclipse) appear within the first 120 words; the piece unfolds as a single continuous scene. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (seed planted, vines grow, fruit ripens) that reweights the premise of memory-pruning as gardening. However, the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("disciplined neuroscience," "gentle rebellion") rather than felt on the page; no specific forfeiture or failure charges the final image. The alignment's "once-in-a-lifetime" constraint is declared but never tests a tactic or narrows a window in real time.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly rendered early (corrugated iron, orange decay, shattered glass) and the eclipse light briefly charges the setting ("amber light that made the rust glow"). Yet the environment does not constrain a single choice; Mara's planting proceeds without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The contaminated soil and dead tomatoes are atmospheric rather than tactical obstacles. Micro-setting (body, tool) is absent; no physical detail alters her approach or the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—planting the knowledge fruit seed—is signaled early but never faces a meaningful test or complication. The "pruning" of accumulated trauma is summarized in one paragraph of meditative release without resistance, micro-reversal, or visible cost. The eclipse's once-in-a-lifetime timing is declared but does not tighten the window or force a trade-off. The seed's immediate growth at the end resolves the goal without prior escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme (creation from ruins, neural gardening as rebellion) is declared rather than emergent from scene particulars. The closing sentences state the thesis overtly: "understanding that to grow something truly new, one must first ruthlessly cut back what has died inside" and "the biological bridge between the old world and the new." The fruit's "sweet, terrifying possibility of neural change" at the banquet is told as future intention, not dramatized cost. Recurrent motifs (rust, synaptic plasticity) function as labels rather than constraints that charge the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into academic and diagnostic registers ("synaptic plasticity," "prefrontal cortex actively pruned," "dendritic weight," "molecular blueprint") that clash with the lyric texture and read as authorial intrusion rather than Mara's voice under pressure. The prose modulates between vivid image ("tasting forty years of acid rain") and exposition ("the biological miracle of neural adaptation") without a consistent perceptual signature. No dialogue appears; interiority is often summary rather than immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often mixed: "overgrown with thorny recollections," "choking her capacity," "stagnant time made visible and liquid," "alchemy of the informally wise." Runs of abstract noun phrases ("synaptic echoes," "phantom pains," "cortical space," "explosive organic growth") create register drift and slow momentum in the closure sequence. Paraphrase loops appear: "Her neural pathways had become dangerously overgrown" restates "heavy with the unprocessed sorrow of generations past" without added pressure. The final two paragraphs stack thematic summaries that dilute the image of the ripening fruit. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The" + noun in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (chef with memory-tasting gift plants forbidden seed during eclipse) is a high-concept assemblage that reads as prompt response rather than organic synthesis. Core moves—meditative pruning, seed growth, plan to serve fruit at state banquet—follow a predictable arc without surprise or earned complication. "Informally wise" and "synaptic plasticity" are buzzwords rather than lived-in specifics. The ending gesture (serving fruit to ministers) is declared but not dramatized, offering no on-page risk or fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara (chef who can taste memories) is introduced early and her gift is explained in paragraph six ("absorbing their guilt and grief through synaptic echoes"). However, the ability is never demonstrated in a dramatized beat; no memory-tasting occurs on the page. The pruning paragraph summarizes past tastings ("a soldier's first kill," "a mother's inconsolable loss") without on-page action. Her final decision to plant the seed and serve the fruit flows from setup but does not turn on the memory-tasting gift specifically—any character seeking neural space could execute the same plot. The trait shapes motivation but not tactics or a key choice under pressure. Present in setup, absent in middle development beats, marginal at closure (she has "pruned" to make room, but the chef-tasting mechanism is not active). Cap: missing clear middle development and closure causal work. Positives: early signal +0.5, one beat involvement (summary pruning) +0.4. Frictions: ornamental in closure −0.7, summary-only use −0.5. Final placement: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed appears in paragraph five ("In her palm sat the knowledge fruit seed"), is planted in the climax paragraph, and its growth dominates the final sequence. It is handled on the page (she kneels, plants it, it responds to eclipse radiation, vines spiral, buds form, fruit ripens). The seed drives at least three beats: introduction, planting decision, and growth/closure image. Causal pressure: the seed's need for "soil untainted by static, frozen memory" motivates the pruning action. Closure linkage: the ripening fruit is the final image. Specificity: its illegal status and compressed genetic memory are unique. Positives: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6. Frictions: none significant. However, the seed does not face an on-page obstacle or cost tied directly to its planting—Mara's pruning succeeds without friction, and the growth is instantaneous. Visible cost connection to the seed itself is thin; the cost is Mara's internal work, not a trade-off involving the seed. High integration but lacks a felt price tied to the object's use. Final placement: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The concept "gentle rebellion" is named overtly in paragraph twenty-four ("Mara's gentle rebellion was subtler than simple preservation or protest"). It is linked to her plan to serve the fruit at the state banquet, but that plan is declared, not dramatized. No on-page beat shows the gentleness constraining a choice or creating a tactical friction. The rebellion is theme-layer only; it does not shape stakes or alter options in scene. Present as thematic claim, absent as causal force. Setup: mentioned late (final third). Development: none. Closure: echoed in final image but not active. Swappable: "quiet resistance" or "subversive act" would fit with no structural change. Frictions: late appearance −0.6, ornamental −0.7, label-only −0.3, swappable −0.6. Final placement: 3.8 (capped by swappability and late functional appearance).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Informally wise" appears twice as a label (paragraph four: "a gift that had made her informally wise through osmosis"; paragraph twenty-two: "the alchemy of the informally wise"). It does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost. No choice or perception is filtered through this trait in a way that distinguishes it from generic wisdom. The attribute is told, not shown; removing it would not alter any beat. Setup: present early +0.4. Development: none. Closure: echoed but inert. Frictions: label-only −0.6, ornamental −0.7, swappable −0.5. Final placement: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The action "prune" appears repeatedly and is central to the plot: Mara prunes accumulated trauma to clear neural space for the seed (paragraphs eight, thirteen–fifteen). The pruning is the pivotal internal act that enables the planting and subsequent growth. It drives the middle sequence and is necessary for the closure image. However, the pruning itself is summarized rather than dramatized in real-time choice; it succeeds without resistance or micro-reversal. Positives: early signal (paragraph eight) +0.6, two beats (decision, execution) +0.9, causal pressure (enables planting) +1.2, closure linkage (her "pruned synapses" are named in the penultimate paragraph) +1.0. Frictions: summary-only execution −0.6, no visible struggle or cost during the act −0.4. Final placement: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through synaptic plasticity" is named in paragraph nine and repeated in paragraphs fourteen, sixteen, and twenty. The method is explained as "the brain's biological ability to strengthen, weaken, and rewrite its own circuitry." It shapes the premise (neuroscience as gardening) and is linked to the pruning action. However, the mechanics are told via exposition rather than shown; no on-page beat demonstrates how synaptic plasticity constrains or enables a specific attempt. The method is setup and thematic color, not a tactical factor that alters choices or costs. Setup: present by paragraph nine +0.5. Development: mentioned during pruning but not shown as process +0.2. Closure: the "newly flexible neural architecture" is named as enabling growth, but the plasticity itself is not active in the final image. Frictions: summary-only −0.6, late functional appearance (method is explained but not tested) −0.4, ornamental in closure −0.5. Final placement: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is introduced in the opening line and described vividly (corrugated iron, orange decay, shattered glass, dead tomato beds). It provides the literal ground for planting and the eclipse light filters through its framework. The setting is present in setup, middle, and closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Mara's actions proceed without spatial friction. The greenhouse charges the final image by transforming "industrial decay into a trellis," but this is metaphorical rather than causal. Positives: early signal +0.7, three beats (arrival, pruning, planting/growth) +1.4, closure linkage (trellis image) +0.9. Frictions: does not constrain choice −0.8, atmospheric rather than tactical −0.5. Final placement: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The celestial alignment is introduced in paragraph three ("the once-in-a-lifetime celestial alignment was beginning") and returns in paragraphs eight, nineteen, and twenty. It provides the unique radiation that enables the seed's growth. However, the "once-in-a-lifetime" timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Mara proceeds without a live clock or deadline pressure. The alignment is setup and enabling condition, not a tactical constraint. Positives: early signal +0.6, two beats (arrival, peak/growth) +0.9, causal pressure (enables growth) +0.7. Frictions: does not tighten tactics −0.7, no live clock that alters moves −0.6. Final placement: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to create something beautiful from the ruins" is stated in paragraph twelve ("her motivation burning steady: to create something beautiful from the ruins") and echoed in the final image (fruit as "a beautiful creation born from rust"). It is the dominant stated desire. However, this motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choice; no on-page beat shows friction between this want and a competing fear or cost. The motivation aligns smoothly with all her actions; no moment tests whether the beauty is worth a specific sacrifice. Positives: early signal +0.5, closure linkage (final image) +1.0. Frictions: told-only, no friction between wants and costs −1.0, no choice that tests this desire against another value −0.7. Final placement: 5.1.</comment>
