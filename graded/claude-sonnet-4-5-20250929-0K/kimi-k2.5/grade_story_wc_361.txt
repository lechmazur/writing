<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias shows clear interior progression from "jittery" to "jittery no more," but the transformation feels declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The pendant's vibration serves as an external trigger rather than earned internal conflict forcing a choice with visible cost. Maren's absence as motivation is told through backstory rather than pressing on present decisions in a way that creates genuine struggle. Minor: the archivist remains functionally generic, applying pressure without distinct voice or stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The accumulative/textural lens is signaled early (routine → transformation, seeds germinating) and held through the ending's bloom image. However, the closure relies on conceptual repricing (wonder made routine into legend) without legible on-page cost—Elias loses anxiety but gains capability without trade-off or foreclosed path. The archivist encounter and plant emergence feel convenient rather than causally earned by prior pressure, weakening the RR claim.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway and dragonfly pendant supply vivid sensory anchors that recur and shift meaning across beats. The frozen soil's impossible bloom is spatially coherent and charged at closure. The pendant's vibration constrains Elias's choice to stop and speak, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment/object shaping tactics. Spatial choreography (ridgeway, feet, soil, Observatory ahead) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—coaxing wonder from routine—is signaled early but remains abstract until the archivist encounter. The pendant's sympathetic vibration offers one pressure point that narrows options (stop vs. pass), but the germination follows without further escalation or cost to Elias. No trade-off or foreclosed path is visible; the flowers bloom, tea is shared, and he continues with newfound calm. Under the accumulative lens, one tightening is sufficient, but the lack of visible price prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (wonder germinates in routine pauses) emerges through image and action rather than statement. The dragonfly pendant, frozen soil, and bioluminescent flowers form a coherent symbolic chain. However, the final paragraph edges toward moralizing: "teaching him that even as faces fade... the wonder remains rooted in the willingness to pause." The archivist's line "The fade isn't an ending, is it?" risks thematic echo, though it's delivered as question rather than thesis. The ending reweights prior material but borders on explaining its own resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature (noticing what others overlook, electric prickle of transformation) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register at peak beats: "sympathetically... ionized air... phosphorescent... bioluminescence" reads academic rather than courier-specific. The archivist's dialogue ("You carry the Wing of Kael") and Elias's reflection both trend toward faux-archaic tone. Dialogue advances plot but lacks subtext or goal-driven tension. The prose compresses effectively but voice specificity weakens under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but several artifacts cluster: "vibrating sympathetically" appears three times in near-identical phrasing; "fade" recurs as both noun and verb without pattern payoff; "germinate/germinating" loops across adjacent beats. Stock phrases appear in peak moments: "eyes widening," "reverent fingers," "teaching him that." Figurative density is high ("ancient silk," "bright as new copper," "electric prickle") without taught pattern. The final third stacks summary-like reflection ("understood then," "had learned that") that dilutes immediacy. No single artifact obscures closure, but cumulative drag prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise (courier as seed-planter, mentor fading into myth) offers a fresh angle on the guide-figure trope. The sympathetic vibration mechanism and bioluminescent germination are conceptually specific. However, the emotional arc (anxious → calm) and the wisdom-transmission frame follow familiar mentor-story templates. The transformation test is marginal: swap "courier" for "wandering healer" or "ridgeway" for "forest path" and the core arc holds unchanged. The archivist encounter feels convenient rather than inevitable, and the ending's tidy resolution (flowers bloom, anxiety gone, delivery continues) lacks bold risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias appears throughout and his choice to stop and extend the encounter (rather than pass under the courier's code) creates the key turn. However, "jittery" is mentioned twice as label and contrasted at the end; the trait shapes framing more than on-page tactics. His decision to share story and tea drives the middle beats and participates in closure (walking on, "jittery no more"), meeting setup/development/payoff gates. Causal pressure is moderate—stopping enables germination, but the cost is minimal. Scores in mid-6s: essential across beats but the jittery → calm arc is declared more than dramatized through contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dragonfly-wing pendant is introduced in paragraph one, vibrates sympathetically in the archivist encounter (enabling Elias's choice to stop), and "settled against his chest" in the penultimate paragraph with reweighted meaning (comfort rather than warning). It appears in at least three distinct beats and its "iridescent membranes catching starlight" and vibration mechanics are irreplaceably specific. The pendant's resonance with the aurora directly enables germination, satisfying causal pressure. Closure linkage is strong: the final reflection hinges on "the dragonfly-wing pendant settled... teaching him." All three gates met; specificity and closure participation justify high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Maren is named early and the backstory (vanished three winters ago, left pendant and instruction) frames Elias's journey. The "absent mentor" concept shapes stakes thematically—Elias "understood then why Maren had left, why the mentor had stepped into absence—to become the myth." This realization reweights the premise at closure. However, Maren's absence does not constrain on-page choices; Elias carries out the delivery without friction from the mentor's lack. The element operates as lyric resonance (early seed → final reprise) rather than causal pressure. Scores in low-6s: present in setup and payoff, thematically purposeful, but middle development is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" is signaled early (Maren chose Elias because he "noticed what others overlooked") and demonstrated on-page: Elias stops for the archivist "extending the brief encounter beyond the customary greeting," then shares tea and story with other travelers. This trait enables the germination (extended encounter → sympathetic resonance → bloom) and appears in closure ("every brief encounter he chose to lengthen"). The cost is visible: he delays delivery, trading efficiency for connection. All three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage justify low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Germinate" is the story's hinge action: Maren's instruction "every delivery was a seed," the silver shoot unfurls in the archivist beat, "more seeds germinated" in the traveler sequence, and the ridgeway blooms at closure. The action appears in at least four beats and drives major turns—understanding, sharing, blooming. The final image ("germinating possibility") and the archivist's garden-tending exit depend on this exact verb. Irreplaceability is high; swap "grow" or "bloom" and the resonance with "seed" and "germinate" collapses. Scores in low-8s: indispensable across beats and ending, with strong causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Vibrating sympathetically" is named explicitly when the pendant begins to resonate "with the aurora's silent frequencies" and again when "more seeds germinated... vibrating sympathetically with the pendant's frequency." The method enables the impossible bloom and is mechanically specific. However, it first appears at the archivist encounter (past the first third), reducing setup credit. The method shapes the middle turn and participates in closure (pendant's vibration as comfort), meeting development and payoff gates. Causal pressure is moderate—resonance triggers germination—but late signal and modest irreplaceability (could substitute "harmonizing" or "resonating" with minor edits) cap scoring in high-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "aurora-lit ridgeway" anchors setting in the opening line and recurs: aurora ripples overhead, casts shadows, pulses, fades at dawn. The ridgeway itself supplies spatial coherence (gravel path, frozen soil, Observatory ahead) and the aurora's "ionized air" and "silent frequencies" enable the pendant's sympathetic vibration. Environment directly constrains choice—Elias walks the boundary "between what was remembered and what was becoming myth"—and the aurora's pulse draws travelers in the climax. The ridgeway blooms at closure, charging the final image. All gates met; strong causal and closure linkage justify mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Across the fade from memory to myth" is introduced early (Maren's instruction, Elias walking "the boundary") and recurs thematically ("faces fade into stories and stories into myth"). The archivist asks "The fade isn't an ending, is it?" and the ending references "the fade from memory to myth." However, the timeframe remains abstract—no ticking clock or deadline tightens decisions. The fade operates as theme and lyric motif rather than constraint. It shapes the ending's conceptual resonance (testament "across the fade") but does not alter on-page tactics or create urgency. Lyric reprise without mid-development use; scores in high-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To coax wonder from the routine" is Maren's lesson ("Wonder doesn't shout... germinates in the creases of routine") and Elias's enacted goal: he extends the routine exchange, shares story, and "coax[es] wonder from the routine exchange by allowing the moment to expand." The motivation drives the archivist encounter (stop vs. pass), the traveler sequence (share vs. rush), and the ending realization ("transforming the mundane walk... into a garden"). Internal friction appears briefly (courier's code of efficient solitude vs. pendant's vibration) but resolves quickly. Cost is visible—delay, vulnerability—though modest. All gates met; strong causal and closure linkage justify mid-7s.</comment>
