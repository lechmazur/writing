<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly rooted in intellectual curiosity and her apprenticeship, with her isolated state embodied in spoken-aloud habits. However, her interior life reads more as thematic summary than contradictory impulse—her journey from loneliness to revelation proceeds smoothly without genuine internal friction. The "sociable isolation" is asserted rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. The final whispered thanks and smile feel decorative rather than earned by a visible cost that forecloses a competing path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—the antique airship context, Elara's apprentice role, and seventeen-day solitude are established within the opening paragraph, but the spatial anchor (observation deck) and her task (maintaining charts) arrive piecemeal across the first ~150 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the airship transforms from "vessel of solitude" to "bridge to revelation") but the cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page: no competing option is foreclosed, no visible sacrifice made. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (clues accumulate toward a discovery), yet the final "complete route" arrives without tightening pressure or a trade-off that reweights prior material. The turn feels declared rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The antique airship, observation deck, teak deck with hopscotch board, and starling murmurations outside create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—brass railing, cold metal, engine soot, dust—and filtered through Elara's cartographic lens. The hopscotch board constrains her final decoding action and charges the closure image by mirroring the starling spiral, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Idiom and register remain consistent; spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the Aurora Archives location—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Elara encounters no meaningful obstacle, reversal, or trade-off. The starlings cooperate, the phrasebook reveals its secrets, the hopscotch grid confirms her hypothesis—each step affirms rather than complicates. The "purple hours of night" compress the decoding work into summary, and the final achievement ("her motivation...finally satisfied") arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed. One tightening or deepening choice under pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the intersection of solitude, observation, and discovery—emerges organically from Elara's actions and the convergence of dust, language, and living geometry. The final image of "stranded light" and "bridge to revelation" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how isolation enables insight. However, the phrase "sociable isolation complete" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic summary, and "the universal language of geometry and motion" is an explicit thesis statement rather than an earned implication. The close avoids overt moralizing but leans toward articulation over embodiment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices through a cartographic lens (brass railing, charcoal waves, spectral residue, celestial coordinates). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with occasional elevated turns ("hypnotic undulations," "ghost footprints," "stranded luminance") that match the archival, scholarly register. However, some constructions feel slightly overcrafted ("a habit born of sociable isolation that made the silence bearable without requiring the pretense of human company") and rhythmic monotony emerges in longer sentences with parallel participial phrases. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains stable; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong specificity in some images (starlings "painted the twilight in shifting charcoal waves"). However, several passages exhibit overwriting: "made the silence bearable without requiring the pretense of human company or the exhausting performance of social grace" is a paraphrase loop, restating the same idea. "Diligently curious" and "secret patterns...invisible to the casual observer or untrained eye" are near-synonyms within a single sentence. The final paragraph stacks three appositional clauses ("no longer merely a vessel of solitude but a bridge to revelation") that summarize rather than dramatize the transformation. Template cadence appears in the middle section: "She knelt...She began...She worked..." across consecutive paragraphs. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum and precision. Deduction: −0.8 for paraphrase loops, template stems, and summary-over-scene at closure; −0.3 for register drift in "social grace" and "species divide."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of solitary cartography, avian navigation, linguistic decoding, and atmospheric phenomena is specific and non-obvious. However, the core frame—lone scholar decodes ancient secret through patient observation and cross-referencing texts—is a familiar template. The hopscotch cipher and starling murmuration offer fresh details, but the emotional arc (isolation → discovery → satisfaction) proceeds without transformation or moral calculus. The stranded luminance concept is intriguing yet remains abstract; its discovery does not require Elara to sacrifice a competing value or confront a personal limit. Proximity check: no close echoes detected. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its premise but does not heighten stakes through bold structural or thematic choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her observation drives the plot. She is introduced in the opening line, her curiosity motivates the decoding sequence (middle), and she sets the new course at the end (all three gates). However, her choices do not create reversals or narrow options—she notices, cross-references, and succeeds without friction. The apprentice role and curiosity are signaled early (+0.6), she appears in three distinct beats (+1.4), and she shapes the ending (+1.2), but her agency is passive observation rather than decision under pressure (−0.8 for low causal friction). Total adjustment: +2.4 −0.8 = +1.6; base 3.0 + 1.6 = 4.6, but her presence in all three gates and beat involvement lifts to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The phrasebook is introduced in paragraph 5 (early setup, +0.6), its dog-ear marks the "stranded luminance" passage (middle development, constrains her focus, +0.9), and she cross-references its translations during the night-long decoding (development, +0.4). It appears in the ending section implicitly (her decoded route relies on its translations, +0.7). The object is handled twice on-page and its contents directly enable the cipher solution (+1.2 causal pressure). Adjustment: +3.8; base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, round to 7.1 for strong irreplaceability (the polyglot's phrasebook is not generic).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stranded luminance is introduced in paragraph 6 as a phrasebook entry (setup present), it defines the goal—the Aurora Archives location (middle stake, +0.9)—and the final paragraph names it as the destination beyond the horizon (closure participation, +1.2). However, the concept remains atmospheric rather than tactical: it does not constrain Elara's methods or force a trade-off on the page (−0.6 for low causal pressure). It is specific and irreplaceable (+0.6). Adjustment: +2.1; base 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1, lifted to 5.9 for closure linkage strength.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" appears as a label in paragraph 4 but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Elara's curiosity drives the plot generally, yet no moment shows her diligence competing with another impulse or forcing a sacrifice. The trait is ornamental rather than friction-generating (−0.8). Early mention (+0.3), generic trait (−0.4 swappability). Adjustment: −0.9; base 3.0 − 0.9 = 2.1, but her sustained nightlong work arguably embodies diligence, lifting to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Note" as an action is introduced early (paragraph 4: "diligently curious about...navigation anomalies...mentioned"), enacted in paragraph 12 ("began to note the correlations...sketching furiously"), and drives the climax (paragraph 14: "she had charted the complete route"). The action appears in three beats (+1.4), is causally essential (+1.3), and shapes the ending directly (+1.5). Specificity is moderate (noting/charting is typical for a mapmaker, −0.3 swappability). Adjustment: +3.9; base 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9, round to 7.8 for closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hopscotch board is introduced in paragraph 7 (early setup, +0.6), its hidden runes and celestial function are revealed in paragraph 9 (middle development, +0.9), and Elara decodes it by cross-referencing the starling spiral in paragraphs 11–12 (causal pressure, +1.4). The method is indispensable—removing the board breaks the cipher logic (+1.6 irreplaceability). It shapes the ending: "dusty chalk" reappears in the final summary (+1.0 closure linkage). Adjustment: +5.5; base 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5, capped at 8.2 because the mechanics (how symbols map to coordinates) remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The antique airship is named in the opening line (setup, +0.8), its observation deck and teak boards provide the stage for all action (present in every beat, +1.4), and in the final paragraph it "seemed to sigh...no longer merely a vessel of solitude but a bridge to revelation" (closure participation, +1.2). The setting supplies the hopscotch board resource and enables solitude, both essential to the plot (+1.0 causal pressure). Adjustment: +4.4; base 3.0 + 4.4 = 7.4, reduced to 6.7 because the airship's movement or systems never constrain a choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The starling murmurations are present from paragraph 3 (setup, +0.8), their shifting patterns mirror the hopscotch grid in paragraph 10 and validate Elara's calculations in paragraph 13 (two beats, +0.9), and their thinning at dawn in paragraph 13 provides the temporal frame ("purple hours of night...dawn broke") that paces the decoding work (+0.6 time pressure). They are causally essential: the flock's geometry is the cipher key (+1.4). Their "numbers thinning as dawn approached" signals urgency without hard deadline (−0.2 for moderate clock pressure). Adjustment: +3.5; base 3.0 + 3.5 = 6.5, lifted to 7.6 for indispensable closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to chart the next great discovery" is implicit in Elara's apprentice role (paragraph 2, +0.4), drives her investigation of navigation anomalies (paragraph 4, middle stake, +0.9), and is explicitly satisfied in paragraph 14: "her motivation to chart the next great discovery finally satisfied" (closure, +1.0). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in friction—no competing want or cost tests her commitment (−0.7). Adjustment: +1.6; base 3.0 + 1.6 = 4.6, lifted to 6.3 because the entire plot enacts this motive even if no internal conflict appears.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is named in paragraph 2 ("a habit born of sociable isolation"), recurs in paragraph 16 ("her sociable isolation complete"), and coheres with the tone of solitary work punctuated by Elara's spoken-aloud habit and final whispered thanks. The tone is consistent but static—it does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with a felt shift (−0.6). Early signal (+0.6), present in two beats (+0.5), closure mention (+0.5), but the phrase is a thematic label rather than an enacted contradiction (−0.5). Adjustment: +0.5; base 3.0 + 0.5 = 3.5, lifted to 5.2 for coherent tonal texture across the piece.</comment>
