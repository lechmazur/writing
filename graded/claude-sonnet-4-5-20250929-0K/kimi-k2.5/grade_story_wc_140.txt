<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist's sensory filtering trait is established early and drives their collection method, but remains largely descriptive rather than creating genuine decision points under pressure. The motivation to "discover the texture of memories" functions more as thematic claim than dramatized want versus cost friction. The final affirmation ("understanding finally that to discover the texture of memories was to become the texture itself") reads as declared epiphany rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible forfeiture. Interior voice is consistent and character-particular, avoiding therapy-speak, but the protagonist's choices never narrow options or foreclose a path with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory fragments and container imagery toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the archivist "understanding finally" their identity as layered texture), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than viscerally demonstrated—no visible forfeiture of a live option or relationship on the page. The accumulative pattern is taught early and holds, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; the smile and understanding feel granted rather than paid for.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with rust, corrugated steel, salt wind erosion, and spatial choreography (seventh stack from crane, blue container, gaps between stacks). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the archivist's textural perception. The poison-label object and container setting charge the final image and recur with shifting weight. The port environment constrains the archivist's movement and supplies the fragments they collect, meeting the micro-setting test for choice constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to discover/reconstruct the texture of erased memories. Pressure accumulates through the collection of fragments, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options. The archivist moves through the labyrinth without facing a tested decision where one path must be foreclosed. The ending crystallizes understanding but does not dramatize a trade-off or visible price; the smile and affirmation feel conclusive without sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the label's transformation from warning to map), but escalation remains atmospheric rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of erasure, layered identity, and memory-as-accretion emerges organically from the container imagery, poison label, and fragment-collection method. The final image ("to become the texture itself") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in the parallels between shipping containers (labeled incorrectly, cargo mismatched) and the archivist's nameless existence. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection on survival beyond official record. However, the thematic claim ("erasure was not an end but a recalibration") is stated rather than fully embodied through a concrete on-page cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "sounds had grain, silence had weight." Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, filtering reality through texture and sediment metaphors. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, balancing lyric density with clarity. Under peak pressure (the final paragraph), the voice maintains its textural idiom without drifting into abstraction. No dialogue is present; the piece's singular focalization and sensory vocabulary create a memorable narrative stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent (rust as accretion, containers as identity vessels, tides as rhythm), but several lines veer into overwriting: "the porous boundary between living and being archived" and "the texture of velvet—soft, dense, hiding something precious" stack metaphors without clear causal pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-section runs ("They understood that memory was not recollection but accretion, the way rust layers upon metal, the way containers stack..."). Paraphrase loops occur: the third-to-last and second-to-last paragraphs restate the layering/texture thesis with minor variation. Information density is high, but momentum occasionally stalls under figurative weight. No grammatical errors; syntax varies purposefully.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The shipping-container-as-metaphor for identity is vivid and specific, avoiding generic "memory palace" tropes. The bureaucratic death-certificate error and poison-label compass are fresh particulars. However, the emotional arc (nameless survivor layers fragments until achieving self-understanding) follows a familiar template of identity reconstruction through collection. The piece commits fully to its premise and sensory mode, but the final affirmation lacks the non-obvious turn or cost that would elevate synthesis into inevitability. The transformation test is borderline: the plot's emotional resolution could transfer to other "erased-identity-reconstructed-through-fragments" frames with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The death-certificate survivor frames the premise and motivation, but makes no on-page choices that create turns or narrow options. The trait is present throughout (beats: opening exposition, touching the label, final smile) but functions as backdrop rather than causal lever. The archivist's survival status is descriptive; no decision or renunciation hinges on their legally erased state. Present in closure image (survivor/witness marking) but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poison-bottle label appears in at least three beats: breast pocket introduction, tactile examination during fog ("feeling the chemical warnings translate into the roughness of abandonment"), and final tattoo-like marking ("the label in their pocket had softened...marking them as survivor"). It functions as compass, map, and identity marker, reweighted across the story. However, the label does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; its role remains symbolic anchor rather than plot lever. Present in closure image with thematic charge but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Erased histories (the archivist's own; the port's vanished merchant, stowaway-foreman, customs fire) shape the dominant stake and accumulate across beats. The concept drives the collection method and layering structure, altering the protagonist's tactics (moving through corridors, pressing fragments against palms). Present in closure: "the one who remembers what the archives forgot." However, the concept does not force a visible trade-off or choice that narrows options on the page; it operates more as thematic lens than dramatic pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The filtering trait ("sounds had grain, silence had weight, memories settled upon skin like sediment") is established early and colors perception throughout. It enables the collection method (filtering overheard stories by texture) and appears in multiple beats: opening description, velvet-drone translation, final understanding. However, the trait does not constrain or force a visible cost; no on-page moment shows a tradeoff where filtering differently would have altered outcome. The trait enriches voice but remains label-level rather than choice-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Layering appears in numerous beats: rust on metal, containers stacking, narratives accumulating, the label bleeding into fabric, and the final "layer upon layer" affirmation. The action structures the archivist's method and thematic resolution. However, major turns do not trace specifically to layering; the action could be replaced with "weaving," "accumulating," or "building" with minor edits. Present throughout and in closure, but mechanically interchangeable with near-synonyms rather than irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The collection method is signaled early ("collecting fragments of overheard stories"), demonstrated in at least two beats (Ukrainian confession, customs regret), and shapes the archivist's movement through the labyrinth. The mechanics matter: fragments are pressed against palms, layered as palimpsest, felt for texture. Present in closure resolution ("accumulated narratives settle"). However, the method does not face a visible constraint or force a tactical choice under pressure; the archivist's collection proceeds without friction or cost. Causal role in one major throughline but not in a tested decision.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is anchored early (seventh stack from crane), supplies resources (corridors where voices echo, blue container for listening), and constrains movement (towering terraces, gaps between stacks). The setting is present in at least three beats: opening location, fog-horn navigation, and final ear-against-steel moment. It charges the final image ("the port itself became a memory") and provides the spatial logic for fragment collection. The environment shapes tactics (moving through corridors, sitting among collection) and participates in closure, though the archivist's choices are more enabled than constrained by it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tidal rhythm is mentioned in the opening ("across the rhythm of tides"), during fog-horn navigation, at the archivist's seated reflection ("as the tide turned, sucking at pylons"), and in the final line ("layered by the relentless, rhythmic tides"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock that alters tactics. The tides function as atmospheric motif rather than causal pressure. No on-page moment shows the archivist racing or adjusting strategy because of tidal timing. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation to "discover the texture of memories" is stated early, drives the collection method, and resolves in the final understanding ("to discover the texture of memories was to become the texture itself"). Present in at least two beats: opening exposition and closure affirmation. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction between wants and costs. The archivist pursues the goal without on-page obstacle or sacrifice; no moment shows them weighing the collection against another need or forfeiting a path to continue. Told-dominant with thematic payoff but minimal choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Nameless identity is introduced early ("The archivist—nameless, since names are merely labels..."), recurs in reflection ("the nameless existence, a vessel"), and charges the final image ("in the nameless dark between containers"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly with the fog-horn tension and final smile. The namelessness shapes the thematic question and reweights at closure. However, tone remains largely static (contemplative, textural) without sharp pressure modulation during supposed high-stakes moments. Lyric reprise that reweights the stake but does not shift cadence under escalation.</comment>
