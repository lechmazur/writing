<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivations are declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The backstory-heavy opening delivers years of arson and archaeological expertise through summary, while her present actions in the archive—tracing gouges, setting up an easel—lack embodied resistance or cost. The shift from destroyer to bridge-builder is asserted ("she understood now") rather than earned through on-page struggle. Interior voice relies on elevated abstractions ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive precision") that feel authorial rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative lens but fails the Orientation Test: who Maya is, where exactly she stands, and what immediate danger or constraint she faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. Closure arrives as a summary of her completed art trail across three continents rather than a single on-page image with visible cost; the final beat ("a promise kept") tells us the work is done without showing a decisive moment or felt price. The causality is retrospective exposition—seventeen libraries burned, then years of art-making—compressed into a montage that elides the pressure points where choices narrow options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The limestone hollow, volcanic glass, and obsidian fragments supply vivid sensory anchors, and the archive's strata and dim chamber constrain Maya's movements enough to ground her actions. However, spatial choreography across "three continents" and multiple library ruins remains abstract; we never track her body through a single location with enough granularity to feel proximity or access shaping a choice. The micro-setting (charcoal from embers, easel in dim chamber) does charge the final image, lifting the score within its band despite the early orientation debt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early, but escalation is retrospective: the entire art-trail project is recounted in summary after Maya has already completed it. No on-page reversal tightens her options; she moves from archive discovery to portrait-sketching to final placement without friction, resistance, or a moment where she must trade one value for another. The stated cost (years of arson, tears, stepping into shadow) is told rather than dramatized in a beat where we see her forsake a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of indigenous wisdom versus colonial noise emerges through event and image (burning libraries, vandalized portrait, treaty garden), but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "knowledge should serve connection rather than domination" and "a promise kept" state the thesis rather than letting the closing image resonate. The tapestry and portrait do form a language of deliberate loss, and the notion of destruction as prayer has thematic promise, yet the ending explains its meaning instead of trusting the reader to infer it from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice carries a distinct elevated register ("volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive," "surgical precision"), but it remains static across beats and reads as authorial rather than filtered through Maya's immediate perceptual state under pressure. Psychic distance is wide and declarative; we are told about her trembling fingers and tears without inhabiting the sensory particulars of soot, charcoal dust, or the weight of the tapestry fragment in her grip. No dialogue appears. The phrase "analytically intuitive" recurs as a label without dramatizing the perceptual signature it names.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Density is high, but the prose suffers from template-cadence runs ("she had been," "she understood," "she would create," "she worked") and elevated diction that clashes with the immediacy of peak action: "volcanic tenderness" and "ferocious care" appear multiple times without fresh embodiment. Paraphrase loops cluster around the promise/covenant/treaty theme, restating the same idea across adjacent sentences. Mixed metaphors—"volcanic tenderness," "smoke…clung to meaning like incense"—muddle physical logic. The −0.6 to −1.4 baseline applies; artifacts touch the closure beat ("a promise kept"), so the penalty escalates and disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist as truth-teller, vandalized self-portrait as coded map—offers a fresh synthesis, and the inversion of destruction into preservation has conceptual promise. However, the execution leans on stock symbolic objects (tapestry, portrait, obsidian mosaic) and the emotional arc (violence transmuted into care) follows a familiar redemption template. The trail of artworks across three continents reads as premise-serving ornament rather than a choice that costs Maya a live alternative, and the final image's language ("volcanic tenderness," "promise kept") echoes workshop abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya the arsonist is present in backstory summary (seventeen libraries) and named throughout, but her on-page choices in the archive—tracing gouges, setting up an easel, placing artworks—are execution of a plan already decided rather than pressure-tested decisions that narrow options. Her role as destroyer is told; her present actions as bridge-builder lack friction or a moment where burning versus preserving creates a live trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in the opening beat (held against chest, threads whispering), returns woven into a sculpture with Maya's hair, and is touched "one last time" in the closing lines. It shapes two distinct beats and charges the final image, but its properties (depicting the treaty garden, loose threads) function as symbolic backdrop rather than a tool that constrains Maya's tactical choices or imposes a visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait frames Maya's interpretive task (gouges as coded preservation), drives her first artwork (sketching the damaged face with charcoal), and reappears as the "final work—healed and whole through her interpretation yet still bearing the sacred scars." It shapes at least two beats and the closure unit, though the scars' specific coordinates or the portrait's function as a map remain abstract rather than tactically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is a repeated label ("surgical precision that only an analytically intuitive eye would recognize," "analytically intuitive precision that felt like collaboration") without on-page demonstration of a trade-off between logic and instinct that constrains or enables a choice under pressure. The trait is asserted in description; we never see Maya misread a pattern via over-analysis or leap too far via intuition with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Portray" governs Maya's entire art-trail project: sketching the archivist's face, sculpting hands, installing a mosaic, reconstructing the self-portrait. These actions shape the middle sequence and the closure image, but each step is recounted in summary after completion rather than dramatized as a turn where the act of portraying forces a choice or reveals a friction that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations (portrait in Seattle, sculpture in Boston, mosaic in Portland, final work at the archive entrance) is signaled early and structures the middle sequence. However, its mechanics—how each piece "attracted the intuitively gifted while repelling those who sought to plunder"—remain abstract. We see placement but not the process of encoding coordinates or the cost of leaving each piece behind, so the method functions as a thematic device rather than a constraint that shapes Maya's on-page attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive provides the inciting discovery (tapestry, vandalized portrait, strata of genius) and houses Maya's easel work in the dim chamber. It supplies sensory detail (volcanic glass, mineral air, obsidian) and the final placement of her reconstructed portrait at the entrance. The setting constrains access (hollow beneath volcanic glass, shadows) and charges the closure image, though the specific geography and the archive's rules or dangers remain vague.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" anchors the story post-arson, and the phrase "years burning libraries" and "years of art-making" gesture at elapsed time, but no live clock tightens Maya's present decisions in the archive. The timeframe is backstory context; we never feel hours, days, or a deadline pressing her as she works, so it does not function as an on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Maya's desire to rescue the forgotten promise drives her interpretation of the gouges, her art-trail plan, and her final placement of the healed portrait. The motivation is declared early and sustains the through-line, yet it is never shown in friction with a competing want (safety, recognition, doubt). We are told "she understood now" and "her fires had been prayers," but the realization arrives as epiphany rather than a choice that costs her a live alternative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears as a repeated phrase (describing the archivist's self-destruction, Maya's creative process, and the final eruption into quiet) and sets an elevated, paradoxical register. However, the tone remains static—lush and declarative—across all beats without modulating under pressure. At the closure image, "volcanic tenderness…erupt into the quiet it deserved" restates the label rather than embodying the oxymoron in a concrete sensory moment that charges the final line.</comment>
