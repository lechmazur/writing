<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's mutation as "specific form of cartography" and her decision to transform exile into methodology show clear motivation and change. Interior experience is heavily filtered through metaphor rather than embodied contradiction—"cells aging microseconds while her consciousness crawled through eons" reads more poetic than character-particular. The final choice feels earned by the mapping work, but micro-choices under pressure remain abstract; we see determination more than conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the fixed point brightens, she glimpses the exit, and steps through with her charcoal—options crystallize and pressure is undeniable even though the physical cost is not yet paid on the page. The "three objective years / three centuries subjective" and the mapping ritual deepen coherently. Orientation anchors arrive within the first ~80 words (Elara, observation deck, post-accident isolation). One meaningful tightening occurs when her perception shifts from curse to cartography, narrowing her path to the hatch.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Temporal distortion—breath crystals falling slowly, elastic time, stretched vision—constrains movement and enables the unique perception that reveals the exit hatch. The observation deck functions as micro-setting whose properties charge the final threshold crossing. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("echoed silence pressed against her eardrums"), though spatial choreography of the hatch itself remains vague. The compass rose and charcoal anchor tactile presence throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: escape from temporal exile. One clear tightening when Elara realizes her mutation grants cartographic sight, transforming the observation deck from prison to vessel. The fixed point discovery narrows options and the hatch appears "accessible only to someone moving at her specific, tortured temporal frequency"—agency is decision (to map) with visible cost (enduring stretched perception). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through density increase and the final threshold step.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of curse into gift, isolation as key—emerges through the mapping ritual and family custom rather than statement. The compass rose alignment and fixed-point discovery offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the survival question. Minor slip: "the price of passage through the lock" edges toward overt articulation. The closing image of stepping through "following her true north out of the dark" reweights prior material without moralizing, though "blessed pariah" and "necessary key" carry slight thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature—temporal stretching, cartographic framing—is consistent. However, diction frequently elevates beyond immediate embodied experience: "pneumatic finality," "eons," "sympathetic resonance," "methodology" cluster in a register more lyric-essay than character-lived crisis. The voice reads authorial-poetic rather than Elara-specific under pressure. No dialogue present; filter verbs ("understood," "glimpsed") are minimal and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>High figurative density throughout: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or elevated comparison ("seconds expanded into agonizing hours," "muscles and thoughts into taffy-like resistance," "stars stretched into smeared lines"). In peak beats (fixed-point glimpse, threshold crossing) the ornate diction competes with momentum rather than sharpening it. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 6–7 restate stretched movement without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" openers recur across five consecutive paragraphs mid-story. Clarity remains legible but density overruns propulsion in several beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Time-dilation survival through neurological mutation is a fresh synthesis; the family cartography custom transforms trope of inherited object into active methodology. The fixed-point/hatch solution feels inevitable in hindsight, grounded in established temporal rules. Risk: committing to heavy scientific metaphor and stretched perception throughout. Moderate deduction for reliance on "blessed pariah" archetype and the "mutation as gift" frame, both widely used in speculative templates, though the specific execution through mapping elevates the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present from the opening; "blessed pariah" frames her isolation and unique ability. Her decision to turn confusion into cartography (paragraph 18) and the final step through the threshold (paragraph 26) are key turns driven by her status. Appears across setup, middle realization, and closure. Causal pressure: her unique temporal frequency is the specific key to the hatch.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Torn from uniform (paragraph 7), clutched throughout as grounding anchor (paragraph 7), grows warm and aligns with the fixed point (paragraph 17), pinned to the sketch marking coordinates (paragraph 24). Present in four distinct beats; its alignment behavior enables the navigation solution and it charges the final sketch. Irreplaceable: its navigation properties matter causally.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled early via great-grandmother's cartography and "anchor the soul" (paragraph 8). The fixed point offers "true north in a universe that had forgotten direction" (paragraph 14), shaping her methodology (paragraph 18–20). Appears in the closing line: "following her true north out of the dark." Drives her mapping tactic and charges the exit discovery; specific concept properties (orientation, fixed reference) alter her approach and close the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "seconds expanded into agonizing hours" (paragraph 3), movements "sluggish yet deliberate" (paragraph 6). Development: enables her unique perception to see the fixed point (paragraph 13) and perceive "underlying topology" (paragraph 16). Payoff: the hatch is "accessible only to someone moving at her specific, tortured temporal frequency" (paragraph 22). Constrains movement and cognition throughout; its cost ("three centuries of subjective isolation") is visible; it provides the causal key to escape.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glimpse of the fixed point (paragraph 13) is the pivotal turn that transforms her perception from passive suffering to active cartography. It enables the insight in paragraph 15–16 and unlocks the hatch discovery (paragraph 21–22). Present in setup (seeking constellations), triggers the major realization, and directly shapes closure. Swapping "glimpse" for another perceptual verb would weaken specificity but the beat itself—perceiving the anomaly—is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced early: father's journal with "generations of stellar cartography" and the custom (paragraph 9). She executes it on the anniversary (paragraph 10–11), and it transforms "from memorial to methodology" (paragraph 19), charting her escape route. The compass rose is pinned to the sketch (paragraph 24). Shapes two beats (ritual observance, tactical mapping) and participates in closure, though the mechanics—how sketching reveals the exit—remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Anchored in opening line; temporal properties—stretched air, distortion field, chronometric radiation—constrain all movement and perception. The deck's "tortured chronology" intersecting with baseline reality is the puzzle Elara maps (paragraph 16). The viewport and panoramic glass frame the fixed-point discovery; the deck itself becomes "the vessel that would carry her home" (paragraph 25). Indispensable: its unique physics enable and necessitate her escape method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: "after the shutdown" in paragraph 3; "three objective years since the accident" (paragraph 10). The anniversary observance ties time to the sketching ritual and marks urgency ("Tonight marked three objective years"). The timeframe establishes exile duration and subjective cost ("three centuries of subjective isolation"), shaping her desperation. Not a live countdown but the cumulative weight tightens motivation and the ritual timing is causally meaningful.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Implicit in her clutching the compass rose for grounding (paragraph 7) and explicit crystallization: "turn this crushing confusion into systematic exploration" (paragraph 18). This shift from passive endurance to active mapping is the story's hinge; it drives the sketching (paragraph 19–20) and discovery (paragraph 21–22). The friction between crushing isolation and methodical hope generates the middle beats and charges her final step. Desire is dramatized through on-page action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Introduced early: "echoed silence...pressed against her eardrums" (paragraph 4), sounds "layered and distorted, ghosts of acoustics bouncing between seconds" (paragraph 5). Returns as "canvas rather than cage" (paragraph 20) when her perception shifts. Modulates with her state—oppressive at start, enabling at the turn—and charges the final threshold as she steps "out of the dark" past silence. Coherent and purposeful but the shift is told more than sensorially embodied in the final beats.</comment>
