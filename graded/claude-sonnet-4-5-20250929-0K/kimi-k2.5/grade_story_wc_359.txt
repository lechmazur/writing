<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. Her seventeen years of training and singular drive to "certify wonder" remain abstract labels without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The synesthetic condition is described richly but functions as ornamental perception rather than constraining any on-page decision. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she executes her plan without friction, cost, or genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late (~180 words for clear spatial grounding) and the Drive Lens remains ambiguous—hovering between Accumulative/Textural (aurora imagery, bell-ringing ritual) and Causal (sculptor's chisel as trigger) without committing. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing (wonder encoded in the electromagnetic field) but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no on-page consequence shows what Elara forfeited or risked. The sculptor's chisel "completes her circuit" through coincidence, not protagonist agency, undercutting causality. Applying Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and lens ambiguity (−0.3).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern and aurora provide vivid sensory detail (emerald and rose curtains, crystalline walls, violet silence) but function primarily as backdrop. The seventeen crystal bells and central spire supply spatial choreography, and the cavern's "molecular memory" charges the final image with minor resonance. Setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Elara's task proceeds without environmental friction. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) present but underutilized in pressure moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (certify wonder before midnight) is signaled early but never tightens on the page. Elara faces no reversal, no narrowing of options, no trade-off; she strikes the bells, the song transmits, the Council's instruments register wonder, success is complete. The sculptor's coincidental action enables resolution without protagonist agency driving escalation. No visible price is paid—collapse against the wall after success is fatigue, not cost that forecloses a path. Under any lens, pressure remains static from setup to resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme (wonder as measurable force vs. pragmatic efficiency) is stated directly in exposition rather than emerging from enacted conflict: "They had argued that beauty served no practical function." The final image attempts resonance through "awe now encoded in the electromagnetic field" but this is assertion, not non-literal answer earned through particulars. The amber sheet and aurora function as symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic points without constraining prior choices. Subtext is minimal; the Council's conversion happens off-page via convenient instruments.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature (synesthesia as mint and copper, geometric color shards) is vivid but applied uniformly without modulation under pressure. Diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with immediate crisis: "oscillating repose," "synesthetically blessed acolyte," "cathedral of frozen breath" in the opening beat. Filter verbs ("felt the impending impact," "perceived the silence") dull immediacy. No dialogue present to assess. Voice is competent but lacks rhythmic control that tightens with escalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: nearly every sentence in the climax carries figurative language ("sound exploded into prismatic geometry," "emotional cortex," "weaving them into a synesthetic tapestry") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalty (−0.6). Paraphrase loops cluster in paragraph two: "violet weight," "deep violet weight," "smooth as velvet" restate synesthetic perception without adding pressure. Template cadence in paragraph four: "each tone manifesting," "each bell tone caught" (−0.4). Register drift into academic lexicon ("electromagnetic song," "conceptual repricing") clashes with POV (−0.4). Stock metaphors: "circuit," "theorem," "tapestry." Cumulative artifacts approach −1.4; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise (artist performs ritual to save wonder from bureaucrats) follows a familiar template: lone visionary vs. Council of Pragmatists declaring art obsolete. The synesthesia-aurora-bell combination is ornamental rather than transformative; removing synesthesia and substituting direct sound would leave the emotional arc unchanged. The sculptor's chisel functions as coincidental deus ex machina with no prior causality or friction. No fresh inflection arises from lived detail, world logic, or moral calculus; the Council's instant conversion via convenient instruments avoids earned conflict. Derivative Premise penalty (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as prism-song bell ringer is established early (first paragraph), satisfying setup. She performs the bell-ringing in paragraph four (development beat). She collapses in the final paragraph, present at closure. However, her choices do not create turns—she executes a predetermined plan without deviation, friction, or on-page decision that alters tactics. Observation and execution dominate; no key turn traces to her agency. Gates: setup ✓, development (action but no choice), closure (present but passive). Functional but replaceable; swappable with "ritual performer" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The amber music sheet appears in paragraph one ("held the amber music sheet before her"), paragraph three ("The amber sheet trembled in her hands"), and paragraph four ("The amber music sheet blazed, its notation rearranging itself"). It guides her strikes with "precise intelligence" and dissolves into "pure resonance" at closure. Three beats present; early setup ✓; closure participation ✓. However, it functions as a passive guide rather than constraining choice—Elara never wrestles with the notation, makes an error, or adapts. The sheet's dissolution is described but does not reweight prior material with cost. Mid-band: present across beats and ending but causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The Sculpted Hush is named in paragraph one as "a sonic architecture that crystallized stillness into something almost tangible." Paragraph four states "The composition did not shatter silence but rather revealed its hidden architecture." It appears thematically but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics—Elara does not struggle with the composition's difficulty, adapt its execution, or face a cost tied to its unique properties. Setup ✓ (first paragraph); middle beat (reiterated in paragraph four); closure (implied in final success). Functional presence but swappable with "legendary ritual" without altering choices. Lacks causal pressure or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Synesthesia is introduced early ("synesthetically blessed acolyte," first paragraph) and described richly: violet silence, mint and copper harmonies, geometric color shards. It enables perception of the aurora as "choral arrangement" (paragraph two) and the sculptor's chisel as "sharp silver note" (paragraph three). Present at closure when colors flood the cavern. Gates: setup ✓, development (enables perception), closure (colors present). However, the trait never constrains or costs—Elara gains only advantages (richer perception) with no on-page tradeoff, overload, or misinterpretation. Label-only benefit without visible friction. Caps at 3.8 for swappability; could be removed and replaced with "heightened sensitivity" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unfetter" appears in paragraph one: "unfetter the world's forgotten capacity for awe before it was lost forever." The action recurs implicitly in paragraph four when she transmits the prism-song "outward" and the final paragraph states "awe was now encoded...undeniable and permanent as stone...unfettered from neglect." Setup ✓ (first paragraph stated goal); development (bell-ringing enacts it); closure (result declared). The action drives the stated goal but is executed without friction or adaptation—she unfetters as planned with no reversal. Causal link present but swappable with "liberate" or "restore" without redefining options. Mid-band: shapes one key turn (goal to execution) but lacks visible cost or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The aurora is introduced in paragraph two ("aurora borealis danced above," filtering light, tasting of mint and copper) and positioned as the transmission medium in paragraph four: "Through the colors of the aurora now flooding the cavern, Elara transmitted the Sculpted Hush outward, riding the electromagnetic waves." The method is signaled early and its mechanics (electromagnetic carrier wave) are described. Setup ✓; development (positioned beneath aurora in paragraph two); closure (aurora "pulsed once in acknowledgment" before retreating). The mechanics matter—she uses the aurora as messenger—but she does not adapt or troubleshoot; the aurora complies without friction. One key turn shaped (transmission mechanism) but replaceable with minor edits (e.g., "through the ice crystals"). Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern is established in the opening line ("cathedral of frozen breath," "crystalline walls") and supplies spatial anchors: central spire, seventeen bells, fissures admitting aurora light, molecular memory. It returns in the final paragraph ("ice cavern preserved this moment in molecular memory"). Setup ✓; development (the bells and spire provide staging); closure (molecular memory charges the final image). However, the cavern does not pressure choices—Elara's plan proceeds without environmental obstacle, constraint, or resource scarcity. Postcard description dominates; no micro-setting element alters tactics. Mid-band: shapes staging and charges the final image but lacks choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The timeframe is stated in paragraph two ("certify wonder...before the Council of Pragmatists declared imagination obsolete at midnight") and referenced in paragraph three ("the sculptor's chisel first strikes marble"). The simultaneity of sculptor and bell ringer is described in paragraph three ("When the sculptor's tool finally struck marble...Elara struck the first bell"). Setup ✓ (midnight deadline named); development (chisel strike as synchrony trigger); closure (implied success before deadline, though the clock is not revisited). However, time does not tighten decisions—the deadline is mentioned once and never creates urgency, countdown, or tactical adaptation. The chisel strike is coincidental timing, not a live clock the protagonist races. Functional presence but swappable with "at dawn" or any symbolic moment. Caps at 4.6 for late clarity (sculptor introduced paragraph three) and lack of pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("certify wonder as essential") is stated explicitly in paragraph two and framed against the Council's midnight declaration. It recurs in paragraph four ("the unquantifiable metric of marvel") and paragraph five ("awe was now encoded...certified"). Setup ✓ (second paragraph); development (drives bell-ringing action); closure (goal achieved, certified). The desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page friction between wonder and pragmatic survival, no cost she weighs. "Her motivation burned with singular intensity" is assertion. No scene shows her choosing wonder over a competing need. One key turn shaped (goal drives action) but lacks embodied conflict or visible tradeoff. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Oscillating repose is named in paragraph three ("The oscillating repose of the cavern shifted between absolute stillness and the subtle creaking of ancient ice") and paragraph four ("Elara moved between the bells...in the oscillating repose between motion and meditation"). The tone attempts to modulate between stillness and intensity but reads as static elevated lyricism throughout—paragraph one's "cathedral of frozen breath" and "deep violet weight" carry the same register as the climax's "prismatic geometry" and "synesthetic tapestry." No coherent tonal shift under pressure; ornamental repetition of the phrase without embodied modulation. Setup ✓ (third paragraph); development (fourth paragraph reiteration); closure (stillness "charged with possibility" but no tonal payoff). Single static mood dominates. Functional but replaceable; tone does not charge the final image with distinct pressure.</comment>
