<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Arthur's interiority is filtered through his authenticator's eye and establishes clear motivation (finding Thomas's promised site), but key emotional beats lean toward summary ("loneliness that had calcified into routine") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to become "curator of roads not taken" arrives without visible internal conflict or competing impulse; we see decision, not struggle. The brother relationship functions as setup rather than on-page crucible, and Arthur's decades of expertise don't visibly constrain or complicate his choices in the cavern.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with Accumulative elements (glowing flora, ant procession, rising water). Closure lands as Decisive Change (Arthur steps through, commits to catalog ghost maps) with felt cost (abandoning solitary dealing, embracing perpetual archival duty). The matrix chip engages hidden gears and opens the wall in clear because/therefore sequence. Minor orientation slip: "doorway of decisions" introduced late (paragraph 10) without prior anchor, forcing retroactive comprehension. Creek-rise timer creates pressure, though the twelve-minute estimate and actual pacing remain vague.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming cavern is vivid and specific: foxfire moss pulsing like breath, solstice blooms dripping nectar that smells of "old paper and typewriter ribbon," ants carrying bioluminescent fungus. Spatial choreography is clear (mouth, fissure, stone floor, pivoting wall). The rising creek constrains Arthur's window and the chip's placement on the flat stone drives the opening mechanism. Corduroy trousers and red clay anchor Appalachian setting. The ghost-map chamber's mycelium rivers function as micro-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (fulfill Thomas's promise, find the hidden site) is signaled early and tightens when the flood timer starts. The chip's engagement with hidden gears and the wall's pivot provide one meaningful turn that narrows options. Arthur's choice to step through and catalog the maps forecloses his prior life as "merely a dealer" with visible cost (perpetual archival burden). However, no false path or genuine temptation tests the choice; the ants lead, the door opens, Arthur steps through without on-page hesitation or competing desire, reducing felt friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (honoring unlived lives through deliberate choice, regret transmuted into responsibility) emerges from image and action. The ghost maps rendered in mycelium and "roads not taken" concretize abstract regret. However, paragraph 13's thematic summary ("doorway of decisions was not a threshold to cross but an archive to consult") states rather than dramatizes, and the final paragraph articulates theme overtly ("curator of roads not taken, archivist of might-have-beens") instead of trusting the image. The matrix chip's M and the maps' mycelium offer resonance, but the explicit moral framing in the ending reduces subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and Arthur's perceptual signature (authenticator's eye, trained gut, atlas auctions) filters description consistently. Diction fits the cartographer's register ("empirically intuitive," "forged coastlines," "watermarks"). Thomas's deathbed line is brief and voice-distinct. However, elevated phrasing in high-pressure moments ("empirically intuitive," "crucible of consequence," "transmuted into responsibility") drifts above Arthur's established idiom. Filter verbs ("watching," "feeling," "recalling") cluster in mid-story without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high in setting and object description, but multiple lines paraphrase stakes without adding pressure: paragraph 9 ("the doorway of decisions required temporal pressure") rewrites paragraph 10 ("doorway of decisions required temporal pressure as much as it required the key") with synonym churn. Paragraph 12 summarizes closure theme that paragraph 15 will restate. Stock metaphor "sunrise through stained glass" in the final beat. Template cadence in paragraph 4 ("He had noticed," "his gut—trained by...—told him") and paragraph 14 ("why Thomas had given," "why he had to be," "why the promise had to linger"). Filter-verb stack ("watching," "feeling," "recalling") across paragraphs 7–9 dulls peak discovery beats. Elevated register ("empirically intuitive," "crucible of consequence") clashes with scene urgency. Combined artifacts and loops trigger penalties per Q7 guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis (type foundry matrix as literal key, ant procession as guide, ghost-map archive) is specific and non-obvious. However, the core frame (fulfilling dying sibling's cryptic promise by finding hidden magical archive) follows widely used templates without sufficient transformation through lived occupational friction or moral calculus. Arthur's choice lacks competing cost; the archive appears, he accepts the role without visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative. The glowing flora and mechanical gears offer vivid detail, but the thematic resolution ("curator of roads not taken") arrives as declared purpose rather than earned discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Arthur's profession filters all perception (authenticator's gut, forged coastlines, watermarks) and his choice to step through and catalog the archive drives closure. However, "lonely" functions as label without on-page friction; the loneliness doesn't visibly complicate his decision or create competing desire. His expertise enables reading the landscape but doesn't constrain tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Matrix chip appears in paragraph 2 (inherited key), paragraph 7 (placed on stone, ants treat with reverence), paragraph 8 (glimmers, casts M shadows), paragraph 9 (pressed into fissure, engages gears), and paragraph 15 (locks into pedestal, spreads glimmer). Its mechanical function (teeth engaging hidden gears) and symbolic function (letter M, typewriter-ribbon scent callback) drive the opening and charge the ending image. Removing it breaks the unlock mechanism and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"You promised you'd find it when the water returns" (paragraph 3) establishes the core stake and Arthur's midsummer vigil. The promise shapes his twenty-year search and drives his presence at the cavern. Paragraph 14 explicitly names it ("why the promise had to linger"), and the closure fulfills it. However, the promise itself doesn't create on-page friction or tactical constraint during the cavern sequence; it motivates arrival but doesn't complicate choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Empirically intuitive" is declared (paragraph 4) as Arthur watches ants, and the text asserts his gut training enables reading the landscape. However, the trait never constrains a choice or forces a tradeoff; Arthur follows the ants without empirical/intuitive tension. The label remains ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Glimmer appears when the matrix chip is placed (paragraph 8: "metal began to glimmer...internal phosphorescence"), drives the ants' circling behavior, and returns in the final beat (paragraph 15: "glimmer spread through the blooming cavern like sunrise"). The glimmer signals the chip's activation and charges the closure image, linking setup to ending. Removing "glimmer" would require alternate cues for the chip's function and final transformation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Following ants home" is Thomas's final instruction (paragraph 9), and Arthur follows the ant procession from paragraph 4 onward (carrying glowing fungus to the fissure, circling the chip, disappearing into the crack). The ants' path leads Arthur to the correct fissure for the chip. However, Arthur simply watches and follows without testing alternate paths or facing friction from the method; it's presented as the only legible route.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Blooming cavern is established early (paragraph 4: foxfire moss, Appalachian blooms that "only opened during the solstice flood"), and its sensory details (nectar smell of old paper and typewriter ribbon) link to Arthur's profession. The cavern's interior chamber (paragraph 12: maps in glowing mycelium) provides the archive Arthur will catalog, directly shaping closure. The solstice timing and flood-dependent blooms create the temporal window. Removing the blooming cavern breaks both atmosphere and the archive's physical form.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Creek rises throughout (paragraph 4: "rain fell in sheets," paragraph 10: "creek roared behind him, rising faster than predicted," paragraph 11: "twelve minutes, perhaps fifteen," paragraph 14: "icy water licking at his heels and climbing his calves"). The rising water creates urgency and is present in the closure moment. However, the twelve-minute estimate is never tested on the page; Arthur completes his discovery and choice without the timer visibly narrowing his window or forcing faster decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The doorway is mentioned in Thomas's promise (implied in paragraph 3: "find it") and named explicitly in paragraph 10 ("doorway of decisions a literal race"), paragraph 12 (what it is), and paragraph 14 (why it had to be found this way). Arthur's search drives the plot and his final choice to catalog the archive fulfills the quest. However, "doorway of decisions" as phrase arrives late (paragraph 10) and the desire to find it doesn't create on-page conflict or friction; Arthur never doubts, hesitates, or faces a competing want.</comment>
