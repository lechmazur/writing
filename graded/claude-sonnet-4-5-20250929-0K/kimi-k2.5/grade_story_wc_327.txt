<comment>The copper-veined storyteller has a clear goal (preserve language) but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven rather than contradictory or embodied. The diamond's hunger and the elder's offstage death provide pressure, but the protagonist's internal conflict never surfaces as simultaneous competing impulses in scene. Her final action feels procedurally executed rather than earned through visible struggle with a personal cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the diamond's curse dissolves, language preserved as resonance)—but cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than felt or visible on the page. The single-scene continuous structure fits scope, and the textural density increases toward the ending, but the final image lacks a sharp before/after that makes personal cost unmistakable.</comment>

<comment>The bone towers, canyon acoustics, and whispering gallery are vividly specific and integral to the plot's mechanics. The diamond's placement in the hollow carved by ancient acousticians and the copper veins conducting reverberations embed setting in action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the storyteller's professional priorities, and the environment directly enables the resolution.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake (preserve dying language) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens via the offstage elder's approaching death, but that deadline never lands with visible urgency or alters on-page tactics. The protagonist's agency appears in the final act (speaking the creation myth), yet the resolution unfolds without a dramatized cost or trade-off that narrows her options beforehand. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diamond responds to her footsteps, but escalation remains atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist choices that foreclose paths.</comment>

<comment>Theme (preservation of language, translation of the ephemeral into resonance) emerges from image and action rather than assertion. The flawed diamond's fracture-as-key, the ravens' interference patterns, and the bone-tower acoustics build a coherent symbolic architecture. However, the ending's resolution—curse harmless, language preserved—feels conceptually tidy without the ambiguity or felt moral cost that would invite deeper reflection. The creation myth recitation at the terminus offers a resonant image but leans toward thematic declaration rather than an open, non-literal answer.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: professional-acoustic bias filters setting detail (porous texture, calcium walls, tonal frequencies). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though elevated register occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("dissolution of syntax," "recursive depths") without loss of clarity. No dialogue; narration stays within the storyteller's plausible lexicon. Psychic distance is steady, and the prose reflects the focalizer's expertise without Wikipedia-voice intrusion.</comment>

<comment>Density is high and propulsion generally strong, but several lines loop conceptually: "the death of the language accelerated with each passing breath" restates the offstage elder's decline without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "The gem was rumored... Now it pulsed... The tunnel opened... Here, the attribute..." (four consecutive summary-declarative stems). Figurative language (trapped lightning, throat-like passage, organ pipes) is vivid but clusters densely in the final third without always serving clarity. Syntax varies purposefully elsewhere, and information density is solid. Minor scaffold reduces momentum slightly but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of acoustic topology, avian pattern-reading, and language preservation through resonance is specific and non-obvious. The copper-veined body as living circuit, the flawed diamond as phoneme prison, and the bone towers as archive offer fresh particulars rather than stock fantasy motifs. The core premise (harnessing a cursed object to save a dying language via sound-texture translation) commits fully and follows its implications without retreat. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the lyric final beat heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The copper-veined storyteller is present throughout, drives the middle action (moving through the tunnel, placing the diamond, speaking the creation myth), and her choices enable the resolution. Setup in paragraph one, development via the journey, and payoff in the final act. Her on-page decisions narrow options (choosing quiet articulation to avoid triggering the diamond's hunger), though the final cost is more conceptual than personal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The flawed diamond appears in paragraph one (setup), pulses in response to her copper veins and footsteps (development), and cracks to sing at the terminus (payoff). Its internal fracture and curse mechanics constrain tactics (quiet speech to avoid triggering hunger) and the resolution hinges on redirecting its malice. The object is handled across three distinct beats and its transformation (crack along flaw line, releases stored vocabulary) is causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The tunnel of echoes is introduced in paragraph one, shapes the protagonist's weapon choice (quiet articulation vs. loud noise), provides the mechanics for redirecting the curse ("harnessing the endless echoes to trap the diamond's malice"), and anchors the final image (language lives on as resonance within the canyon). The concept is causally integral: without the echo chamber's acoustic properties, the resolution cannot occur.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>"Quietly articulate" is labeled explicitly ("Here, the attribute of quiet articulation became her weapon") and enables one tactic (soft speech avoids triggering the diamond's hunger). It appears in the opening paragraph and returns at the whispering gallery, but the constraint is told rather than dramatized with visible friction or cost. The trait functions as a plot key rather than a character-specific challenge that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Harness" appears explicitly in paragraph two ("She needed to harness the diamond's imprisoned phonemes") and the final act dramatizes harnessing the canyon's acoustics to redirect the curse. The action is central to the resolution, but the mechanics are conceptual rather than physically embodied—she speaks, the diamond responds—making the verb's causal pressure less irreplaceable than its thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>The ravens and their spiral-to-gyre formation are introduced in paragraph two and provide the translation key ("texture into sound, rough porousness into tonal frequencies"). The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter to the plot. However, after the decipherment, the birds scatter and the method does not constrain later choices or return to charge the ending image, making it functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The bone towers and canyon are present from the opening line, supply the acoustics that enable the resolution, and anchor the final image ("language lived on as resonance within the towers of bone"). The whispering gallery of rib bones arranged like organ pipes provides the exact spatial resource needed for the climax. Setting is integral across setup, development, and payoff, with causal pressure and closure linkage. Removing this exact setting would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The timeframe (death of the elder at dawn, language dissolution) is declared early and referenced twice ("running out of time," "sleeping elder miles away"), but the deadline never tightens on-page tactics or creates visible urgency. The storyteller moves at a narrative pace unaffected by the clock. Time is thematic but does not constrain choices or alter the resolution's timing, making it ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The motivation to translate texture into sound is signaled in paragraph two ("translation she sought: texture into sound") and drives the protagonist's decipherment of the raven patterns and her final act (speaking to vibrate the bone towers). The desire is dramatized through on-page action, though internal conflict or friction between this want and competing costs is absent. The motivation is essential to the plot but not tested by visible trade-offs.</comment>
