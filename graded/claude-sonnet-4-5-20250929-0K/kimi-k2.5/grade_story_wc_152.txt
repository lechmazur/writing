<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is established through concrete action (embroidering intelligence into star charts), and her "foolishness as architecture" creates a legible character strategy. However, her competence borders on frictionless—she never faces a moment where her method might fail or her disguise might be penetrated, which flattens internal conflict. The captain's instant comprehension feels convenient; we don't see Mira sweat over whether her oblique warning will land. Embodied contradiction is present in the performance/wisdom split but never tested with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Accumulative texture building toward a Causal turn when the captain arrives). Closure achieves Charged Poise: the conspiracy is forestalled, the "silence still intact" reweights the opening's "unheard stories," and cost registers as the fragility Mira must continue to navigate. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly by the second paragraph. The main causal link—Mira's displaced constellation functions as a map—lands with clarity, though the "adjacent possibilities" mechanic remains more atmosphere than dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is sensuously rendered ("autumn sunlight into something deep and marine") and the space actively shapes Mira's method: the dome "held sounds like a shell holds ocean," the eternal candle provides constancy for her calculations. Spatial choreography is clean (alcove, workbench, spiral stairs). The autumn timeframe and falling copper leaves supply recurring atmospheric pressure. The observatory as both literal workspace and resonance chamber charges the final image of "silence still intact."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the coup while maintaining her cover—is signaled early and tightens when "three days before the coup, the pattern clarified." The captain's arrival is the key reversal, forcing Mira to encode her warning in a way that tests her disguise. However, the resolution feels slightly frictionless: the captain decodes her instantly, and we don't witness a moment where the warning might fail or arrive too late. The cost is conceptual (ongoing fragility) rather than a visible sacrifice on the page, keeping this in the 7.0–7.9 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the central question: what stories exist only in silence, and how do we preserve them? The "adjacent possibilities" and "negative space of treason" anchor this in specific imagery rather than abstraction. The closing image—"the fragile border between what was whispered and what was saved"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The eternal candle and recurring silence motif accumulate meaning across the piece, and the wisdom-as-foolishness frame reweights power dynamics without thesis statements. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the candlelit closure earns its charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric register: "conspirators' footsteps three floors below, though no one else had learned to read that geometry yet." However, perceptual certainty occasionally exceeds what Mira can plausibly know in real time ("the coup would come with the first frost; she had heard it in the unspoken pauses"). Some phrases risk ornamental elevation ("galaxy-chart embroiderer, obsessed with celestial thread-counts") that slightly pulls away from immediate embodiment. Dialogue (the captain's exchange) is spare and functional, avoiding false complexity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "harmless as a moth circling dull flame," "timelines brushing close to this one like ghosts breathing on glass," "stories that existed only in gaps between words." While individually vivid, the metaphor layer rarely pauses, risking decorative accumulation in a high-concept piece where clarity of method matters. A few constructions lean ornamental ("the Candle Keeper's quadrant is wrong" as pure setup feels slightly scaffolded). No paraphrase loops or template cadence; syntax varies purposefully. Momentum holds, but line-level clarity would benefit from one or two beats of plain declaration amid the lyricism.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of embroidery-as-espionage, "adjacent possibilities" divination, and the disguise-as-architecture frame is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its metaphysical mechanic and follows through to the closure image. However, the "wise woman mistaken for mad" archetype is familiar, and the piece does not materially transform it beyond elegant execution. The "negative space of treason" and "listening to stars" offer fresh angles, and the autumn-observatory setting particularizes the premise. Risk is present in the high-concept bet, but the captain's instant decoding slightly softens the boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and drives two major beats: her embroidery work across the week and her oblique warning to the captain. Her choice to "disguise urgent intelligence as aesthetic obsession" enables the story's central tactic. Removing her would collapse the narrative entirely.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The eternal candle appears in three beats: establishing Mira's workspace, as a calculation anchor ("using its constancy to measure which threads of reality were fraying"), and in the ending gesture ("touching the eternal flame to seal a thread"). It provides both literal light and metaphoric stability, constraining her method. However, its mechanics remain slightly atmospheric; we don't see a moment where the flame's behavior alters a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Unraveling the conspiracy is the story's spine: Mira detects it through overheard fragments, tracks it via displaced star-patterns, and warns the captain in the climax. The conspiracy shapes every beat, from her method ("adjacent possibilities") to the three-day countdown to the final "silence still intact." The entire narrative logic collapses without this element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is dramatized across multiple beats: courtiers dismiss her as "obsessed with celestial thread-counts," she prattles about "constellation accuracy" to the observatory keeper, and the captain recognizes "her foolishness was architecture." This trait enables her survival and her warning. The tradeoff—social dismissal as the price of operational security—is visible and sustained.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears explicitly once ("Synchronize your men with the adjacent possibility where the gates remain closed") and threads through her earlier work ("synchronizing the Andromeda spiral with yesterday's overheard fragment"). It shapes the resolution but arrives late as an articulated instruction rather than a demonstrated method. The action is present and consequential but not developed across enough distinct beats to be indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Adjacent possibilities" is named early ("the timelines brushing close to this one like ghosts breathing on glass") and recurs as her divination mechanic: comparing "slight variations between her stitch and the actual stars." It frames her method and reappears in the climactic instruction. However, the mechanics remain more poetic assertion than on-page demonstration—we never see her test a failed possibility or adjust when the adjacent reading is unclear. Present and thematically charged, but not operationally constraining.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is established early and shapes every beat: the dome filters light "into something deep and marine," holds sound "like a shell holds ocean," and provides the isolated workspace that enables Mira's disguise. Autumn is signaled through copper leaves and the "first frost" deadline. The setting's acoustic and optical properties directly enable her surveillance method, and the "cobalt glass deepened to purple" charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the coup" anchors the story and tightens explicitly: "Three days before the coup, the pattern clarified" and "Before the frost seals the windows." The countdown pressures Mira's choices and the captain's arrival. Removing the temporal constraint would eliminate the urgency that drives the final act. The clock is live and consequential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to listen for unheard stories" is articulated early ("she did not stitch stars so much as listen to them") and recurs in the closing line ("listening for the next unheard story forming in the silence between heartbeats"). It frames her method and thematic stance. However, we never see this desire conflict with another want—safety, recognition, rest—so it remains a shaping principle rather than a dramatized tension with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is sustained across the piece: "silence between palace whispers," "vacuum where loyalists' voices should have been," "echoed silence of the cobalt dome," and the closing "silence still intact." The tone modulates from meditative observation to quiet urgency as the captain arrives, then returns to watchful poise. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and charges the final image without breaking into louder registers.</comment>
