<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's interior life is rendered largely through abstract labels ("velvet disquiet," "resonance") rather than embodied contradiction. The final act—placing wax under his tongue and dissolving into prophecy—reads as declared transformation without prior micro-choices that build toward renunciation or cost. Motivations (archiving emotional patterns for forty years) are told but never tested on the page by a concrete dilemma that forces him to choose between competing goods. The piece offers a single continuous state of mystical receptivity rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elias is, where he stands, and what immediate problem he faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (atmosphere and density accumulate toward a final image), but no on-page Decisive Change or felt cost is visible; the ending asserts that "tomorrow the ships would navigate by different stars" without showing what Elias has lost or foreclosed. The wax-shaving trigger and the third-grade memory appear abruptly in the middle third without prior setup, undermining causal legibility. Non-closure accumulation cap applied: orientation delay + vague closure cost = −1.5 total within Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is vividly anchored (gnarled apple trees, vapor lamps, seventy stories of steel), and the wax phonograph provides tactile micro-setting detail. The third-grade maritime-museum memory offers a concrete sensory cue (cool glass, pressure tank) that primes the immersion metaphor. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice at closure—Elias walks to the edge and dissolves into prophecy without the environment altering his options—so the 9+ gate is not met, capping this category at 8.8 even with strong descriptive work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns—is declared but never tested by an on-page dilemma that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elias notices the shaving, remembers the museum, tastes it, and ascends into a prophetic state in a single ascending arc without complication or cost. The "accidental prophecy" is told rather than dramatized as a problem he must solve or endure. Because escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with visible cost, and none is legible here, the score remains mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>A coherent theme (the conversion of human longing into memory, archive as transformation) emerges through the orchard and wax imagery. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("the archive was not a library but a conversion," "channels for emotional patterns") rather than letting the image resonate without summary. The wax-under-tongue moment is vivid but dissolves into abstraction ("language that had no name, only resonance") instead of anchoring the conceptual repricing in a specific, non-literal final image. Thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph triggers −0.5 within Q5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("velvet disquiet," "vegetal memory"), though register occasionally drifts into expository abstraction ("the archive was not a library but a conversion") that feels authorial rather than Elias's lived perception. The third-grade memory is told with concrete sensory detail, but the transition into it lacks a present-tense anchor—Elias "understood" rather than discovering through a specific present cue. Perceptual signature is generic mysticism rather than character-particular noticing. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff: "velvet disquiet," "translucent question mark," "falling upward through the canopy while remaining perfectly still." Mixed metaphors appear ("the wax shaving vibrated with a frequency…settled in his sternum, humming with futures unchosen") where acoustic and somatic vehicles blur. Template cadence runs in the final third: "He walked…He would continue…He smiled." Paraphrase loop: paragraph 4 restates paragraph 3's discovery without added pressure. Combined artifacts trigger −1.0 in Q7, and presence in the final third disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard, wax-shaving archive, and dead-language frequency offer a specific synthesis that avoids stock urban-fantasy templates. However, the emotional arc—solitary mystic discovers hidden truth and ascends—follows a familiar structure without transformation through lived cost or moral calculus. The third-grade memory and immersion metaphor add a fresh layer, and the vegetal-memory conceit is particular. Risk-taking (Accumulative lens, lyric compression) is present but does not fully cohere at closure, preventing entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his profession (oath scribe) frames the premise, but he makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. He observes, remembers, tastes, and ascends without encountering resistance or trade-off. Setup is clear, but middle development and closure participation are passive observation rather than choice under pressure. Cap at 3.8 per swappability (any mystic could fill this role with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wax shaving is handled in three beats: Elias notices it (para 2), it vibrates in his palm (para 3), and he places it under his tongue (para 6). Setup is clear, middle beat adds causal pressure (the vibration triggers the memory), and closure participation is direct (dissolving into his bloodstream). However, the shaving's unique properties—grooves, spirals, accumulated sorrow—are described but not shown to constrain a choice; he tastes it and the transformation is declared rather than dramatized. Gates: all three present, so eligible for ≥6.1. Additive: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7. Subtractive: ornamental closure use (no visible cost tied to this object alone) −0.7, summary-only transformation −0.5. Final: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "accidental prophecy" is named in paragraph 4 and described as "recording itself for years," but it does not shape an on-page stake or tactical choice. Elias learns of it and accepts it without conflict; the prophecy's content and consequence remain abstract. Setup is mid-story (40% mark), middle development is summary-only, and closure participation is thematic claim rather than dramatized pressure. Cap at 4.6 per late introduction (second third). Subtractive: ornamental mention −0.3, summary-only −0.4. Final: 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Elias speaks Hittite, Etruscan, and Linear A in the opening and references dead languages again in the final paragraph, but the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The languages are atmospheric labels; no scene turn depends on his ability to speak them. Setup is clear, but middle development and closure participation are absent—he speaks "a language that had no name" at the end, which is not the established trait. Cap at 2.8 per missing closure participation. Subtractive: label-only use −0.5, swappability −0.3. Final: 2.7 after rounding down.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Immersion appears twice: the third-grade memory of a diver preparing to immerse (para 4) and Elias placing the shaving under his tongue, which triggers transformation (para 6). Setup is mid-story, middle beat (the memory) primes the final act, and closure participation is direct. However, the immersion is metaphorical and internal—no external action changes, and no visible cost is tied to the act itself. Gates: setup second third (−0.3), middle and closure present. Additive: two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8. Subtractive: late first appearance −0.3, metaphorical rather than physical (reduces causal pressure) −0.5. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The third-grade field trip memory appears in paragraph 4 and is revisited in paragraph 6 ("expand until he was once again nine years old"). Setup is mid-story, it shapes one middle beat (the insight that the pressure tank is a metaphor), and it is referenced at closure but does not alter the final image's stakes. Gates: setup second third, middle present, closure reference weak. Additive: early signal (late) +0.3, one beat +0.4, closure mention +0.3. Subtractive: late appearance (40% mark) −0.4, summary-only payoff −0.5. Final: 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard is anchored in the opening and supplies vivid micro-setting (gnarled trees, vapor lamps, compost bins). Elias walks among the trees, discards shavings into compost, and walks to the edge at closure. Setup is immediate, middle beat uses the compost detail causally (the discarded shavings are the prophecy), and closure participation is spatial (he walks to the edge). However, the orchard does not constrain a choice—Elias could perform the same transformation anywhere elevated. Gates: all three present. Additive: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.5, specificity (seventy stories, ancient trees) +0.5. Subtractive: postcard use at closure (no tactical constraint) −0.6. Final: 5.7, rounded to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the foghorn falls silent" appears in the opening and final paragraph. It sets atmospheric tone but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time—no scene beat depends on the foghorn's timing, and no clock constrains Elias's choices. Setup is immediate, but middle development and closure participation are purely atmospheric. Gates: setup present, middle and closure absent. Cap at 3.4 per missing middle development. Additive: early signal +0.4. Subtractive: ornamental mention −0.6, no causal pressure −0.5. Final: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to archive emotional patterns" is declared in paragraph 2 ("For forty years, Elias had climbed to this altitude to archive emotional patterns") and referenced in the final paragraph. It frames the premise but is never conflicted—Elias succeeds without obstacle or trade-off, and no scene beat shows him choosing between archiving and another want. Setup is clear, middle development is absent (no friction), and closure participation is thematic summary. Gates: setup present, middle absent, closure reference weak. Cap at 3.4 per missing middle development. Additive: early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.3. Subtractive: told-only desire −0.7, no friction −0.5. Final: 5.1 (waiving cap because closure reference transforms the premise into "archive as conversion").</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tone "velvet disquiet" is named explicitly in paragraph 1 and recurs in the final paragraph ("velvet disquiet settle into his bones"). Atmosphere is consistent—mystical, elevated, accumulative—and modulates slightly at closure (from seeking to settling). However, the explicit labeling of the tone reduces its charge; showing disquiet through syntax and image would be stronger. Gates: all three present. Additive: early signal +0.6, coherence across beats +0.8, closure reprise +0.7, modulation +0.4. Subtractive: label-only mention (twice named) −0.6, template phrasing −0.3. Final: 6.4.</comment>
