<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's professional devotion to unvarnished history drives her final choice with visible cost (career, safety, funding). Her plant-telepathy and coffee-stain divination are introduced early but read more as ornamental abilities than traits that shape choices under pressure—the jasmine provides atmospheric advice rather than forcing a hard trade-off. Internal conflict is present (dream vs. empire, beauty vs. safety) but the final decision feels preordained by her established values rather than contradictory impulses wrestling in scene. The "mulberry ache of the choice" is asserted more than embodied through micro-hesitations or physical resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Causal-leaning Hybrid: Elara receives warnings from plants and coffee stains, then acts to propagate the violin's truth through roots. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost (the violin melts, her career endangered, truth distributed) that lands on the page. One structural slip: the empire's Ministry claim is stated as future fact without dramatized uncertainty, flattening what could be a tighter pressure point. The final image (empty case, sorrow, taste of the future) reconfigures the opening stakes with felt cost, satisfying closure requirements under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer is vividly rendered (crimson draperies, greenhouse heat, dust motes, jasmine, fern, oaks) and setting actively constrains choice: the temperature breaches critical threshold, creating urgency. The ice violin's melting and the potted oaks as vessels for propagation make the micro-environment essential to the ending. Minor deduction: some details (mulberry jam simile, mahogany case) read decorative rather than pressure-driving, and the surrounding forest's mycorrhizal network is invoked late without prior spatial setup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve authentic provenance vs. surrender to empire—is signaled early and tightens through the temperature breach and the dawn deadline. One meaningful escalation: Elara shifts from passive documentation to active destruction/propagation, forecloses the career-safety path with visible cost. The choice between "glittering, weaponized narrative" and melting the violin into root systems narrows options decisively. Minor friction: the empire's claim is stated as fait accompli rather than dramatized as imminent arrival, slightly reducing urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. power, memory vs. archive, resistance through dispersion) emerges from concrete action—melting the violin, distributing the monk's song into tree rings—without overt moralizing. The final image (empty case, mulberry stain sorrow, tasting the future) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The mycorrhizal/cambium library metaphor is vivid and particular. One slip: "the particular pain of choosing beauty over safety" over-articulates theme mid-climax, and "perforated destiny" as concept feels more ornamental than deeply integrated into the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong (provenance researcher's lens, plant-telepathy filtering). Diction is consistent and elevated but occasionally drifts into over-wrought lyricism ("spectral veins," "evaporating clarity," "hollow spaces where freedom had leaked out") that risks purple prose without full voice-motivation. No head-hopping. The plant-chorus moments ("sharp, green, photosynthetic terror," "chlorophyll and dread") are vivid but their register ("thermal shock," "collapsing cellular memories") sometimes feels more authorial than experiential. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense, with strong imagery. Multiple overwriting issues accumulate: density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("spectral veins," "vegetable kingdom screamed," "puncture wound in the fabric of what would be," "specific gravity of ice transforming to water"), mixed metaphors (coffee stains as "dark continents bleeding" then "puncture wounds"), and elevated diction ("mycorrhizal networks," "lignin," "cambium and sap") that occasionally clashes with immediacy. Several paraphrase loops: the violin's melting is described multiple times in adjacent passages without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "The oak roots drank greedily... By morning, the violin would be gone... Every tree would bear witness..." stacks similar syntactic structures. Applying −0.8 for density + coherence issues and −0.4 for loops touching the closure region.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (ice violin + plant telepathy + coffee-stain divination + mycorrhizal propagation of truth) is inventive on its surface but feels over-constructed—three separate magical abilities stacked without tight causal necessity. The ending choice (melt artifact to distribute its essence through roots) is fresh and committed. However, the combination reads more like prompt fulfillment than organic synthesis: swap any one element (divination method, telepathy channel) and the emotional/thematic arc remains largely intact. The "perforated destiny" concept is invoked but not deeply transformed. Risk-taking in the closing image is notable but does not fully offset the checklist feel of the setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as provenance researcher frames her stakes (devotion to unvarnished history) and drives the final choice to propagate truth underground rather than surrender to the Ministry. Present in setup, middle (documenting, reading coffee stains), and closure (opening the case, singing the note). The occupation matters causally: her professional knowledge and access enable the act. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band: essential across beats and ending, though the choice feels somewhat preordained by her established values rather than wrenchingly difficult.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ice violin is handled across multiple beats: traced in the opening, described as weeping, temperature-monitored, lifted and sung to at closure. Its transformation (solid → water → dissolved in roots) is the story's central action and indispensable to the ending. Removing it breaks the plot. The element drives causality (melting urgency) and charges the final image (empty case, distributed song). Scores high in the 8.5–10.0 band but held slightly below due to the violin functioning more as object-to-be-acted-upon than active constraint on earlier choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The core concept "perforated destiny" is introduced mid-story via coffee stains ("holes puncturing through time itself—a perforated destiny") and invoked once more when Elara sings "a frequency that perforated destiny itself." It appears in setup (coffee-stain reading) and closure (the sung note), but its mechanics are vague and it does not demonstrably constrain tactics or narrow options. The story would function with "reading the future" alone; the perforation metaphor adds texture but not causal necessity. Swappable with minor edits. Scores mid-band: functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is introduced early (jasmine panic, fern chorus) and returns at the end (jasmine triumph, ivy Morse code, oak incorporation). It enables one key choice: asking the jasmine "how to propagate truth" yields the mycorrhizal-network solution. However, the trait feels more like a convenient delivery mechanism than a constraint with cost—Elara could have reached the same solution through research or memory. The ability is present across beats but does not impose visible trade-offs or difficulty. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band: shapes one key turn but remains somewhat swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Propagate" is the story's central action: Elara propagates the violin's truth through root systems, shifting from passive researcher to active distributor. The verb is seeded early (asking the jasmine "how to propagate truth"), drives the climax (melting the violin into soil), and defines the resolution (truth archived in woody tissue, forest-wide witness). Removing "propagate" requires fundamental rewrite. The action is irreplaceable and causally central. Scores high in the 8.5–10.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Coffee-stain divination is introduced early ("ability had emerged only last winter") and provides the inciting knowledge: the stains show "holes puncturing through time" and the empire's future claim. It shapes Elara's understanding of the stakes and appears again at closure when she "sang the note she had heard in the coffee stains." Present in setup and closure, but its mechanics are vague and it does not constrain middle tactics—once the vision is received, the method becomes passive. Functional but not indispensable; another divination method would serve similarly. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band: shapes one key turn (the vision) with purposeful reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer directly shapes the conflict: the greenhouse heat accelerates the violin's melting, creating urgency ("temperature breached critical threshold," "she had until dawn"). The setting provides the potted oaks that become vessels for propagation. Midsummer heat is causally essential—remove it and the violin does not melt, removing the time pressure. The observatory's plants enable the solution. Present across beats and indispensable to the ending. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band: essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the promise loses its glow" maps onto "she had until dawn" and the temperature breach creating urgency. Time pressure is stated and motivates the final choice. However, the exact deadline is invoked more than tracked—no clock-checking or escalating time cues tighten the middle beats. The phrase "promise loses its glow" is poetic but vague as a constraint. Present in setup and closure, functional in one turn (dawn deadline), but not as tightly integrated as it could be. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to weigh a dream against an empire" is dramatized on the page: Elara's lifelong devotion to history vs. career/safety, "the mulberry ache of the choice," and the final decision to "save its soul" at personal cost. The friction between wants (preserve truth) and costs (funding, safety, career) is explicit and shapes the climax. Present across beats and drives the ending. Minor deduction: the choice feels somewhat preordained by her character rather than agonizingly balanced in the moment. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band: essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone "mulberry ache" is seeded early ("air thick as mulberry jam") and returns at the climax ("the mulberry ache of the choice settled in her chest, sweet and bruising") and ending ("eyes holding the particular sorrow of mulberry stain—deep, permanent, necessary"). The descriptor modulates with pressure: greenhouse heaviness → painful choice → permanent sorrow. It charges the final image and maintains coherence. However, "mulberry" as a tonal register is more metaphorical than pervasive—other passages read lush-lyric without the bitter-sweet specificity. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band, upper end: shapes one key turn with purposeful reprise that reweights the stake.</comment>
