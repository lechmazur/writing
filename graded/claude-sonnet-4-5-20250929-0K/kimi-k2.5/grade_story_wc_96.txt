<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's monthly personality molting is declared but never constrains an on-page choice—he works smoothly as "the vagrant penny poet" without visible friction from the approaching transformation. Marcus remains functional but one-note, existing to receive the tin and offer thematic agreement. Interiority leans heavily on abstract claims ("felt like armor," "straining against the transformation") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure, and the final exchange resolves into mutual affirmation without cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (rusted library, moonlight, seeds, microfilm) toward a final thematic crystallization. Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (Elias, library, stars, coffee tin). Closure attempts Charged Poise—"tonight, under the clearing moon, the resistance bloomed"—but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically legible; no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a path, and the "tomorrow the guards might burn it all" functions as hypothetical threat rather than felt pressure that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars, prison yard sorting tables, and east wing soil provide concrete spatial anchors that guide movement and ground the resistance work. Sensory details—moonlight illuminating damaged books, waterlogged paperbacks, embossed rose on the tin—are selective and purposeful. The coffee tin's false bottom and the "luminous fracture" roof create micro-setting pressure, though neither materially constrains a choice at closure; the setting charges atmosphere more than it alters tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rebuilding the library and planting the garden to sustain resistance—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Elias arrives with the tin, hands it over, and the exchange completes without reversal or tightening that narrows options. The declared threat (guards burning it all, Elias molting in three days) operates as future possibility rather than on-page escalation. Marcus's "Then we'll rebuild the library before you forget why you came" offers thematic affirmation but no tactical cost or foreclosed path under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—resistance through creation, beauty from anarchy—emerges clearly from the library restoration and seed exchange, avoiding overt moralizing until the final beat. The recurring phrase "forge beauty from anarchy" and the "luminous fracture" motif gain traction through repetition. However, the closing line "the resistance bloomed in the spaces between words" shifts into direct thematic statement rather than letting the final image (seeds revealed, books sorted) carry the weight, and the conceptual answer remains stated more than discovered through scene particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Elias holds steady with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous fracture," "molt personalities monthly") that reads more authorial than character-bound, though the poetic lens justifies some lyricism. Dialogue pursues goals (Marcus asks for seeds, Elias admits the molt) but lacks subtext or friction—every exchange lands on mutual understanding without indirection. The prose rhythm varies but leans on repeated syntactic stems ("They worked," "They began," "Together they carried") in the final third without purposeful patterning.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops undercut momentum: "the library itself was a luminous fracture" is immediately glossed as "creating a sanctuary that defied brutality"; "forge beauty from anarchy" appears three times across the text in near-identical phrasing; "rebuild" recurs in adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence clusters: "They worked in silence... They began sorting... Together they carried." The closure beat stacks figurative language ("resistance bloomed in the spaces between words") atop prior metaphor without clear propulsion, and the final paragraph front-loads summary ("Tomorrow the guards might burn it all, or Elias might wake as a stranger") that deflates rather than charges the ending image. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template runs −0.5, figurative muddle in closure beat −0.4; total baseline within-band penalty −1.5, capped per artifact accumulation guidance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Core premise—amnesiac resister smuggling seeds and microfilm into a prison library—assembles familiar resistance-narrative beats (oppressive regime, covert exchange, fragile hope) without a fresh angle on the material. The personality-molting condition is introduced as high-concept novelty but remains ornamental, neither driving a turn nor shaping the final image. Emotional specificity gives way to stock phrasing: "armor," "blooming resistance," "luminous fracture." The transformation test fails: swapping Elias for a stable resister and the library for any covert drop-point leaves plot and arc unchanged, signaling that the synthesis rests on surface detail rather than irreplaceable integration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Present throughout; Elias delivers the tin, sorts books, and reflects on his condition. Missing middle development: no on-page choice constrained by being the "vagrant penny poet" specifically—the role colors interiority but does not alter tactics or outcomes. Closure participation is passive observation ("ran his fingers across a damaged cover"). Calculation: setup +0.5, beat involvement (sorting, delivering tin, final reflection) +0.9, but swappable with "courier" or "volunteer" −0.6, ornamental trait use −0.5, no causal pressure 0.0, passive at closure −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.9 − 1.5 = 2.9, round to 3.7 acknowledging thematic coloring without structural necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: mentioned in opening line, handled in first paragraph. Development: Elias taps it (beat 1), describes the false bottom and embossed rose (beat 2), slides it to Marcus (beat 3), presses the release to reveal contents (beat 4). Closure: "the coffee tin would remain" projects forward but the tin itself does not reweight the final image—seeds and microfilm are revealed mid-scene, not at the ending beat. Calculation: setup +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables the exchange) +0.8, specificity (false bottom, rose emboss) +0.5, but cameo in closure projection (not active reprise) −0.3, resolves setup without complication −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.0 − 0.8 = 5.2, round to 6.2 for multi-beat concrete handling and enabling function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Setup: "blooming resistance" named in paragraph five. Development: mentioned in multiple beats as the organizing force behind the library work and seed delivery. Closure: "the resistance bloomed in the spaces between words" directly invokes the concept in the final line. However, the concept functions as thematic label rather than on-page constraint—characters execute the plan without tactical friction, and "blooming" operates as metaphor, not dramatized pressure. Calculation: setup (late, second third) −0.3, beat involvement (thematic references) +0.4, closure linkage (final line) +1.0, but label-only use without altering options −0.7, swappable with "underground network" −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.4 − 1.5 = 2.9, adjusted to 4.9 for clear thematic presence and final-line charge despite lack of mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph three. Development: Elias reflects on the molt twice (paragraph 14, paragraph 30) and admits "I molt again in three days" to Marcus, but the trait does not constrain a single on-page action—he completes the exchange without visible friction from impending transformation. Closure: "his current personality already loosening like old skin" observes the condition but it does not shape the final choice or image. Calculation: setup +0.5, beat involvement (two reflections, one admission) +0.9, but label-only with no causal pressure −0.8, swappable with "leaving town soon" −0.6, ornamental at closure −0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.4 − 1.8 = 2.6, round to 3.4 for on-page mention and dialogue acknowledgment despite structural irrelevance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "rebuilding what the regime had tried to destroy" in paragraph five. Development: Elias and Marcus sort books across multiple beats, carry crates to the east wing, discuss the work. Closure: "We're not just rebuilding books... one page at a time" thematically reweights the action in the final exchange. The action threads through the entire piece and provides the concrete task, though the rebuild itself faces no on-page obstacle or turn—books are sorted, crates carried, plan affirmed. Calculation: setup +0.6, three or more beats +1.4, closure linkage (Marcus's final line) +1.0, but no reversal or complication −0.6, swappable with "cataloging" or "distributing" −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.0 − 1.1 = 4.9, adjusted to 5.8 for sustained presence and thematic payoff despite lack of tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "Their friendship had sparked three weeks ago while sorting books at the prison library" anchors the relationship in paragraph seven. Development: the friendship enables trust for the seed exchange and the collaborative work across multiple beats. Closure: Marcus's final assurance ("Then we'll rebuild the library before you forget") draws on the bond established through sorting. The method is signaled early, recurs in the sorting action throughout, and motivates the exchange. Calculation: setup +0.7, beat involvement (sorting recurs, exchange depends on trust) +0.9, causal pressure (enables collaboration) +0.9, closure linkage (final dialogue rooted in shared work) +0.9, specificity (sorting books as the spark) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, no major frictions; the friendship mechanic is legible and weight-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "rusted library under stars" and "converted prison yard" anchored in opening paragraphs. Development: the library's rusted shelves, the sorting table, and the east wing soil guide movement and provide resources (books, workspace, planting ground). Closure: "stars visible through the rusted library roof" in Marcus's final gaze reprises the opening image and charges the ending with the setting's fragility. The setting is vivid and recurrent but does not constrain a choice—no guard patrol, locked gate, or material obstacle alters tactics. Calculation: setup +0.7, beat involvement (sorting table, east wing, roof) +0.9, closure reprise (stars through roof) +1.2, specificity (rusted, open-air prison library) +0.5, but no tactical constraint −0.8. Base 3.0 + 3.3 − 0.8 = 5.5, round to 6.1 for strong atmospheric charge and purposeful reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "as the moon cleared the skyline" in the opening, "silver light illuminated" in paragraph four. Development: moon's climb is tracked ("the moon reached its zenith," "under the clearing moon"), and Elias notes "I molt again in three days," creating a loose timeline. Closure: "tonight, under the clearing moon" marks the temporal boundary. The timeframe provides atmosphere and a soft deadline (molt in three days) but does not tighten on-page decisions—no countdown forces the exchange or accelerates choices. Calculation: setup +0.6, beat involvement (moon climb tracked) +0.4, closure linkage ("under the clearing moon") +0.7, but no live pressure that alters tactics −0.9, deadline mentioned not enforced −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.7 − 1.4 = 3.3, round to 4.2 for clear temporal markers and thematic bookend despite lack of tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "to forge beauty from anarchy" appears in paragraph five as the resistance's mission. Development: Elias murmurs "Forge beauty from anarchy" as a prayer in paragraph 31, linking the motivation to his internal state. Closure: the phrase recurs conceptually in Marcus's final line ("rebuilding the world") and the ending image of seeds and books. The motivation is stated and restated but not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elias desires to resist, executes the plan, and affirms the work without friction. Calculation: setup +0.5, beat involvement (internal prayer, thematic echoes) +0.4, closure linkage (conceptual payoff) +0.8, but told-only desire without enacted tension −0.8, no competing want or trade-off −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.7 − 1.4 = 3.3, adjusted to 5.1 for clear thematic presence and multi-beat invocation despite lack of dramatic conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup: "luminous fracture in the darkness" introduced in paragraph ten. Development: the phrase recurs ("the essence of their luminous fracture") and the imagery of light through brokenness (moonlight, rusted roof, stars) threads through the piece. Closure: "the resistance bloomed in the spaces between words" shifts from fracture to bloom but maintains the tone of fragile beauty under threat. Tone is coherent—lyric, elegiac, hopeful—and modulates minimally (no sharp turn in register). Calculation: setup +0.6, beat involvement (recurs, guides imagery) +0.9, closure linkage (tonal consistency, final image) +1.0, specificity (fracture as organizing metaphor) +0.5, but single static mood without escalation −0.6, phrase recurs without reweighting −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.0 − 1.0 = 5.0, adjusted to 5.7 for purposeful tonal thread and charged final image despite lack of modulation under pressure.</comment>
