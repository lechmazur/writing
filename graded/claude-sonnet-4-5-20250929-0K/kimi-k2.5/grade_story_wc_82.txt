<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to transform grief into cranes emerges clearly, but interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphysical language ("soul untethers," "corporeal anchor") rather than embodied contradiction. The final dispersal reads as surrender rather than a choice that forecloses options with felt cost—Mira becomes "the light itself" without dramatized resistance or trade-off. Backstory (daughter, husband) is told in a single retrospective block without anchoring in present micro-choices that shift tactics. The shadow-detachment frame offers potential for internal conflict but remains ornamental rather than forcing contradictory impulses to act in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cranes accumulate as physical manifestations of folded grief, and the final dispersal reconfigures Mira's essence into atmospheric blessing. Closure occurs on the page (she disperses, cranes scatter), but cost remains asserted rather than viscerally felt—"became the light itself" and "ascending not by rising, but by diving" are poetic claims without a concrete forfeiture or visible price that alters options. Orientation anchors (workshop, floating isle, tea garden) arrive early. The narrative delivers one meaningful deepening (gem-folding accelerates to crane-release to self-dispersal), meeting the 600–800 word scope, but the final image's conceptual repricing lacks the undeniable weight required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating-island tea garden, glass basilica, and gem-polishing wheel provide vivid spatial anchors and constrain the protagonist's final work to this suspended, enchanted locale. The upward-drifting petals and translucent floor charge the atmosphere, and the workshop-to-garden movement is choreographed cleanly. The gems and wheel are handled in multiple beats (polishing, unfolding, crane-folding), meeting the micro-setting/tool test. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Mira's process unfolds without environmental friction or shortage—so the garden functions primarily as lyric backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming accumulated grief into cranes that can fly—is signaled early and pursued through gem-polishing and origami-folding. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening (understanding "she had been the shadow all along") that reconfigures the metaphysical frame, and the crane-release constitutes agency. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on poetic assertion ("luminous torment," "diving into the heart of light") rather than a visible trade-off or forfeiture that narrows options. No live obstacle or cost-laden choice tests commitment; the process flows without friction or visible price paid on the page, meeting baseline pressure but not the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of grief transformed into blessing through artisan labor emerges organically from the crane-folding and dispersal. The final image—cranes scattering as "sadness transformed into hope, weight transformed into wings"—attempts a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the closing lines drift toward thematic summary ("only way to rise is to let go, to fold, to transform very heavy stone into infinity") that states the moral rather than letting the image carry it. The "descending while ascending" motif recurs purposefully, but its metaphysical register risks abstraction. The story resists easy binaries and invites reflection, yet the apprentice-discovery coda and explicit transformation language nudge into sermon territory, preventing full thematic integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The narrative maintains stable third-person limited focalization through Mira's perceptual filter, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture (e.g., "shadow pooling on the tatami like spilled ink," "cathedral of prisms"), and purposeful compression suits the Accumulative lens. However, diction drifts into elevated, quasi-mystical register ("corporeal anchor," "vaporous nightmares," "architecture of mourning") that reads as imposed rather than character-rooted—Mira is a crafty lantern maker, yet her interiority speaks in poet-philosopher cadence without grounding in her craft idiom. Filter verbs ("felt herself," "understood then") are frequent but voice-motivated. The final paragraph's extended metaphor stack ("spiral staircase of consciousness, each step both a burial and a birth") obscures rather than sharpens the closure image under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean and anchors spatial choreography, but suffers from pervasive overwriting and figurative density that dulls momentum. High-pressure beats deploy stacked metaphors ("architecture of mourning," "luminous torment made manifest," "spiral staircase of consciousness") without respite, violating the density penalty (−0.5). Synonym churn and template cadence appear in parallel constructions ("descending while ascending," "burial and a birth," "folding, transforming") across adjacent lines (−0.4). The final third doubles down on abstract elevation ("dispersed into the atmosphere," "diving into the heart of light") that obscures the concrete closure action, triggering the artifact-in-closure penalty (−0.5 additional). Information density is moderate; many sentences perform thematic echo rather than advancing choice or situation. The opening and garden-transition beats are sharper, but the closure paragraph collapses under metaphor weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of gem-polishing, dream-recording, origami cranes, and floating-island setting offers a non-obvious premise with genuine visual specificity. The transformation of mineral memory into flight and the shadow-detachment frame provide fresh angles on grief-work narratives. However, the emotional arc—artisan completes life's hidden work, releases accumulated sorrow, and ascends—follows a familiar template (the maker's final gift, the wise elder who becomes essence) without sufficient lived detail or moral calculus to transform it. The glass basilica and floating-isle tea garden are vividly particular, and the cranes-as-carriers premise feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric, metaphysical register heightens ambition but occasionally tips into ornament. The piece synthesizes elements with coherence, earning mid-range originality, but does not achieve the irreplaceable specificity or bold stakes required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The lantern maker is present throughout and her craft history (dream recording, gem polishing) is seeded early. She makes one key decision—to release the cranes—but the choice flows without visible friction or trade-off. Her thirty-year practice and "crafty" descriptor are told rather than shown constraining present tactics. The final dispersal is surrender rather than a turn that narrows options. Meets setup and closure gates but lacks middle development where her choices alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glass basilica is anchored early (workshop setting, "cathedral of prisms") and reprised at the crane-release ("passing through the glass basilica's spire") and final dispersal ("sang a single clear note"). However, its structural role is ornamental: it houses the workshop and chimes resonantly but does not constrain action or supply a resource that alters outcome. The floating-isle frame is more functional. Present in setup and closure, but middle development is weak; the basilica observes rather than shapes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dream recording is seeded early ("three decades… capturing the vaporous nightmares and fragile hopes") and directly enables the crane-folding: each crane is "a dream recording she had stolen from her own sleep over the decades, preserved in gem-form, now given flight." This causal link meets setup, middle (the cranes are dream-recordings-as-gems), and closure (cranes carry "dream recordings she had set free"). The concept shapes the dominant stake and reweights the final image. Present across all three gates with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Descending while ascending" is introduced early ("felt herself both falling and rising," "disoriented her, as though gravity had reversed") and recurs at the crane-folding climax ("descending deeper into grief while ascending beyond its gravity") and ending ("descending through cloud layers while climbing toward stars"). The phrase charges tone and theme but remains metaphorical—it does not constrain a physical action or force a trade-off with visible cost. The attribute is lyrically integrated but ornamental in function; no on-page choice hinges on this paradox.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Transform" drives the central turn: Mira transforms gems into cranes, grief into flight, herself into dispersed essence. The action is seeded early ("to transform them"), executed in the middle beats (gem-folding under the wheel), and completes at closure (cranes scatter, Mira disperses). Removing "transform" would collapse the story's logic—the entire arc is transformation of material and self. The action is irreplaceable and shapes all major beats, meeting high integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced early ("ancient wheel for gem polishing," "patient method of gem polishing") and mechanically enables the crane-folding: "Under her grinding wheel, the stones didn't diminish but revealed their secret architecture, unfolding like paper." The method matters—stones must be polished to unfold—and is present in setup, middle (the wheel work), and closure (wheel "still warm" when the apprentice finds it). Causally necessary and irreplaceable; the specific mechanics drive the transformation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The floating-island tea garden is anchored early (iris gate, cherry trees rooted in wind, stone lanterns) and hosts the final work, meeting setup and closure. However, the garden supplies atmosphere rather than constraint: Mira could complete her work in the workshop with identical result. The upward-drifting petals and translucent floor charge tone but do not alter tactics or force a choice. Present in three beats but functionally replaceable as setting; no micro-setting pressure on outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the shadow detaches" is anchored in the opening line ("the hour after the shadow detaches, when the soul untethers") and reprised at closure ("her shadow—which had waited patiently by the gate—stood and opened its arms"). The timeframe is metaphysical rather than durational—no ticking clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. The shadow's patience and final embrace frame the arc but do not constrain Mira's process. Present in setup and closure but lacks middle pressure; the time element is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to fold grief into origami cranes—is stated early ("she needed to fold grief into origami cranes") and pursued through gem-folding and crane-release. The grief sources (daughter, husband, own life) are told in retrospect, and the "need" clarifies "like steam from a kettle" without prior dramatized friction. The cranes accumulate as physical embodiments, meeting setup, middle, and closure. However, the desire is asserted rather than tested by competing wants or costs; Mira's process flows without visible trade-off. Present across beats but lacks on-page friction between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" is introduced early ("the glass basilica chimed," "dream recording… swirling in captive luminescence") and sustained through "luminous torment made manifest" at the crane-folding and "luminous torment that illuminates rather than burns" at closure. The tone is coherent and charges the final image (cranes as fractured rainbows, Mira dispersing into light). However, the phrase risks stock oxymoron and is asserted rather than earned through embodied emotional contradiction. Tone modulates purposefully with escalation but leans heavily on poetic declaration; present in setup, middle, and closure with thematic weight.</comment>
