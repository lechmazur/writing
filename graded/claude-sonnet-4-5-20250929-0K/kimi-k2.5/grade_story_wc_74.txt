<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is stated but not tested through contradictory impulses or on-page friction. The insomnia serves as premise rather than dramatized struggle; she moves methodically through her task without wavering or cost that complicates her resolve. The grandmother's warning is delivered as backstory exposition rather than a present complication. Her final survey of glyphs feels like completion of a ritual rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path with visible emotional consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates visions and painted glyphs across three hours, but no reversal or deepening tightens options—Maya paints steadily until dawn arrives and she stops. The closure is a survey and a set-down; the cost is asserted ("thirty-seven words for kindness that no mouth could speak") rather than dramatized through a forfeited choice or a reweighted stake. The waxing moon frames the ritual but does not impose escalating pressure or a trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, smog, fogged glass, lemon trees, orchids, and condensation are vivid and sensory. The environment shapes Maya's seclusion and the visual logic of glowing glyphs suspended in humid air. Spatial choreography remains clear; the waxing moon's climb and the shift from dark to dawn anchor time and light. Micro-setting (the brush, the canvas, the glass walls) charges the final image of luminescent words. One small slip: "MethodicALLY hopeful" recurs as an adjectival phrase without physical grounding in gesture or posture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving that strangers remember kindness through painting extinct words—is signaled early but never contested. Maya paints vision after vision without obstacle, error, or choice that narrows options. The waxing moon provides atmosphere but no ticking constraint; dawn's arrival is noted but does not force a trade-off or alter her plan. The piece delivers density and accumulation but lacks a moment where Maya's agency forecloses an alternate path with felt cost, per the Accumulative lens's requirement for a cadence shift that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—lost kindness persisting across extinct languages—emerges through concrete visions (the bus driver's umbrella, the nurse's lullaby, bread shared during siege). The glyphs function as proof rather than assertion, and the ending image of "thirty-seven words for kindness that no mouth could speak but every hand remembered" offers a resonant conceptual answer. However, "methodically hopeful" and "saffron quiet" edge toward label-speak, and the final paragraph's "humanity's best moments left permanent scars on the atmosphere" flirts with thematic summary. The piece avoids overt moralizing but leans on lyric assertion where dramatized pressure would sharpen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is poetic and moon-focused; diction remains elevated throughout ("desperate breath of orchids," "slow silver constellations," "turmeric in warm milk"). Free indirect access to Maya's interiority is clean. One friction: the register is uniformly lyric even during the accumulation of visions, reducing contrast between calm ritual and peak transmission. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") appear but are voice-consistent. No head-hopping; tense and stance remain stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("sodium streetlamps drowning in industrial haze," "turmeric in warm milk," "pollen in the greenhouse air"), but the concentration borders on overwriting in a ritualized scene that spans three hours with little variance in cadence. Minor template stems: "She was methodically hopeful," "She closed her eyes," "She painted the word," "She set down." Paraphrase loop: "lost languages were not truly lost; they had transformed" closely echoes the premise stated earlier. Information density is strong; no major loops or muddle, but the lyric texture flattens momentum across the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—painting extinct words of kindness via moon-tipped brush and borrowed memories—is imaginative and specific. The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and waxing moon cohere into a singular vision. Transformation test: the emotional arc (nocturnal vigil → completion at dawn) would function similarly with different names and setting, suggesting the freshness lies more in ornament than in irreplaceable synthesis. The insomnia frame and the "daydreams sparked by moonlight" method feel under-exploited; the visions arrive without friction or cost, reducing ingenuity in execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her role as painter frames every beat. However, her choices do not create key turns—she decides to paint and then paints steadily without wavering, error, or pivot. The insomnia is stated as necessary vessel but not dramatized as constraint or complication. She is observer and recorder more than decider; the visions arrive unbidden and she translates them without friction. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but agency remains illustrative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush appears in setup (grandmother's gift, bristles that glow), is dipped and used repeatedly in the middle (painting the glyphs), and is set down at closure ("its work complete for this lunar phase"). It enables the action but its unique properties—writing only extinct words—are told rather than tested; Maya does not attempt to write a living word and fail, so the constraint is asserted without on-page demonstration. Functional across beats and closure-present, but the mechanics are ornamental rather than pressurized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lost languages shape the stakes (proving kindness persists) and provide the content of each painted glyph. The concept is signaled early and recurs in every vision beat. It constrains what Maya can write (only extinct words) and the ending declares "thirty-seven words for kindness that no mouth could speak but every hand remembered." However, the constraint is told rather than tested—Maya never attempts to write a word that fails the rule, so the concept remains thematic rather than tactical. Present in setup, middle, and ending; shapes content but not choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is introduced early ("She was methodically hopeful, the way one might arrange watercolors by temperature") and recurs once ("Maya worked methodically hopeful"). The phrase colors her stance but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. It reads as tonal label rather than trait that forces a trade-off—she never abandons hope or pays a price for maintaining it under pressure. Present in setup and middle; ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rouse" is the premise action: Maya rouses memories via moonlight and paints them as glyphs. The visions of the bus driver, nurse, bread, and stranger are all roused daydreams that spark the painting. The action is present in setup (moon presses warm, rousing memories), drives the middle (each vision), and the ending notes the glyphs "roused itself from the brush's tip." The action is indispensable to the story's mechanics, but because it proceeds without friction or choice, its integration is essential but not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Via daydreams sparked by moonlight" is the method by which Maya receives the visions. Signaled early ("This was her particular gift: daydreams sparked by moonlight"), it recurs across the middle beats (bus driver, nurse, siege visions) and the ending notes the moon's climb and dawn's arrival. The method is present and consistent, but its mechanics are not tested—Maya does not lose moonlight and struggle, or receive conflicting visions. The method is functional but frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse provides shelter, humidity for the glowing glyphs, and seclusion above the smog-choked city. The glass walls hold the painted words at the end, creating the cathedral effect. The setting is introduced immediately, shapes the atmosphere throughout, and the final image depends on the condensation and glass. The smog below contrasts with the lunar clarity above, pressuring the stakes thematically. The environment does not alter Maya's tactics (she paints uninterrupted), but it charges the closure image with concrete specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The waxing moon is present in the opening line, climbs higher in the middle ("The waxing moon climbed higher, silvering the smog"), and dawn arrives at the end to mark completion. Time passes across three hours, and the moon's phase is noted as incomplete ("its work complete for this lunar phase"). However, the waxing state does not tighten tactics—Maya does not race the moon's setting or face a deadline. Time marks progression but does not pressure choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to prove that strangers remember kindness—is stated explicitly early ("She needed to prove that strangers remember kindness") and each vision dramatizes an instance of kindness. The ending declares the proof complete. However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested; Maya does not doubt, encounter evidence that disproves it, or pay a cost for pursuing it. The desire frames the action but does not generate friction or a turning choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears twice: once as "a saffron quiet settling over Maya's chest like turmeric in warm milk" and again as "The saffron quiet deepened, not empty but full of presence." The tone is lyric, hushed, and accumulative throughout, modulating slightly as the glyphs multiply and dawn approaches. It charges the atmosphere and the final image of luminescent words. The tone is coherent and consistent, but it does not shift under pressure or crystallize a stance; it sustains one register from start to finish.</comment>
