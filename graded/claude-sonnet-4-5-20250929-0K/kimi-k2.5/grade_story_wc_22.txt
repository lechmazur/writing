<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The coachman possesses attributes (speaks dead languages, understands bird calls) but makes no meaningful choices under pressure; he executes a ritual planting with the certainty of inevitability. Interiority is entirely absent—no contradictory impulses, no embodied emotion, no internal conflict. The piece reads as an external portrait of a figure performing predetermined actions rather than a character struggling with stakes. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values; the protagonist is a vessel for the concept, not a person under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening, avoiding penalty. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (reef death, monastery seeds, battlefield reclamation) toward a final image of "conquering death with the quiet persistence of grammar." However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—the garden's siege is declared inevitable in the abstract rather than dramatized with visible cost. The ending restates the premise ("root by root, word by word") without reweighting prior material or foreclosing options; it summarizes rather than crystallizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and purposeful: calcified reef, jetty as "narrow vastness," rusting ordnance leaking iron. The blooming jetty and twilight light charge the final image, and the physical environment (gaps between boards, charred landscape) guides the planting ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects the coachman's priestly focus on soil chemistry rather than emotional state. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—letting a garden reclaim a battlefield—is signaled early but never pressured. No reversal, tightening, or complication occurs; the coachman faces no opposition, resource limit, or internal friction. The piece describes a ritual execution without dramatizing any cost, choice, or obstacle. Agency is absent: the protagonist enacts inevitability rather than forging a path under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (reclamation, language as restorative force, patience vs. violence) emerges through concrete images: seed pods as "dormant explosions," ash married to salt, grammar conquering death. The submerged concord and dead languages add thematic texture. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the theme ("conquering death with the quiet persistence of grammar") rather than trusting the image, and no non-literal answer to the central question lands—the ending asserts inevitability instead of reweighting prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("declensions of calcium," "avian liturgy," "subjunctive mood of Coastal Aramaic") suits a scholar-priest figure, and the purposeful compression of technical terminology creates a consistent texture. Psychic distance is stable throughout. However, register occasionally tips into ornamental excess ("a perfect expression of narrow vastness," "blue hour like a bridge") that prioritizes lyric decoration over character perception. POV modesty holds; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Figurative language pervades nearly every sentence in the opening and closing thirds without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density that obscures rather than propels: "twilight like a hypothesis testing the water," "dormant explosion waiting for permission to detonate into green," "slow, inevitable siege of the battlefield, root by root, word by word." Paraphrase loops appear: the submerged concord is described twice (graf 7 and graf 13) in near-synonym terms. Template cadence: "He [verb]... The [noun] [verb]... Their voices formed... Speaking back..." runs across multiple paragraphs. Clarity suffers under metaphor stacking; information density is high but momentum drags. Apply −1.2 for pervasive figurative density, paraphrase loop, and template cadence in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of dead languages, bird-call translation, and battlefield reclamation is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template plots. The coachman's skill set (linguist of drowned kingdoms, translator of avian chemistry) is fresh. However, the execution leans heavily on ornamental detail rather than earned transformation; the premise is intriguing but the story does not take risk with structure or pressure. Emotional specificity is absent; the piece prioritizes world-building over human complexity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The gloom-hill coachman is present throughout and performs all actions, but makes no choices that create turns. He executes a predetermined ritual without friction, opposition, or micro-decision. The character is a vessel for the concept rather than an agent under pressure. Present in setup, development, and closure, but swappable with any patient ritualist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seed pods are introduced early (graf 1), handled in the planting sequence (graf 8–9), and invoked at closure ("the garden began its slow, inevitable siege"). They appear in three beats and carry thematic weight (genetic memory, dormant explosions). However, their use is static—no evolving meaning or reweighted reprise, just consistent symbolic labor. Causal pressure is modest; they enable the ritual but do not constrain choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The submerged concord is named twice (graf 7, graf 13) as an ancient agreement between earth and sea, shaping the thematic frame. It does not constrain an on-page action or alter tactics; it functions as backstory and thematic echo rather than a live stake. Present in development and closure but ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Speaking dead languages is introduced early (graf 4) and enables the coachman to understand bird calls and mix fertilizer according to "avian liturgy" (graf 10–11). The trait appears in setup and development, but its mechanics are told rather than dramatized with cost or tradeoff. The skill is convenient rather than pressured; no visible price or friction accompanies its use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fertilizing the battlefield is the dominant action, introduced in graf 1 ("to fertilize the stretch of blackened earth") and executed in grafs 10–12. It drives the middle sequence and is invoked at closure ("the garden began its slow, inevitable siege"). Present in setup, development, and payoff, and central to the narrative. However, the action is ritual repetition without reversal or complication; removing it would collapse the story, but it does not redefine options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Understanding bird calls is introduced in graf 4 ("this skill allowed him to understand bird calls") and applied in grafs 9–11 ("The birds called down... describing the precise molecular hunger," "Speaking back to them... the coachman mixed crushed shell and charcoal"). The method appears in setup, development, and closure ("listened to the birds teach him the next verses"). It enables the fertilization but is not tested or constrained; the mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized with friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is anchored in the opening ("descended... toward the blooming jetty at twilight") and charges the final image ("the blooming jetty seemed to float free of the shore... suspended in the blue hour"). The setting provides physical resources (gaps between boards for planting) and atmospheric resonance (twilight as threshold). Present in setup, development, and closure; it constrains the planting location and elevates the ending with symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe—after the reef dies—is established in graf 1 ("twenty years prior, when the ocean turned to acid and the coral had surrendered") and invoked at closure ("beneath the water the dead reef dreamed of calcium"). It provides context and thematic backdrop but does not tighten decisions or tactics. The coachman's actions are not shaped by urgency or temporal constraint; the timeframe is historical setting, not live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation to let a garden reclaim a battlefield is stated in graf 1 and drives the planting sequence. It appears in setup, development, and closure ("the garden began its slow, inevitable siege of the battlefield"). However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; no friction between want and cost, no obstacle to dramatize commitment. The motivation is asserted and enacted without internal or external pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone—narrow vastness—is sustained through imagery: "a thin line of wood suspended between the infinite gray death below and the infinite darkening air above," "the blooming jetty seemed to float free of the shore, a narrow vastness of plank and petal drifting between worlds." The phrase is explicitly invoked once (graf 6) and recurs implicitly in the final image. The tone is coherent and modulates from twilight observation to ritualized closure, charging the ending with spatial and temporal suspension.</comment>
