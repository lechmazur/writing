<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is stated but not dramatized through conflicting impulses or genuine struggle. The architect is present but remains a prop receiving the cure rather than a force applying counter-pressure. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("fluidly logical mind," "catalyze a transformation") that distances us from concrete thought and embodied emotion. The ending offers a change in the architect's state, but we never see Mara face a meaningful trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; no penalty. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the architect's release from grief) but the cost is asserted rather than shown—Mara "had succeeded" without visible forfeiture or altered stance. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of sensory detail and recurring motifs), and the final image attempts to reweight silence as comfort, but the effect reads declarative rather than earned through on-page pressure. One cost-proof deduction applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace, storm glass vial, and brass resonators are vividly described and filter perception through Mara's professional focus. The setting constrains movement (perpetual drift, thermal currents) and the storm glass signals the twelve-minute window, shaping the scene's rhythm. However, the architect's blueprints and the refracted sunlight feel ornamental rather than tactically decisive—Mara would perform the same acts without them. Sensory detail is textured but leans decorative in peak beats rather than constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort the grieving architect—is signaled early but never tested by counter-pressure or complication. The twelve-minute pressure drop offers a ticking clock, yet no reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara simply waits for the atmospheric stillness to do its work. The architect's shift from resistance to acceptance is told ("her shoulders dropping") rather than dramatized through a visible choice or renunciation. Agency is passive observation, and the escalation curve is flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of silence as presence emerges through recurring images (storm glass, resonators, the train whistle's echo) and the final image attempts to answer the question non-literally. However, "silence had learned its lesson" is an overt thematic statement that replaces earned resonance, and the architect's epiphany arrives without friction or ambiguity. The piece gestures toward transformation but delivers it as a thesis rather than a felt complication. The final paragraph moralizes rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable in Mara's close third; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct textural signature (crystalline dendrites, vaulting hush, spectral ribbons) that reflects Mara's professional lens. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("catalyze," "fluidly logical cadence," "calcified architecture of regret") that reads more like authorial commentary than character-specific thought under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("Listen...") is serviceable but carries minimal subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent but ornamental rather than tactically biased.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades the piece: nearly every sentence in the opening and middle beats stacks figurative language ("spectral ribbons," "barometric whispers," "drowning in velvet," "snowfall") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and register penalties. Paraphrase loops appear ("the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" recurs three times; "drifting prism terrace" appears six times with minimal variation). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "Mara [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" across consecutive lines. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("silence had learned its lesson"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Clarity remains intact, preventing further deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The gondola-as-therapy premise and the mystical-tech storm glass vial echo familiar writing-prompt templates (healing journey, magical object, atmospheric epiphany). The specific combination (sound-monitoring, floating terrace, architect passenger) offers surface novelty, but the emotional arc—grief to acceptance via curative silence—follows a predictable path without complication or a non-obvious moral calculus. The transformation test fails: swap the terrace for a meditation chamber or the architect for any grieving professional, and the arc persists unchanged. No bold risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara (gondola operator) is present throughout and performs actions (adjusting trim, rotating the storm glass, steering), but her choices are observational rather than decisive. She waits for atmospheric conditions to do the work and recognizes success after it occurs. No on-page choice narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost. Functional but swappable; any gondola operator could perform the same beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The storm glass vial appears in four distinct beats: opening (reading dendrites), middle (clouding to signal pressure drop), late middle (rotating to refract sunlight), and closure (clear and still). It shapes Mara's timing and provides a visual cue for the architect, but the architect's shift does not hinge on the vial's mechanics—Mara could recognize stillness by other means. Early signal and closure participation earn mid-band; causal pressure is modest. Irreplaceability is limited.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"In transit" frames the entire premise (between mountain station and cloud-city terminus, perpetual drift, neither departed nor arrived) and shapes Mara's identity and the architect's suspended state. The concept constrains setting and tone and is present in the closure image ("drifting onward"). However, it does not force a tactical choice or trade-off on the page—the transit state is atmospheric rather than a source of friction. Setup, development (as constant context), and payoff all present; causal pressure is thematic rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Fluidly logical" is mentioned twice as a label ("fluidly logical mind," "fluidly logical cadence") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. We do not see Mara choose logic over intuition or pay a price for her hybrid thinking. The trait reads ornamental, a descriptor without tactical consequence. Late first appearance (second mention in paragraph four) and label-only use trigger caps and text-pattern deductions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears three times as Mara's stated goal but is never dramatized as an on-page action with cost. The transformation occurs passively (atmospheric stillness does the work) rather than through a decisive act Mara performs. Easily swappable with "facilitate" or "enable" without structural loss. Present in setup and thematically in closure, but missing middle development as an enacted choice. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Monitoring noise levels" is signaled early (brass resonators, negative three decibels, "cataloguing the exact acoustic signature of healing") and recurs in the middle beat when Mara adjusts resonators and recognizes the frequency of stillness. The method shapes her professional identity and timing, but the architect's shift does not hinge on Mara's noise measurement—the atmospheric drop does the causal work. Mechanics matter for texture but not for tactical pressure. Setup and middle development present; closure participation is thematic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is established in the opening sentence and recurs throughout (thermal currents, rising through mist, floating through clouds, carrying passengers onward). It supplies the suspended, isolated micro-environment essential to the scene and is present in the closure image. However, the terrace does not supply a resource or constraint that alters Mara's tactics—she would perform the same actions on any floating platform. Setup, development (as constant context), and payoff all present; causal pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"The quiet that follows a train whistle's echo" is introduced in the opening paragraph, recurs in the architect's embrace near the end, and names a specific acoustic signature. However, it functions as metaphor and tone rather than a ticking clock that tightens decisions. The twelve-minute pressure drop (tied to the storm glass) is the functional timeframe, but it is not itself "the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo." The phrase is present but does not constrain tactics or create urgency. Setup and thematic payoff; missing middle development as a live temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To teach silence how to comfort" is stated in paragraph two and echoed in the closure ("silence had learned its lesson, had become comfort instead of threat"). Mara's motivation frames the scene and is present at the end, but it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. We never see Mara risk failure, adjust tactics when the architect resists, or forfeit an alternative path. Setup and thematic payoff present; missing friction and on-page trade-off. Swappable with any healing-facilitator motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" appears three times and names the story's dominant atmosphere (suspension, silence, vastness). Tone is coherent through the turns and modulates slightly when the resonators begin to stir, signaling the return of ambient sound. The final image ("vaulting hush toward whatever destination awaited") charges the ending with tonal weight. However, the tone is static rather than dynamically shifting under pressure—it maintains one register (reverent, elevated, hushed) throughout without complication. Setup, development (as constant mood), and payoff all present; modulation is minimal.</comment>
