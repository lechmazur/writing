<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's characterization is specific and grounded—her forty-year expertise with "frozen gears" and methodical patience come through in embodied action (calibrating the loupe, measuring hydrodynamic flow). The internal contradiction between wanting to "schedule spontaneity" and needing to "befriend uncertainty" drives the waterfall crossing, where she shifts from calculated risk to intuitive faith with visible cost (the tilting stone, the "impassable" leap). Minor deduction: the epiphany moment ("befriending meant release, not conquest") edges toward articulated insight rather than remaining fully dramatized, though the physical crossing immediately enacts it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drive lens is Hybrid-Causal with accumulative texture: fragments surface over months, then the greenhouse vortex reveals the staircase, forcing the improvised waterfall crossing that narrows options (her notes "lied") and delivers the compass rose with visible cost (trusting physics-defying leaps). Closure is a Decisive Change—retrieving the artifact vindicates the admiral and liberates Elara, with the chronometer "singing" after twenty years. Cost is legible: she forfeits her lifelong reliance on calculation. The "ashes" conceal-to-preserve logic is taught late but pays off cleanly at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice throughout: the greenhouse's thermal vortex guides her to the hidden stairs, the waterfall's chaotic pulse defeats her calculations and forces improvisation, and the stepping stones' irregular shifts require her to abandon measurements. The compass rose on its natural pedestal behind the veil is both obstacle and prize. The final beat—compass rose aligned with "gaps in the glass"—charges the closure image with geometry that reweights possibility. Micro-setting (stones, water pressure, mineral drip) drives tactics and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: retrieve the compass rose to vindicate her mentor and unlock truth. Escalation tightens when her hydrodynamic calculations fail, forcing her to trust rhythm over data—a meaningful deepening of the "uncertainly certain" conflict. The crossing sequence narrows options beat by beat (tilted third stone, submerged fifth stone) with visible physical and epistemic cost. Agency is genuine: she steps "not when her notes instructed" but when her breath matches the spray, a choice that forecloses the path of pure calculation. Coincidence (leaves, thermal current) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the waterfall crossing: uncertainty as "room to breathe rather than territory to conquer." The compass rose and chronometer are not merely symbolic—they constrain the plot and charge the final image when the mechanism "sang a note it had held silent for twenty years." The leaves-as-guides motif recurs with reweighted meaning (settled "into a new constellation" at the end). Minor slip: "vindicating the dead and liberating the living" in the final line edges toward thematic summary rather than trusting the image alone, though the chronometer's song earns the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled—"uncertainly certain," "swirling leaves," "darkness held substance and weight"—with a consistent baroque-lyric register that fits the tinkerer's methodical yet intuitive worldview. Psychic distance stays tight to Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: some elevated diction ("geological patience," "hothouse flower," "vegetative reluctance") pushes the register slightly beyond what a village tinkerer might plausibly internalize under stress, creating mild distance from embodied thought. The perceptual signature (gears, springs, flow mechanics) is consistent and character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong sentence variety and high information density ("glass roof shattered into teeth," "water cutting through bedrock with geological patience"). Minor loop: "uncertainly certain" appears twice within close proximity without substantial reweighting between uses. Figurative density is high but occasionally tips into ornament ("darkness held substance and weight" followed immediately by "spray" and "veil" and "torrent's irregular pulse")—three metaphoric vehicles in rapid succession without clear necessity. No major artifacts touch closure, so the ceiling remains sub-8.0 territory rather than disqualifying high bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of clock-tinkering expertise, subterranean-quest logistics, and the "befriend uncertainty" arc feels purposeful and specific. The waterfall-as-chaos-test is a fresh inflection on the mentor-vindication premise. Risk: the lyric register and patterned imagery (leaves, compass points, glass gaps) heighten stakes without obscuring the causal spine. Deduction: the greenhouse-to-cavern transition and the ashes-conceal-to-preserve twist rely on familiar adventure-quest scaffolding; transformation comes through Elara's internal arc rather than a wholly non-obvious premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in setup (calibrating loupe), middle (calculating flow, then abandoning notes), and closure (placing compass rose into chronometer). Her choices create the key turn: stepping onto stones "not when her notes instructed" but by breath-rhythm, a decision that narrows options and earns the retrieval. The tinkerer identity shapes her initial approach (measurements, timetables) and the cost of relinquishing it. Irreplaceability: only a methodical expert would attempt calculation first, making the shift to improvisation causally specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The compass rose is mentioned in setup (the absent piece she seeks), becomes the physical goal behind the waterfall (constraining the crossing), and returns in closure when placed into the chronometer to "sing a note…silent for twenty years," vindicating the admiral. Its needle "still true after two decades" reweights certainty versus chaos. Handled across three beats with escalating causal pressure and a charged final image. High irreplaceability: the story's logic and ending collapse without this exact artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" is introduced early (great library fire that "erased the admiralty's inconvenient records") and pays off at closure ("ashes had hidden the truth not to destroy it, but to preserve it"). It shapes the stakes—why the compass was concealed—and subtly constrains her search (she must look below literal and figurative surfaces). Present in setup and closure, with thematic reweighting in the final paragraph. However, the ashes do not directly alter middle tactics; the waterfall and stones drive the action more than ash-logic does.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" is introduced early ("she moved through the world uncertainly certain") and dramatized at the waterfall when her certainty (calculations) fails and she must embrace uncertainty (improvisation). The trait constrains her initial approach (over-reliance on measurement) and enables the solution (trusting rhythm). Reappears in closure ("still uncertainly certain, but now the uncertainty felt like room to breathe"). Visible cost: she forfeits the safety of schedules. Minor deduction: the phrase is used twice in near-identical form without much evolution between appearances, edging toward label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Improvise" is signaled at the peak turn ("She had to improvise") and immediately enacted across the stepping-stone sequence: moving by breath-rhythm rather than notes, swaying on the tilted stone, leaping the submerged gap. The action redefines her options—calculation has failed, improvisation is the only path—and earns the retrieval with visible cost (physical risk, epistemic surrender). Present in middle escalation and causal to closure. Removing "improvise" would collapse the waterfall crossing's logic and the thematic arc. High irreplaceability and strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse and swirling leaves appear in setup (she enters, leaves spiral upward, parting to reveal the staircase). The leaves guide her to the hidden descent, shaping early tactics. They return in closure ("leaves had settled into a new constellation"), reweighting the pattern-discovery motif. Present in two beats with thematic reprise. However, the middle waterfall sequence—the story's pressure peak—does not involve the leaves; the stones and water do the causal work there. The method enables discovery but does not constrain the climactic crossing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The subterranean waterfall is introduced at the structural midpoint and immediately pressures choice: its chaotic pulse defeats Elara's calculations, forcing improvisation. The stepping stones' shifting rhythm (third tilts, fifth submerged) narrows options beat by beat. The natural pedestal behind the veil positions the compass rose as both prize and test. The waterfall's "song changing key" on her return reflects her internal shift. Present across escalation and closure with high causal density. Removing this setting would eliminate the story's central conflict and the improvisation demand.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" is introduced early ("the critical timeframe when coincidence becomes pattern") and frames her months-long fragment-gathering. It shapes her recognition that breadcrumbs were "scattered with intention," justifying the search. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions in real time; the waterfall crossing happens in a present urgency unrelated to elapsed months. The phrase recurs thematically but does not function as a live clock that alters middle or final tactics. Present in setup and as framing concept, but not causally active in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is introduced in setup ("she had spent her life pursuing the motivation to befriend uncertainty") and is directly tested at the waterfall: her plans fail, forcing her to "let uncertainty…become her dance partner rather than her adversary." The motivation is dramatized through conflicting wants (control vs. release) with visible cost (abandoning measurements, risking falls). It returns in closure ("uncertainty felt like room to breathe rather than territory to conquer"). Present across three beats with friction and reprise. Minor deduction: the articulation of the insight ("befriending meant release, not conquest") is somewhat告知-told rather than purely enacted.</comment>
