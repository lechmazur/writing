<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's phantom state is established with vivid particulars (the pull cord handle, leaf blower conductor history), but his motivation to restore laughter operates largely through metaphorical action rather than micro-choices under pressure. The interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion—"mournfully eager," "desperate to restore"—rather than embodied contradiction acting in scene. His wife and daughter appear only as observed presences; no relationship friction or status dynamic tests his choices on the page. The backstory (leaf blower symphony) is colorful but does not tilt a present decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (post-death echo chamber, Elias as phantom). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pull cord handle dissolves into silver dust, joining the off-key wind permanently, and laughter reaches the family—a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Cost is conceptual (Elias fades into memory) but legible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs (maceration of grief into usable tenderness). However, the entire sequence unfolds without reversal or constraint; the pull cord mechanism succeeds on first attempt, and no on-page obstacle tests tactics, weakening escalation clarity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is vividly rendered—obsidian walls, condensation, stalactites of grief—and constrains Elias's choices (he must macerate silence to reach the living). The pull cord handle is handled across multiple beats and charges the final image when it crumbles. Spatial choreography (tunnel walls, floorboards, living room, daughter's bedroom) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the phantom's urgency. The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) qualifies and elevates the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: restore lost laughter to the household. The stake is signaled early and maintained. However, escalation is weak: Elias pulls the cord, it works, laughter arrives—no reversal, no live option foreclosed, no visible price paid that alters tactics. The mechanism succeeds on first attempt without obstacle or cost that narrows choices. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening (maceration) reweights the silence, but the lack of friction or trade-off prevents entry into higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—tending to the unspoken, processing grief into tenderness—emerges from particulars (maceration, half-sung lullabies, off-key wind) rather than assertion. The final image (pull cord crumbling into wind) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the gap between Elias's wordless efforts and the family's gradual response. However, the phrase "tending to the unspoken was not about speaking" edges toward explicit theme statement, and the closure feels slightly mechanical (each element predictably contributes to laughter's arrival) rather than offering surprise or friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV on Elias is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: he sees his family's grief crystallizing, hears the echo chamber doubling sound. Psychic distance is controlled. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("macerate," "stalactites," "mournfully eager") that feels authorial rather than character-particular, especially given Elias's backstory as a leaf-blower conductor. The prose lacks the rough-edged or blue-collar texture one might expect from his voice. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—obsidian walls, stalactites of grief, silence macerated into pulp—without pattern-teaching or payoff variation; the metaphor vehicle (maceration) is repeated mechanically across beats. Template cadence: "He pulled. Instead of... Each rotation... Through this liquefied..." creates drumbeat rhythm. Paraphrase loop: "macerate" and its cognates appear eight times, often restating the same concept without added pressure. Register drift into technical/poetic diction ("macerate," "liquefied atmosphere") clashes with the POV's established leaf-blower-conductor idiom. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—ghost using a pull cord to process grief through sound—is specific and memorable, transforming the haunting trope through the leaf-blower conductor detail. The maceration metaphor is fresh initially. However, the emotional arc (phantom works to restore laughter, succeeds without obstacle) follows a predictable template: bereaved ghost helps family heal. No counter-reading or friction complicates the closure. The synthesis feels purposeful but not inevitable in hindsight; swapping maceration for another sound-based mechanism would leave the arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his backstory (leaf blower symphony conductor) frames his approach. However, his choices—raising the pull cord, pulling it, releasing lullabies—do not create turns; they are sequential executions of a single plan without friction or cost. Observation and metaphorical action dominate; no on-page decision alters tactics. Functional but replaceable; another ghost archetype could execute the same plan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pull cord handle appears in setup (Elias clutches it), is used across multiple beats (pulls repeatedly to macerate silence), and returns charged at closure (crumbles into silver dust). Its specific properties (grooves worn by Sunday mornings, translucent, glowing brighter) matter and are irreplaceable. It drives two distinct beats and shapes the ending image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage earn high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tending to the unspoken is signaled early ("he understood now that tending to the unspoken was not about speaking") and shapes the dominant stake (breaking down hardened grief). It constrains tactics (he must macerate silence rather than speak). However, the concept is stated explicitly mid-text rather than emerging purely from action, and its presence in the ending is thematic echo rather than a choice-altering force. Lyric reprise with some causal work, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" appears early as a label ("mournfully eager phantom") and recurs late ("pulled the cord again, mournfully eager"). It colors his stance but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost; removing it would leave all choices intact. Functional descriptor but ornamental integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Macerate is the engine of the story: Elias uses the pull cord to macerate silence (beat one), then macerate his own regret (beat two), enabling laughter to break through (closure). The action is irreplaceable—no near-synonym would preserve the grinding, organic metaphor. It drives multiple beats and defines the ending's logic. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Half-sung lullabies on an off-key wind are signaled early (setup), used in the middle beat ("released his half-sung lullabies... carried on an off-key wind"), and present at closure (wind continues carrying lullabies). The method's mechanics matter: deliberate tunelessness slips past rational defenses. It shapes two beats and contributes to the ending. Causal role and closure participation earn solid integration, though it does not foreclose options.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Echo chamber tunnel is introduced immediately, constrains Elias's realm (he remains suspended there), provides the mechanism (walls amplify and double sound), and supplies resources (condensation, stalactites of grief). It shapes tactics (he must use the echo effect) and is present in closure (walls ring with joy). Environment pressures choices and charges the final image. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" frames the premise (post-death state) but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. No live clock limits Elias's attempts; time feels untracked and elastic. Present in setup only, with no middle or closure participation. Functional framing but replaceable and uninvolved in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To restore lost laughter is the dominant stake, signaled early and maintained. It shapes all of Elias's actions (macerating grief, releasing lullabies). Closure dramatizes partial success (wife hears melody, daughter smiles, laughter travels back). However, the motivation is more asserted than conflicted; no friction between wants and costs tests his commitment on the page. Causal across beats but lacks on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>True haunting tone is coherent throughout: obsidian walls, wordless phantom, off-key wind, grief processed into tenderness. Tone modulates with pressure (starts mournful, builds through maceration, ends with joy ringing off walls). The ending image (pull cord crumbling into permanent instrument) charges the final beat with melancholy persistence. Tone shapes the closure effect and remains stable under accumulation. Strong tonal integration.</comment>
