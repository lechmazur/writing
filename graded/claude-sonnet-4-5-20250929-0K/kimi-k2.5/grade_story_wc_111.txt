<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated clearly—proving gardens know their gardeners—but her interior life remains abstract, filled with elevated philosophical reflection rather than embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The backstory about deceiving the eastern quadrant is told in summary; we never see her struggle with a present choice where competing impulses collide. The final act of placing marbles feels ritualistic but lacks visible cost or foreclosed options that would demonstrate genuine character pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (garden maze, vine dresser, ritual with marbles) arrive early. The piece accumulates texture through repeated polishing and placement of marbles, building toward the fountain moment where the garden "exhales" in recognition—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the relationship. However, the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; the final image does not clearly foreclose a path or show what Elara sacrifices by emptying her pouch. One meaningful deepening is present, but the felt price is oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The garden maze is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: dual-state ivy (green and ash), hedges as remembered entities, the fountain of calcified promises. These elements reflect Elara's interiority and philosophy. The marbles constrain her ritual choices and charge the final image. However, spatial choreography within the maze remains vague—we do not track her movement through corridors in a way that alters tactics or creates friction. The body and tools (velvet pouch, nightshade oil) are present but do not visibly limit options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving the garden's consciousness through ritual maintenance. The piece signals this early and sustains thematic coherence, but pressure does not escalate through a meaningful tightening or choice that narrows options. Elara's actions (polishing, placing marbles) proceed without resistance or reversal; the ivy "shivering" and the garden "exhaling" feel like cooperative responses rather than friction. No on-page cost or trade-off is legible—ritual success arrives without sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—survival through strategic dishonesty and elaborate reconciliation—emerges from concrete ritual (polishing cracked marbles, speaking corrective words to ivy). The blooming-withering motif recurs and gains weight at closure when "every plant displayed both ages at once." However, the final paragraph over-articulates theme: "survival requires both the lie and its repair" and "the honest acknowledgment of necessary lies" border on moralizing summary. The fountain image is resonant but does not fully replace the explanatory frame.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, stable throughout. The prose carries a distinct, elevated register—"calculators of fortune," "scaffolding for truths not yet strong enough to stand alone"—that feels consistent but tonally uniform across calm ritual and would-be peaks. Filter verbs ("understanding that," "watching as") dull immediacy in several lines. Perceptual signature is present (vine dresser noticing plant states, chlorophyll, thorn angles) but does not modulate under pressure; diction remains constant rather than compressing or sharpening at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated abstraction ("statistical curves hung like visible mist," "papery ash," "river deltas or the veins of an ancient hand"). Paraphrase loops appear—paragraphs 4 and 5 both explain the deception-and-repair philosophy in adjacent summary blocks. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "She + past-tense verb" or "The + noun." Synonym churn: "mended deception," "strategic dishonesty," "necessary lies" cycle without added pressure. These artifacts dull momentum and trigger cumulative deductions in Q7 (−0.6 baseline for density + loops, −0.3 for template stems, total ~−0.9, plus minor register drift). Applying the non-closure accumulation cap and routing to Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise—a world where luck is measurable, and a gardener uses ritual lies to sustain a sentient garden—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative and pastoral modes. The marbles-as-apology conceit and the blooming-withering duality feel specific. However, the story does not take bold risks with structure or perspective; the philosophical voice and ritual pacing remain safe and consistent. The emotional truth of reconciliation through repeated care is genuine, but the frame (post-luck-measurement society) remains under-explored ornament rather than a constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, and her actions (polishing, placing marbles, speaking corrective words) drive the sequence. However, these are ritual repetitions rather than decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. Setup is early, middle beats involve her moving through the maze, and she appears at closure. She does not make a choice with visible cost or face a reversal; she enacts a ceremony that succeeds. Functional but replaceable—another ritualist or gardener could perform the same arc. Cap at 4.6 for missing a cost-bearing decision; modest lift for beat involvement and closure presence lands at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marbles appear in paragraph 3 (early setup), are polished and placed in paragraphs 9–10 (middle beats), and the "final marble" is set in the fountain at closure (paragraph 15). Three distinct beats with evolving use: trophy-and-apology, ritual offering, culminating act. Each placement reweights meaning (correcting lies, integrating damage). The marbles' cracked state is specific and irreplaceable—smooth marbles would not carry the same thematic charge. Closure linkage is strong. Eligible for ≥7.0; visible cost tied to emptying the pouch is conceptual rather than material, limiting upper reach.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Mended deception" is named in paragraph 6 and threaded through the backstory (deceiving the eastern quadrant, forcing resilience). It shapes the philosophy—lies as scaffolding—and the ritual (polishing marbles, correcting ivy's false drought). Middle beats show Elara enacting correction, and the final image ("survival requires both the lie and its repair") explicitly reprises the concept. However, the concept does not create a present choice or narrow options; it functions as theme and backstory rather than a live dilemma Elara must navigate with cost. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is summary rather than pressure. Two gates plus lyric reprise allow ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic about falsehoods" is labeled in paragraph 4 and governs her approach to deception-and-repair. However, the trait is asserted rather than tested. We do not see Elara weigh competing options or pay a cost for pragmatism versus honesty; the ritual proceeds without friction. Swappable—"strategic," "careful," or "deliberate" could replace it with minor edits. Present but ornamental; no on-page action where this trait constrains or enables with visible price. Cap at 3.8 for swappability, small lift for thematic coherence lands at 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Polish" appears in paragraph 7 (polishing marbles with nightshade oil), paragraph 9 (polishing the third marble), and paragraph 15 (polishing the final marble). Three beats. The action is ritually essential—each polishing commemorates and corrects. However, no major turn or reversal traces to polishing itself; the ivy responds to placement and speech, not the act of polishing. The action shapes method and closure presence but does not redefine options or create a decision point. Eligible for mid-6s; strong beat involvement and closure linkage lift it to 6.9, but swappability (buffing, anointing) and lack of causal pressure cap higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Commemorating small victories elaborately" is named in paragraph 7 and enacted through the polishing-and-placement ritual. The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter: polishing with nightshade oil, speaking corrective words, placing marbles at specific sections. Middle beats show the method in action (ivy, fountain). Closure reprises the method as Elara empties her pouch and the garden "exhales." However, the method does not shape a choice or face resistance; it is a procedure that succeeds without friction. Setup, development, and payoff are present; causal pressure is low. Eligible for ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The garden maze is present from the opening line and supplies the ritual space. Specific sections (eastern quadrant, western ivy wall, center fountain) receive attention. The maze's "shifting geometry" and the plants' dual states (blooming-withering) reflect Elara's philosophy. The fountain at the center charges the final image. However, the maze does not pressure choices—Elara navigates it without obstacle or resource constraint. Spatial choreography is vague; we do not track turns or distances that alter tactics. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle development as constraint is weak. Eligible for ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After luck becomes measurable" is named in paragraph 4 and establishes the story's speculative frame (probability meters, statistical confidence). However, this timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. Elara's ritual proceeds without reference to measurable luck; the maze's persistence "after three dynasties" anchors deep past, not urgency. The timeframe functions as world-building flavor rather than a live clock or constraint. Present but ornamental; swappable with another post-X era. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development and cost; small thematic coherence lift lands at 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To prove that gardens know their gardeners" is stated in paragraph 11 and repeated in paragraph 12 as Elara's explicit motivation. This desire frames the ritual and culminates in the garden's recognition (paragraph 17: "the garden had been paying attention all along"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or a choice with visible cost. No friction between this goal and another need appears; Elara enacts her proof without resistance or sacrifice. Setup and payoff are clear; middle friction is absent. Told-only motivation trends low; thematic coherence and closure linkage lift to 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" is named in paragraph 8, recurs in paragraph 17 ("blooming withering accelerating"), and structures the story's dual-state imagery (roses with impossible resilience, ivy bursting and turning to ash, the fountain flower in perpetual stasis). The tone is coherent through all turns and modulates at closure when "every plant displayed both ages at once," charging the final image with the paradox's full weight. The oxymoron is specific, recurrent, and essential to the conceptual frame. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; undeniable closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>
