<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority shows contradiction—guilt over three dead agents versus desire for repair—and the pillbox anchors her emotion concretely. However, "prudently daring" is told via label rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure, and the final surrender feels more stated ("mended soul") than earned through visible internal cost. Marcus appears as functional opposition but lacks distinct voice or stance that evolves on the page. The motivational arc is present but remains at tell-level in key moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena surrenders the microchip and leaves "with empty hands and a mended soul," crystallizing her shift from running to repair. Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes her last secret—but the final image ("descended...with empty hands") reads as symbolic declaration rather than a choice that forecloses a live tactical option on the page. The Drive Lens is Hybrid (causal setup, accumulative final reprise of "silver hush" and codes), coherent at closure. Orientation is clean by paragraph one. The tightening occurs when Marcus accepts the chip and they write new codes together, but the turn hinges on thematic agreement rather than a because/therefore that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff is established early with mist, wind, skeletal pines, and snow; the codes in snow are handled on the page and guide Elena's movement. The pillbox is tactile ("silver and nicked," "engraved") and its weight is felt. However, the environment does not materially constrain a choice—Elena and Marcus meet without obstacle, and the final descent is unopposed. The micro-setting (snow as message surface) shapes one beat but does not charge the closure image beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elena's repair of the network and self, signaled early. The one meaningful tightening occurs when she offers the pillbox to Marcus and they write new codes, foreclosing her fugitive status. However, the escalation is driven by thematic agreement rather than protagonist agency under duress; no live tactical opposition forces the trade-off. Cost is conceptual (surrendering the last secret) but the final image presents resolution as peaceful rather than a visible price paid. One micro turn is present; no coincidental rescue.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of repair emerges from the pillbox, codes, and winter-to-spring imagery; "fixing what's broken" is explored through Elena's surrender and the network rebuild. The final line "descended...with empty hands and a mended soul" edges toward stated moral rather than earned resonance. "Courage was not a reservoir to be found, but a current to be entered" is explicit philosophizing that replaces scene pressure. The ending offers a symbolic answer but leans on archaic diction ("vouchsafe," "tilt") and prompt labels ("prudently daring," "unused courage") rather than particular images that reweight prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited on Elena; no head-hopping. Voice has textural ambition—"silver hush," "gauze," "skeletal pines"—but diction drifts into elevated register ("vouchsafe," "prudently daring," "burned spy," "disavowal") that reads more literary than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Marcus's single exchange lacks subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance is controlled. The prose modulates with scene stakes but the perceptual signature is not selective or biased in Elena-specific ways; it reads as omniscient-lite rather than filtered through her operational mindset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is adequate; no grammar errors. However, figurative language saturates without clear pattern payoff: "gauze," "silver hush," "skeletal pines," "the earth tilt toward spring," "the water was cold, but it was moving." Register drifts—"vouchsafe," "disavowal," "prudently daring"—clash with the present-tense urgency of a burned spy. Minor paraphrase loop: "codes...codes spoke of...codes she had left" across three beats. Filter verbs ("seemed to absorb," "felt") appear but are voice-tolerable. Overwriting in the final third ("mended soul," "current to be entered") dulls the closure image with abstraction. Apply −0.6 for density + register drift in peak beats; −0.2 for paraphrase; total −0.8 non-closure, baseline ~6.9 → 6.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The burned-spy-meets-handler setup is template familiar; the pillbox-as-macguffin and codes-in-snow are functional but not fresh. The winter-to-spring metaphor and "silver hush" recur but do not transform expectation. The emotional arc—guilt to repair—follows a predictable path without a non-obvious synthesis or risky structural choice. Archaic diction ("vouchsafe," "prudently daring") reads as ornament rather than necessity. The ending's symbolic closure (empty hands, mended soul) is earnest but does not offer hindsight inevitability or a turn that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena (burned spy) is present throughout, and her decision to surrender the microchip and write new codes drives the closure. Setup early, middle choice to meet Marcus, payoff in the vouchsafe moment. Her status as "burned" informs guilt and tactics. Causal pressure: her choice forecloses fugitive status. Closure linkage strong. Irreplaceability moderate—any disgraced operative could serve. Cost visible (surrender). Two gates + closure → 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Engraved pillbox appears in beat one (clutched, traced), beat two (held out, opened), and is causally active in the vouchsafe moment. Setup early, middle handling, payoff when Marcus extracts the chip. Specificity: mother's initials, silver/nicked. Closure linkage: the act of giving it enables the network rebuild. Cost: Elena surrenders her last leverage. Three gates, causal pressure, closure active → 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fixing what's broken" is stated early ("I am tired of being broken") and shapes the dominant stake. It constrains Elena's choice to vouchsafe the chip and guides the network-rebuild tactic. Payoff in "Welcome to the repair." Setup, middle choice, closure participation. However, it reads more as theme than a tactical constraint that narrows options on the page. Cost is conceptual. Three gates, moderate causal pressure → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Prudently daring" is labeled twice ("prudently daring gait," "prudently daring choice") but not dramatized as a trade-off with visible cost. No on-page moment where caution enables Elena or recklessness is rejected under pressure. Present in setup and closure reflection but ornamental. Two gates (setup, closure mention), no middle constraint, swappable → cap 4.6; label-only −0.3, summary-only −0.3 → 3.8 + lyric reprise +0.4 → 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears once in dialogue at the pivot: Elena hands the pillbox to Marcus, enabling the rebuild. The archaic word is purposeful (old promises) and the act drives the closure. Setup (codes as promise), middle beat (the offer), payoff (Marcus accepts). Causal pressure: without the act, no network repair. Specificity high (word choice signals tone). Cost tied to surrender. Three gates, causal active, closure essential → 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Codes in snow are traced early (Orion's belt, staggered line), guide Elena's path to Marcus, and are written together at closure. Setup early, middle navigation, payoff in new codes. The method matters: it summons Marcus and becomes the repair mechanism. Causal pressure moderate; specificity (patterns they invented) is present. Cost: exposure. Three gates, two beats, closure participation → 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Zephyr Bluff is named and described early; mist, wind, cliff's edge, and snow provide the canvas for codes and the meeting. Setup immediate, middle navigation, closure (descent). The setting enables the code method and charges atmosphere but does not constrain a choice—no obstacle or resource scarcity alters tactics. Spatial choreography clear. Three gates, moderate enabling, closure presence → 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tilt of the earth toward spring" appears in the opening and closing images ("the tilt is complete," green on valley floor). It shapes tone and metaphor but does not tighten a decision—no live clock or seasonal pressure alters Elena's timing. Setup early, payoff in final line. Two gates (setup, closure lyric reprise), no middle constraint. Lyric resonance reweights the repair theme. Cap 4.6 for missing middle, +0.9 for closure linkage and thematic charge → 5.5 + specificity +0.3 → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Unused courage" is stated in reflection ("seeking unused courage...only to find it here") and frames Elena's arc. It appears late (final third) and is told rather than dramatized through a conflicted micro-choice. Setup absent, middle implicit (Elena's approach to Marcus), payoff in summary. The desire to find courage drives the meeting but reads as theme rather than a want-versus-fear friction on the page. Late −0.6, summary-only −0.4 → cap 3.0; but lyric charge in ending +1.8, causal implicit +0.8 → 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Silver hush" recurs in beats one, three, and the final reprise ("burned through the hush"). Tone is consistent (quiet, contemplative) and modulates with the stakes: tension in approach, resolution in "Welcome to the repair." Setup immediate, middle atmosphere, payoff reweighted. The tone charges the final image and supports the repair theme. Three gates, coherent pressure, closure active → 7.3.</comment>
