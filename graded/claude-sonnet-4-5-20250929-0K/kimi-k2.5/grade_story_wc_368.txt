<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dye master's interiority is concrete and specific ("heart beating with borrowed rhythm," "ribs that still felt like foreign architecture"), and her watchfulness creates a consistent perceptual filter. The pivotal realization—that the donor remained "porous, allowing the world to pass through her without resistance"—arrives through sustained observation rather than unmotivated epiphany. However, the transformation reads more as conceptual understanding than embodied choice that forecloses options with visible cost; the final release of the wing is symbolic rather than a decision that alters tactics or relationships. The metaphoric density occasionally edges toward label-speak ("valley-mist wonder," "explosive quiet") without sufficient embodied grounding in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within the opening lines (dye master, obsidian bench, three weeks post-surgery, floating tea house). The accumulative/textural lens holds: sun-trail tracking builds density toward the epiphany that porosity magnetizes stories, and the final wing-release reweights the opening question with a shift from seeking control to embracing receptivity. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (the dye master's stance crystallizes) with conceptual cost legible in her acceptance of fragility. The causal chain from observation → insight → release is clean, though the middle section's reflective loops slightly dilute forward pressure before the ending sharpens focus.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house constrains the protagonist's perspective (height, rotation, mist-veiled isolation) and the wing's iridescence becomes a working tool that tracks light and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the dye master's craft (indigo, cochineal, fixing bath analogies) and her watchful priorities. Spatial choreography is coherent (eastern window, cedar floors, paper lanterns, valley below), and the environment's drift on magnetic ore subtly mirrors the protagonist's suspended state. The micro-setting (wing, sun trails, pavilion rotation) functionally charges the closure image when the wing is released and "became a star," satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the donor's narrative gravity before the new heart fully claims her identity—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through repetitive tracking rituals that deepen rather than escalate causally; the "quietly explosive truth" detonates as insight, not conflict reversal. The final act (releasing the wing) demonstrates agency as renunciation with visible cost (letting go of the compass), but the escalation reads more as thematic intensification than a tightening that narrows live options. No antagonist or external friction tests the protagonist's commitment; the piece relies entirely on internal pressure and observation, which fits the accumulative lens but limits dramatic urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sun-trail tracking, wing iridescence, and dye-fixing metaphors: stories adhere to surfaces that admit fragility. The final image—wing spun into starlight—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the opening question of attraction through the concept of porosity. Subtext operates in the gap between the dye master's need for control (tracking, mapping, positioning) and the donor's lesson of receptivity. The "valley-mist wonder" recurs as a stance rather than a cliché, and the tea house's elevation reframes perspective without overt symbolism. Minor slip: "explosive quiet" and "radiant, accumulating tales" edge toward abstraction in the final third, though the wing's transformation anchors the thematic close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable (tight third, dye master's perceptual signature throughout: indigo/cochineal analogies, sediment/fixing-bath metaphors). Diction remains within the character's lexicon (craft-specific, contemplative), and psychic distance modulates purposefully when external observation (sun trails, wing position) alternates with interior reflection. The prose rhythm slows appropriately during watchful beats and accelerates slightly at the climactic insight. Minor deduction: the density of figurative language in reflective passages ("sediment," "mineral stain," "spores on morning air," "radiant, accumulating tales") occasionally tips toward overwriting, especially in the final third where elevated register ("valley-mist wonder," "explosive quiet") recurs without sufficient grounding in immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and information density is high; most lines serve dual purpose (advancing insight and charging imagery). The sun-trail tracking provides concrete propulsion through repeated observation → adjustment → realization cycles. However, figurative density in the second half accumulates without relief: "legends accumulated like sediment," "mineral stain like dye," "valley-mist wonder," "spores on morning air," "radiant, accumulating tales" cluster in adjacent beats, creating a metaphoric pile-up that slows momentum. Template cadence appears in reflective turns: "She understood that…," "She saw now that…," "She smiled, feeling…" The final paragraph stacks abstractions ("radiant, accumulating tales," "threads of their morning stories") where a single concrete image would sharpen closure. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks, but the metaphoric saturation in peak beats triggers overwriting penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of heart transplant, craft knowledge (dye mastery), and narrative magnetism through the metaphor of porosity is specific and non-obvious. The floating tea house and sun-trail tracking method provide fresh particulars, and the blue morpho wing serves as both tool and thematic anchor rather than decorative symbol. The transformation test holds: swapping the dye master's craft or the wing's properties would collapse the metaphoric structure. Risk distinction: the quiet, observation-driven arc without external antagonist commits fully to accumulative design. Minor limitation: the premise of receiving a donor's intangible qualities (narrative magnetism) alongside the physical heart leans toward magical thinking without world-rule grounding, and the "stories cling to souls" framing echoes familiar metaphysical tropes about inherited memory or essence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The watchful dye master is present throughout and her observation drives the arc. She positions the wing (setup), tracks sun trails across multiple beats (development), and releases the wing at closure (payoff). However, her watchfulness generates insight rather than decisions that narrow options or alter tactics under external pressure. The piece is observation-led; the only decisive act is the symbolic release, which reweights meaning but does not foreclose a live relational or physical stake. Causal pressure is internal and conceptual. Gate count: all three present. Band guidance: one beat of symbolic action at closure, plus thematic charge, places this in the mid-5s; the specificity of her craft metaphors (indigo, cochineal, fixing bath) and the wing-release's closure participation lift it toward 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blue morpho wing appears in setup (palm, dawn light), is actively handled and repositioned at the eastern window to track sun trails (development), and returns with reweighted meaning when released to become "a star" at closure (payoff). It constrains the protagonist's method (compass for tracking) and charges the final image with iridescent transformation. The wing's "caution" (blue shifting to violet, then black) informs the protagonist's understanding of fragility. Gate count: all three. Causal pressure: enables the tracking method and symbolically embodies the lesson of porosity. Closure linkage is strong. Deductions: the wing is more often described than used; its physical properties (iridescence, scales, shadow) do most of the work through observation rather than active manipulation that alters tactics under duress.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Iridescent caution is named in the mid-section ("iridescent caution play across its surface—blue shifting to violet, then black, warning that beauty and fragility shared the same molecular structure") and echoed thematically in the protagonist's realization that "caution could shimmer rather than constrain." It shapes the thematic stakes (how to hold watchfulness without rigidity) but does not alter on-page tactics or force a choice between competing options. Setup: implied through the dye master's careful positioning. Development: the wing's color shifts illustrate the concept. Payoff: "caution could shimmer" reframes the idea at closure. Gate count: two of three (development is thematic illustration, not choice pressure). The concept remains more interpretive resonance than concrete constraint. Swappability: moderate; "iridescent caution" could be replaced with "luminous restraint" or "delicate vigilance" without major structural edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is named once in the climactic beat ("the quietly explosive truth detonate in her chest—not with violence, but with the soft expansion of understanding") and echoed in "explosive quiet" near the end. The attribute describes the mode of revelation rather than constraining or enabling an on-page action with visible cost. It modulates tone (the epiphany is soft rather than violent) but does not shape tactics or force a trade-off. Setup: absent. Development: the phrase appears at the insight beat. Payoff: reprised as "explosive quiet." Gate count: one of three (development only, and as descriptor rather than enacted trait). The trait is label-only; removing "quietly explosive" and replacing it with "sudden" or "gentle" would not alter story logic. Cost connection: none visible.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Illuminate" recurs throughout: the tea house "illuminating [the earth] from above," the wing tracking how "light behaved differently around objects that had known death and resurrection," and the protagonist seeking "the pattern that would illuminate the mystery." The action shapes the method (tracking sun trails to illuminate understanding) and the thematic stakes (illumination as perspective, not escape). Setup: early, in the second paragraph. Development: drives the tracking ritual across multiple beats. Payoff: "illuminate" reappears in the climactic realization and informs the final image (wing catching light, becoming a star). Gate count: all three. Causal pressure: the illumination method enables the insight, though the action itself is observational rather than physically transformative. Major turns trace to this action, but it could be replaced with "reveal" or "clarify" with minor edits, indicating moderate swappability. Irreplaceability: medium.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tracking sun trails is signaled early ("Each morning she tracked the sun trails") and its mechanics matter: the protagonist positions the wing at the eastern window, notes where light pools and scatters, and watches the tea house rotate to follow the sun. The method shapes her attempts to decode the donor's magnetism and drives the insight when "the wing cast a shadow that fractured into prisms." Setup: clear by the first third. Development: the tracking ritual recurs and structures the middle section. Payoff: the final sun trail moves across her face as the tea house turns, and the wing's release catches light to complete the pattern. Gate count: all three. Causal pressure: the method enables the epiphany and charges the closure image. Deduction: the mechanics are more observational than tactical; the protagonist does not adjust her tracking in response to a failed attempt or external obstacle. The method is specific but could be replaced with another form of patient observation (e.g., tracking reflections, shadows) with moderate structural edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house pressures the protagonist's state (height initially terrifies, then offers perspective) and its rotation on magnetic ore enables the sun-trail tracking method. The setting is not mere backdrop; the mist-veiled isolation, the pavilion's drift, and the valley floor "impossibly far below" shape the protagonist's realization that "the floating rock was not escaping the earth but illuminating it from above." Setup: present in the opening lines. Development: the tea house's rotation and height constrain the method and mirror the protagonist's suspended emotional state. Payoff: the height's meaning is reweighted at closure ("for the first time since the surgery, the height did not terrify her"). Gate count: all three. Causal pressure: the setting enables the tracking method and charges the final image through verticality and drift. Irreplaceability: high; removing the floating, rotating quality would collapse the illumination metaphor and the protagonist's arc from fear to perspective.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after receiving the donor heart" is signaled in the opening line ("Three weeks had passed since the surgeons sealed the donor organ inside her chest") and creates a ticking pressure: the protagonist needs to understand the donor's magnetism "before the new heart fully claimed her identity." The three-week marker establishes urgency and the ending acknowledges completion ("feeling the donor's final gift settle into place"). Setup: immediate. Development: the timeframe tightens decisions implicitly (the protagonist has limited time before assimilation), though no on-page clock accelerates tactics. Payoff: closure acknowledges the timeframe's resolution. Gate count: all three. Causal pressure: moderate; the urgency is declared but not dramatized through a narrowing window or failed attempts that eat time. The three weeks could be three months or three days without major structural change, indicating swappability. Cost connection: the timeframe motivates the quest but does not visibly constrain a specific choice or tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn why some people magnetize stories" is stated early ("the dye master needed to understand this gravity before the new heart fully claimed her identity") and drives the tracking ritual. The desire is dramatized through repeated positioning of the wing, mapping light, and searching for patterns. Internal friction appears when the protagonist must reconcile her watchful, controlling nature with the donor's porous receptivity. Setup: clear in the first third. Development: the motivation structures the middle beats (observation, adjustment, insight). Payoff: the epiphany answers the question (porosity, not performance) and the wing-release enacts acceptance. Gate count: all three. Causal pressure: the desire drives action and shapes the arc. Cost: implicit in the renunciation of control (releasing the compass-wing), though the cost is more conceptual than relational or physical. Deduction: the motivation is slightly tell-heavy in the opening ("she needed to understand this gravity") and the friction between wanting control and needing receptivity is more explained than enacted through conflicting micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Valley-mist wonder is named once ("to hold oneself in valley-mist wonder—present, translucent, receptive") and tonally present throughout: the mist-veiled setting, the floating pavilion, the iridescent wing, and the quiet epiphany all sustain a contemplative, luminous register. The tone modulates with pressure: the protagonist's initial terror (height, foreign heart) gives way to calm receptivity by the end, and the final image (wing becoming a star, stories drifting upward) crystallizes wonder without sentimentality. Setup: the mist and floating setting establish tone early. Development: the tone remains coherent through observation beats and does not fracture under the insight's pressure. Payoff: the tone charges the final image (release, transformation, star). Gate count: all three. Coherence: high. The tone is not static; it shifts from anxious watchfulness to luminous acceptance. Deduction: "valley-mist wonder" is named explicitly near the end as a thesis-like phrase, which risks over-articulation, though the tone's embodiment in setting and rhythm earns most of the score.</comment>
