<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is motivated and his choice to descend is clear, but internal contradiction is minimal—he drifts "with methodical aimlessness" yet the narrative never shows genuine ambivalence or competing impulses acting simultaneously. His grandmother's deathbed instructions anchor backstory within ~20%, but the final realization feels more like receiving a gift than foreclosing a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present (key tag "warm in his palm") but the climactic moment leans toward wonder rather than a choice that alters stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the sunken-ship library and sky-lantern convergence are legible early. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding his true purpose) with conceptual cost implied—twelve years spent maintaining surface lamps to reach this single moment. The cost is visible in "twelve years of night shifts" but the final beat prioritizes revelation over a decision that narrows options, slightly softening the felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flooded ballroom with air-pocket library is vivid and specific; the porthole view of ascending lanterns and the tuning fork's violet shimmer constrain the climactic discovery. Sensory hierarchy is strong—violet "like dust made of amethyst," mold-spotted volumes, brackish tide. The sheet-music cabinet's lock mechanism (key tag fits without a key) integrates setting into closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering synesthetic proof—is signaled by paragraph nine and drives the descent. One meaningful tightening: the convergence of sky lanterns creates the chromatic resonance his grandmother theorized. Agency is limited; Elias waits for cosmic alignment rather than forcing a choice under pressure. The final image reweights his twelve-year routine, but coincidence (lantern festival timing) enables rather than complicates, and no visible tradeoff or renunciation occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—sound as light, words as luminous trace—emerges from grandmother's research and the violet shimmer without overt statement. The final image ("some colors could only be found by those willing to drown in the dark") answers the thematic question through metaphor, non-literal and resonant. Subtext operates in "hides behind truth" and the covenant passed through generations. Minor slip: "luminous vows" recurs as a label without sufficient concrete grounding in character action, edging toward prompt echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (pier-worker's eye for lamps, inherited librarian's focus). Diction is elevated and lyric ("meteor hush," "dust made of amethyst") which fits the tonal aim but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("chromatic resonance," "synesthetic harmonics") that edges beyond a lamplighter's natural lexicon. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well under emotional pressure in the descent sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("reef of rust and secrets," "slow-motion meteors in reverse," "drown in the dark") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff proportional to frequency; this triggers overwriting penalty −0.5. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 8–9 restate "hidden in plain sight" and "factual yet concealing" across adjacent beats (−0.2). Sentence openings vary and momentum is present, but the stacked metaphors in peak beats (tuning fork, violet shimmer, final epiphany) blur rather than sharpen the closure image. No scaffolding or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Synesthetic color-of-sound discovery in a sunken library is a fresh synthesis; the air-pocket physics and skeleton-key-tag-as-lock are specific. The convergence with sky lanterns offers non-obvious timing. Risk: "luminous vows" as concept and "hides behind truth" echo writing-prompt templates without full transformation through lived cost. The ending's "drown in the dark" metaphor feels earned in hindsight but borders on abstraction. Transformation test: swap names/place and the emotional arc holds, indicating mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias (late-shift pier lamplighter) is present throughout and his choice to descend drives the middle and ending. Setup by paragraph one; development in descent sequence; payoff when he sits among the violet and understands his purpose. His occupation (maintaining lamps) frames expectation and the ending reweights it. Cost is conceptual (twelve years spent unknowingly preparing) rather than a decision that narrows options on the page. Causal pressure is moderate; the role is essential but his agency is more receiver than decider.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Hotel skeleton key tag appears in paragraph eight (grandmother's deathbed gift), unlocks the sheet-music cabinet in paragraph fourteen (second functional beat), and returns warm in his palm at closure (third touch, reweighted). Setup in first third via backstory; development when it opens the cabinet; payoff as closure anchor. Irreplaceability: fits a lock "though no key dangled." Causal pressure moderate; it enables discovery but does not force a choice under stress. Closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Luminous vows (core concept) are introduced in paragraph ten, described as "written in the margins" and "emitted by promises spoken with absolute intent." The sky lanterns are framed as vows released, and the convergence enables the chromatic discovery. Setup by ~40%; closure linkage indirect (lanterns create the chord, violet reveals the concept's truth). Development beat: grandmother's research on chromatic signatures. Cost is conceptual (truth revealed) but the vows themselves do not constrain Elias's choices or tactics on the page. Swappability moderate; "promises" or "intentions" could replace with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" (attribute) appears in paragraph eight: grandmother's instructions were "factual…yet they concealed the covenant." It recurs in paragraph nineteen: "hidden in plain sight." Setup in first third; closure callback when Elias understands the hidden purpose. The trait constrains by misdirection (he tended lamps, not knowing the real aim) but no on-page choice is shown where this concealment forces a visible tradeoff. Development beat is summary rather than dramatized pressure. Cost is realized retroactively, not paid in scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Signify" (action) appears twice: paragraph six (hotel signage bleeding copper) and paragraph twelve ("luminous vows that signify the soul's true frequency"). The second use ties to closure when the violet shimmer signifies sound's hidden hue and the final line invokes vows "signifying" truth. Setup early; payoff at closure where the act of revealing meaning is central. Causal role: the discovery *is* a signification event. Irreplaceability moderate; "reveal" or "manifest" could substitute with minor loss. The verb does redefine options (Elias now knows his purpose) but is not a physical action that forces a turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" (method) is introduced in paragraph five and echoed in paragraph eighteen ("his wandering purposefully through twelve years"). Setup early; development implicit in the descent (he appears to drift yet traces precision); payoff when the ending reveals the method was unconsciously goal-directed all along. The paradox—appearing aimless while being driven—shapes tactics (he waits, does not force) and charges the final realization. Causal pressure moderate; it frames rather than constrains a specific choice. Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Forgotten library inside sunken ship (setting) is introduced paragraph six, dominates middle beats (descent, air pocket, sheet-music cabinet), and supplies the unique condition (chromatic resonance visible only here) that enables closure. Setup by ~25%; development across multiple beats (porthole view, tuning fork, violet shimmer); payoff essential—discovery cannot occur elsewhere. Irreplaceability high: air pocket physics and acoustic properties are causally tied to the synesthetic reveal. Visible cost: Elias must enter the flooded wreck repeatedly for twelve years. All three gates met; closure would fail without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sky lantern release (timeframe) is introduced paragraph one, creates the convergence in paragraph ten ("tonight…the barrier…grew thin"), and remains visible through the porthole at closure. Setup immediate; development when "tonight's convergence would create a chord visible only in this sunken chamber"; payoff as the lanterns' ascent enables the violet shimmer. The timing tightens the window (one night per year) and supplies necessary conditions. Cost is opportunity-based (miss this night, wait another year) but not dramatized as a ticking-clock pressure that alters Elias's tactics on the page. Causal role strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Discover the color of sound (motivation) is grandmother's life work (paragraph eleven) inherited by Elias; it drives his descent and frames the climactic moment when violet appears. Setup by ~35%; development in grandmother's research notes and tuning-fork use; payoff when he sees "the shade of twilight and amethyst…the color of middle C, at last." The desire is dramatized through action (striking the tuning fork, opening the ledger) and the cost is conceptual (twelve years spent preparing). Friction: the discovery happens *to* him via convergence rather than through a choice under competing wants. Closure linkage undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" (tone) is named in paragraph three ("a silence so profound it felt cosmic and final") and echoed in paragraph fifteen ("meteor hush pressing against the glass"). The tone—reverent, hushed, cosmic—is coherent through turns and charges the final image of silent vows ascending. Modulation is present: urgency during descent, wonder at the violet shimmer, quiet awe at closure. The repeated phrase unifies atmosphere and meaning. Closure linkage strong; the hush is both literal (sky lanterns) and metaphorical (revelatory silence). Specificity high; swapping "silence" or "stillness" would lose the cosmic-scale connotation.</comment>
