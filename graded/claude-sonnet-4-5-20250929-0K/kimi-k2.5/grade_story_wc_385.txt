<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to understand her sister's echo is clear, but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than contradictory impulses. The final choice to "ensure the Echoed Ones were honored" arrives as declaration without visible cost or a path foreclosed on the page. Embodied emotion is scarce; the "reed-blown melancholy" remains a label rather than enacted pressure. The "richly perceptive" attribute functions as a told trait without on-page tradeoffs or mistakes driven by that very perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph and follows an accumulative lens: Mira descends, encounters the Archivists, receives revelation, and crystallizes her stance. The closure reads as Charged Poise—she commits to honor rather than exploit—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatically foreclosed. The progressive-disclosure mechanism is told in summary ("seven years unraveling") rather than shown tightening options on the page, weakening causal linkage at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus, starlight columns, and seashell anchor setting vividly and purposefully. The shell's positioning to "catch the starlight at the precise angle" constrains Mira's action and charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dust of centuries," "sandstone worn smooth"), and the spatial choreography of descent and convergence remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is signaled early and drives the descent. However, escalation under the accumulative lens depends on deepening pressure, and here the Archivists provide answers without resistance or complication. The final "decision crystallizing" lacks a visible price paid or option foreclosed on the page; Mira's stance is declared but not tested against counter-pressure. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the sister's imprinting and the consent/preservation tension. The seashell's shift from ocean memory to Echoed Ones' voices is a purposeful reprise that reweights meaning. Yet the ending tilts toward thesis statement ("echo became choice, not capture") rather than allowing the final image to resonate without summary. The philosophical question is rich but the resolution is told more than enacted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prose sustains a consistent lyric register with strong perceptual signature ("harmonic resonance of dark matter," "gypsum in desert air"). Psychic distance is stable and purposeful compression fits the accumulative mode. However, elevated diction ("reed-blown melancholy," "progressive disclosure") occasionally drifts above immediate sensory grounding, and the Archivists' dialogue ("you carry the resonance key") reads expository rather than goal-driven. Filter verbs ("understood," "recognized") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy here.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("frozen river of light," "shimmer of quartz and shadow"). The phrase "webs of intrigue" recurs without evolving meaning, bordering on loop. Some constructions are overwritten: "the reed-blown melancholy of her voice weaving new patterns into the ancient nexus" stacks modifiers without added clarity. Opening and closing lines anchor well, but mid-passage exposition ("the Archivists had discovered that human consciousness could be imprinted") summarizes rather than dramatizes the revelation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—consciousness encoded in geology—offers a fresh angle on ancestor memory and post-collapse preservation. Specific details (seashell coordinates, acoustic geometry, slot canyons as arteries) ground the speculative frame. Yet the core turn (Echoed Ones as seeds, not prisoners) resolves via explanation rather than embodied discovery, and the "webs of intrigue" and "progressive disclosure" feel like structural placeholders rather than transformed tropes. The final image risks abstraction over lived particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mira drives the descent, positions the shell at the precise angle, and crystallizes the final stance. She appears in setup, middle revelation, and ending, meeting all three gates. However, her choices are more observational than decisional until the very end, where "ensure" is declared but not enacted with visible cost. The sister's shimmer and the shell's song enable revelation, but Mira's agency in altering tactics is limited.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The seashell half is present in the opening (listening, mapping coordinates), positioned mid-scene to catch starlight and trigger the convergence, and returns at closure as the translation device. It constrains Mira's action (angle precision) and charges the final image. The object's fractured-whole history and shift from ocean memory to Echoed Ones' voices reweight its meaning across beats. Strong integration, though the mechanics of "translation" are asserted rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "webs of intrigue" appear in setup as past context (seven years unraveling) and recur twice in body paragraphs as thematic labels. They function as backstory explanation rather than on-page tactical constraint. The concept does not narrow options or alter Mira's choices in the present scene; instead it is revealed and then resolved via exposition. Present but largely ornamental to the live action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is attributed in the opening ("the elders had recognized") and supports Mira's ability to assemble "the final pattern from the fragments." However, it remains a told label without on-page cost or tradeoff. No scene demonstrates perception enabling one choice while foreclosing another, nor does hyper-perception create mistakes or blind spots. The trait is functional but swappable with "insightful" or "gifted."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears as Mira's final commitment: "she would ensure the Echoed Ones were honored as ancestors rather than exploited as archives." It defines the closure stance and is signaled earlier via her question about consent. The action shapes the ending's thematic charge but is declared rather than enacted with visible tactics or cost on the page. Two gates (middle stake, ending articulation) are met; the lack of demonstrated execution or foreclosed alternative keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" is named in the opening third ("Through progressive disclosure, she had spent seven years") and recurs once ("the progressive disclosure had taught her"). It frames backstory but does not shape on-page attempts or constrain present choices. The shell's angle and the Archivists' revelation are the live mechanics; progressive disclosure is a retrospective label for past process. Functional setup, minimal middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus anchors the entire scene: Mira descends into it, starlight filters through it, the convergence occurs at its center, and the final song is woven "into the ancient nexus." The setting provides spatial constraint (narrow columns, sandstone purchase) and thematic resonance (braided canyons as arteries). It is indispensable to the story's geography, pressure, and closure image. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "universe hums its secret song" in the opening and the "cosmic hum" intensifies as Mira approaches the Archivists and again when the shell sings. The phrase provides atmospheric continuity but does not function as a ticking clock or tighten decisions. Time remains vague; no urgency or deadline shapes Mira's tactics. The element is present and thematically consistent but ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to learn why some people echo while others simply cease" is stated explicitly mid-scene and drives her question to the Archivists. It is seeded in the opening (her sister's permanent resonance) and resolved at closure when she understands the answer. The motivation is told and pursued through dialogue rather than embodied in conflicted micro-choices or visible tradeoffs. Two gates met; middle friction and cost visibility are light.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" appears twice as a descriptor of Mira's voice and once in the final line. The tone is asserted rather than enacted through rhythm, image, or syntactic compression. The prose leans more toward lyric elevation than melancholy's weight; diction such as "shimmer of quartz and shadow" and "frozen river of light" reads luminous rather than mournful. The label is present but the tonal texture does not consistently modulate pressure or charge the ending beyond declaration.</comment>
