<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to witness and preserve meaning—is consistent and embodied through "gently meticulous" actions (calipers, sampling, ledger work). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between procedural discipline and despair, visible when "urgency tightened her chest" yet her movements remain controlled. The final realization ("to measure is to love what cannot be saved") feels earned by the progression from duty to comprehension. However, the protagonist remains largely passive observer rather than agent making choices that alter outcomes; she documents rather than decides.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (frequencies, vows, the slide's warmth) building to a Conceptual Repricing at closure where measurement itself is reweighted as an act of love and witness. The cost is conceptual and elegiac—archives full but hands empty, preservation without salvation—legible in "the blank slide like a prayer." One meaningful deepening occurs when the Fading accelerates and Elara increases sampling rate, tightening time pressure and reweighting her ministry from decades to hours.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library, brass apparatus, and magic lantern slide function as micro-setting that constrains and enables action: the resonator translates light to mathematics, calipers measure decay, the slide's warmth signals mnemonic release. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"frost-rimed balustrade," "quartz hush," "prismatic shadows"—filtered through Elara's archival priorities. The apparatus directly charges the final image when the slide goes "clear, empty glass holding nothing but her own reflection," turning tool into mirror and completing the thematic loop. Spatial choreography (balustrade to obsidian table to ledger) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving meaning before the Fading erases it—is signaled early and tightens when "the Fading was accelerating, the transition from illusion to memory compressing into hours rather than decades." This temporal squeeze forces Elara to increase sampling rate, a tactical shift driven by the shrinking window. The final cost is visible: vows dissolve to "statistical notation," the slide goes blank, yet "her archives full of the songs that once made people human." The pressure is largely situational (external decay) rather than protagonist-driven choice, which limits agency but maintains coherent escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the contrast between luminous bonds and their reduction to frequencies, the paradox of "speed and reverence," the shift from preservation-as-salvation to witness-as-love. The final image—"holding the blank slide like a prayer"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether meaning can survive oblivion, reweighting the entire cataloging enterprise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the child's ultraviolet promise (innocence dissolving), marriage bonds at 432 Hz (specific human connection), and the empty reflection (the archivist becomes the last remaining vow). No thematic echo; the prose earns its insight through the documented decay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in Elara's archival lens: "gently meticulous precision," technical vocabulary (resonator, photonic resonance, spectral thread), and the habit of translating experience into measurement. Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible focalization—"mnemonic energy releasing," "photonic resonance"—but reads as professional idiom rather than register drift. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (millisecond sampling, chest tightening). The prose rhythm modulates well, from the slow opening catalog to compressed urgency ("capturing frequencies now in milliseconds") to elegiac stillness at close. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance setting, action, or theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the accumulative design. However, minor overwriting appears: "quartz hush" recurs four times without clear pattern payoff, and some figurative language stacks without cost—"luminous potential," "spectral thread," "mnemonic energy" cluster in adjacent lines. Paraphrase loop: "measure what remained before the edge of oblivion swallowed them" and later "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" repeat the frame with synonym drift. Template cadence in the middle third: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Elara [verb]." These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion slightly. Closure image (blank slide, reflection, prayer) is clean and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—archiving decaying vows as light frequencies in a frozen sky-library—synthesizes fresh particulars (photonic bonds, thermal inversion spires, the resonator apparatus) with the familiar elegiac-archivist frame. The shift from preservation-as-mission to witness-as-love offers a non-obvious moral calculus, and the "magic lantern slide" reinvents the prompt object through mnemonic physics. Specificity (432 Hz marriage bonds, ultraviolet child's promise) avoids generic abstraction. However, the lonely-scholar-preserving-lost-civilization template remains recognizable; transformation is present but incremental rather than radical. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and technical idiom heightens coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara as "orderly records chief" is present from the opening, drives the sampling and measurement work across multiple beats (engaging resonator, adjusting calipers, recording amplitude, increasing sampling rate), and her meticulous discipline shapes the final stance: "procedural discipline" overriding despair. The role enables her to translate vows into data and constrains her to witness rather than intervene. The attribute appears in the closure image (closing the ledger, holding the slide) and the final realization ties directly to her archival identity. Early signal, beat involvement across setup/middle/end, causal constraint (her skills allow measurement but not salvation), and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide is handled in multiple beats: held "between trembling palms" at setup, engaged with the resonator to sample frequencies (middle development), grows warm from mnemonic release, and becomes "clear, empty glass holding nothing but her own reflection" at closure—a charged transformation that anchors the final image. Its specific property (containing vows as photonic resonance rather than images) is irreplaceable and drives the measurement action. Early signal, multiple-beat involvement, causal enabler, and closure participation with reweighted meaning (from archive vessel to mirror/prayer) all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" shape the dominant stake from the opening: "glowing threads of intention" that sustained settlements, now "flickering like dying stars." The concept drives Elara's sampling work (marriage bonds, peace treaties, cooperation chords, child's promise) and the measurement method (capturing harmonic signatures). It reappears transformed in the closure when vows dissolve to "statistical notation" and "songs that once made people human." The concept is irreplaceable—stakes and tactics depend on vows as measurable light. Early signal, middle constraint (acceleration of decay forces faster sampling), and closure reconfiguration all present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is embodied across beats: "fingers moving with gently meticulous precision across ledgers," adjusting spectacles, engaging the resonator, adjusting calipers, increasing sampling rate with "procedural discipline." The trait enables accurate measurement under pressure and constrains her to witness rather than intervene—a visible trade-off when "urgency tightened her chest" yet movements remain controlled. It charges the closure: "gently meticulous records of light" and the solemn ledger-closing. Early signal, visible cost (speed versus reverence paradox), multiple-beat embodiment, and closure linkage present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The action "measure" drives the entire narrative arc: sampling frequencies, recording amplitude, measuring decay rate, capturing wavelengths in milliseconds. Major turns trace to measurement—when the Fading accelerates, Elara increases sampling rate (tactical shift); when the last frequency flatlines, measurement ceases and the realization arrives. The final insight ("to measure is to love what cannot be saved") reweights the action itself, transforming documentation into devotion. Measurement is irreplaceable; the story's logic collapses without it. Early signal, multiple-beat causal driver, and closure conceptual repricing all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sampling frequencies" is signaled early ("beginning her work by sampling frequencies") and its mechanics matter: the resonator translates light into mathematics, she records amplitude of each wavelength, captures harmonic signatures (432 Hz, lower octaves, complex chords), increases sampling rate to milliseconds. The method enables the measurement action and constrains her tactics when decay accelerates. It appears in closure framing: frequencies flatline, vows reduce to notation. Early signal, mechanical specificity that shapes middle attempts, and closure participation present. Swappable with "recording" or "cataloging" only at surface level; the frequency-capture detail is load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "frozen library above clouds" is established in the opening and provides essential constraints: thermal inversion preserves the archives, "quartz hush" frames tone, ice walls refract afternoon light casting "prismatic shadows," the isolation enforces Elara's solitary ministry. The setting supplies the apparatus (brass resonator, obsidian table) that enables measurement. It charges the final image: "cloud-borne library, where even time had grown frostbitten and slow." The environment is irreplaceable—stakes depend on the fragile preservation and the vertical exile. Early signal, middle atmospheric pressure (shifting clouds signal time passage), and closure charge all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "while illusions fade to memory" is present from the opening ("illusions fade to memory and memory itself begins to crumble") and tightens when "the Fading was accelerating, the transition from illusion to memory compressing into hours rather than decades." This compression forces Elara to increase sampling rate (tactical shift) and creates urgency. The phrase recurs at closure: "solemn act of witness performed while illusions faded to memory." The timeframe shapes tactics and charges the ending, though the metaphor remains somewhat abstract. Early signal, middle pressure point, closure linkage present; cost tied to acceleration is visible.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is explicit early ("to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion required both speed and reverence") and drives Elara's work: not "merely to preserve data, but to ensure that when the last warmth left the world, someone would understand what had been sacrificed." Friction appears between the desire (conjure meaning) and the limit (cannot save, only witness). The closure reweights this: "meaning was not conjured from preservation alone, but from the solemn act of witness." Early signal, middle conflict (speed versus reverence paradox), and closure conceptual repricing present; the verb "conjure" is reweighted from magic to ministry.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" frames tone from the opening ("breath crystallizing in the quartz hush") and recurs to modulate pressure: "quartz hush deepened as afternoon light refracted," "quartz hush of the cloud-borne library" at closure. The tone—crystalline silence, elegiac stillness, cold precision—remains coherent through escalation (urgency within the hush) and charges the final image where Elara "sat quietly" within that hush. The phrase is specific and voice-particular, not generic atmosphere. Early signal, pressure modulation (deepening parallels the Fading), and closure charge all present. The recurring phrase does light thematic work, reweighting silence from preservation condition to witness posture.</comment>
