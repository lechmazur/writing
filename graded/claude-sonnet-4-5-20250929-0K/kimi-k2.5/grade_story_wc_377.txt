<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's seasonal muteness is mentioned but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—she works alone throughout, so the attribute functions as atmospheric detail rather than dramatic friction. Her motivation ("preserve the color of wonder") is asserted repeatedly but never tested against a competing want or obstacle that would force a values-hierarchy choice. The final "success" moment lacks the earned contradiction or renunciation that would demonstrate character change; she completes a project without internal conflict or visible forfeiture. Interiority leans heavily on abstract declarations ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation adequately (who, where, when by ~150 words) but lacks a clear closure effect with legible cost. The ending describes mechanical success—the bells ring as planned—without a decisive change, renunciation, or reconfiguration that forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt consequence. The narrative unfolds as a descriptive unfolding of a plan that works, not a pressure-driven sequence where agency alters options. Under any lens (Causal, Accumulative, or Situational), the absence of meaningful tightening or cost at closure prevents high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispering bluff, thin atmosphere, and iceberg fragment are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (prisms, thermal currents, altitude effects on fingers). The iceberg's refraction of sound into visible spectra is a purposeful detail that charges the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Elara's work proceeds without spatial friction or environmental complication, keeping the setting in mid-range rather than the 9+ band where constraint or crisis-driven detail would be required.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the dominant stake (completing the bell mechanism) is stated early and then achieved without reversal, complication, or visible cost. The narrative lacks an on-page choice that narrows options or a deepening that changes knowledge—Elara executes a plan, the wind cooperates, the bells ring. The absence of agency-driven pressure or felt price at closure (she "had succeeded" with no trade-off) keeps this well below the threshold for strong conflict scoring.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (truth beyond words, preservation of wonder) emerges from consistent images—bells, ice prisms, seasonal muteness—and the final image (truth singing in metal and ice) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, thematic depth is limited by the lack of dramatic tension: the protagonist's conviction is never tested, so the theme remains an assertion rather than an earned insight. The repeated use of prompt-like phrases ("color of wonder," "symphonies of truth") in expository interiority rather than scene-driven discovery lowers resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (attention to vibration, altitude effects, color). Diction is controlled and purposeful, though it drifts toward elevated register in high-concept moments ("humanity had learned to communicate through pressure and silence"). No dialogue appears. The prose sustains a consistent narrative distance and voice-motivated lexicon, but the lack of stress-driven modulation or psychic distance shifts keeps it from high-band scores where voice would tighten under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but several issues accumulate: paraphrase loops (the iceberg's preservation and color are restated three times across paragraphs), template cadence in the bell-ringing sequence ("The first bell rang... The second bell sang... the third of light, the fourth of..."), and stock metaphors ("truth made audible," "cathedral of amazement"). The loop about "symphonies of truth" and "color of wonder" recurs without added pressure. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum and prevent clean high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (post-verbal humanity, kinetic truth-bells, altitude workshop) offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements, and the iceberg-as-prism detail is specific. However, the narrative arc follows a template path: lone artisan completes a long-planned project in a decayed world, succeeds without complication, and the final image affirms the premise without transformation. The absence of risk, reversal, or non-obvious moral calculus keeps originality in mid-range; the story executes its concept but does not deepen or complicate it through character pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her hands perform adjustments, but her choices do not create key turns—she executes a plan that proceeds without complication or decision-point. Label-only integration; no forked-path choice visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment appears in setup (hauled three decades prior, never melts), provides visual color in the middle (prisms), and returns at closure (refracting sound waves). However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; it functions as atmospheric motif rather than causal lever. Two-beat participation with lyric reprise but no agency link caps it near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is asserted as driving concept but remains thematic claim rather than on-page stake or constraint. The bells ring to express truths, but this does not alter Elara's options or impose visible cost. Label-only presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness is introduced early and tied to sharpened vibration perception, but it never constrains an on-page action with cost—Elara works alone, so the inability to speak does not create friction or force a trade-off. Functional flavor but replaceable; the story would proceed unchanged if she were simply silent by habit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Glisten" recurs in setup (dawn on ice), middle (prisms on tools), and closure (refracting sound into visible spectra). The final glistening charges the ending image and links iceberg, bells, and wonder. However, the action does not drive a turn or narrow options; it is a purposeful lyric reprise rather than a causal pivot. Strong closure linkage lifts it into the 6+ range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture is introduced early (assembling counterweights, balanced rods, weighted sails), mechanics are explained, and the mechanism performs its function at closure. However, the method does not shape attempts or impose constraint—it works as designed without complication. Functional presence across beats but no friction or cost tied to the means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The whispering bluff is established early (wind carries voices, thermal currents preserve ice, altitude stiffens fingers) and the wind activates the sculpture at closure. The setting provides atmospheric pressure but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara's work proceeds without spatial complication. Setup and closure participation meet two gates; lack of middle friction limits score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" frames the world but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The timeframe is backstory context; no live clock or temporal pressure shapes Elara's work. Present only as thematic setup.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is stated as motivation and echoed at closure, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elara's desire faces no test or friction. Told motivation without on-page friction trends low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" is embodied through controlled imagery (hands moving "with muted vigor," "slow, majestic rotation"), restrained diction, and the interplay of silence and mechanical precision. The tone remains coherent and modulates subtly between description and the final bell sequence. It charges the ending image through sustained understatement, meeting two positives (coherence and closure linkage) without overt mood swings.</comment>
