<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The solitary summoner remains conceptual rather than embodied—no contradictory impulses act in scene, no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. Interiority consists of elevated abstractions ("smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic") rather than character-particular perception. The work is completed through described technique without visible struggle or cost that would foreclose a path. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; the prophecy is contained off-stage through summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past 120 words—who this summoner is, her concrete location beyond "brook" and "clearing," and what timeline governs the prophecy threat never anchor clearly (−0.4). The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: "having turned a tide of whispered destiny into nothing more than the absence of sound" tells outcome without showing the price paid or options foreclosed. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet no meaningful tightening or cadence shift reweights the stake—the work proceeds smoothly from mapping to containment without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid ("moonlight turned water into liquid mercury," "cricket song and the gurgle of currents") but remains postcard description—the brook, clearing, and nocturnal setting do not constrain any choice or supply resources that alter outcome. The crane's wing is handled across beats, yet its paper properties and starlight charge function as ornament rather than tactical constraint. Spatial choreography is clean but the environment exerts no pressure on the working itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the summoner maps silence, releases the wing, and the hush expands without resistance that forces trade-offs. "The prophecy fought back, its coded syllables writhing" is told summary, not dramatized pressure. The resolution occurs through described technique rather than protagonist agency under cost, and coincidence (the wing becoming a compass needle) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of silence vs. prophecy, stillness vs. intensity is declared in abstractions ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") rather than emergent from concrete action. The crane's wing recurs but does not shift meaning—it remains a magical tool throughout. The final paragraph moralizes: "having turned a tide of whispered destiny into nothing more than the absence of sound, a tranquil blaze that would guard the world invisibly" (−0.6 for thematic summary replacing scene pressure). No non-literal answer to the central question; the ending restates the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable and focalization is controlled, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction defaults to elevated fantasy register ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") without character-specific idiom. Filter verbs ("she felt the words trying to flow") and expository constructions ("This was the paradox she embodied") dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains uniformly remote, never modulating with the supposed intensity of the working. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting with stacked metaphors and register drift: "terrestrially cosmic—rooted in soil yet spanning galaxies, as intimate as soil and vast as nebulae" mixes vehicles incoherently (−0.6). Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching: "silence rushed in…a vacuum nature abhorred yet she commanded" followed immediately by "the smoothed hush flowed from her lips…creating a silence so complete it had weight, texture, gravity." Paraphrase loops ("mapping silence…charting invisible contours…creating a cartography of quiet") and template cadence across the middle paragraphs (−0.8 cumulative). Artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise—summoner contains prophecy through mapping silence—follows fantasy-template structure without transformation: lone magic-user performs ritual near water at night to avert destiny. The "origami crane wing folded from starlight-charged paper" and "terrestrially cosmic" diction read as quirk layering rather than necessity. Turns arise from convenient magic (wing becomes compass, hush expands geometrically) rather than character choice or world logic established early. No bold risk; the safety middle chooses median fantasy options throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics—she begins mapping silence, continues mapping, releases the wing, and completes the containment without friction or choice under pressure. Observation and technique description dominate; agency is asserted in summary rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in three beats: opening description, transformation into compass needle, and retrieval at dawn. Early signal (+0.5), but middle use is passive (it spins on its own) rather than handled choice. Closure participation is present (retrieved and tucked away) but ornamental—the wing could be any magical tool. Specificity (paper holding starlight/tree memory) remains decorative; no visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is mentioned repeatedly as the technique's product but does not constrain on-page action—it spreads "in geometric precision" and "flowed from her lips" through summary. The concept echoes thematically without shaping tactical choices or trade-offs. Late first full appearance in paragraph two (−0.3); swappable with "enforced silence" or similar (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears twice as a label ("rooted in soil yet spanning galaxies") but never constrains or enables action with visible cost. It describes the nature of her working in elevated metaphor without altering what she can or cannot do. Ornamental trait mention (−0.8); no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Flow" recurs in several forms—"flow between worlds," "flow into reality," "flow into the future"—but as metaphorical description rather than a distinct action the protagonist performs. The prophecy's attempt to flow is told opposition, not a turn the summoner creates. Swappable with "spread" or "enter" (−0.6); summary-only use (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is signaled early (paragraph two) and described: "charting invisible contours where sound failed to penetrate, finding the hollows between heartbeats…creating a cartography of quiet." The method shapes the middle beat and the hush follows mapped contours at closure. Functional across two beats (+0.9), but mechanics remain abstract—how mapping enables containment versus other methods is not made specific. Closure linkage is present but indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook are established early with vivid detail and anchor throughout. The setting provides atmosphere and the brook's surface hosts the wing, but the environment does not constrain the summoner's choices or supply resources that alter the working's outcome. Micro-setting (the specific spot where she kneels) could be any similar location. Present in closure (brook continues flowing) but passively.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" functions as condition rather than tightening timeframe. Dawn's approach in the final act signals elapsed time but does not create urgency or alter tactics—the summoner completes her work "when dawn threatened" without the clock forcing trade-offs. Vague duration (one night) and no live countdown that shapes attempts (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The goal to hush the prophecy is stated early and drives the scene's structure, but the motivation is told ("she sought a deeper stillness…she worked to hush the future") rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between competing wants or costs—she begins the work and succeeds. Functional but replaceable; the prophecy threat is abstract and the urgency asserted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is named twice: "the tranquil blaze ignite within her chest" and the closing phrase "a tranquil blaze that would guard the world invisibly." The tone aims for paradox (stillness with intensity) but the prose remains uniformly elevated and abstract throughout, never modulating with the supposed pressure of the working. Static mood (−0.5); label-only rather than embodied in cadence or diction shifts.</comment>
