<comment>Corvin's motivation—welcoming nuance into certainty—is conceptually clear and drives the threading action, but his interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("prismatic doubt," "necrotic belief from healthy tissue") that flattens embodied emotion under pressure. The final stance crystallization (settling into silt, receptors open) reads as passive observation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (murderers/saviors, prison/sanctuary) but operates as theme rather than simultaneous impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening lines and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the garden awakens into "polyculture of maybe," pressure crystallizes, and the final image (Corvin waiting, receptors open) reweights the premise with felt cost—endurance that forecloses certainty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through cascading metaphor and the dome-breathing moment shifts cadence to reweight the dominant stake (animate the petrified philosophy). One meaningful deepening is present; causality is elliptical but accumulative logic holds.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The hydrothermal vent, calcified fingers, hairline fissure, and foxglove ampoule all constrain the threading method and charge the closure image (dome breathes, bioluminescent chains, purple haze). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (water tastes of iron and old light, coral screaming/singing). The fissure as structural weakness serves as both setting constraint and thematic anchor, elevating setting's role beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—animating the petrified philosophy by threading ambivalence through the neural network—is signaled early and tightens once when Corvin shatters the ampoule and projects telepathy, forcing the garden's roots to spiral and question. The escalation reads under the Accumulative lens as a density shift (purple smoke, cascading logic, photon question marks) that reweights rigidity into complexity. The cost is legible (the garden shudders, certainty dissolves) but Corvin's final stance is receptive waiting rather than a trade-off that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The theme—that mercy and judgment, structural weakness and survival, coexist without binary resolution—emerges from concrete images (foxglove as toxic/medicinal, fissure as conduit, coral screaming then singing in major/minor). The final image (Corvin settling, telepathic receptors open, wisdom of the purple haze) reweights prior absolutes without stating a moral. The architectural metaphor (cascading, lattice, substrate, roots) coheres throughout, and the piece resists tidy binaries, though the abstract philosophizing ("necrotic belief," "polyculture of maybe") edges toward thematic echo in places.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person close POV with a distinct perceptual signature (telepathic receptors, stone skin, incisively kind attention) and a lexicon grounded in geology and architecture (calcified, lattice, substrate, silt). Register remains elevated throughout, which fits the meditative stance but flattens under peak pressure (ampoule shattering, garden shuddering) where sharper syntax might lift urgency. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. The prose reads coherent but lacks rhythmic modulation at key turns.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Information density is high and many lines multi-task (foxglove as color/poison/medicine, fissure as entry/conduit/thematic anchor), but figurative density in high-pressure beats—"prismatic doubt," "necrotic belief from healthy tissue," "polyculture of maybe," "stained-glass vessel"—approaches overwriting without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure. Paraphrase loop: "murderers and saviors both, prison and sanctuary" restated as "mercy and judgment could share the same stained-glass vessel" without added pressure. Template cadence in the final paragraph: "no longer X but Y" structure repeats across multiple beats without variation. Propulsion is steady but cumulative figurative load dulls immediacy. Apply −0.8 for density without coherent pattern and template runs.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—living statue threading memory through structural weakness to teach gradient to petrified certainty—is specific and non-obvious, and the underwater garden setting with calcified telepathy feels particular. The foxglove ampoule as both cardiac arrest and healing tincture, the fissure as survival mechanism rather than flaw, and the coral's tonal shift from scream to song all demonstrate transformation of familiar elements. Risk-taking (high figurative density, elliptical causality, lyric accumulation) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring closure, meriting mild upward adjustment within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Corvin (living statue, telepathic) appears throughout and his choices—moving to the fissure, shattering the ampoule, projecting telepathy—drive all three major beats. His traits (stone skin, telepathic receptors, calcified fingers) are handled concretely and constrain method (threading through substrate, incisively kind cutting). He is present in the final image (settling into silt, receptors open), shaping closure participation. His agency is decision-based (choosing the flaw over ceremony) with a cost (endurance, waiting for slow awakening). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present; irreplaceability strong (telepathy required for neural threading).</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The ampoule appears in beat one (pulsing in palm, stained purple, containing architect's thought), beat two (warmed against stone skin at the fissure), and beat three (shattered against fracture, purple smoke ribboning, memory propagating). Its properties—glass stained foxglove-purple, toxic/medicinal, saline suspension—are specific and irreplaceable (no generic vessel would carry the same thematic/causal charge). It enables the threading action and its destruction shapes the closure cascade (purple haze as wisdom, cardiac arrest and healing). Early signal, multi-beat use, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Cascading revelations frame the opening (secret exposed: caretakers drowned in mercy) and the ending (cascading logic: if caretakers complex, then creations complex, then destroyers complex). The concept shapes stakes (fractured purpose, prismatic doubt) and alters tactics (thread ambivalence through the crack rather than restore glory). It reappears in the final paragraph ("cascading revelations that would continue") charging the closure image with an ongoing process. Early signal, multi-beat pressure, and closure linkage present, though middle development leans thematic rather than decision-forcing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Incisively kind" appears three times: opening (after revealing the secret, expecting absolution/rage), midpoint ("pressed his incisively kind attention against the substrate, cutting not to wound but to illuminate, separating necrotic belief from healthy tissue"), and ending ("incisively kind, cutting through sediment of dogma"). The trait constrains method (cutting to illuminate vs. wounding) with a visible cost (slow, uncertain awakening rather than quick restoration). However, the trait is largely told rather than shown through embodied action; the cutting metaphor does most of the work. Present in closure but role is conceptual accent rather than enabling choice. Cap at mid-band for label-reliance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Threading the architect's memory through the garden's neural network is the central action: signaled early ("thread this memory through the garden's neural network of roots"), executed at midpoint ("thread the architect's ambivalence through the crack"), completed at closure ("memory propagated," "consciousness threading back"). The action is irreplaceable (no other verb captures the dual tactile/telepathic method) and drives all major turns (choosing the fissure, shattering the ampoule, projecting through the breach). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Structural weakness (hairline fissure in dome lattice) is introduced early ("eastern quadrant where the dome's lattice had developed a structural weakness centuries ago"), chosen as method over ceremony ("not through ceremony, but through the flaw"), and enacted at the climax ("thread the architect's ambivalence through the crack, letting the structural weakness serve as conduit"). The method's mechanics matter: the fissure allows memory propagation without collapse, and the final thematic payoff ("survival required the structural weakness, the fissure where change could enter") charges the closure. Early signal, causal enabling, and closure linkage all present; irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The underwater garden—hydrothermal current, anemones, kelp forest, glass dome, coral, bioluminescent plankton, silt—provides all setting anchors and pressure (three thousand years without sunlight, ocean pressure vs. city defiance, roots petrified in vertical certainty). It supplies the neural network substrate Corvin manipulates and the resources (vent, fissure) that enable the threading method. The garden's transformation (roots spiraling, dome breathing, plankton awakening, coral singing) is the closure effect. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal constraint, and closure shaping all present; irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "after revealing the secret" anchors the opening ("After revealing the secret—that the garden's caretakers had not ascended but drowned themselves in mercy—he had expected absolution or rage") and the ending ("The revelation had already happened—the secret exposed—but now came the harder work"). It sets up the stakes (what comes after the climax) and the motivation shift (from restoration to welcoming nuance). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; it functions as premise rather than tactical pressure. Early signal and closure reprise present, but no mid-scene constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The motivation—welcome nuance into certainty—is stated explicitly ("his motivation was not to restore the garden's former glory, but to welcome nuance into the certainty that had petrified it") and dramatized through the threading action (teaching roots gradient, spectrum, mercy with edges). It is conflicted (prismatic doubt, murderers/saviors paradox) and drives the choice to use the flaw rather than ceremony. The ending restates it thematically ("every absolute in the drowned city had dissolved") and the final image (Corvin waiting, receptors open) embodies endurance of this stance. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage present, though abstraction reduces embodied friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Animate lifeless" is established in the opening (living statue, coral screaming, hydrothermal current) and threaded throughout (granite heart, stone skin breathing, water remembering, dead architects speaking through poison flowers). The tone modulates: silence is "heavier than blackwater," coral shifts from screaming to "singing in a key that contained both major and minor," and the final image names the paradox directly ("animate lifelessness...no longer seemed paradoxical but honest"). The tone charges the closure by framing the garden's awakening as both alive and suspended. Early establishment, modulation under pressure, and closure charge all present; coherence strong.</comment>
