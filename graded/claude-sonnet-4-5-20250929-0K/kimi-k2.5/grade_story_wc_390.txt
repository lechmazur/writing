<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to protect the artifact is signaled early, but her interiority defaults to label-heavy abstractions ("logically emotional," "calculated soul") rather than embodied contradiction. The key choice—singing to dissolve the hunters—arrives without prior dramatized conflict between her engineering detachment and emotional depth; the duality is asserted, not enacted. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (trembling hands, racing pulse), but the climax substitutes therapeutic self-description for genuine struggle under pressure. The final collapse reads as ritual exhaustion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes who, where, and when within the opening lines, satisfying the orientation test. Causal linkage is present: Mara accidentally broadcasts a signal, hunters follow, she climbs the tower, discovers the slot, and sings to trigger sonic absolution. However, the key mechanism—hidden slot and harmonic forgiveness—is introduced only at the climax without prior setup or constraint, reading as a late rule change that solves a problem it did not help create. The closure effect (hunters dissolving into mist, forgiven by sound) lands on the page, but the cost—"shaking with the aftermath"—remains abstract and does not visibly alter Mara's options or foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina, fleeting sunset, and lighthouse are rendered with vivid sensory detail (azure coat, amber icebergs, fresnel lens catching light). Spatial choreography is clean: Mara moves from marina to lighthouse base to lantern room without confusion. The setting supplies the tower as a resource and the sunset as a time constraint, both affecting outcome. However, the crypt keeper's key and resonant chambers function more as symbolic props than as physical tools that constrain choice through tactile engagement; the hidden slot and vibrational matching mechanics lack the grounded specificity needed to charge the final image beyond the ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protect the sacred artifact from shadow hunters—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates as the hunters close in and Mara climbs the tower, narrowing her options to the lighthouse mechanism. However, the peak reversal (inserting the key, singing, triggering absolution) is enabled by a mechanism not previously established, weakening the sense that escalation is driven by protagonist agency under constraint. The hunters dissolve without visible cost to Mara beyond physical exhaustion; no trade-off or foreclosed path emerges to charge the resolution with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: the marriage of logic and emotion, engineering and soul, enables transformation rather than destruction. The key, lighthouse, and Mara's voice recur with shifting weight, and the final image ("engineering and soul, flesh and spirit intertwined") attempts resonance. However, the ending leans toward explicit theme statement ("sonic absolution," "harmonic forgiveness," "fleshly ethereal") rather than trusting the dramatized particulars. The phrase "saved by the marriage of engineering and soul" in the final paragraph reads as moralizing summary that replaces scene pressure, warranting a −0.6 deduction in Q5 per the penalty guidance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("fleshly ethereal," "liquify the air," "logarithmic calculation") that remains internally consistent. However, diction at peak beats drifts into abstraction ("sonic absolution," "harmonic forgiveness," "vibrational matching") that clashes with the embodied urgency of the chase, reading more as conceptual exposition than lived perception. Perceptual signature is present (engineer's focus on beam angles, blueprints, frequencies) but the voice at closure smooths into thesis rather than intensifying under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense ("breath crystallizing," "banner in the dying wind," "liquify the air") and occasionally effective, but several metaphors strain coherence: the key "vibrates with a frequency only she could feel thrumming against her palm like a second heartbeat" mixes tactile and auditory registers awkwardly. Template cadence appears in runs of identical stems ("She was," "She had," "She knew," "She sprinted") across adjacent sentences in the opening third, triggering a −0.4 deduction. Phrase loops recur: "logically emotional," "fleshly ethereal," "sacred artifact" repeat without added pressure. The closure beat ("saved by the marriage of engineering and soul, flesh and spirit intertwined") lands on abstract summary rather than propulsive image, dulling momentum. Combined artifacts trigger a −1.0 deduction in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse engineer uses sound to defeat spectral hunters—offers some freshness through the fusion of technical detail and mystical threat. However, the core structure (protagonist flees to tower, discovers hidden mechanism, activates it at the last moment) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "sonic absolution" concept and vibrational matching mechanics are asserted rather than earned through prior particulars, reading as late-introduced solutions. The phrase "sacred artifact" and "harmonic forgiveness" carry stock fantasy resonance without character-specific inflection, and the final image ("flesh and spirit intertwined in the silence") leans on generic dualities rather than a singular synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and makes decisions (sprint to tower, climb stairs, insert key, sing), but most choices are reactive escapes rather than trade-offs that narrow options. The key decision—to sing and trigger absolution—arrives without prior dramatized conflict between her engineering detachment and emotional depth, reading more as ritual fulfillment than a choice that alters tactics. She is introduced early (setup gate met), involved across beats (development gate met), and present at closure (payoff gate met), but her choices do not create the key turns; the mechanism does. Score: setup +0.5, beat involvement (two distinct beats) +0.9, closure linkage (present but not causally active) +0.3, swappability (any competent engineer could perform the action) −0.6, late causal pressure (final third only) −0.4. Total: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key is present from the opening ("clutched the crypt keeper's key") and handled in multiple beats: carried during the chase, grows warmer climbing the tower, inserted into the hidden slot at closure. It supplies the vibrational signature that attracts the hunters and unlocks the harmonic frequency. However, its purpose and mechanics are withheld until the climax, and the "hidden slot within the lighthouse mechanism" is introduced only when needed, weakening irreplaceability. Score: setup +0.7, beat involvement (three distinct beats) +1.4, causal pressure (enables the climax action) +1.0, closure linkage (inserted and activated at closure) +1.2, late first explanation (mechanics revealed in final third) −0.5, resolves a problem it did not help create (hidden slot) −1.0, swappability (any resonant artifact could substitute) −0.5. Total: 6.7, rounded to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is named explicitly at closure ("sonic absolution, a frequency that unmade the hunters") but its mechanics and stakes are withheld until the final beat, reading as a late-introduced solution rather than a concept that shapes tactics throughout. The term does not appear until the climax paragraph, missing the setup gate. Mara's voice and the lighthouse horn create the effect, but the concept itself does not constrain her earlier choices or alter tactics under pressure. Score: late first appearance (final third) −0.8, ornamental use (label without prior action pressure) −0.8, resolves a problem it did not help create −1.0, closure linkage (named and executed at closure) +0.7, beat involvement (one distinct beat) +0.4. Total: 3.2, rounded to 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is asserted in exposition ("She was logically emotional by nature, always building rigorous frameworks around her deepest feelings") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is mentioned once in the opening paragraph and again obliquely at closure ("calculated soul"), but Mara's choices do not dramatize the tension between logic and emotion; she simply performs both in sequence (calculates pitch, infuses memory). Score: late setup (mentioned but not demonstrated) −0.5, label-only (no on-page tradeoff) −1.0, ornamental use −0.8, closure linkage (echoed as "calculated soul" in final third) +0.3, swappability (any engineer with feeling could substitute) −0.6. Total: 2.4, rounded to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Adapt" appears in exposition ("She had to adapt her understanding of protection itself, moving beyond the static defenses she had always trusted") but the dramatized adaptation—inserting the key and singing—occurs only at closure and is enabled by a mechanism not previously established. The concept of adaptation does not shape earlier choices; Mara's tactics (sprint, climb) are straightforward escapes. The action is signaled early (setup gate met) and present at closure (payoff gate met), but lacks middle development where adaptation constrains a choice under pressure. Score: setup +0.5, beat involvement (one distinct beat at closure) +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (adaptation enables final act but via late rule) +0.3, swappability (any pivot or innovation could substitute) −0.6, development gate missing (no middle choice shaped by adaptation) −0.4, late causal work −0.3. Total: 5.1, rounded to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Vibrational matching is introduced and executed only at the climax ("vibrational matching between human voice and mechanical resonance," "Mara's voice and the mechanism created sonic absolution, a frequency that unmade the hunters"). The method is not signaled earlier; the key's vibration is mentioned in the opening, but the matching mechanic and its requirements appear for the first time in the final paragraph. It does not shape prior attempts or constrain tactics under pressure. Score: late first appearance (final third) −0.8, resolves a problem it did not help create −1.0, closure linkage (executed at closure) +1.2, beat involvement (one distinct beat) +0.4, ornamental use (mechanics appear only at resolution) −0.6, no middle development −0.4. Total: 3.8, capped at 3.8 due to swappability and late introduction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is established early with vivid detail (floating icebergs, amber sunset, frozen hulls, snow-dusted planks) and supplies spatial choreography for the chase. It provides the lighthouse as a resource and the shifting ice as an obstacle ("she could not outrun them across the shifting ice plates"). However, the ice itself does not alter tactics in a dramatized choice; Mara simply runs to the tower without navigating the stated danger. Score: setup +0.7, beat involvement (two distinct beats: chase, tower approach) +0.9, causal pressure (lighthouse as resource) +0.8, closure linkage (marina settles into darkness at closure, framing but not active) +0.4, specificity (drift-ice detail is vivid but the ice danger is declared, not enacted) +0.3, swappability (any isolated hazardous location could substitute) −0.5. Total: 5.6, rounded to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "fleeting golden sunset" is present in the opening and mentioned again at closure ("watching the last light vanish beyond the ice fields"), framing the action. The sunset is described as pausing ("seemed to pause in its descent as if watching her progress"), but this effect is metaphorical rather than a live clock that alters Mara's moves. Time pressure is asserted ("rapid descent beneath the horizon") but not tracked during the climb or song; the hunters' approach supplies urgency, not the sunset itself. Score: setup +0.7, beat involvement (opening and closing mentions) +0.4, closure linkage (final light vanishes at closure) +0.5, causal pressure (metaphorical pause, no tactical constraint) +0.1, swappability (any dusk or limited-time window could substitute) −0.6, no middle development (sunset not referenced during climb or song) −0.3. Total: 4.9, rounded to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to protect the sacred artifact is signaled early ("She was hunting the key," "maintain the boundary between the living harbor and the dead waters") and drives her choices throughout: she flees to the tower, climbs, and activates the mechanism to defend the artifact. The artifact is described as maintaining a boundary, but the stakes—what happens if the hunters take it—are implied rather than dramatized, reducing friction between want and cost. The resolution (dissolving the hunters) fulfills the goal without visible trade-off; Mara collapses with exhaustion but retains the artifact and the harbor is saved. Score: setup +0.7, beat involvement (three distinct beats: flee, climb, sing) +1.4, causal pressure (drives all major choices) +1.2, closure linkage (goal achieved at closure) +1.0, specificity (sacred artifact is named but its unique properties are vague) +0.3, cost connection (exhaustion is present but no path foreclosed) +0.2, swappability (any valuable object could substitute) −0.6, friction (want vs. cost is asserted but not dramatized) −0.4. Total: 6.3, rounded to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" is articulated in exposition ("The fleshly ethereal nature of the moment surrounded her completely—the physical burn in her lungs, the spiritual weight of the artifact") and echoed at closure ("flesh and spirit intertwined in the silence"). The tone attempts to fuse visceral detail (breath crystallizing, boots crunching, lungs burning) with mystical language (spectral, sacred artifact, harmonic forgiveness). However, the balance tilts toward abstraction in peak beats, and the final image defaults to thesis statement rather than embodied sensation, flattening the dual register. Score: setup +0.5, beat involvement (tone sustained across opening, middle, closure) +0.9, closure linkage (echoed explicitly at closure) +0.7, coherence (tone is consistent but leans abstract under pressure) +0.3, modulation (tone does not shift meaningfully with escalation) −0.2, charges final image (final line is thematic summary, not sensory charge) −0.3. Total: 5.7, rounded to 5.7.</comment>
