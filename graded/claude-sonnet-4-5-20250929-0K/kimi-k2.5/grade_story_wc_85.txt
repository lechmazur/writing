<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his backstory is efficiently woven through present action (examining the watch, arranging carvings). The interiority leans toward philosophical summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—"tempered regret settling into his bones" tells more than it dramatizes. The final choice to find the daughter tomorrow is stated as intention rather than enacted with visible cost on the page. Emotional embodiment remains cerebral; the watch "somehow accusing" and sitting "under the weight of unspoken words" trend abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece opens with strong orientation (terrace, Elias, watch hand at 4:17) and establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: Elias arranges the carvings in order and commits to finding the daughter, crystallizing his stance with the cost of bearing witness after twenty years of erasure. The Drive Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the driftwood chronology and the watch hand becomes the punctuation mark. One minor causality gap: "He had come to this cobalt terrace at dusk because the father had died last spring" introduces backstory motivation but the on-page trigger for tonight specifically is not dramatized, only the general search over three weeks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace at dusk is vividly rendered with "dying light in shades of deepening blue" and "churning sea," and the setting charges the final image when Elias arranges the gallery "across the cobalt slate" as stars emerge. The driftwood carvings function as micro-setting objects that constrain his search and enable the closure choice. Spatial choreography is clean throughout: kneeling, moving through piles, sitting on cold stone. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elias's guilt-driven attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias discovering "the weight of a withheld truth"—is signaled early and drives the search through driftwood. Pressure accumulates as he finds each carving, culminating in the final piece showing the woman with her own child, which confirms the unbroken lineage despite his erasure. The decision to find the daughter tomorrow and offer the carvings is stated as intention rather than enacted choice with visible immediate cost; the weight is measured but not yet paid on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the final carving completes the chronology and forces his witness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: manufactured genealogies versus salt-bleached truth, silence as both erasure and love. The watch hand marking 4:17 and the driftwood progression create a resonant answer to "how heavy was a life unlived?" without stating a moral. Minor slip: "Here, under the weight of unspoken words that had finally found their shape in wood and time, Elias understood the specific gravity of his crimes" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the arranged carvings speak. The final gallery image reweights prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with Elias throughout. Narrative distance is controlled and the perceptual signature is consistent—notice "sieved hush" and "tempered regret," which feel slightly elevated but remain within a reflective genealogist's register. Minor register drift: "specific gravity" and "tempered regret" lean academic in a peak moment. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains close and purposeful. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately with the accumulative pressure, slowing for the gallery arrangement at the end.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout with mixed success: "sky bruised into night," "sieved hush," "tempered regret," "specific gravity" cluster in rapid succession and occasionally compete for attention rather than layering cleanly. Two instances of paraphrase: "He could not quell the past—could not undo the forged certificates" restates in immediate succession. Sentence openings vary well and information density is strong. The watch hand "seemed to pulse" and "somehow accusing" hedge with filter verbs where directness would sharpen. No major loops or template cadence, but the metaphor load in the final third slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The black market genealogist premise offers a fresh occupational angle, and the driftwood carvings as counter-archive to forged documents create a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The transformation test holds: swap names and the arc remains generic penance-through-witness. The emotional territory—guilt, bearing witness, offering proof of love—feels familiar but is grounded in particular details (watch hand at 4:17, year-by-year carvings, cobalt terrace). Risk-taking is moderate; the structure and emotional arc follow a recognizable redemption contour without bold formal choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his past as a black market genealogist frames the entire story. His on-page choices—examining the watch, sifting driftwood, arranging the gallery, deciding to find the daughter—drive all beats and the closure. The occupation is causally essential: without his having erased the daughter, there is no withheld truth to discover. The final decision to offer the carvings flows directly from his genealogist's understanding of archives and legitimacy. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage, and high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in three distinct beats: opening (Elias examines it, 4:17 marking the erasure moment), middle ("seemed to pulse in his pocket, its stopped mechanism somehow accusing"), and ending (placed at the end of the gallery row as "punctuation mark"). It is handled on the page and returns with reweighted meaning—from artifact of crime to memorial marker. The mechanics are specified (gilt, minute hand, frozen at 4:17) and the object's symbolic function is clear. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" appears twice: "performing a sieved hush—a ritual of listening to what silence had filtered and preserved" and "The sieved hush deepened as waves crashed below." The concept is thematically present (silence filtering truth, wood preserving what documents denied) but does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—Elias's search method is sifting driftwood, not performing silence. The phrase reads as lyric ornament rather than a constraint that alters his choices. Present and coherent with theme, but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's work manufacturing false memories is established early ("crafting meticulous archives that rewrote abandonment as noble sacrifice") and is the root cause of the story's conflict: he erased a daughter to satisfy a client. The attribute constrains the present action—he searches for driftwood because his forged certificates severed the official lineage. The cost is visible: twenty years of reputation built on erasure, now confronted. The trait enables his understanding of what he stole and shapes his decision to offer proof. Setup, middle pressure, and closure linkage are all present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Quell" appears once in a key line: "He could not quell the past—could not undo the forged certificates." It articulates his limitation and frames the turn from erasure to witness. However, the action is negated (he cannot quell) rather than performed, and the verb does not recur or shape tactics elsewhere. The line is thematically resonant but structurally replaceable—"undo," "erase," or "reverse" would serve the same function with minor edits. Present in one beat, conceptually linked to closure theme, but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is signaled early ("spent three weeks searching") and occupies the narrative present: "Elias moved through the piles of weathered sculptures, sifting through the driftwood carvings with trembling fingers, seeking the final piece." The method is dramatized on the page with physical cost ("hands raw from salt and splinters") and the mechanics matter—year-by-year chronology must be assembled. The search yields the final carving that completes the lineage and enables the closure decision. Setup, development (raw hands, "performing a sieved hush"), and payoff (gallery arrangement) are all present. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace at dusk is established in the opening line and anchors every beat: Elias kneels on it, sits on "the cold stone," and arranges the carvings "across the cobalt slate." The setting provides the physical stage for the gallery and charges the final image as "the first stars emerged" and "dusk settled completely." Time pressure is implicit (dusk advancing to night) and the terrace's isolation supports the reflective tone. The environment does not constrain choices mechanically, but the "precipice" framing and cold stone embodiment shape the emotional weight. Strong setup, presence across beats, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Under the weight of unspoken words" appears in the title-like framing and recurs in the penultimate paragraph. The timeframe is thematic rather than mechanical—unspoken words as accumulated pressure over twenty years and the father's lifetime, now materialized in wood. Dusk provides a live clock that tightens the present scene (light dying, stars emerging, "dusk settled completely"), but the phrase itself does not track tactical decisions. It frames tone and stakes effectively but does not alter moves on the page. Lyric seed-and-reprise structure; thematic presence without causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—"to discover the weight of a withheld truth"—is stated explicitly and dramatized through the search for the final carving and the act of arranging the gallery to "measure the mass of what he had stolen." The desire drives all on-page action and is conflicted: "not redemption—he was too honest for that fantasy." The friction between wanting to measure the weight and knowing he cannot repay it generates the closure choice to bear witness. Setup (explicit statement), development (questions "How heavy was a life unlived?"), and payoff (arranging the gallery, deciding to find the daughter) are present. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tempered regret is established early ("tempered regret settling into his bones like the evening chill") and modulates coherently through the narrative: guilt without self-pity, witness without redemption fantasy. The tone charges the final image—arranging the gallery quietly, "counting the weight," "hoping it would be enough to anchor him." No melodrama or false catharsis; the ending remains restrained and elegiac. The tone is consistent under pressure and supports the accumulative lens. Strong coherence and closure linkage, though "tempered" leans slightly academic in register for peak emotional beats.</comment>
