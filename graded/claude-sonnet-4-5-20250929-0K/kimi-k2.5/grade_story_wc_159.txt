<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The caretaker exhibits consistent motivation and her core action (using the cracked tube) shows purposeful agency. However, interiority remains abstract—phrases like "foxglove regret" and "cloud-mist carpeting" feel ornamental rather than character-specific. The final choice is signaled but lacks contradictory impulses in the moment; she proceeds methodically without visible internal friction. Embodied emotion is minimal; we're told about regret but don't see it complicate a single micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (who, where, what). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the caretaker's ritual tending → discovery of the tube → lighting the orchids → return to waiting. Closure reads as Charged Poise: she returns to her station knowing entropy will resume, the cost felt in the crumbled tube and temporary illumination. The cost is legible but quiet; the deepening is present but the stakes never tighten into a narrower dilemma, keeping the band mid-range.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The Opal Library is vividly rendered with purposeful specifics: cloud-mist floors, prismatic shelves, glass orchids suspended in geometric precision. The cracked bamboo tube functions as micro-setting, constraining the choice (its imperfection is the lens for sonic illumination) and charging the final image when it crumbles. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the caretaker's professional priorities. Spatial choreography (spiral staircase, central atrium, lower levels) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the names before they dissolve. The discovery of the cracked tube and its use at the atrium constitute one meaningful tightening, but the caretaker never faces a trade-off or genuine obstacle—her choice unfolds without friction. The cost (tube crumbles, light is temporary) is visible but arrives as consequence rather than dilemma. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but gentle; no live option is foreclosed by her decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: preservation, imperfection as utility, temporary beauty against entropy. The "foxglove regret" motif attempts to carry emotional weight but leans toward decorative abstraction rather than earned insight. The final image of the caretaker waiting for "the next cracked instrument" offers resonance without overt moralizing, and the cost (beautiful poison, isolation) is felt. However, the piece hovers near thematic assertion ("beautiful, necessary, and quietly fatal") rather than letting the image speak alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent distance. Perceptual signature is present ("cloud-mist," "crystalline geometry") but drifts toward elevated diction that doesn't feel character-specific under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the narrative stance is coherent. However, register occasionally slips into ornamental lyricism ("the air tasted of violet nostalgia and rusted triumph") that reads more authorial than filtered through the caretaker's working mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "cloud-mist," "frozen moonlight," "violet nostalgia," "rusted triumph," "foxglove regret" stack without functional payoff. Sentence openings show some variety, though "She [verb]" recurs frequently in the second half. Minor paraphrase loops appear ("gently systematic" echoed, "deserted marvels" repeated). The final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes the caretaker's return, flattening momentum. Template cadence is noticeable in the middle third ("She walked… She understood… She climbed… She positioned… She tapped").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—library of extinct feelings tended by a solitary caretaker—offers a fresh synthesis of archive-keeper and emotional archaeology. The cracked tube as imperfection-made-lens is a specific, non-obvious turn. However, execution leans on stock museum-of-memory imagery and the protagonist's solitary devotion follows familiar archivist/curator templates. The foxglove-regret metaphor feels borrowed rather than earned. The piece commits to its premise but doesn't transform it through lived detail or unexpected moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The caretaker's discovery of the tube and decision to use it drive the central action. She appears in all three beats: tending, discovering, activating the tube at the atrium. Her choice to strike the tube is the story's hinge. Cost is tied to her role (the tube crumbles, she returns to waiting). Setup early, middle involvement (discovery/understanding), payoff at the atrium and return. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; however, the choice unfolds without visible friction or trade-off, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube is discovered in the western annex, examined for its melody, and used at the atrium to create light. Three distinct beats: discovery, listening, activation. Its crack is the functional property that refracts sound into illumination—irreplaceable specificity. It crumbles at the end, sealing the temporary victory with visible cost. Setup by midpoint, middle use (examination/realization), payoff (activation and destruction). Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection. Swappability is low; the crack's imperfection is mechanically essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" appears as description and thematic echo (shelves of obsolete joy, extinct feelings) but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The concept frames atmosphere but remains ornamental; the caretaker's task would function identically if the library held living knowledge. No middle choice is gated by the desertedness; the temporary lighting doesn't depend on the marvels being deserted. Present throughout but replaceable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is attributed twice in nearly identical phrasing ("work was gently systematic," "gently systematic arrangement"). It describes her method but doesn't constrain an action or force a trade-off. The trait could be "methodical" or "meticulous" with no change to the beat structure. Label-only mention without visible cost or enabled tactic. Present early and echoed at closure, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lighting is the story's climax: the caretaker strikes the tube, sound refracts into illumination, the glass orchids ignite, names awaken. The action transforms the situation and delivers the story's peak image. Setup (failed illumination mentioned early), middle realization (the tube can transmute sound), payoff (the lighting itself and its aftermath). Strong causal pressure, closure participation, and cost (tube crumbles, light is temporary). Irreplaceable; swapping "illuminate" for "awaken" or "restore" would require rewriting the tube's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The echo of the song is discovered mid-story when the caretaker listens to the tube, its harmonic frequency matches the orchids, and it becomes the method for lighting them. Two distinct beats: discovery/listening and activation at the atrium. The "long-forgotten" quality and harmonic match are mechanically necessary. Setup in the western annex discovery, middle realization (matches the orchids), payoff (spills out to create light). Strong causal role and closure linkage. Cost is indirect (the song ends forever when the tube crumbles).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Opal Library is established early and provides resources: the spiral staircase to the atrium, the opal railing (struck to activate the tube), the suspended orchids, and the cloud floors. The setting supplies the mechanics for the climax (atrium as central point, railing as resonator). Three gates met: setup (opening paragraphs), middle (western annex yields the tube), payoff (atrium scene). The "above clouds" detail is scenic but the opal railing's acoustic properties enable the key action. Causal pressure and closure linkage are solid; irreplaceability is moderate (another resonant surface could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" is descriptive rather than temporal. No ticking clock or time pressure shapes decisions. The caretaker moves "today" but duration is vague; we're told illumination failed "decades ago" and the tube will "eventually" splinter, but no urgent deadline alters her tactics. The phrase appears as atmospheric descriptor, not a constraint. Present as theme, absent as escalation device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Preservation of forgotten names is stated early ("Her motivation had not wavered") and drives the climactic action: she uses the tube to light the orchids so the names persist longer. Two beats: the opening declaration and the atrium activation. The cost (knowing the solution is temporary, "foxglove regret") is felt but not deeply dramatized in a choice with friction. Setup clear, middle implicit (discovery of the means), payoff (lighting the names). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but the desire is told more than it's tested by conflicting wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Foxglove regret—"exquisite sorrow of knowing this beauty was temporary and slightly poisonous"—is named twice and meant to suffuse the ending. Tone is melancholic and elegiac throughout, coherent with the stakes. However, the phrase feels imported rather than embodied; the caretaker's actions don't modulate with regret (she proceeds without hesitation). The final image carries the intended tone, but "foxglove" as metaphor is decorative. Setup (named mid-story), weak middle presence (actions are calm, not regret-tinged), payoff (lingers in closing lines). Functional but label-reliant.</comment>
