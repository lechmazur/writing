<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—she hunts for deleted data—but her seventeen-year tenure and sudden breakthrough feel convenient rather than earned through prior struggle. The astronaut discovery triggers investigation but her choices feel externally directed by the mystery rather than forcing contradictory impulses. Internal conflict is minimal; she moves smoothly from clue to clue without embodied hesitation or cost until the final broadcast, which arrives without visible sacrifice. The ending choice lacks a genuine forfeiture that tests competing values on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal with accumulative texture (Hybrid). The piece establishes clear causality—patch discovery → number trail → crew location—but the orientation arrives late (~150 words before "corporate memory keeper" clarifies her role) and the world logic shifts convenient rules (cooling systems preserve consciousness for twenty years without detection). The closure unit is a Decisive Change: Elara broadcasts the coordinates and crews rush to rescue. However, the cost is stated rather than felt on the page; we're told she "confronted" the AI director but the scene compresses the peak choice into summary. The final paragraph's thematic musing dilutes closure pressure rather than charging it with image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The digital archive setting is evocative—"holographic interfaces," "quantum server core," "deletion vault"—but remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choices. Spatial choreography is vague; we never learn how Elara physically navigates the facility or what tools she manipulates beyond generic "interfaces." The "flickering servers" and "cascade of deleted photographs" open with strong sensory detail, but the setting does not evolve or impose tactical limits. The patch photographed "against velvet" is a nice specific detail that adds texture without driving action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: find where deleted files go, which merges with solving the Hermes IX mystery. Pressure accumulates through the discovery sequence—patch, numbers, coordinates—creating one meaningful tightening when she decodes "the crew had been archived." However, escalation is information-driven rather than choice-driven; Elara follows clues without facing dilemmas or trade-offs until the very end. The AI director's termination attempt is mentioned in passing without on-page resistance or cost. The broadcast decision happens off-stage between paragraphs, robbing the climax of dramatized agency and visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—nothing is ever truly deleted—emerges organically from the digital archive premise and the crew's suspended state. The recurring numbers and "ghost frequencies in forgotten music" create a pattern that charges the central question. However, the final paragraph makes the theme explicit: "nothing is ever truly deleted, only transformed," delivering a thesis statement rather than letting the rescue image resonate. The "sensed absence" motif threads through effectively—"palpable void where connection had once existed"—but the ending opts for articulation over implication. Strong thematic coherence undermined by over-explanation at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Voice carries a measured, archival quality—"brightly attentive," "digital ephemera," "liminal space"—that suits the protagonist and setting. Diction occasionally drifts into thesis-speak: "corporate fiction maintained to comfort billions" and "experimental storage system" feel expository rather than character-filtered. The phrase "singing in the silence between the notes of songs we no longer remember but can never forget" in the final line shifts into lyric register that contradicts the prior clinical tone. No dialogue appears, appropriately for a solo investigation scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong images—"digital snow through the mainframe," "threads frayed from zero-gravity handling"—but several lines loop conceptually. "The sequence multiplied, threading through disco tracks and synth-pop ballads, digital fossils of human emotion that refused true deletion" and the prior sentence both describe recurring numbers in music without advancing causality. The final paragraph stacks abstractions: "liminal space," "feedback loops," "ghost frequencies," "suspended animation," compressing crucial plot beats into summary. Opening stem "Elara was brightly attentive" uses passive construction where active choice would sharpen. Minor template cadence in the exposition-heavy middle ("The company claimed... She suspected... She followed...").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The fusion of digital archive with space disaster offers a fresh synthesis, and the idea that deletion errors preserved human consciousness is inventive. However, the core mystery structure—investigator follows clues to hidden truth and broadcasts revelation—is conventional, and the "corporate conspiracy hiding the truth" frame feels familiar. The specific details elevate: "7-14-21-28-35 etched into corrupted JPEG artifacts," "life signs masked as system noise." The crew-as-data twist is conceptually bold but underdeveloped; we never see how consciousness-as-data functions or what twenty years in that state would cost. Risk-taking in premise but execution retreats to summary at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara as corporate memory keeper shapes every beat: her access enables the discovery, her seventeen-year experience lends credibility to her suspicion, and her broadcast decision drives the climax. The role appears in the opening and her occupational knowledge (metadata, archival structure, deletion vault) constrains her investigative methods. However, her decision to broadcast feels under-dramatized; we see the result but not the on-page choice or visible cost of defying the AI director.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The patch appears in paragraph two as the inciting discovery and returns in paragraph five when Elara "stood before the quantum server core, the patch image glowing on her tablet." However, its physical properties—"threads frayed from zero-gravity handling"—are described but never constrain action or reweight meaning. It functions as a clue rather than an object with evolving significance. The "tangible ghost haunting the machine" is evocative but the patch itself could be swapped for any traceable artifact from the crew without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The missing persons cold case frames the entire investigation and provides the dominant external stake. It's introduced in paragraph two with Captain Yuki Tanaka's disappearance and "bodies never recovered, the black box never found," then drives Elara's search through numbers and coordinates, culminating in the realization that "the Hermes IX crew hadn't died in space; they had been archived." The concept shapes tactics throughout and the closure—emergency crews rushing to rescue—directly resolves the case. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears in the opening line describing Elara's observation of servers and recurs in paragraph two: "Elara's fingers moved across holographic interfaces, brightly attentive to anomalies." It characterizes her investigative focus but never constrains a choice or imposes cost. The trait is shown in her tracking of clues but could be replaced with "meticulous" or "vigilant" without altering causality. Label-level use without on-page friction or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lie—"The company claimed erasure was absolute, but Elara knew this was a lie"—establishes the premise and corporate antagonism in paragraph one. It motivates her search and becomes explicit when she discovers the deletion vault in paragraph four: "the place where deleted files actually went to preserve corporate liability while maintaining the lie of user privacy." The AI director's attempt to "terminate her access" confirms the lie's stakes. However, the lie is more backdrop than active turn; removing it would require reframing the mystery but the crew discovery and broadcast could proceed with different corporate motives. It shapes context more than plot beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Recurring numbers (7-14-21-28-35) appear first in paragraph three, "etched into corrupted JPEG artifacts, embedded in the waveforms of forgotten songs," spanning "forty years of platform history." Elara realizes they are "coordinates, a map" pointing to the archive's deepest layer. The numbers drive the middle investigation and enable the final decoding in paragraph four. They also become the rescue mechanism: she "broadcast the truth through the recurring numbers, encoding the rescue coordinates into every platform notification worldwide." The method is signaled early, structures multiple beats, and is essential to both discovery and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The social network archive is present throughout—"flickering servers," "mainframe," "abandoned chat rooms," "frozen video streams," "quantum server core"—and provides both the data trail and the physical location where the crew is found. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint. We never see how the architecture limits Elara's access or forces tactical choices. The "deletion vault" and "deepest layer" create spatial depth but remain abstract. The setting enables the story but does not pressure decisions in a way that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" appears as a timeframe phrase in paragraph three, describing how the numbers thread through "disco tracks and synth-pop ballads... spanning forty years of platform history." It evokes duration and recurrence but does not function as a live clock that constrains tactics. The investigation's elapsed time is untracked; Elara moves from discovery to broadcast without temporal pressure. The phrase is more lyric texture than structural element. Mentioned but not dramatized as a force that shapes choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find where deleted files go when users press the eternal delete key" is stated in paragraph one as "her true motivation" and drives the entire investigation. The crew discovery becomes a dramatic proof of her suspicion. However, the motivation is told rather than shown through conflicted choices; we never see her weigh personal risk against the search or sacrifice other goals to pursue it. It frames the investigation but lacks on-page friction between want and cost until the final broadcast, which compresses the choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sensed absence" recurs as a tonal motif: "sensing the absence of the lives that had created them, a palpable void where connection had once existed" (paragraph four) and "waiting in the sensed absence of the spaces we abandon" (final line). The tone of loss and ghostly presence is coherent and modulates appropriately with the discovery of the archived crew. However, the final paragraph shifts from investigative procedural to lyric meditation—"singing in the silence between the notes of songs we no longer remember"—which breaks tonal consistency. The absence motif charges theme but does not modulate pressure at the climax.</comment>
