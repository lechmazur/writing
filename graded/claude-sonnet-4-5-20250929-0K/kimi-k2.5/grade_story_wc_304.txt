<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated clearly ("to capture one last spark before oblivion") but her internal contradiction is thin—she operates with calm competence throughout, never wavering or doubting her ritual. The dancer remains inert; no second character appears to test Elara's stance. Her final act of archiving the chip reads as routine execution rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost, leaving characterization functional but one-note.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first two paragraphs; no penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers sensory detail and repeats the chip/aurora/soul-preservation motif to build density. Closure occurs when Elara places the chip into the archive and prepares for the next arrival, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—her refusal to cease her vigil forecloses rest. Cost is conceptual (eternal labor) but legible in "forever standing watch," satisfying the closure gate. One meaningful deepening (the chip absorbs the dancer's pattern) tightens the premise. However, no on-page reversal or tactical shift narrows options; the process unfolds as described from the outset, capping upside.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto, aurora, and quartz walls are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frosting breath, ionized shimmer, crystal hum). The emerald chip functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's method (she can only use this one tool). The grotto's inaccessibility ("by airship or faith") and the archive of chips in niches charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test. Minor deduction: the dancer's body and the worktable receive generic treatment; spatial choreography of Elara's movements (arranging hair, pressing the chip) lacks tactile specificity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the dancer's spark before neural cascade ends. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the threshold of stillness approached" and Elara must complete the capture. Agency is present (Elara's decision to press the chip, to archive it), but no live option is foreclosed—she always intended this outcome, and no complication forces a trade-off. The cost (eternal repetition) is visible in the final line but does not narrow prior tactics. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but does not escalate through reversal, fitting mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: the tension between entropy and preservation, the question of whether pattern suffices for selfhood. The emerald chip and aurora motifs recur with shifting weight—initial tool, then repository, finally one among hundreds, reweighting Elara's singular act into an endless archive. The final image ("forever standing watch") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "nothing truly beautiful was ever lost to the dark" in the closing line edges toward thematic summary, though it remains tied to Elara's enacted stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent (physics-aware, detail-oriented, reverent). Diction ("lucidly watchful," "radiant hush," "snowstorm of dying synapses") is elevated but character-apt for a technician-mystic. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Psychic distance holds. One brief strain: "the architecture of self rendered into mineral permanence" reads slightly expository mid-scene, but voice recovers immediately. Sentence rhythm modulates cleanly between contemplative passages and the active chip-pressing beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density ("cathedral of quartz and silence," "electromagnetic whispers of memory and dream"). No loops or scaffold. Minor density issue: "the dancer's final moments—a pirouette, a mother's face, the scent of rain on warm stone" lists memory fragments rather than dramatizing their capture; summary-only use of a key beat. Figurative language is controlled (aurora as "jade and violet silk," chip as "green net") with no mixed metaphors. One stock phrase: "forever standing watch" is serviceable but not fresh.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The beautician-mortician role and skyborne soul-archive premise offer a fresh synthesis; the emerald meteor-chip as memory storage is specific and non-obvious. The aurora-as-departing-souls concept and the ritual of "infusing" the corpse transform mortuary work into metaphysical practice. However, the emotional arc (solitary technician performs eternal duty) is familiar; no turn surprises or complicates Elara's conviction. The "preserving souls in crystals" motif echoes speculative-fiction templates without a sharp, lived-detail transformation. Risk-taking is present (lyric accumulation, no external antagonist) but the ending's inevitability from line one limits ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara (beautician mortician) is present throughout and her choices drive the middle beat (pressing the chip) and the ending (archiving, preparing for the next). She shapes two beats and the closure, but her decisions are procedural rather than pressured—no live dilemma forces a trade-off. Swappable with "soul collector" or "memory archivist" with minor edits; the beautician detail (arranging hair) appears once without altering outcome. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; development is weak. Base ~5.0 + beat involvement +0.9 + closure linkage +0.7 − swappability −0.4 − ornamental beautician detail −0.5 = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The emerald chip appears early (paragraph 6), is handled in the capture beat (pressing to temple, absorbing frequency), and charged in the ending (placed in archive, pulsing with aurora). Three beats; irreplaceable (meteor origin, lattice structure unique to the premise). Causally essential: without it, Elara cannot preserve the spark. Setup, development, payoff all met. Base ~5.0 + early signal +0.6 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.2 + closure linkage +1.0 + specificity +0.6 − (no visible cost tied directly to the chip itself, only to Elara's labor) −0.7 = 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Threshold of stillness" is introduced early ("that infinitesimal moment when consciousness dissolves"), recurs at the climax ("the threshold of stillness approached"), and shapes Elara's urgency—she must act before the neural cascade ends. The concept constrains her timing and charges the ending's meaning (standing watch at "the boundary between motion and rest"). Setup, development, payoff met. Base ~5.0 + early signal +0.7 + two beats +0.9 + causal pressure +0.9 + closure linkage +1.2 + irreplaceability +0.5 − (late explicit reprise could be tighter) −0.2 − (conceptual cost is oblique) −0.7 = 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" is named once in paragraph 5 and echoed in "forever standing watch" at the end. No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait; Elara's vigilance is described, not tested. Lyric seed-to-reprise is present but does not reweight a choice. Setup and payoff met; development absent (cap 3.4 waived for lyric mode). Base ~3.0 + early signal +0.4 + closure echo +0.5 + thematic fit +0.3 − label-only (no tradeoff or cost) −0.8 − swappable with "attentive" −0.6 = 4.8, rounded to nearest tenth per rules but constrained by absence of middle use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Infuse" is stated as Elara's method ("infusing the corpse with intention") and enacted in the combing/chip-pressing sequence. It shapes one major beat (the capture) and the ending's thematic charge (pattern infused into lattice). Setup, development, payoff met. Base ~5.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + causal pressure +0.8 + closure linkage +0.9 − swappable with "imprint" or "transfer" with minor edits −0.6 − (verb's mechanics remain abstract; no tactile cost shown) −1.1 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is introduced early ("learning the method of finding patterns in static, reading the snowstorm of dying synapses"), drives the middle beat (parsing aurora randomness into "constellation of thought"), and charges the ending (emerald pulses in rhythm with aurora). Mechanics matter: Elara's skill is what allows capture. Three beats; irreplaceable. Setup, development, payoff met. Base ~5.0 + early signal +0.8 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.5 + closure linkage +1.0 + specificity +0.7 − (no visible failure or cost tied to the method's difficulty) −0.8 − (reader never sees her struggle or adjust technique) −1.0 = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto is anchored early (paragraph 2), its inaccessibility ("by airship or faith") and the aurora overhead supply Elara's raw material (souls departing as light), and the archive niches charge the ending. The setting is causally essential: ground-level would break the premise. Three beats; irreplaceable. Setup, development, payoff met. Base ~5.0 + early signal +0.8 + three beats +1.4 + causal pressure +1.6 + closure linkage +1.3 + specificity +0.8 − (postcard lyricism in places) −0.4 − (no micro-setting constraint on Elara's movement) −1.6 = 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To capture one last spark before oblivion" is stated in paragraph 9, dramatized in the chip-pressing beat, and echoed in the archive ending. The motivation is present in three beats and shapes Elara's entire ritual. Setup (late, second third; −0.4), development, payoff met. Base ~5.0 + two-beat involvement +0.9 + causal pressure +1.2 + closure linkage +1.0 + irreplaceability +0.6 − late signal −0.4 − no conflicting want or fear −1.2 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is named in paragraph 12 and paragraph 19, modulates with pressure (quiet opening, shimmer during capture, "silent dance" at end), and charges the final image ("indifferent and beautiful"). Tone is coherent across turns and irreplaceable to the piece's atmosphere. Setup (mid-scene), development, payoff met. Base ~5.0 + early-enough signal +0.5 + three tonal beats +1.4 + closure linkage +1.6 + specificity +0.7 − (phrase itself is stock poetic) −0.4 − (static mood; no tonal friction or shift under stress) −0.5 = 8.3.</comment>
