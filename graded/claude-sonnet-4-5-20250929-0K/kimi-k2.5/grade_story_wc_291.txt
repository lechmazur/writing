<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's prosopagnosia and methodical nature are established, but her internal contradiction remains largely told rather than dramatized in scene pressure. The "cold case had frozen her heart" and subsequent thawing are asserted through summary rather than shown through specific choices under stress. The final realization that she "felt the weight of the face...as living, breathing anguish" arrives as a label rather than an embodied shift with visible cost. Her investigative choices proceed linearly without meaningful internal friction or trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the quarry setting, ribbon fragment, and portrait work build toward a final reweighting. Closure arrives when Elara discovers the ribbon matches the rival's jacket lining and "the case warmed under her hands," which constitutes a Conceptual Repricing—the cold case is reconfigured as emotionally felt. However, the cost is asserted ("mirrored her own isolation") rather than demonstrated through a specific forfeiture or choice. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (Elara, quarry rim, present investigation anchored by ~80 words). One small causality slip: the "conspiracy that had festered in darkness" and the silent witness emerge without prior setup, reading as convenient rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quarry is vividly rendered—"wet shale that glittered like broken glass," "furrowed hush," mist thickening "in the bowl of the earth"—and the setting clearly constrains Elara's work (portable easel, charcoal smudging in humidity). The limestone and black pool recur to anchor the investigation spatially. The environment directly enables the closure: holding the ribbon "against the gray limestone" while sketching produces the pattern that breaks the case. Micro-setting (the ribbon, easel, charcoal) functions as active constraint and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solving the heiress's disappearance—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Elara's descent into the quarry and methodical cross-referencing provide a single meaningful tightening when she discovers the ribbon's true source. However, the escalation is largely internal (awakening empathy) and asserted rather than tested through on-page choices with visible trade-offs. The rival's guilt and the silent witness emerge late without prior complication, reading as a revelation delivered rather than a pressure point Elara must navigate with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: the mask versus face beneath, methodical detachment versus empathy, blindness versus vision. The quarry as "a place of violent extraction" now serving "restoration" is apt but borders on overt metaphor. The final image—Elara feeling "the weight of the face...as living, breathing anguish that mirrored her own isolation"—reweights the cold case as emotionally lived, achieving Conceptual Repricing. However, the thematic work is often stated ("to solve this, she must work by unifying opposites") rather than enacted through scene particulars, and the "cold case warmed" metaphor in the final paragraph edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with strong diction ("geological wound," "lance the abscess of silence"). Perceptual signature is present: Elara's scientific method and neurological blindness filter her observations. Register occasionally inflates beyond immediate scene need ("taxonomy of contradictions," "penetration of emotional barriers"), though it remains mostly consistent with an educated investigator's internal voice. No dialogue is present to test character distinction. The prose modulates appropriately at the climax ("her breath shallow"), maintaining voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and imagery is vivid, but overwriting appears in clusters: "memory refusing to dissipate," "the persistent fog that clung to the limestone walls like memory," and "abscess of silence that had protected the powerful" stack metaphors without clear advancement. Several template cadences: "she removed," "she descended," "she set up," "she let," "she worked." The phrase "years had passed since the masquerade ball when the heiress vanished into this geological wound, and now, long after the evidence disappears from police vaults and witness memories decayed into static" mixes tenses awkwardly (past perfect → present → past). Filter-verb runs ("she understood that to solve this," "she could not visualize") in reflective passages dull immediacy. The closure image is clean but the path to it carries moderate line-level drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist solving a cold case through forensic art offers a fresh premise with inherent dramatic irony. However, the execution leans on familiar investigator-at-scene beats and the climactic discovery (ribbon matches rival's jacket lining) arrives without meaningful transformation of prior material—it reads as a convenient reveal rather than an inevitable synthesis. The "unifying opposites" method is declared but not dramatized through specific choices that complicate her approach. The emotional arc (thawing empathy) follows a predictable template without bold risk or resistance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her prosopagnosia frames the investigation, but her face blindness does not constrain or enable key on-page choices with visible cost. She observes, descends, sketches, and discovers—decisions that could belong to any investigator. The trait is setup and thematic coloring but does not drive a turn or force a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment is signaled early (evidence bag, paragraph 2), handled physically ("Holding the ribbon fragment against the gray limestone"), and returned at closure when its weave reveals the rival's jacket lining. It appears in at least three beats: initial examination, placement against limestone, and the microscopic match that breaks the case. The object is causally active and shapes the ending, though the discovery feels convenient rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The cold case is present as the investigation's frame ("long after the evidence disappears") and motivates Elara's quarry visit. It shapes stakes thematically (emotional thawing of a "frozen" case) but does not constrain on-page tactics or force trade-offs. The concept is functional setup and thematic echo, not a driver of middle choices or closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is asserted ("her very methodical nature demanded") and echoed in descriptions of cross-referencing textile archives and building taxonomies, but the trait does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost. The methodical approach proceeds smoothly without friction or trade-off; Elara does not sacrifice speed for thoroughness or vice versa in a way that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Lance" appears twice: as metaphor ("lance the abscess of silence") in paragraph 2 and again in paragraph 5 ("by piercing the established narrative...lance the conspiracy"). Neither instance is a physical act that drives a turn; both are abstract declarations. The action could be replaced with "expose" or "penetrate" without altering story logic. Not causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is declared explicitly in paragraph 3 ("she must work by unifying opposites: the mask versus the face beneath it") and mentioned again in paragraph 5 ("by unifying the opposite testimonies of absence and presence"). The method is told but not demonstrated through specific investigative choices or beats that show her actively reconciling contradictions. It is thematic framing rather than mechanics that shape attempts or constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quarry is anchored early (rim, mist, limestone walls) and present throughout. It provides micro-setting that alters tactics: wet shale affects footing, humidity smudges charcoal, the black pool marks the heiress's last location, and the limestone surface enables the ribbon comparison that cracks the case. The setting directly shapes the investigation's method and charges the closure image. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" is signaled in the opening and reinforced ("long after the evidence disappears from police vaults and witness memories decayed"). The timeframe establishes obstacle (no fresh leads) and motivates Elara's solitary pursuit, but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. No live clock or deadline presses her choices. The element frames context but does not drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" is stated in paragraph 4 ("She worked deliberately to awaken dormant empathy within herself") and resolved at closure ("she felt the weight...as living, breathing anguish"). The desire is present and linked to the thawing metaphor, but the emotional shift is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible friction. The want does not visibly cost her detachment or methodical edge in a way that complicates a beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears in paragraphs 3 and 6, bookending the investigation. The tone is coherent: mist, silence, quarry's "bowl of the earth," "black pool." The mood modulates subtly as dawn "began to dissolve the mist into threads of silver" and Elara's breath shallows at the climax. The tone charges the final image of isolation and anguish. Strong coherence and reprise, though the tonal shift is gentle rather than dramatically modulated under peak pressure.</comment>
