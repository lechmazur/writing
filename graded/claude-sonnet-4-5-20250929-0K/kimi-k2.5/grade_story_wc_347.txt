<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and grounded in her brother's death, and her reluctant competence is consistently embodied through physical gestures ("welding gloves," muttered complaints). The mechanical precision of placing nuts reads authentic. However, interiority remains surface-level—grief is mentioned but not contradictory or pressured, and the final exhaustion is stated rather than felt through degraded perception or micro-choice friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is causal: Elara discovers the blueprint, decodes its logic, assembles the nut trail, and the travelers escape. The closure—watching them reach safety, then planning to resume her vigil—is a valid Earned Stasis with visible cost (exhaustion, ongoing isolation). The orientation is delayed slightly but anchor arrives by ~150 words. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mechanical birds force her behind cover and she must use the vibration plate, raising stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, cursed orchard, and vibration plate all constrain Elara's tactics. The "offhandedly exact" nut placement and the vibration-plate gambit charge the ending image. Spatial choreography is clear: limestone cracks, ravine floor, eastern cave mouth, basalt pillar. The frost's sensory arrival—"sparkling layer"—directly shapes the closure timing and reinforces the world's rules.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (guide travelers to safety) is signaled early and tightens when the birds dive and the frost forms. The reversal—mechanical birds thwarted by the vibration plate, then the pruning hook—is protagonist-driven. Cost is visible: exhaustion, resumption of her reluctant vigil. However, the middle sags slightly with exposition about the blueprint and brother's backstory, delaying pressure buildup until the travelers appear.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of reluctant care and graceless beauty emerges through image and action (welding gloves, muttered complaints, the green-glowing nut path). The blueprint's "impressions without touching" method and the phrase "graceless beauty" recur purposefully, charging the final image. However, the brother's bones and the "secret language" lean into overt thematic statement rather than letting the trail's construction speak for itself. The ending resists moralizing but doesn't fully reweight the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with a distinct perceptual signature: "offhandedly exact," "welding gloves," "muttered complaint." The phrase "graceless beauty" appears twice, threading tone through narration. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminesce," "coherent map") that sits uneasily against her practical, grudging voice. No dialogue; interior access is controlled. Psychic distance modulates appropriately at the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, template cadence appears in the middle beats: "She had three hours... Clutching the small nut... She understood now... She moved..." clusters four "She [verb]" sentence openings across six lines, flattening momentum (−0.5). The phrase "graceless beauty" recurs purposefully, but "offhandedly exact" is used twice identically without reweighting (−0.2 for minor loop). Figurative language is restrained and functional. Clarity is solid throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cursed-orchard caretaker and mechanical-bird guardians offer genre freshness. The method—phantom footprints assembled from glowing cursed nuts—is specific and non-obvious. However, the core reluctant-guardian-atones-for-past-failure template is familiar, and the blueprint's sudden discovery fits a convenience pattern. The vibration-plate gambit and the pruning-hook throw add tactical specificity that elevates the piece above median execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's reluctance is foregrounded from the opening line and drives her choices across all major beats: discovering the blueprint, assembling the nut trail despite complaints, using the vibration plate, and resuming her vigil. Her past failure (brother's death) motivates the present action with visible cost. The ending reaffirms her caretaker role with exhaustion and resignation legible on the page. Introduced immediately, shapes three distinct beats (discovery, assembly, vibration-plate defense), and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The nuts are present in five distinct beats: harvest from the heart-tree, first placement with shadow-arrow, methodical positioning of the constellation, the seventh nut atop basalt, and the vibration-triggered luminescence that forms the guiding path. Each nut contains "a fragment of the curse" and glows at frost, a specific property that enables the closure. Removing the nuts would collapse the entire rescue mechanism and the ending image. Early signal, causal across beats, irreplaceable, closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blueprint is discovered early, reveals the labyrinth's true architecture and the "impressions without touching" method, and Elara consults it twice (once before assembly, once after closure). It frames her tactics and constrains her approach—she cannot touch the ground herself, must rely on nut placement. However, the blueprint's mechanics are summarized rather than shown in use during the peak assembly beat, limiting its visceral pressure. Three gates met, causal role in two beats, charges method but not the final image directly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" appears twice: once describing her nut placement ("offhandedly exact placement") and once in the pruning-hook throw ("offhandedly exact aim"). Both actions are consequential—the first creates the guiding shadow, the second destroys the mechanical birds—demonstrating a specific skill under pressure. However, the phrase is used identically without cost or friction explored, and her precision is never tested or shown to fail. Two beats, causal, but cost is external (effort) rather than tied to the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Assemble" structures the entire middle section: Elara assembles the seven-nut constellation methodically, each placement calculated for shadow-casting and frost-glow. The assembly sequence creates the guiding path that saves the travelers, and the vibration-plate adjustment mid-assembly forces a tactical adaptation. Removing "assemble" would require a fundamentally different action verb and plot mechanism. Early signal, drives three beats (placement sequence, seventh nut, vibration trigger), and is closure-active as the path becomes legible at frost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—"leaving impressions without touching the ground"—is signaled via the blueprint, shapes Elara's entire approach (she places nuts rather than marking paths herself), and is demonstrated twice: the shadow-arrow from nut placement and the vibration-triggered luminescence shift. The method's logic constrains her choices throughout and is essential to the closure image (the glowing path guides travelers). Early signal, causal across beats, irreplaceable, closure-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth's switchback trails, narrow ledges, ravine floor sightlines, and basalt pillar all constrain Elara's nut placement. The mechanical birds patrol overhead, forcing her behind cover and prompting the vibration-plate gambit. The eastern cave mouth is the designated safe endpoint. Spatial logic drives tactics: nut positions must cast visible shadows from the ravine, the basalt pillar is unreachable by birds, the vibration plate is installed and accessible. Environment is causal, irreplaceable, and closure-active (travelers reach the cave as frost forms).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The three-hour deadline is established in paragraph three and tightens decisions: Elara must position seven nuts "before temperatures dropped." The frost's arrival is tracked across beats (temperature plummets, first crystals form, full coating completes) and closes the window exactly as travelers reach safety, creating genuine temporal pressure. The timeframe is causal, shapes assembly pacing, and charges the closure moment. However, the actual elapsed time during nut placement is compressed and not granularly tracked, slightly weakening lived urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to guide lost travelers is rooted in her brother's death and dramatized through her reluctant but methodical assembly work, her tactical responses to the mechanical birds, and her final exhaustion. The friction between reluctance ("never asked," "muttered complaint") and commitment (continued assembly, resumption of vigil) creates authentic tension. Her actions—blueprint study, nut placement, vibration-plate use, pruning-hook throw—all trace to this motivation. Early signal, drives all major beats, visible cost (exhaustion, ongoing isolation), closure-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Graceless beauty" appears three times: opening description of Elara's movement, the luminescent nut pattern's "graceless beauty—awkward angles that somehow formed a coherent map," and the final line's "graceless, beautiful trap of a home." The tone modulates from reluctant competence through tactical urgency to resigned endurance, coherent across turns. The oxymoron charges the closure image by reweighting the orchard's curse and Elara's vigil as both burden and strange grace. However, the phrase risks becoming a label rather than an embodied texture in some beats.</comment>
