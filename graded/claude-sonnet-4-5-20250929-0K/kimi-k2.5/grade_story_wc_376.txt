<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aurelia's motivation is consistent—searching for lost letters to rebuild trust—but her interior life remains abstract. The wilting-leaf mechanism works as a device but doesn't generate meaningful internal conflict or force contradictory impulses in scene. Marcus's confession is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The transformation at the end (leaves unfurling) feels declared rather than earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows a causal lens: map fragments → coordinates → vault → letters. Orientation is established early (Aurelia, greenhouse city, post-drought). The closure unit—finding the vault and reading honest letters—lands on the page, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt; no visible price is paid for the journey itself. The journey feels more like discovery than transformation, and the final image (preparing to transcribe) gestures toward future action rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky is vivid and purposeful, shaping the sealed districts and postal collapse. Sensory detail is selective (ash, steam, condensation, vines) and filtered through the setting's logic. However, the northern quadrant itself—the destination that drives the plot—remains spatially vague; we never see or feel the flood Marcus mentions or the physical constraint it might impose. The zinc plates as keys is a nice touch but doesn't meaningfully constrain the vault approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding lost conversations to rebuild trust) is clear and sustained. One meaningful turn occurs when Marcus's lie is exposed by the wilting leaves, forcing his admission, but this deepening doesn't narrow Aurelia's options or raise the cost of the journey. The vault opens without complication, and the letters are simply there, waiting. No visible price is paid—no forfeited resource, no trade-off, no tactical shift—undercutting the escalation requirement for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (truth, lost communication, rebuilding trust) emerges clearly from the premise and closure image. The wilting-leaf device is purposeful but borders on allegory, and the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("truth finally had a sanctuary"). The core question—what happens when honest words are lost—receives a resonant answer (they wait for retrieval), but the answer feels stated rather than embodied in a non-literal final image or action that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout. Aurelia's perceptual signature (calligrapher's eye, gilded leaves, ink-stained fingers) is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Marcus's admission carries subtext. The prose maintains a steady, slightly elevated register appropriate to the setting, though some phrasing trends toward stock lyricism ("cathedral silence," "tears from metal supports"). No head-hopping or filter-verb issues; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good, though some beats lean toward ornamental description ("vines heavy with tomatoes brushed their shoulders"). A few template-cadence runs appear ("The air grew thicker... condensation dripping... When they reached"). Minor paraphrase loop: "lost conversations" recurs as a phrase without added pressure. The closure beat avoids scaffold, but the penultimate paragraph stacks metaphorical intensifiers ("sanctuary," "breathe and grow") that edge toward overwriting without obscuring causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (post-apocalyptic greenhouse city, bio-truth-telling leaves, lost letters as cultural treasure) synthesizes familiar post-collapse and epistolary tropes without a sharp fresh angle. The wilting-leaf device is inventive but functions mechanically—one reveal, then resolution. The map-piecing and zinc-plate keys are solid tactile details, but the vault opens without complication or surprise. The ending gestures toward transcription as restoration but doesn't transform the premise or offer a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aurelia frames the story, searches, deciphers the map, uses the plates, opens the vault, and reads the letters—all major beats trace to her agency. Her choices create the journey's structure and the closure moment. However, the vault discovery feels more like completion of a treasure hunt than a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragments appear in the satchel, fit the map edges, confirm the route, and unlock the vault door—four distinct beats across setup, middle, and closure. The plates' dual function (map-puzzle and key) is specific and irreplaceable. However, the unlocking feels convenient rather than constrained; the plates simply fit without complication or cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Candor in small moments saves lives" is spoken by Aurelia and triggers Marcus's confession, shaping one middle beat. The concept recurs thematically at the vault (honest letters, unfurling leaves) but doesn't constrain or enable the protagonist's tactics or choices beyond that single exchange. It reads more as theme label than on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wilting-near-dishonesty trait triggers action twice: three petals curl when Marcus lies, forcing his admission, and the leaves unfurl fully at the vault in the presence of truth. The attribute is signaled early, creates one visible consequence, and returns at closure with reweighted meaning. However, the trait doesn't constrain Aurelia's choices—she never faces a cost tied to the leaves' revelation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reread" appears twice: Aurelia rereads the map marginalia to verify coordinates, and later rereads the vault letters at closure. The first instance shapes the middle beat (confirming the route); the second anchors the ending image. However, the action is not irreplaceable—"read" or "examine" would serve nearly as well—and the rereading doesn't generate a turn or cost beyond thoroughness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shredded map is found under floorboards, pieced together with zinc plates, and reveals coordinates—setup, middle work, and payoff all present. The piecing mechanics matter: the plates' inverse impressions fit torn edges like puzzle pieces, a specific and irreplaceable method. The method shapes the middle attempt and enables the vault discovery. However, the assembly happens off-camera in summary ("By piecing together"), reducing dramatic weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city frames the entire story: sealed vents trap humidity, severed postal tunnels motivate the search, the toxic sky outside constrains movement, glass domes filter air, hydroponic forests and condensation catchments provide the route. The setting supplies resources (the old postal station, the vault) and pressures (sealed northern quadrant, Marcus's fear). The environment is essential to plot logic and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the oasis dried" anchors backstory and the drought "centuries ago" establishes scale, but the timeframe functions as premise rather than live pressure. The search has lasted "three years," but no clock tightens decisions in the present action. Marcus mentions "last spring" for the flood rumor, a small temporal anchor. The timeframe enables the setting but doesn't constrain tactics or escalate stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Aurelia's desire—"to find where lost conversations go"—is stated early, drives every beat (the search, map decoding, vault journey), and is fulfilled at closure when she finds the letters and prepares to transcribe them. The motivation is consistent and shapes the arc. However, it's not visibly conflicted or tested by a counter-desire; the journey proceeds without meaningful friction between want and cost.</comment>
