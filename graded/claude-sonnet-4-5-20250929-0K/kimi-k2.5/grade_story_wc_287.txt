<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are established through clear backstory linkage (father's lighthouse work, mother's gardening), and her final choice to restore the lighthouse is earned through accumulated grief transformed into guardianship. However, interiority leans toward therapeutic self-awareness ("protected vulnerability of having finally used the tools she had hoarded, having transformed private grief into public guardianship") that feels too articulate for a peak beat. Embodied emotion is present (knees pressed against grating, calloused hands) but competes with abstract reflection. The renunciation of her garden sanctuary and the physical journey represent genuine cost, though the final realization borders on over-articulated wisdom.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers symbols (petal drop, bitting gauge, rowing rhythm, lighthouse beam) toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's private tending becomes public guardianship. Closure lands on the page with felt cost—she has left her sanctuary and committed to vigilance—and the final image of the beam's sweep charges prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when she rows to the lighthouse and successfully activates it. Causality is mostly sound, though the bitting gauge's sudden utility for mirror calibration (not locks) stretches plausibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The harbor, fire escape garden, and lighthouse interior are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (rusted grating, silver light fracturing on waves, dust motes in moonbeams). The bitting gauge tooth functions as a micro-setting object that constrains and enables the climactic choice—Mara cannot restore the light without this specific tool. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (fire escape → rowboat → lighthouse ladder → adjustment panel). The moonlit harbor charges the final image by providing the reflected light source, making setting essential to the resolution rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring parental legacy by restoring protective light—is signaled early and tightens through the physical journey and mechanical challenge. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: waiting → rowing → climbing → calibrating. Agency is clear in Mara's decision to act after the petal falls and her hands-on restoration work. The cost is visible: she abandons her garden sanctuary and commits to overnight vigilance. One friction: the mechanism's success feels somewhat inevitable once she arrives with the correct tool; a moment of doubt or mechanical resistance would sharpen the test. The "quivering hush" and "wistfully pragmatic" phrasing recur but don't meaningfully constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of care outlasting loss emerges through concrete action (tending, rowing, calibrating) rather than stated thesis. The lighthouse restoration enacts rather than explains the transformation from private grief to public service. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the thematic payoff: "The fire escape gardener had become something else tonight, someone who understood that tending required both the patience to wait for petals to fall and the courage to row into the dark when they did" reads as direct explication rather than resonant implication. The beam's rhythm ("pull and release") effectively mirrors earlier rowing but borders on mechanical recurrence. Strongest when image-driven (petal spiral, moonlight paths), weaker when internally glossed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is character-consistent (gardener's eye for petals, mechanic's daughter touching tools). Diction generally fits Mara's blue-collar background but occasionally drifts into elevated register: "wistfully pragmatic," "protected vulnerability," "instilling the harbor with a vigilance." These phrases feel imposed rather than emerging from Mara's working-class idiom. Psychic distance shifts are intentional (close at key beats, reflective in transitions), though peak moments would benefit from tighter sensory immediacy. Free indirect thought is clean. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies appropriately and information density is generally high. However, patterned phrase recurrence becomes intrusive: "wistfully pragmatic" appears twice, "quivering hush" twice, "rhythm of oars in water" three times (once as "the rhythm of oars in water, that ancient cadence"), "pull and release" four times. The final paragraph contains two near-identical constructions describing vigilance and care. Mixed metaphor in "instilling the harbor with a vigilance"—one instills values in people, not locations. Figurative language is dense in reflective passages without pattern-teaching or clear payoff. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 range in Q7 per the prose-artifact guidance, with concentration in non-closure beats preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—using a dead parent's tool to restore their former workplace as symbolic closure—is familiar territory. Execution is competent but safe: the gardener/lighthouse pairing feels designed for thematic neatness, the petal-drop trigger is stock symbolism, and the bitting gauge's repurposed function (mirrors not locks) reads convenient rather than earned. Emotional truth is present in the grief-to-guardianship arc, but the resolution is tidy and the thematic architecture highly visible. One fresh inflection: using reflected moonlight rather than electricity shows environmental problem-solving. Overall, a well-told version of a recognizable template without transformation through unexpected complication or moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fire escape gardener character: Setup in opening paragraph, development through her active choices (descending, rowing, climbing, calibrating), payoff as she watches the beam and commits to vigilance. Her gardening background informs her understanding of cyclical care and patience. The character drives all major beats and the final stance crystallization. Specificity: her calloused hands and knowledge of tending soil inform her mechanical work. Cost: she leaves her sanctuary garden to become a different kind of tender. Slightly generic in emotional processing but causally central.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bitting gauge tooth: Setup in opening (kept twenty years without purpose), payoff at lighthouse (inserted into gears for mirror calibration). It enables the climactic action and represents inherited legacy made useful. However, middle development is weak—it's carried as inert cargo during the rowing sequence. The pivot from "lockmaster's" tool to mirror-array calibrator feels retrofitted for convenience rather than earned through established properties. Present in two functional beats (pocket, panel) but the mechanical logic is suspect. Irreplaceability is asserted but not demonstrated through failed alternatives or specific tooth geometry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Quivering hush as core concept: appears twice as descriptor ("She moved with a quivering hush"; "a quivering hush settled over the harbor") but doesn't shape stakes or constrain tactics. It's atmospheric dressing rather than a pressure that alters options. The harbor stilling to glass is a physical correlate, but Mara's choices would proceed identically without this element. No middle development where the hush complicates or enables a beat. Swappable with "tense silence" or "held breath" (which also appears). Functional as tone-setting but ornamental to causality.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Wistfully pragmatic attribute: appears as label twice ("wistfully pragmatic" describing her movements and later her precision) but never constrains or enables action with visible cost. We don't see Mara's wistfulness and pragmatism pulling in opposite directions to create a dilemma or trade-off. Her movements are simply efficient and memory-tinged in parallel, not in tension. The trait is told rather than embodied through a choice that sacrifices one quality for the other. Replaceable with "deliberate" or "careful" without structural change. Late first appearance (second paragraph) and no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Instill as action: appears in "The rhythm of her rowing instilled a calm determination" and "instilling the harbor with a vigilance." The rowing does create emotional effect and the lighthouse arguably instills protection, but "instill" as an active verb shaping turns is thin. The major causal action is "calibrate" and "activate"—Mara adjusts mirrors and the beam sweeps. "Instill" is more effect than action. It doesn't define a distinct beat that another verb wouldn't cover. Present at setup and closure but doesn't drive middle choices. The mixed metaphor in the final usage (instilling an environment rather than a person) further weakens integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm of oars in water as method: Setup in rowing sequence ("that ancient cadence of pull and release"), payoff when the beam moves "with the steady rhythm of oars in water" and her heart beats "pull and release, pull and release." The parallel rhythm links physical labor to the lighthouse's function and Mara's commitment. However, middle development is absent—it's a simile in the rowing beat and a callback at closure without shaping an interim choice. The mechanics of steady alternation don't meaningfully constrain tactics. Lyric resonance (early seed, final reprise) reweights the dominant stake of sustained care with modest cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Luminous harbor by moonlight: Setup in second paragraph with vivid description, development as Mara rows through it toward the breakwater, payoff as the harbor's moonlight becomes the lighthouse's fuel source. The moonlight's availability and the harbor's dark corners create the specific problem (abandoned lighthouse, debris-hiding breakwater) and solution (reflected-light mechanism). Spatial layout constrains her journey (must row north to breakwater). The micro-setting of reflected moonlight enables the climax without electricity. Strong causal role in two beats (passage, activation) and present in closure image. Specificity: only moonlight, not any light source.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>After the final petal drops timeframe: Setup in opening as explicit trigger, but doesn't tighten decisions thereafter. Mara mentions she has "prepared" the boat "at dusk" suggesting prior planning; the petal drop is ceremonial permission rather than a live clock. No urgency once she begins—she rows, climbs, calibrates without time pressure. Stays until dawn "ensuring the light held steady," which implies patience rather than deadline. The timeframe signals readiness but doesn't narrow tactical windows or force faster choices. Functional framing device but replaceable with "after her decision" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reflect light into dark corners motivation: Setup when Mara articulates her purpose ("She needed to reflect light into dark corners, not merely for the ships that might pass, but to honor the practical magic her parents had embodied"), development through her rowing and climbing toward the lighthouse, payoff as the beam sweeps "the dark corners of the breakwater where debris collected and lost things hid." The desire drives all major beats and is grounded in parental legacy. Slight friction: the motivation is told in internal monologue rather than discovered through failed attempts or visible cost. The conflict between private grief and public service is present but not dramatized as a dilemma—she commits fully without wavering.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Protected vulnerability tone: explicitly named once in final section ("feeling the protected vulnerability of having finally used the tools she had hoarded") but otherwise implicit in the combination of fragile grief (petals, memories) and determined action (rowing, climbing, calibrating). The tone is relatively stable—Mara is consistently resolute-yet-tender throughout without significant modulation under pressure. No sharp tonal pivot when the mechanism catches or intensification during the climb. The phrase "both fragile and unbreakable" in the final line attempts to crystallize this duality but feels stated rather than charged through prior tonal shifts. Coherent but static; doesn't deepen at closure.</comment>
