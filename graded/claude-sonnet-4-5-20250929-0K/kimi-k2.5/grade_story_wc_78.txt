<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The prophet's motivation is clear and embodied through action—striking the mallet, moving through trees—but interiority remains surface-level and declarative rather than contradictory. Key choices ("dubbed the storm complete," "gave it the name it had earned") are asserted outcomes rather than dramatized dilemmas with visible cost. The final stance—"For the prophet, there were no true obstacles"—undercuts tension by declaring immunity to struggle. Emotional states are primarily metaphorical ("motivation burned") rather than embodied through specific perception and micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates sensory detail and metaphor toward a conceptual repricing—storm becomes collaborator, obstacle becomes instrument—visible in "The storm, thus acknowledged, ceased to be an enemy." Cost is felt in "restless euphony...unresolved chord" but remains oblique; the prophet's work succeeds without foreclosing a path or paying a tangible price. One meaningful deepening (storm integration) occurs, sufficient for this length, but the closure leans heavily on stated transformation rather than image-driven reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The driftwood orchard is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "apple trees rooted in floating logs," "concentric circles," "Each trunk held a different pitch." The setting constrains action (she moves through trees, climbs the highest log) and the final image of the orchard drifting toward new clouds charges closure. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she catalogs pitch, reads bruised cumulus—though spatial choreography occasionally floats (her exact position shifts without clear transition). The micro-setting (body, mallet, trees as marimba) functions as environment and qualifies for the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming the storm into music—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is largely metaphorical: "faster," "roared back," "final wave" describe intensity without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The storm "roared" but she simply "roared back"; no tactic shifts, no cost paid for each attempt. The resolution ("the storm...ceased to be an enemy") is declared rather than earned through a visible choice that forecloses a competing path. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening occurs (rain becomes collaborator), but pressure remains abstract and the protagonist never faces a genuine obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—transforming threat into creation—emerges from images (xylophone mallet, fractal rhythms, sketched resonance) rather than statement until the final lines, which tip toward moralizing ("no true obstacles, only instruments not yet struck"). The closing image of new clouds gathering offers a resonant, cyclical answer to the thematic question without fully stating a moral, though "restless euphony of the tide" edges close to label. Subtext operates in gesture (catching raindrops, coronation strike) and the piece resists tidy resolution by ending on "waiting to be born." Strong accumulation of particulars supports theme without meta-commentary until the last paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (she reads clouds as percussion, catalogues pitch). Diction is elevated and poetic but occasionally drifts into register mismatch: "alchemy that kept the driftwood circle from disintegrating into the hungry deep" reads more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance is controlled, though some lines ("Where others saw...she saw") perform exposition rather than trust dramatization. Syntax varies purposefully with emotional intensity, but several sentence openings default to "The" or "She," creating mild template cadence. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with mixed success: "sketched resonance," "fractal generating waves," "Russian dolls carved from resonance" layer metaphor on metaphor without always clarifying. Several lines loop or paraphrase: "restless euphony—nights when the music...made sleep impossible and creation inevitable" and later "restless euphony of the tide" recycle the phrase without reweighting. Stock constructions appear ("motivation burned with singular intensity," "eager eyes"). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The storm," "The prophet," "She." Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but some ("carrying its instrument-maker toward the next blue hour, the next storm, the next song") churn synonyms. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template runs, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—floating orchard, storm as music, driftwood marimba—offers a fresh synthesis of maritime survival and musical transformation. Execution is vivid but not entirely earned: the prophet succeeds without genuine friction, and the core turn (obstacle to instrument) is stated more than dramatized through specific, irreversible choices. The piece commits to its lyric vision but retreats into abstraction at closure ("endless composition," "world forever becoming music") rather than a specific, non-obvious image. Proximity check: "blue hour" and "restless euphony" carry poetic weight but edge toward familiar literary diction. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lyric mode) is present but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leeward tide prophet is present throughout and drives the action (raises mallet, strikes stump, climbs log, dubs storm). Setup clear by paragraph one; development shows her moving through trees and matching tempo to storm; payoff occurs in the coronation strike and final stance. However, her choices do not create reversals—she succeeds in every beat without cost or tactic shift. The character enables the accumulative design but does not face a decision that alters options. Present in all three gates but swappable with any musician-protagonist without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Xylophone mallet appears in beat one (gripped, raised), beat mid (catches raindrops), and closure (comes down in coronation). Setup immediate; development shows evolving use (striking, catching water); payoff charges the final turn. The mallet's physical properties (maple head, smoothed by decades) are specific and its use constrains her movement. However, it could be replaced with any percussive tool—drumstick, baton—without breaking story logic. Present across all three gates with clear beat involvement, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Sketched resonance is introduced mid-piece ("sketched resonance began to appear...etched in the very air") and described vividly ("visible harmonics," "geometric patterns," "glowing contrails"). It recurs in the final third ("sketched resonance fade from the sky") but does not constrain choice or alter tactics—it visualizes what is already happening. The concept is ornamental rather than causal; removing it would not break the story's logic. Present in development and payoff gates but lacks setup and does not shape stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Interprets cloud movements appears three times: early (reading bruised cumulus), mid (matching tempo to storm rotation), and closure (interpreting new clouds with eager eyes). Setup by paragraph one; development shows her matching action to cloud movement; payoff gestures toward continuation. However, the trait enables rather than constrains—she interprets successfully every time without cost or error. The attribute could be "reads wind patterns" or "senses pressure" with minor edits. Functional across beats but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dub is introduced early ("she raised the mallet to begin the dub") and defined ("overlaying rhythms atop the original score"). Development beat: "Each strike dubbed the approaching tempest with a new name." Payoff: "she dubbed the storm complete, giving it the name it had earned." The action shapes the central turn (storm becomes collaborator) and is causally linked to closure. Specific to maritime/musical tradition, less easily swapped than other elements. Present in all three gates and drives the conceptual transformation, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Fractal generating appears twice: mid-piece ("fractal generating waves, each echo splitting into smaller copies") and final line ("ready to fractal-generate order from the chaos"). Setup is present by paragraph one ("fractal" introduced); payoff includes it in closing summary. However, the method does not constrain her choices or differentiate one strike from another—any rhythmic pattern would serve. The term adds texture but is functionally ornamental; removing "fractal" and keeping "resonance" would not alter story logic. Present in setup and payoff but missing meaningful development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Orchard afloat on driftwood is established immediately ("outermost ring of the orchard afloat on a circle of driftwood in open seas") with vivid specifics (apple trees, floating logs, concentric circles, central platform). Development: she moves through the trees, climbs the highest log, uses trunks as percussion. Payoff: "The orchard afloat...drifted onward." The setting constrains movement, supplies resources (each trunk a different pitch), and the drifting circle charges the final image. Removing this setting would break the story's logic and the instrument metaphor. Present across all three gates with strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>At the blue hour is named in the opening line and closing third ("At the blue hour's peak"). The timeframe creates atmospheric specificity (indigo horizon, darkening sky) but does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no clock pressures her choices, and the storm's arrival is descriptive rather than deadline-driven. The phrase is evocative but swappable with "at dusk" or "at twilight." Present in setup and payoff but lacks middle development and does not constrain tactics. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To turn obstacles into instruments is stated explicitly ("Her motivation burned...to turn obstacles into instruments") and recurs in mid-piece ("To turn obstacles into instruments was...the physics by which she survived") and final line ("no true obstacles, only instruments not yet struck"). The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. She succeeds at transforming every obstacle without friction between desire and price. Present across all three gates but resolves too smoothly; replacing this with "to master the storm" would work with minor edits. Functional but not deeply integrated with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Restless euphony appears three times: "seasons of restless euphony," "moved through the trees in a dance of restless euphony," and "restless euphony of the tide." The tone coheres through accumulated sensory detail (fractal rhythms, glowing harmonics, drumming rain) and modulates slightly as the storm integrates. However, the phrase itself is label-only and does not modulate under pressure—intensity rises but the texture remains lush and musical throughout. The tone charges the final image but could be replaced with "relentless harmony" or similar. Present in all three gates with lyric consistency but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>
