<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior is heavily labeled ("analytically artistic," "trembling certainty") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final choice to board the train lacks visible cost on the page—she has "already carried her past the point of retreat" before deciding, so no path is foreclosed by her action. Backstory about the sister saturates the text but remains summary; the grief never tangibly alters a present micro-choice. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("every fiber," "heart hammered against her ribs in Morse code") and declarative epiphany rather than embodied contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The closure unit—boarding the phantom train and glimpsing the archive—lands on the page, but cost is asserted rather than shown: Elara's "commitment" is sealed by glowing cracks, not by a choice that forecloses another option. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (symbols accrue: cracks, punch, archive), but the final image reconfigures meaning through declaration ("her map finally complete") rather than through a visible trade-off or renunciation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the punch validates the ticket, but the train materializes conveniently rather than through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cathedral Station's starlit vault and cracks are vividly rendered and anchor the scene early. The phantom punch and train exist as atmosphere more than constraint—Elara's choice to use the punch is unopposed, so the setting supplies spectacle rather than pressure. The cracks guide her feet but do not force a trade-off; she follows them without spatial friction. Micro-setting (the ticket, the punch) charges the final image but does not alter tactics. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding her sister's explanation—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through symbolic density (cracks → punch → train) rather than through reversals or escalating cost. The single tightening occurs when the punch validates the ticket, but this moment is unopposed; no live option is foreclosed. Agency is minimal: Elara follows arrows, then boards a train that has already materialized for her. The resolution (glimpsing the archive) is delivered to her rather than earned by a choice under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—silence, maps as narrative, unspoken truths—emerges through recurring images (cracks, phantom mechanisms, the archive). The punch and ticket accrue symbolic weight across beats, and the final archive image reweights "all cartography is storytelling" without overt moralizing. However, several lines veer into explicit theme statement ("destruction could also be direction," "some routes can only be drawn by walking them"), weakening the implicit work. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer (the infinite filing cabinets) but the thematic question is partially pre-articulated rather than fully discovered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("analytically artistic," mapmaker's eye) is asserted more than enacted—Elara notices angles and gradients but the prose does not modulate diction or rhythm to reflect technical expertise under pressure. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("fortress of unspoken truths," "negative space between words people were afraid to speak") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she called") appear but are voice-consistent. Psychic distance remains controlled; tense is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often mixed: "fortress of unspoken truths" is spatial metaphor, then clarified as "infinite archive"; "locomotive constructed of forgotten appointments and midnight confessions" strains coherence. Template cadence appears in paired clauses ("not steel but suggestion," "analyzing…recognizing," "waiting for…training her") across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops: the cracks "guide her feet" and "form arrows that pointed deeper" within adjacent lines. Stock phrases ("every fiber," "heart hammered…in Morse code," "trembling certainty") recur. Propulsion is uneven: the middle third stacks description (punch, train, ticket) without forward movement. Readability remains high but information density is diluted by synonym churn and scaffolding connectors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The phantom-train premise offers a fresh angle on grief and urban infrastructure. The mapmaker lens is specific but underused—Elara's analytical eye is told more than shown shaping her choices. Emotional specificity is present (eight-year search, blank ticket) but the archive resolution arrives as spectacle rather than emerging from prior particulars. The cracks-as-language conceit and the punch mechanism are imaginative, yet the final turn (boarding the train, seeing the archive) feels like a reward for following directions rather than a synthesis earned by contradictory choices. No close echoes of famous work, but the piece hedges into safe symbolic territory (trains, archives, silence) without transforming the template through lived detail or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's mapmaker role is signaled early and returns in the final line ("her map finally complete"), but her choices are passive—she follows pre-existing arrows and boards a train that materializes for her. The trait enables observation (noticing the cracks' geometry) but does not constrain a decision with visible cost. Present in setup and payoff, absent from causal middle; caps at ~6.0 under the gate model, then lowered for swappability (any observer role would work) and lack of on-page trade-off tied to her meticulous mapping.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The punch appears at the midpoint, is handled in one extended beat (Elara aligns and uses it), and returns in the closure image (the glowing stamped coordinates). It enables the key turn—validating the ticket—and its phantom nature is specific and irreplaceable. However, it lacks middle development: no prior failed attempt or constraint tied to using it. Present in two gates (development, payoff) but missing early setup; caps at ~6.0, lifted slightly for causal role and closure linkage, capped below 7.0 because no visible cost is tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unraveling mysteries" frames the quest early but remains thematic backdrop rather than shaping tactics. Elara catalogs silences in journals (told, not shown) and follows clues that resolve without complication. The concept is present in setup and mentioned at closure ("explanation for her sister's silence") but does not constrain choices in the middle—she encounters no false leads, rival interpretations, or investigative friction. Functional but replaceable; any quest frame would serve equally.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Analytically artistic" is label-only: mentioned three times ("analytically artistic renderings," "analytically artistic intuition," "analytically artistic" hands) but never dramatized as a constraint or enabler. Elara photographs and analyzes cracks, yet no trade-off emerges between precision and creativity. The trait does not foreclose an option or open a path that another approach would miss. Present across beats as description, absent as causal force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dare" governs the climax: "To board this train was to dare the unknown…courage she wasn't certain she possessed." The action is signaled, executed on the page, and shapes the ending (she boards, sees the archive). However, the daring is asserted rather than tested—no on-page hesitation, competing pull, or visible cost accompanies the boarding. The punch mechanism does the causal work; "dare" is the emotional frame. Present in all three gates but lacks specificity of cost; swappable with "risk" or "choose."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cracks appear in the opening line, are analyzed ("no natural settling creates such precise geometry"), guide Elara's path across multiple beats ("followed them now," "widened as she walked," "blazed silver"), and are confirmed at closure. They constrain her route and validate her methodology in the final moment. The method is irreplaceable (arrows in stone) and causally active, shaping both middle tactics and the ending image. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure; no visible cost tied to following them slightly lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The starlit vault is rendered vividly in the opening and returns as backdrop when the train materializes. It anchors the scene spatially but does not constrain Elara's choices—she moves freely within it. The mist and glass ceiling supply atmosphere rather than pressure. Setup and payoff present, but middle development is ornamental. Micro-setting (the vault as a single continuous space) works adequately; caps near 6.0 for lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"3:00 AM, that fragile hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is signaled early and establishes mood, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no dawn deadline, no urgency tied to the hour. The phrasing is lyric but the element remains static description. Present in setup, absent from tactics and closure. Introduced early but never developed; caps at 4.6 for missing middle and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Finding the "fortress of unspoken truths" and her sister's explanation is the dominant stake, signaled early ("following a map that had drawn itself") and resolved at closure (the archive reveals "the explanation for her sister's silence"). The desire is clear and consistent but not conflicted—no competing pull or visible price accompanies the quest. Dramatized through actions (following cracks, using punch, boarding train) but lacks friction between want and cost. Present in all three gates; lack of on-page tension caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" is introduced as a phrase early ("her flashlight trembling…with that peculiar conviction she called trembling certainty"), returns in the climax ("with trembling certainty"), and modulates between doubt ("courage she wasn't certain she possessed") and resolve. The tone is coherent and purposeful but operates as a label rather than emerging through syntax and rhythm—prose cadence does not vary to enact the tremor. Present in setup and payoff, modulates once in the middle; lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not charge the final image distinctly. Scores mid-band for coherence without embodied intensification.</comment>
