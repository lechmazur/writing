<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is abstractly declared ("academically rebellious," "luminous skeptic") but her on-page choices lack concrete cost or internal contradiction. The convergence with three colleagues dilutes individual pressure; no relationship friction tests her stance. Interiority consists largely of metaphorical musing ("preservation itself is a kind of violence") rather than embodied contradiction under stress. The final placement of the amber beneath the microscope feels like a symbolic gesture rather than a choice that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with orientation debt—who Elara is, why she's at this tower, and what immediate choice faces her remain vague past 120 words—triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and capping Q3 at 7.0. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (atmospheric density and thematic callbacks), but no meaningful tightening or cadence shift occurs; the group simply arrives, discusses, and enters the lab. Closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via Professor Vance's whispered line ("homecoming isn't a return; it's a reaction"), yet the cost remains abstract—no on-page action or image demonstrates what they sacrifice or risk by choosing this illicit path. The Cost proof test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where cost is legible in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The "rainwashed tower," "bronze quiet," "overgrown sculpture path," and Gothic arches are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the spring storm's aftermath. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The fly amber and microscope are present, but neither object's physical properties shape tactics—they serve as thematic vessels rather than tools with mechanical stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the chemistry of homecoming"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the group walks to the tower, discusses their hypothesis, and sets up equipment without friction or setback. The preliminary data reading at the end is told rather than dramatized, and no visible price is paid (no lost funding, no institutional reprisal, no interpersonal cost materialized on the page). Agency is observational rather than decisional. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a cadence shift should reweight cost; neither occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of displacement and altered belonging emerges through the fly-in-amber metaphor and the dialogue about "preservation as violence." However, the final image—Professor Vance reading data while Elara reflects on remaining "luminous skeptics forever"—delivers a thematic Echo ("remain luminous skeptics") that articulates the story's thesis rather than allowing it to arise from dramatized particulars. The conceptual stakes are legible, but the ending summarizes insight rather than letting a concrete action or image reweight prior material without statement. Modest thematic coherence keeps the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("particular luminosity," "bronze quiet," "cortisol levels, dopamine responses, cellular memories"). However, diction frequently drifts into academic abstraction that feels more like the prompt's language than Elara's lived interiority under pressure—phrases such as "molecular signature of displacement" and "synthesis of who we were and what we've seen" lack perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse; when present (Maya, Vance), it carries thematic weight but minimal subtext or goal pursuit. No head-hopping, but the voice reads as committee consensus rather than singular perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is grammatically clean and carries vivid images ("copper patina gleaming wetly," "morning glories," "diffused spring light"), but suffers from overwriting in high-density figurative runs: nearly every sentence in the opening paragraph stacks metaphor ("bronze quiet," "fly amber," "biological timestamp," "closed system") without propulsive causal linkage, triggering the Density check (−0.5). Several paraphrase loops appear: "abandoned observatory" / "abandoned artist colony" and "questions and strange atmospheric residues" / "invisible radiation or viral agents" restate ideas without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" constructions in the first two paragraphs. Cumulative artifacts total −0.8 in Q7. Information density is moderate; many sentences do descriptive work but few advance tactical choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—post-contact scientists conducting unsanctioned research in an abandoned tower—combines familiar elements (alien visitation, dissident researchers, atmospheric ruin) without a transforming twist. The "fly amber" and "artificial pilgrimage" are prompt-supplied and feel ornamental rather than organically necessary; the story could function with generic "sample" and "journey" substitutions. The central insight ("homecoming isn't a return; it's a reaction") is stated rather than discovered through specific, non-obvious action. The Transformation test suggests the emotional and thematic arc could persist with different names and places. No bold structural risk or fresh synthesis elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is labeled "luminous skeptic" in the opening line and the trait recurs at the end ("remain luminous skeptics forever"), satisfying Setup and Payoff. However, her skepticism does not constrain a middle choice or create visible cost—she simply pursues her hypothesis without on-page friction. The character shapes the thematic frame but does not drive key tactical turns. Present across beats but functionally replaceable with "independent researcher." Two-gate eligibility (~6.0 ceiling), minus swappability (−0.6) and ornamental middle use (−0.5), plus modest closure echo (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fly amber appears in three beats: Elara clutches it in her pocket (Setup), holds it up to filtered light with the "preservation as violence" line (Development), and places it beneath the microscope in the tower (Payoff). All three gates are met. The object's metaphorical charge (stasis, preservation, displacement) recurs and shapes the thematic closure via the microscope image. However, the amber does not constrain a tactical choice or enable a solution—it functions as symbolic prop rather than actionable tool. Three-gate eligibility (≥6.1), causal pressure minimal (−0.5), closure linkage present (+0.8), swappability moderate (−0.5), specificity fair (+0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Artificial pilgrimage" is named once in paragraph two ("this artificial pilgrimage—a journey constructed deliberately") and echoed in paragraph six ("The artificial pilgrimage was complete"). Setup and Payoff are present, but no middle beat shows the concept constraining a choice or shaping tactics. The pilgrimage is a thematic label for the walk to the tower rather than a stake with mechanics. Two-gate eligibility (~6.0 ceiling), minus ornamental use (−0.8), minus swappability (the walk could be called "unsanctioned research trip" with no structural change, −0.7), plus lyric reprise (+0.3), minus label-only pattern (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Academically rebellious" is introduced in paragraph two ("Elara remained academically rebellious, rejecting the institutional narrative") and implied at the end ("remain luminous skeptics forever"). Setup and Payoff present. The trait enables her to pursue the illicit lab, but no middle scene shows her choosing rebellion over safety with visible cost—the rebellion is backstory context rather than a live on-page choice under pressure. Two-gate eligibility (~6.0), minus label-only (−0.4), minus no middle development beat (−0.5), plus modest thematic echo (+0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Converge" structures the story: Elara traces footprints, three colleagues emerge and converge at the tower base (middle), and they enter together (ending). Setup, Development, and Payoff all present. The convergence enables the group discussion and lab setup, providing the social frame for the thematic dialogue. However, the action is largely spatial choreography—arrival and entry—rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Three-gate eligibility (≥6.1), beat involvement (two beats, +0.9), causal pressure minimal (enables setup but does not force a tradeoff, +0.3), closure linkage (entry completes the convergence, +0.5), swappability moderate (could be "meet" or "gather," −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path" appear in paragraph three (Setup: "She had traced the dusty footprints") and paragraph six (Payoff: "erasing the dusty footprints that had guided them here"). The method enables Elara to follow others to the tower. However, the mechanics are not dramatized—no scene shows her interpreting prints, choosing a fork, or losing the trail. The footprints function as narrative transit device rather than a method with friction. Two-gate eligibility (~6.0), minus summary-only use (−0.6), minus swappability (could be "followed a map" or "received directions," −0.5), plus modest Setup/Payoff bracket (+0.4).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "rainwashed tower in spring" is introduced in the opening line, recurs as a destination and vertical shelter throughout, and houses the final lab scene. Setup, Development, and Payoff all present. The tower provides spatial pressure (upward path, converging point, shelter) and atmospheric charge (Gothic arches, moss, rain). However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is a vivid container rather than an active force. Three-gate eligibility (≥6.1), beat involvement (present across all major beats, +1.4), causal pressure minimal (enables but does not force choices, +0.3), closure linkage (houses the final image, +0.7), specificity good (+0.5), but postcard-level description without tactical stakes (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After making first contact" anchors the backstory ("Three months after making first contact") but does not create a live clock or urgency that shapes on-page decisions. The temporal frame is static context—no countdown, no approaching deadline, no time pressure that alters tactics. Setup present, but no Development or Payoff beats show time tightening choices. One-gate only (missing middle and closure participation), cap at 4.6. Minus ornamental use (−0.5), minus summary-only (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To understand the chemistry of homecoming" is stated in Elara's hypothesis (paragraph two) and recurs in the lab scene and Vance's final line ("homecoming isn't a return; it's a reaction"). Setup and Payoff present. The motivation frames the journey and the thematic conclusion. However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted—no scene shows Elara torn between curiosity and safety, or between empirical rigor and wishful thinking. The motivation is told context rather than a live friction forcing a tradeoff. Two-gate eligibility (~6.0), minus told-only (−0.6), minus no middle friction (−0.5), plus thematic payoff (+0.4), minus label pattern (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears in the opening paragraph ("The bronze quiet of the afternoon"), recurs as description of Elara's voice ("her voice matching the bronze quiet around them"), and is echoed in the final paragraph's mood ("leaving only the quiet certainty"). Setup and Payoff present, with a Development callback. The tone coheres across turns and charges the reflective ending. However, the mood is largely static—spring rain and atmospheric stillness persist without modulation tied to escalating pressure. Three-gate eligibility (≥6.1), tone coherence across beats (+0.8), closure charge (quiet certainty, +0.5), but static rather than pressure-responsive (−0.7), specificity fair (+0.4), no felt cost tied to tone shift (−0.3).</comment>
