<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is embodied through tactile woodworking choices and the physicality of grief ("rust-hued peace settling over her shoulders like an old shawl"). The progression from containment through ritual to the practical immortality of the handle shows earned endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction: some emotional states lean toward articulation rather than contradiction in action ("grief, like wild animals, required containment through ritual rather than force" reads slightly thesis-like). The final stance—carving memory into daily use—feels motivated by the widow's specific history with Viktor's circus world.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara transforms absence into "furniture for the soul" through the carved handle, with visible cost in her solitary labor and the persistent scent of "sawdust and mane conditioner." The accumulative/textural lens holds—rain, skylight, kettle, and wood accrue meaning—but the piece cycles through multiple restatements of the central insight without meaningful tightening after midpoint. The orientation is clean (widow, loft, carving blank, kettle) but the narrative deepens more through reiteration than escalation. Cost is legible in her containment labor, though the ending restates rather than decisively reweights.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The skylight functions as both atmospheric anchor and perceptual lens: raindrops as "tiny clock measuring the boiling point" and "crystallized prisms" filter Mara's temporal processing. The ash wood's grain—"tight grain near the center, the softer edges where decay had nearly claimed it"—constrains her carving choices and mirrors her emotional excavation. The loft's persistent scent of sawdust and mane conditioner charges the space with Viktor's absence. The kettle's whistle provides a temporal frame that times the carving work, and the workbench becomes a stage for transformation rather than mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: transform grief into usable form (the kettle handle). The piece operates under an accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening as the wood "revealed its secrets" and she "carved away what was unnecessary, exposing the strength within." However, no live reversal or competing pressure tests the commitment—Mara encounters no resistance, decay problem, or technical failure. The resolution is never in doubt; she simply executes the planned task. Cost is present in the labor and solitude but lacks a moment where options narrow or a trade-off forces choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete woodworking: "love was a form of woodworking. You took what the storm offered, what the lightning struck, and you carved it into handles." The recurring "here and gone" motif shifts from Viktor's absence to "here transformed," reweighting the opening grief. Minor penalty: the final third over-articulates the thematic architecture ("grief, properly carved, became furniture for the soul"; "harvesting lessons from loss meant not forgetting, but shaping memory into handle, heft, and daily use"). The kettle-as-morning-ritual and ash-from-circus-tree particulars anchor the abstraction, but the last two paragraphs tip toward summary rather than image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is consistent (circus-trained attention to grain, ropes, reins). Diction stays within Mara's register until occasional elevated flourishes: "hauntingly practical immortality," "architecture of her survival," "rust-hued peace" feel imposed rather than emerging from her working-class circus background. The skylight-as-lens device works well, but repeated syntactic templates in the final third flatten rhythm: "The lions were gone, the tent folded, the crowds dispersed, but the wood remained" and similar constructions create a summary cadence. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("she thought," "she saw") appear frequently without tonal necessity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops across adjacent lines: "Here and gone, she thought" / "Here and gone" (later); "crystallized time into suspended prisms" / "Through crystallized time, she saw"; "The phrase had become her mantra" followed immediately by exposition of that mantra's meaning. Template cadence runs in the final third: "The lions were gone, the tent folded, the crowds dispersed" / "She would finish the carving tomorrow, sand it smooth, treat it with oil" stack parallel constructions without variation. Stock metaphor strings: "rust-hued peace settling over her shoulders like an old shawl" and "unfolded like waking cats." Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems across the closure window.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The widow-carving-handle-from-circus-tree premise offers specific grounding, and the skylight-as-temporal-lens is a fresh angle on grief work. However, the emotional arc—solitary artist transforms loss into practical art—follows a well-trodden template without unexpected friction. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode and delivers on the woodworking metaphor, but the resolution is visible from the opening and no turn challenges the predetermined path. The "crystallized time" device and circus-ash particulars elevate above generic grief narratives, landing in solid mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara (lion tamer's widow) drives all on-page action: she positions the blank, retrieves the chisel, carves with "hauntingly practical precision," silences the kettle, examines the half-finished handle. Her widow status seeds the task (ash from circus tree, mane conditioner scent) and the final stance (carving memory into use). She is present in setup, development (carving beats), and payoff (examining the unfinished handle, understanding grief as woodworking). Her choices are iterative rather than conflicted—no reversal tests her commitment—but the identity is causally essential: only a circus widow would carve this tree into this handle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ash wood blank appears in opening ("sat heavy in her palms"), middle carving beats ("she began to carve, letting the blade bite into the pale wood"; "The wood revealed its secrets"), and ending reflection ("Mara lifted the unfinished handle to the light"). It evolves from raw material to half-finished handle, and its grain ("tight grain near the center, softer edges where decay had nearly claimed it") mirrors Mara's excavation of strength within grief. The blank's origin (tree that shadowed the circus tent, roots that "drunk in decades of sawdust and roars") charges it with Viktor's presence. It drives the carving action and appears in the closure image, though the handle's incomplete state means full transformation occurs off-page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is seeded early ("Here and gone, she thought, watching a droplet slide down the pane") and reprised at closure ("Here and gone, yes, but here transformed"). It frames Mara's mantra and shapes her stance toward Viktor's absence. However, it functions primarily as thematic echo rather than tactical constraint—no choice pivots on the "here/gone" logic. The concept charges the rain imagery (droplets as transience) and the final reconfiguration, meeting lyric-resonance allowance for purposeful early seed → final reprise that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears twice: "hauntingly practical precision" (carving action) and "hauntingly practical immortality" (the handle's function). The attribute describes Mara's approach but does not constrain a choice—she could execute the same carving with different phrasing. It colors tone and thematic resonance (the ghost of Viktor made useful) but remains closer to label than enacted tradeoff. Present in setup and payoff, shaping atmosphere, but swappable with "methodical" or "unsentimental" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Contain" is seeded early ("grief, like wild animals, required containment through ritual"), drives the carving action ("The chisel moved steadily, containing her sorrow within the emerging curves of the handle"), and anchors the closure insight ("ready to contain what remained"). The verb shapes Mara's tactical approach—she carves to hold grief in functional form—and the handle's design ("hold heat without burning") literalizes containment. The action is specific to her circus past (lion taming = containment) and essential to the woodworking metaphor, though the execution is straightforward without friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Through crystallized time" appears in the skylight device: "Each raindrop acted as a lens, crystallizing time into suspended prisms" and "Through crystallized time, she saw him again." The method provides the perceptual frame (rain as temporal magnification) but does not constrain the carving process—Mara's work proceeds in real time while she reflects. It enriches atmosphere and supports the "here and gone" motif but remains ornamental to the central action. The mechanics are described rather than tested; removing the crystallized-time phrasing would not alter her choices or the handle's completion.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors all action: skylight provides light for carving ("she positioned the blank...aligning it with the gray light"), rain marks time ("each bead of rain a tiny clock measuring the boiling point"), and the space holds Viktor's residue ("the loft still smelled of sawdust and mane conditioner"). The workbench, kettle on stove, and "weeping glass" above create coherent spatial choreography. The skylight's rain-lens device charges Mara's temporal perception and reappears in closure ("Mara lifted the unfinished handle to the light, watching how the crystallized droplets magnified the grain"). Setting is present across all beats and supplies the sensory pressure that shapes her reflective carving.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Kettle timeframe is seeded ("counting the seconds until the kettle screamed"), tracked in middle beats ("The kettle began its low murmur"; "The skylight wept steadily above her, each bead of rain a tiny clock measuring the boiling point"), and completed at climax ("The kettle reached its crescendo"). However, the carving work is not visibly compressed or accelerated by the ticking clock—Mara works at her own pace, reflects extensively, and the kettle simply marks duration rather than forcing tactical choices. The frame provides coherent temporal structure but does not tighten decisions. Time is tracked but not weaponized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Harvest lessons from loss" is stated explicitly ("She worked to harvest lessons from loss, shaping the blank into a handle") and dramatized through the carving action: Mara transforms the circus ash into a functional kettle handle, literalizing the extraction of use from grief. The motivation drives all on-page choices (positioning blank, retrieving chisel, examining grain, carving curves) and anchors the closure insight ("harvesting lessons from loss meant not forgetting, but shaping memory into handle, heft, and daily use"). Minor friction: the motivation is articulated more than conflicted—no moment where she doubts the utility of the task or faces competing desires. Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" appears twice: mid-story ("rust-hued peace settling over her shoulders like an old shawl") and near closure ("she sat in her rust-hued peace"). The tone is coherent—elegiac, contemplative, tinged with loss but not bitter—and modulates slightly as rain shifts to "amber and gold" light. However, the tone remains static across beats without meaningful pressure variation; Mara's emotional register is steady from opening to close. The "rust" evokes aged patina and quiet acceptance, charging the final image of tea and unfinished handle, but the piece does not test or complicate the established mood.</comment>
