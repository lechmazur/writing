<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's professional interiority is concrete and particular—measuring wind velocities, reverse-engineering disaster—with embodied detail (respirator pressing, pupils dilating). However, the story withholds her emotional stakes beyond the professional drive to prevent future disasters; Chen's death elicits curiosity more than grief or moral weight. The moment she "smiled despite the respirator" feels unearned—no prior contradiction or cost justifies satisfaction amid catastrophe. Internal conflict is absent; she moves from mystery to solution without friction or doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal/Accumulative hybrid (causal investigation converging toward accumulative pattern recognition). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya's understanding crystallizes into "precise geometry of tragedy" with visible cost (the silence becomes less absolute, filled with predictable currents). The piece suffers mild orientation debt—"three days ago" and the investigator role anchor by ~100 words, but the inciting rupture and Maya's specific mandate remain vague until paragraph two. One meaningful tightening occurs (tracing wind channels backward to understand Chen's fate), and the final image reweights the opening silence with new legibility. Cost is conceptual (obsessive documentation as the price of foresight) rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vivid and selective: rust-red walls, scorch marks on HAZMAT 447, crystallized residue underfoot. Spatial choreography is clean (twelve-high stacks, ten-meter clearing, twenty-meter visibility into fog). The environment actively constrains choices—containers as baffles create wind shear that killed Chen—and charges the final image (fog swirling in predictable spirals confirms her calculations). The professional filter (anemometer readings, blast radius measurements) shapes what Maya notices without catalog bloat. Minor slip: "yellow-gray mist that seemed to breathe" edges toward stock personification.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: understand how the disaster traveled to prevent the next one. The investigation tightens through systematic survey → scorch-mark measurement → reverse-engineering the convergence point, with the patch serving as coordinate anchor. However, there's no live opposition or genuine uncertainty—Maya encounters no false leads, no physical danger that alters her tactics, no moral calculus beyond professional duty. The "knife-edge of wind shear" discovery feels inevitable rather than hard-won. Cost is present but muted: obsessive documentation is her existing MO, not a sacrifice forced by this case.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: invisible forces become legible through patient mapping; tragedy's "terrible inevitability" versus cultivated foresight. The patch's survival (thermal updraft freeing it while Chen died) is a precise, non-literal image of what escapes catastrophe and what remains trapped. "Hazily beautiful" and "whisper of currents she could finally hear" avoid stating the moral while charging the final image. Minor weakness: "true foresight required such obsessive documentation" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists tidy resolution—the port remains silent, Chen remains dead—while offering conceptual closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: technical precision layered with metaphor ("metal maze," "knife-edge of wind shear"), professional lexicon (anemometer, thermal layers, rotor wash) inflected with lyric compression ("corrugated steel boxes," "sulfur-lit clearing"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during measurement, pulling back for synthesis ("geometric certainty"). The prose texture remains consistent under pressure. One minor filter-verb cluster in paragraph four ("found scorch marks," "measured the blast radius") slightly dulls immediacy, but doesn't break voice. No dialogue to evaluate. Elision is minimal and purposeful (Chen's final moments told, not shown, which fits the investigative frame).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively (short declarative beats during measurement, longer synthesis in the final paragraph). Information density is high: most sentences do double work (e.g., "The patch served as both her talisman and her starting coordinate" merges emotional anchor with methodology). Minor template cadence in paragraph three: three consecutive "she + past-tense verb" openers ("She marked," "She was documenting," "She moved"). "Hazy precision" motif recurs purposefully but edges toward overwriting—"hazily beautiful in its terrible inevitability" stacks modifiers in a high-pressure beat. No paraphrase loops; spatial and causal sequencing is clean. Proofreading is solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of industrial disaster, meteorological investigation, and moral reckoning through spatial geometry is specific and non-obvious. "Documenting wind patterns between buildings that weren't buildings" freshly defamiliarizes investigative procedure. The patch as both talisman and coordinate, surviving via thermal physics that killed its owner, transforms the keepsake trope. Risk-taking in structure (sustained technical investigation without conventional antagonist or reversal) heightens conceptual stakes without obscuring clarity. Slight derivative pressure: accident-investigator-as-detective and found-object-as-anchor are familiar frames, though the container-labyrinth meteorology is fresh. Transformation test passes: swapping names/locale would gut the specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's investigative choices—systematic survey, anemometer measurement, reverse-engineering from effect to cause—drive all major beats and the closure realization. Her professional method shapes the entire narrative arc and enables the final understanding of Chen's death. Present from the opening and causally active throughout.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The patch appears in three distinct beats: clipped to lapel in paragraph one (talisman/coordinate), placed on stained concrete as marker in paragraph four, and its survival explained at closure (thermal updraft). Its dual function (emotional anchor + investigative starting point) and final reweighting (physics of survival vs. death) make it indispensable to the story's thematic and structural logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" operates literally (wind channels creating a combustible convergence point where Chen died) and structurally (all evidence spiraling inward to ground zero). The concept shapes Maya's investigative tactics, defines the disaster's mechanism, and charges the closure image ("precise geometry of tragedy"). Removing it would collapse both plot causality and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting" appears twice: once as general professional trait in paragraph one, once as "rapidly adapting eyes" in paragraph four (pupils dilating/contracting). The eye-adaptation enables navigation through shadow and fog but doesn't constrain a choice or impose visible cost. Functional but replaceable with "adjusting" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The survey action structures all beats: entering the zone, moving between containers, marking velocities, measuring blast radius, kneeling at ground zero, photographing final measurements. Each survey phase advances causal understanding and the story cannot reach its closure (mapping disaster geometry) without this exact action. Indispensable to plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Documenting wind patterns is signaled in paragraph two, executed through anemometer readings and tablet notation in paragraph three, and delivers the closure insight (wind channels backward-traced, shear zones mapped). The method's mechanics matter: "twelve knots between Block C and D, dropping to four" provides the data that solves Chen's death. The entire investigation hinges on this specific methodology.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth pressures every choice: it creates the wind channels Maya must map, forces navigation through "chaotic towers," acts as "baffles and accelerators" that killed Chen, and provides the geometric proof at closure. The setting is both obstacle and evidence, shaping tactics and delivering the final answer. The story's logic fails without this exact architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Three days ago" anchors the disaster timeline and "after the town goes silent" frames the empty setting, but time doesn't tighten decisions or impose live urgency. Maya's investigation proceeds at her own pace with no clock pressure. The timeframe provides context but remains static; swappable with "four days" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To cultivate foresight in action" is explicitly stated in paragraph four and drives Maya's obsessive documentation. The motivation shapes her reverse-engineering method and the closure synthesis ("predict and prevent the next one"). However, it's told more than dramatized—no scene shows her wrestling between speed and thoroughness, or between emotional response to Chen's death and professional detachment. Present and causal but not deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Hazy precision" operates throughout: individual rivets visible yet twenty meters dissolve into fog; crystallized residue underfoot; "hazily beautiful in its terrible inevitability." The tone modulates purposefully—technical exactitude in measurement beats, lyric compression at closure—and charges the final image (fog swirling in "predictable spirals" that confirm calculations). The oxymoron defines both setting and theme, making it integral to the story's texture and meaning.</comment>
