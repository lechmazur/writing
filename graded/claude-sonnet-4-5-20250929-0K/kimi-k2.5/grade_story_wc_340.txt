<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is specific and embodied through her handling of the goggles and diary, with clear motivation rooted in curiosity rather than practical service. The captain's characterization through diary entries balances despair with sensory precision effectively. The transformation from "warmly inquisitive" observer to inheritor of the captain's discipline is earned through the accumulated discoveries during ascent. Minor slip: the final realization about "disciplined capacity to study one's own pain" edges toward diagnostic articulation, though it remains grounded in the captain's concrete example.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: the elevator's physical ascent structures a parallel psychological deepening as Elara decodes both cipher and captain. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land within the opening lines. The closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara inherits the captain's methodology with visible cost—she now stands in his position, aware of the "particular anguish and unexpected joy" awaiting her, the diary "tucked securely against her ribs" signaling acceptance of burden. One tightening occurs when the goggles unlock the diary, narrowing her understanding and foreclosing naive readings of the captain's death.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The icebound spire functions as both macro-setting and constraint: frost-coated glass refracts light to enable the cipher, the elevator's ten-floor structure paces revelation, and the final observatory positions Elara between cloud ocean and stratospheric space. Sensory details—brass cage shuddering, cables singing, breath fogging goggles—are filtered through Elara's heightened attention. The "cathedral of frozen water and ambition" charges the final image where she becomes the next inhabitant of this indifferent geometry. The goggles as micro-setting object constrain her choices and charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the captain's interior life and, implicitly, her own future in his role. Pressure accumulates through the diary's revelations, tightening as she recognizes not tragedy but "cartographer of dualities." The alignment of cipher wheels at floor four and the removal of goggles at floor eight create meaningful beats that narrow interpretation. Agency is attention and inheritance—she chooses to read with "affectionate detachment" rather than household gossip's frame. Closure cost is legible: she accepts the captain's burden, knowing survival requires studying one's pain with curiosity, foreclosing any naïve ascent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—finding beauty and meaning within suffering—emerges through the captain's diary descriptions of auroras and ice-crystal blue alongside despair, not through assertion. The encrypted diary as object embodies the theme: meaning locked until viewed through the right (fractured) lens. The final image offers non-literal answer: Elara positioned between obliterating clouds and merciless clarity, equipped with broken goggles as "crown," suggests transcendence requires embracing dualities without resolution. The captain's "essential secret" is earned through accumulated particulars: coffee taste at altitude, green-silk auroras, exact ice-blue shade. No thematic statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds tightly to Elara's perception; no head-hopping. Diction carries distinct texture: "brass cage shuddered," "cables singing," "cathedral of suspended water and ambition," "cartographer of dualities." Perceptual signature is clear—she notices emotional architecture (diary's "anguish" versus "transcendence") more than physical mechanics. Distance modulates appropriately: closer during cipher work, wider for the icebound spire's indifference. Minor density concern: occasional elevated register ("troposphere," "stratospheric space") fits the setting but edges toward ornament in a few descriptive beats without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (physical ascent tracks psychological revelation). Rhythm varies effectively between longer architectural sentences and tighter action beats. Minor loop: "warmly inquisitive nature" in paragraph seven echoes the opening's implied quality without adding pressure; the concept is restated rather than advanced. Figurative language ("mechanical flower blooming in illuminated code," "geography of hope") is vivid but occasionally clusters without tactical function. No major artifacts touch closure. Propulsion remains clear through the ten-floor structure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The elevator-as-revelation-pacing and cipher-unlocked-by-damaged-goggles offer fresh angles on inheritance and understanding-through-brokenness. The captain as "cartographer of dualities" who maps both weight and weightlessness transforms the tragic-leap trope. However, the core frame—servant discovers predecessor's secret via artifact, inherits their burden—follows a recognizable template. Specificity elevates: the prismatic light mechanism, altitude's effect on water boiling, the particular intersection of curiosity and detachment. Risk-taking in the quiet, reflective closure strengthens the piece, though the premise itself requires transformation through execution rather than offering structural novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive all key turns: she examines the goggles (floor 2), aligns cipher wheels (floor 4), interprets diary content rejecting gossip's frame (floor 6-8), removes goggles to view fractured world (floor 8), and steps onto observatory accepting inheritance (floor 10). Her ascending-servant role is causally active throughout, not merely observational. The shift from "scullery girl" to "ascending servant" three years prior establishes trajectory; present choices complete it. Her decision to read the captain with "affectionate detachment" rather than pity directly shapes the thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Goggles appear in opening paragraph (setup), unlock cipher through cracked lenses at floor 2-4 (development), are removed at floor 8 to fracture the world mirroring captain's landscape (reprise), and rest "on her forehead like a crown of broken glass" in final image (closure charge). Each use is functionally distinct and advances understanding. The "spiderweb pattern" cracks enable the spectral key—specific irreplaceable property. Final crown image reweights them from tool to symbol of inherited burden and fractured-lens methodology. Essential across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The encrypted diary discovery frames the entire sequence: it establishes the puzzle (setup by opening), structures the middle revelation beats as pages turn floors 4-8 (development), and its content—captain's dual mapping—directly enables Elara's final stance (payoff through understanding, not physical use at closure). The encryption mechanism (brass/crystal requiring altitude light) constrains tactics: she must use the goggles, must ascend. However, "discovery" as action is completed early; the diary then becomes vessel for theme rather than active problem. Solid integration across beats but the discovery itself doesn't evolve past floor 4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is established as Elara's distinguishing trait (setup paragraph 7), directly motivates her reading the diary with curiosity rather than gossip-framed pity (development), and enables the final inheritance—she possesses the temperament the role requires (closure relevance). The trait shapes her interpretive lens: she seeks "interior lives" and reads the captain's pain with interest rather than judgment. However, it's more often stated than tested under pressure; no moment forces a visible tradeoff where curiosity costs her something concrete. Present and motivating but not visibly constrained.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Unfold" governs the central mechanism: cipher wheels unfold at floor 4 "like a mechanical flower blooming in illuminated code" (physical), diary pages unfold floors 4-8 revealing layered meaning (metaphorical), and Elara's understanding unfolds across the ascent (psychological). The action is signaled early, executed distinctly across multiple beats, and the final "unfolding" of self-awareness enables closure stance. Removing this exact action would require structural redesign—the progressive revelation depends on it. Strong causal pressure and beat involvement, though the metaphorical extension dilutes specificity slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Scattered light is signaled in paragraph 5 ("fracture in frost-coated glass scattered arctic sun"), executes the cipher unlock ("refracted through fractures, projecting prismatic symbols"), and returns at floor 8 where goggles fracture world "into rainbow shards that perfectly mirrored the captain's encrypted emotional landscape." The method's mechanics matter: without the specific quality of refracted light through damaged lenses, the diary stays locked. Present across setup, development, and payoff with causal necessity. The final metaphorical use (emotional landscape) charges but doesn't constrain a new choice, keeping it from highest band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire shapes every beat: altitude enables the cipher (arctic sun through frost), the ten-floor structure paces revelation, the "troposphere-piercing" geometry establishes the inhuman scale Elara must navigate, and the final observatory position between cloud ocean and stratospheric space physically embodies her inherited stance. The tower's "indifference" to human lives pressures her recognition that survival requires internal discipline, not environmental mercy. Spatial constraints (elevator car, floors, balcony the captain leaped from) are coherent and consequential. Essential to structure, pressure, and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ten-floor ascent structures all progression: floor markers track every major beat (2nd floor light scatter, 4th floor cipher wheels, 6th floor shift from anguish to transcendence reading, 8th floor goggle removal, 9th floor realization, 10th arrival). Time pressure is implicit—the elevator's continuous climb creates urgency for her to complete understanding before arrival. The final "hydraulic sigh" marks closure timing precisely. Removing the floor count would collapse the pacing structure entirely. The timeframe is both literal clock and symbolic ascent, integrated across all three gates with strong causal shaping of revelation beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to seek joy beneath anguish" is established through Elara's reading practice (setup: she seeks "interior lives" not "practical needs"), dramatized as she recognizes the captain did exactly this (development: "not merely to document suffering, but to seek out joy"), and becomes her inherited discipline at closure ("survival...required...disciplined capacity to study one's own pain with curiosity"). However, the motivation is more recognized than tested—Elara doesn't face a scene where seeking joy costs her something tangible or conflicts with another want. It operates thematically and intellectually but lacks friction or visible tradeoff under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" governs Elara's stance from paragraph 9 onward: she sees the captain "not as tragic figure of household gossip who had leaped, but as cartographer of dualities" with explicit "affectionate detachment." This tone modulates appropriately—warm curiosity during diary reading, cooler analytical distance during the spire's indifference observation, then reintegrated warmth-plus-clarity in the final inheritance moment. The tone is coherent, shifts with pressure, and charges the closure image where she stands equipped with "warmly inquisitive" readiness for her own "particular anguish and unexpected joy." Tone as stance, not mood, with clear cost: detachment enables survival but requires accepting pain as study object.</comment>
