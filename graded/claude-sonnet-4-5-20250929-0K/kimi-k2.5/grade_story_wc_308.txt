<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The skimmer's motivation—learning to navigate without moving—is sustained throughout, and the final transformation into landmark tracks with the stated goal. However, interiority remains abstract and label-heavy: "weathered resolve hardening," "pulse left wandering," and "historically reverent care" are asserted rather than embodied through specific sensory contradiction or micro-choice. The protagonist's agency is largely contemplative observation rather than pressure-tested decision; the arrowhead insight arrives as realization, not struggle. Embodied emotion and internal conflict are minimally present; the piece tells us about states rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third—but the disorientation is pattern-taught (centuries, dust, geological time) and pays off at closure, so no penalty applied. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the skimmer achieves his aim by becoming motionless, forecloses the path of movement, and the pulse finds rest. Cost is conceptual and felt (he will be buried, becoming an artifact himself), legible in the final image. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered imagery (dust, bone, echoes) builds density until the final cadence shift reweights stillness as travel. One meaningful deepening is present. However, causality is thin—beats are linked by thematic association and accumulation rather than because/therefore, which fits the lens but limits tension.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is vividly rendered and recurs throughout, grounding the piece spatially. Sensory detail is selective—dust, echoes, bird patterns—and filtered through the skimmer's meditative focus. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop and symbolic resonance rather than constraining choice or supplying resources that alter outcome. The stone arrowhead and bird flock act as micro-setting/object-as-setting and do charge the final image, which lifts the score into mid-6s. Spatial choreography is minimal (single static figure) but clear.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through textural density (centuries, dust, pulse seeking) rather than conflict escalation. One meaningful deepening occurs: the skimmer's realization that the arrowhead is a compass and stillness is travel. However, there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options through protagonist agency; the insight arrives through contemplation and bird observation, not a choice under pressure. Cost is present (he will be buried, becoming stone himself) and legible at closure, but the escalation is conceptual rather than driven by stakes-testing action. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but agency is low.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—stillness as the truest form of travel, navigation without motion—emerges organically from imagery (dust, bone, pulse, arrowhead) rather than statement. The final image (skimmer becoming a stone arrowhead for future discovery) reweights prior material without moralizing. However, the piece edges toward overt philosophizing in places: "silence was not absence but the fullest possible sound" and "stillness was the truest form of travel" feel like thematic summaries rather than arising purely from scene particulars. Subtext operates in the bird patterns and arrowhead transformation. The ending is resonant but borders on explaining its own symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct textural voice—elevated, meditative, poetic. Distance is consistent, filtering perception through the skimmer's centuries-long contemplation. However, diction is often abstract and elevated beyond urgent embodiment: "historically reverent care," "pulse left wandering," "weathered resolve" read as stock poetic constructions rather than character-specific perceptual signature. Sentence openings show variety, but many clauses use similar participial or prepositional structures ("through centuries," "through the patterns," "in the canyon") creating a template cadence. No dialogue to evaluate. The voice is distinctive but not deeply individuated to this character's sensory particularity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and meditative, fitting the subject. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (arrowhead as compass, dust as witness). However, pervasive issues lower the score significantly: paraphrase loops abound ("centuries of layered dust" appears three times; "pulse left wandering" recurs without reweighting; "historically reverent" is repeated), synonym churn (towers of bone, bone towers; endless echoes, canyon of endless echoes), and template cadence ("through the patterns," "through centuries," "through the strata"). Stock metaphors cluster: "weathered resolve hardening like sediment," "ripples across a pond." Filter-verb stacks appear in several beats ("he understood," "he watched," "he had learned"). Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching or clear payoff, creating overwriting. These artifacts touch multiple beats and dull momentum. Apply −1.4 for patterned artifacts (loops, cadence, stock metaphor strings) and an additional −0.3 for filter stacks, totaling −1.7 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a stone skimmer learning to navigate by becoming geologically still—offers a fresh angle on meditation and stasis. The synthesis of arrowhead-as-compass, bird-pattern-as-language, and body-becoming-landmark is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution (stillness as travel, seeker becoming destination) echo familiar contemplative-fiction templates and Zen paradox structures without sufficient lived particularity to transform them. The piece commits fully to its premise but the execution leans heavily on poetic abstraction and stock metaphor rather than grounded sensory discovery. Risk-taking is present in the geological time scale and static protagonist, but clarity is preserved, so no bonus applied. Transformation test: the plot and arc could transfer to a similar meditative figure without major change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer is present throughout and his goal (navigate without moving) frames the piece. However, his choices are minimal—he observes birds, holds the arrowhead, and realizes its meaning. The final transformation (becoming a landmark) is a conceptual endpoint rather than a decision that alters tactics mid-scene. Setup is early, closure linkage is strong (he becomes stone), but middle development consists of passive contemplation rather than constrained action. Two beats (holding arrowhead, watching birds) involve the character, but neither narrows options through agency. Caps: swappable with another contemplative figure (cap 3.8). Adjustments: closure linkage +0.9, two beats +0.9, late first tactical implication (only at end) −0.4. Total ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead appears early (first third), is appraised in the middle (recognized as compass), and charges the closure (skimmer will become one himself). Three distinct beats: held in palms, contains wandering pulse, realization it indicates trajectories. Causal pressure moderate—enables the insight but does not narrow prior options. Specificity high (chipped flint, prehistory, compass not weapon). Closure linkage strong: final image echoes it directly. Caps: all three gates present, eligible ≥6.1. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, minus ornamental first mention −0.3. Total ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The pulse left wandering is mentioned throughout (arrowhead, skimmer's suspended animation, final rest) but functions as thematic echo and poetic image rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics. It is present by first third (setup), recurs in middle (beats within arrowhead), and appears at closure (pulse ceases searching), satisfying all three gates. However, it does not constrain choice or change options on the page; it is a lyric motif. Caps: all gates met, eligible ≥6.1, but swappable with "lost rhythm" or similar metaphor (cap 3.8 applies). Adjustments: early signal +0.4, closure reprise +0.8, ornamental use −0.8, no causal pressure −0.0. Limiter: swappability holds at 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" is mentioned twice (reverently holding arrowhead, reverent meditation) but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. It is a label describing attitude rather than a trait that alters tactics. Setup present (early mention), no middle development, closure participation minimal (does not shape final image causally). Caps: missing middle development (cap 3.4). Adjustments: label-only −0.3, ornamental −0.5. Total ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Appraise appears early ("needed to appraise its significance") and again in middle ("birds had appraised him more thoroughly"). The action frames the skimmer's goal but does not create a major turn—realization arrives through contemplation, not appraisal-driven choice. Setup early +0.6, two mentions across beats +0.9, but swappable with "evaluate" or "assess" (cap 3.8 overridden by beat involvement). Closure linkage weak (not present in final image). Adjustments: early +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure moderate +0.6, swappability −0.5, summary-only in second mention −0.4. Total ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The method (reading bird flight patterns) appears in the middle third and is crucial to the skimmer's realization. It is signaled, mechanics matter (vee-shapes, spirals, directional arrows teach him navigation), and it enables the key insight. Setup delayed (second third) −0.4, one major beat (bird observation) +0.4, causal pressure high (enables realization) +1.2, closure linkage moderate (informs final stance) +0.9. However, introduced at ~40% (late signal penalty −0.4). Total ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The towers of bone in the canyon of endless echoes are established early, recur throughout, and charge the final image ("not prison walls but wayposts"). Three beats: setting as frame, bone towers humming in sympathetic vibration (middle), final realization they are wayposts (closure). The setting constrains conceptually (he is trapped/held by echoes) but does not alter tactics concretely. Caps: all three gates met, eligible ≥6.1. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate (conceptual constraint) +0.8, closure linkage +1.4, ornamental in stretches −0.5. Total ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" is repeated throughout as timeframe marker. It establishes geological time and is present at closure (dust will bury him completely). However, time is static, not a tightening clock—centuries are backdrop, not pressure. Setup early +0.5, closure linkage (dust burial) +0.9, but no middle development (time does not alter tactics) and vague tracking (centuries are unquantified). Caps: missing middle development (cap 3.4). Adjustments: early +0.5, closure +0.9, vague time −0.3, ornamental use −0.5. Dominant limiter holds near 3.4; positive adjustments nudge to ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation (to learn to navigate without moving) is established early, shapes all action (contemplation, appraisal, realization), and is satisfied at closure (he achieves it). Friction is minimal—desire is stated, pursued through passive contemplation, and achieved without trade-off dramatized as cost. Setup early +0.7, three beats (holding still, watching birds, final transformation) +1.4, causal pressure high (all beats serve this motive) +1.3, closure linkage strong (motive achieved) +1.5, but told-only in setup and resolution (no conflicted choice under pressure) −0.6. Total ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Weathered resolve is signaled early ("weathered resolve hardening like sediment") and recurs at closure ("weathered resolve...settled into his bones"). Tone is coherent—meditative, patient, unhurried—and modulates subtly (bird observation adds brief urgency, final lines slow further). Setup early +0.6, closure reprise +1.1, coherent modulation +0.7, charges final image (resolve becomes geological permanence) +0.9. However, tone is largely static (one mood throughout) −0.4, and "weathered resolve" is a stock phrase −0.3. Total ~6.1.</comment>
