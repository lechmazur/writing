<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting choices under pressure. The interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts (shadowed elation, accidentally prophetic) without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. The character performs ritualized actions but does not face a genuine dilemma that tests commitment with visible cost. Agency reads as ceremonial rather than decision-driven.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but the causal chain is abstract: Kael "steers" light through total internal reflection to resurrect tactile memory, yet no on-page obstacle or reversal tests this intent. The ending image (dawn with texture, shadows released) asserts transformation rather than dramatizing a felt cost or foreclosed path. Closure reads as thematic declaration without a decisive change in options or knowledge that the reader can trace through prior beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse and glass lantern wick provide vivid, recurring anchors. Sensory detail (ozone, ink scent, starlight refraction) is selective and tied to the ritual. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or complicate tactics; it serves as stage dressing for the conceptual action. The micro-setting (wick in palm, emerald walls) does not alter the protagonist's options at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prevent blank oblivion, restore textured memory) is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Kael performs his routine without a complication that narrows options or raises cost. The "convergence of forgotten alphabets" and release of shadows proceed unopposed, yielding a resolution without visible trade-off or agency under pressure. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme (memory requires darkness, preservation mixed with extinction) is stated rather than earned through concrete particulars. The final image asserts thematic resonance ("dawn that arrived with the rustle of turning pages") but does not reweight prior material through a non-literal action or choice. Explicit thematic declaration appears multiple times ("memory required darkness to define its edges"), reducing subtext. The piece philosophizes rather than dramatizing a question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice remains stable and carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture. Psychic distance is consistent, and the perceptual signature (ozone, ink, starlight as geometry) is specific. However, elevated diction ("prophetic hymn," "spectral geometries," "liquid luminescence") pervades without modulation under pressure, risking register drift from the ritual action. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") appear but do not flatten immediacy significantly. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across nearly every sentence ("liquid luminescence," "heartbeat of a printing press reborn," "trees of parchment"), creating a steady metaphorical hum that dilutes urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 10, 14, and 22 restate the concept of light-as-darkness and shadow-as-preservation without advancing pressure. Template cadence ("The emerald lighthouse stood… The emerald lighthouse began… The lighthouse stood complete") and synonym churn (steering/shaping/bending narrative) accumulate. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmospheric texture rather than dual work. Deductions: figurative overload −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, template stems −0.4, totaling −1.4 within Q7; baseline ~6.8, adjusted to 5.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The core premise (herald using physics to resurrect print culture) offers a fresh synthesis of science and ritual. However, the execution leans on familiar post-apocalyptic memory-keeper tropes and elevated lyric mode without transforming them through specific choice or moral calculus. The "total internal reflection" mechanism is conceptually interesting but does not generate story friction or character cost. The ending reaffirms the premise rather than offering a non-obvious inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and performs the central ritual, but his actions are procedural rather than decisional. He does not face a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path; the routine proceeds unopposed. Setup present, middle involves handling the wick, closure describes the outcome—two gates met. However, no causal pressure or visible cost tied to his decision-making. Band guidance: two gates, ornamental action, no closure linkage → mid-3s. Deductions: ornamental use −0.5, swappability −0.4, no closure participation beyond presence −0.7. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 (setup + beat involvement minimal), −1.6 cumulative, floor at 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The glass lantern wick appears in paragraph 2 (setup), is handled and whispered to in paragraph 8 (middle development), and is mentioned cooling in Kael's pocket at closure (payoff). All three gates met. The wick's properties (total internal reflection) enable the ritual, but the mechanics do not constrain a choice or create friction. The final mention is a postscript rather than a charged reprise. Band guidance: three gates, functional enabler, no felt cost → low-6s. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 (setup), +0.9 (two beats), +0.5 (causal enable), +0.7 (closure presence), −0.3 (swappability), −0.5 (summary-only final use) = 5.1, but three-gate eligibility lifts floor to 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The concept "otherworldly routine" frames Kael's midnight ritual (setup present). The routine (polishing the wick, climbing stairs, laughing) recurs across beats (middle development). At closure, the narrative states "its routine no longer otherworldly but becoming the world itself" (payoff present). Three gates met. However, the concept operates as theme rather than on-page constraint; the routine does not alter options or create a trade-off. Band guidance: three gates, thematic echo, no causal pressure → low-5s. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 (setup), +0.4 (one beat), +0.3 (closure mention), −0.3 (label-only), −0.4 (theme claim) = 3.8, but three-gate floor lifts to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The attribute "accidentally prophetic" is mentioned twice (paragraphs 4, 14, 21) as a descriptor of Kael's laughter/hymn. Setup present (paragraph 4). No middle development beat where the trait constrains action or creates cost. Closure beat mentions it again ("accidentally prophetic in its joy") but as label only. Two gates, ornamental. Band guidance: two gates, no causal work → low-3s, but missing middle development caps at 3.4. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 (setup), −0.5 (ornamental), −0.4 (label-only) = 2.4, capped at 3.4, final 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The action "steer" appears in paragraphs 7, 11, 16, and 22. Setup present (paragraph 7: "steer the coming dawn"). Middle beats involve steering light and narrative possibility (paragraphs 11, 16). Closure beat: "he had steered the morning into existence" (paragraph 22). Three gates met. The action is central to the ritual but operates abstractly; no on-page friction or turn depends on steering versus another verb (e.g., "guide," "shape"). Band guidance: three gates, central but swappable → mid-5s. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 (setup), +0.9 (two beats), +0.5 (causal enable), +0.7 (closure linkage), −0.8 (swappable) = 4.1, but three-gate floor lifts to 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The method "through total internal reflection" is explained in paragraph 8 (setup) and mentioned in paragraphs 9, 11, 17, 22. Setup present, middle development (paragraphs 9, 11, 17 describe the mechanics), closure invokes it (paragraph 22). Three gates met. The method enables the ritual but does not constrain choice or create a trade-off; the physics jargon decorates the process. Band guidance: three gates, functional enabler, no pressure → low-5s. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 (setup), +0.9 (two beats), +0.5 (causal enable), +0.3 (closure mention), −0.6 (ornamental physics) = 3.9, three-gate floor lifts to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse is established in paragraph 1 (setup). Middle beats locate actions within it (spiral stairs, green walls, windows). Closure describes it standing complete (paragraph 23). Three gates met. The setting provides vivid atmosphere but does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter outcome; Kael's ritual proceeds unimpeded. Band guidance: three gates, atmospheric anchor, no tactical constraint → low-6s. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 (setup), +0.9 (two beats), +0.7 (closure presence), −0.3 (postcard description), +0.2 (irreplaceability of "emerald") = 5.3, three-gate floor lifts to 6.1, round to 6.3 for charged recurring image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last print newspaper" is stated in paragraph 1 (setup) and paragraph 3 ("since the presses stopped"). No middle beat where the historical absence creates tactical constraint or cost. Closure alludes to it thematically ("dawn that arrived with the rustle of turning pages"). Two gates (setup, closure mention). The timeframe motivates the ritual but does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. Band guidance: two gates, motivational frame → mid-3s. Starting at 3.0, +0.3 (setup), +0.3 (closure theme mention), −0.4 (ornamental), +0.4 (motivational relevance) = 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated in paragraph 12 (setup). Middle beats reiterate the goal (paragraphs 7, 13, 16). Closure declares success (paragraph 22). Three gates met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No on-page friction tests commitment. Band guidance: three gates, told motivation, no conflict → low-5s. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 (setup), +0.9 (two beats), +0.3 (closure linkage), −0.7 (told-only), −1.0 (no cost friction) = 3.3, three-gate floor lifts to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The tone "shadowed elation" is established in paragraph 5 and recurs in paragraphs 12, 18, and 23. Setup present, middle beats reinforce it, closure names the lighthouse a "green flame laughing." Three gates met. The tone remains consistent but does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with new meaning. Band guidance: three gates, consistent but static → mid-5s. Starting at 3.0, +0.8 (setup), +0.9 (two beats), +0.7 (closure presence), −0.3 (static mood), −0.5 (no pressure modulation) = 4.6, three-gate floor lifts to 5.6.</comment>
