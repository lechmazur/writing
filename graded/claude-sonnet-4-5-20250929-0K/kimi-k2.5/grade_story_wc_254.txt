<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared but never tested through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle. Her "tremor of certainty" operates as mystical mechanism rather than earned psychological state; no micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The seven-year wait and final transformation are asserted rather than dramatized through embodied cost. Interior voice relies on abstract constructions ("aesthetically driven," "metamorphic language") that read as prompt-label placement rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes "who" and concept early, but spatial orientation remains vague past the 120-word threshold—"edge" and "central column" never cohere into navigable space (−0.4). No causal linkage connects Elara's speech to the transformation; the colonnade responds to her voice, but we see no because/therefore chain, only coincident effects. The closure asserts that "the ban had never been external" but provides no prior beat where this realization alters her tactics or costs her a concrete choice. Lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural, but no pattern is taught by 25% and no cadence shift lands with cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and quartz colonnade are visually vivid but remain postcard anchors—no object constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "lantern-moth hush" appears three times as atmospheric phrase without affecting perception or action. Spatial choreography is unclear: Elara moves from "edge" to "central column" to "space between columns" without legible distances or orientations. The body as micro-setting is underused; her hand on quartz triggers transformation via mystical recognition rather than physical consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled (reclaim the colonnade, prove poetry's power), but no on-page reversal tests commitment. Elara encounters zero opposition—no censor, no physical barrier, no internal doubt that she must overcome through a costly choice. The "tremor of certainty" eliminates rather than escalates tension. Her final realization that the ban was self-imposed arrives as assertion without prior beats where fear visibly constrained her; no tightening or trade-off charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation through language and crossing forbidden boundaries is declared but not dramatized through concrete events. The final "become the silence between syllables" reads as mystical payoff to a premise stated repeatedly rather than earned through particulars. The piece tells us poetry reshapes architecture but shows only ornamental description. "Cloud-shadow poet" functions as job title, not thematic question tested under pressure. No competing goods or unavoidable harms; the colonnade grants Elara's wish without cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register that clashes with visceral immediacy: "aesthetically driven," "metamorphic language," "liminal space where language touches the divine" read as thematic scaffolding rather than Elara's interior lexicon under pressure. Sentence rhythm is uniform—most sentences extend to 20+ words with stacked subordinate clauses. No dialogue present to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic; her noticing (blue tiles, amber light, subsonic hum) could belong to any observer.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "tremor of certainty" → "conviction so profound it manifested as physical vibration"; "dissolving boundaries" recurs five times without added meaning. Template cadence dominates peak beats: "She was aesthetically driven…," "The method demanded…," "The pillars sang louder…" Figurative density in most sentences ("lantern-moth hush," "cobalt tint… a substance she could wade through," "shadow multiply… in fractal patterns") without pattern-teaching or payoff (−0.8). Stock metaphor strings ("bridge between," "silence between syllables") replace concrete action. Closure beat is heavily artifacted, triggering disallowance of 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (forbidden poet activates mystical colonnade) follows fantasy-quest template without fresh inflection. "Cloud-shadow poet" is an invented role that functions as label rather than constraint shaping tactics. The ban-lifts-after-seven-years frame and mystical-transformation payoff are convention without subversion. "Tremor of certainty" and "dissolving boundaries" read as prompt elements inserted rather than organic discoveries. No risk-taking; the protagonist succeeds without friction or cost, and the ending delivers exactly what the opening promised.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is on the page throughout but makes no decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She walks, places her hand, speaks—all moves succeed without friction. "Cloud-shadow poet" functions as title/description; no beat shows her using shadow-observation skills to solve a problem or constrain a choice. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Colonnade is handled twice (hand on central column, step between columns) and its hum is described repeatedly, but it functions as passive responder to Elara's voice rather than object with distinct properties that enable or constrain. No evolving use across beats; it sings louder, then continues singing. Mentioned in closure but not causally active there. Functional but replaceable with any mystical resonator.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Tremor of certainty" appears mid-story as internal sensation, recurs once as "crystallized into absolute knowledge," but does not shape tactics—Elara was already certain from the opening. It eliminates rather than complicates stakes. Present in closure realization but as thematic echo, not causal force. Swappable with "surge of confidence" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" appears twice as label describing Elara's movement and motivation, but no beat shows her choosing beauty over safety or efficiency with visible cost. It reads as trait assertion rather than constraint. No action traces to this attribute; it could be removed without altering any turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Paraphrase" is named as Elara's method (she must "paraphrase" banned verses), recurs in backstory and at the climax ("paraphrase of the ancient command"), and appears in closure insight. However, we never see her choose between literal recitation and paraphrase with cost, nor do we learn how paraphrase differs mechanically from direct speech. Functional presence in three beats but swappable with "reinterpret" or "transform."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Dissolving boundaries" is invoked five times (opening summary, motivation statement, method description twice, closure realization) but its mechanics never constrain or enable a choice. It appears in the ending ("dissolving the last boundary"), but as thematic summary rather than active process. Late signal (past 40% before first functional mention) and ornamental use cap at 4.6; swappability and label-only function lower further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium and frozen lake frame all action, appear in opening and closing images, and the ice "groans" in response to Elara's voice. However, no choice is pressured by spatial constraint—she walks freely, the colonnade is accessible, the environment grants rather than resists. Vivid but postcard; does not alter tactics. Present in closure image but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" is backstory anchor (seven-year wait) and appears in one reflective insight, but no ticking clock shapes tactics on the page. The "twilight" provides atmospheric framing without deadline pressure. Time does not tighten decisions; Elara's transformation proceeds at narrative convenience. Functional setup but no development or payoff in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"To stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is stated twice verbatim as motivation and echoed in closure, but no beat dramatizes friction between this want and a competing cost (safety, doubt, loss). She wants to cross, she crosses; no tragic choice or renunciation. Desire is declared and fulfilled without visible tradeoff. Functional but told-only.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" appears three times (opening, midpoint, closure) as atmospheric constant. Tone is hushed and elevated throughout without modulation under pressure; the transformation is serene, not charged. No turn or tightening alters the mood. Recurring phrase charges the final image only as decoration; it does not reweight the stake. Functional lyric reprise but static and swappable with any quiet-mystical descriptor.</comment>
