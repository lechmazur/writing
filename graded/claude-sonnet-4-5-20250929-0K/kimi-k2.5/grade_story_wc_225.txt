<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's internal journey from self-loathing to acceptance is traceable, and the final choice to stay and teach feels earned by the mirror revelation. However, interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("winnowing absolution," "sediment clearing") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The productive fidgeting is mentioned but never shown constraining a choice in scene. Motivation is clear but the embodied struggle remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page with visible cost: Kaelen renounces his exile-ending escape to stay and teach, forecloses a return path. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered imagery (labyrinth, tapestry, threads) and resolves via a cadence shift when thunder rolls forward and he chooses to remain. Orientation is anchored early (town square, time-frozen village, seven years). One weakness: the mirror revelation that absolves him arrives late and feels convenient rather than fully earned by prior causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth constrains Kaelen's hands throughout and charges the final image when it sits "empty in his pocket like a heart with room to beat again." The time-frozen village supplies concrete sensory anchors (suspended snowflake, arrested breath, fractured lightning) that pressure his choices and shift at closure when time resumes. Spatial choreography is clean (square, chapel, tapestry). The body and recurring object both constrain and charge, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—self-forgiveness via decoding the tapestry—is signaled early and tightens through the labyrinth puzzle-solving. The mirror revelation that the prince was already lost narrows Kaelen's self-blame and forecloses the path of eternal guilt. However, the reversal lacks a visible tradeoff in the moment; the absolution arrives as discovery rather than through a protagonist decision that costs him something tangible on the page. Agency is present in the choice to stay, but escalation is more textural than causally sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the shift from reading chess endgames to reading frayed borders enacts the arc from control to acceptance. The final image—platinum labyrinth empty, room to beat—reweights prior guilt without stating a moral. "Winnowing his shame down to its true, manageable kernel" and teaching children to decode borders offer resonant answers to the core question of forgiveness. Minor weakness: "fierce repose" and "woven hush" are recurrent labels that occasionally tip toward thematic echo rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: chess-tutor precision filters observation (geometric pathways, endgames, strategies). Diction remains controlled and character-specific. However, elevated metaphoric register ("threads of silence that draped across the cottages like heavy velvet," "sediment clearing from disturbed water") occasionally drifts above the immediacy of a man solving a puzzle under existential pressure. Psychic distance is steady, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("woven hush," "threads of silence," "sediment clearing," "heart with room to beat") and several images blur rather than sharpen ("winnowing absolution from wreckage" is abstract). Paraphrase loops appear: "the silence becoming almost tactile, a pressure" and "woven hush deepened" restate the same texture. Template cadence in the opening third: "He had been... Now he sought... The tapestry depicted... Each time he identified..." Stock metaphors (sediment clearing, heart/room) lower specificity. Artifacts touch non-closure beats; apply −0.8 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess-tutor exile, time-frozen village, and tapestry-decoding is specific and non-obvious. The turn from teaching kings to teaching children to read frayed edges before irreversible moves is thematically fresh. However, the mirror-absolution device (puzzle reveals he was blameless all along) is a familiar exoneration trope. The piece commits fully to its premise and the emotional truth feels earned, but the core mechanism—external artifact absolves internal guilt—is recognizable rather than transformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; drives the puzzle-solving beats, the mirror revelation, and the final choice to stay and teach. Kaelen's decisions (plucking threads, inserting the final strand, touching the tapestry border, choosing to remain) create all key turns and the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Introduced early ("miniature platinum labyrinth cupped in his palms"), handled across multiple beats (matching pathways, inserting threads, final click), and charged at closure ("empty in his pocket like a heart with room to beat again"). The object's shifting state (filled, solved, empty) reweights meaning and enables the mirror revelation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "woven hush" appears early and recurs ("woven hush deepened," "woven hush began to unravel"), shaping atmosphere and the break at closure when it unravels. It functions more as tonal texture than a stake-altering force; it does not constrain tactics or narrow options directly. Charged reprise elevates it above ornamental, but causal pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mentioned early ("he fidgets productively, his hands dancing through compulsive patterns") and tied to his chess-teaching past. The attribute is labeled and thematically apt, but never shown enabling or constraining a specific on-page choice with visible cost. The hands' movement is continuous backdrop rather than a tactical tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Introduced early ("winnow absolution from the wreckage"), drives the method (winnowing threads from tapestry), recurs ("winnowing more than fiber and metal"), and shapes the thematic resolution ("winnowed his shame down to its true, manageable kernel"). The action is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the story's logic and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (tapestry's frayed border, ancient runes in selvedge), mechanics detailed across beats (matching labyrinth pathways, extracting threads with tweezers, laying filaments), and the final decoded thread triggers time's resumption. The method shapes all middle attempts and the closure turn; swapping it would break the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Present from the first line (town square, time-frozen village), pressures Kaelen's exile-confinement throughout, and shifts decisively at closure when time resumes and the village awakens. The frozen state supplies both constraint (eternal stasis as punishment) and the stakes (breaking it via the tapestry puzzle). Removing it would erase the story's core problem.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Introduced early ("lull of distant thunder—a storm that had hung paused between sky and earth for seven years"), recurs ("perpetual lull of distant thunder," "distant thunder rolled forward"), and marks closure when the thunder finally moves. The timeframe supplies atmospheric coherence and a marker for the spell's break, but does not tighten on-page decisions or alter tactics beat-to-beat. The seven-year span is backdrop rather than a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stated early (exiled for the gambit that cost a prince's life, seeks absolution), dramatized through the puzzle-solving (separating mistake from self-loathing), tested via the mirror revelation (he was not to blame), and crystallized in the final choice to stay and teach rather than escape. Friction between guilt and the discovered truth generates the closure cost. The motivation drives every beat and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced early ("fierce repose," "calm in their intensity"), modulates through beats ("hands finally still, productive fidgeting ceasing as acceptance replaced anxiety"), and charges the ending ("embodying fierce repose... the quiet strength"). The tone coheres across turns and intensifies at closure. The oxymoron is purposeful but occasionally tips toward label rather than embodied texture.</comment>
