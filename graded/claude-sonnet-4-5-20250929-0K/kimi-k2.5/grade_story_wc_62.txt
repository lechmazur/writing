<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's core motivation—to map collective grief—drives his choice to retrace letters rather than carve new ones, a meaningful renunciation with visible cost. His grandmother's spectral presence enables the shift but does not make decisions for him. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract meditation ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm") rather than embodied contradiction, and the final understanding arrives through declarative insight ("Elias understood") rather than dramatized struggle. The choice to tie ribbons across graves is specific and purposeful, but the protagonist's internal conflict remains more stated than enacted under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines. The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's shift from mapping stones to retracing existing grooves, a meaningful deepening that narrows his approach and forecloses the original mapping project. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of carving "for the living who would come to trace the letters" reweights his solitary work into connective labor, and the cost is felt in the seasonal limit and the grandmother's departure. The accumulative lens holds, though the piece edges toward hybrid in its lyric density. One structural friction: the migration timeframe brackets the narrative but does not visibly tighten tactics within the single dusk scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as more than backdrop: humid air, glass dome, orchids, and ferns constrain Elias's breath-matching ritual and create a spatial crucible for spectral encounter. The woven ribbon becomes a tactile micro-setting element, handled across multiple beats, and the final act of cutting and tying it to stones transforms it from measurement tool to connective web. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"trapped moonlight," "glass creak," "butterflies pulsed against the glass"—and filtered through Elias's meditative focus. The dusk timeframe and migration season layer atmosphere without becoming ornamental. One minor friction: the limestone slab and other carving tools remain generically present rather than handled with occupational specificity that would further charge the work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is clear and drives the protagonist's shift from mapping to retracing, a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. The grandmother's directive to "retrace the grief" and "follow the ribbon backward" complicates the original plan, forcing Elias to abandon his months-long mapping project with visible cost. Agency is present in the decision to tie ribbons across graves, creating a physical manifestation of connection. However, escalation is primarily conceptual rather than enacted through rising external pressure or difficult trade-offs; the grandmother's guidance enables rather than opposes, and the butterflies' departure functions as temporal marker rather than forcing constraint. The resolution reweights the opening stake but does so through accumulation and reflection rather than a high-cost choice that forecloses competing paths.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—that collective grief is not a monument but a mesh, connection rather than isolation—emerges organically from Elias's shift from mapping to retracing and from the ribbon's transformation into a web across graves. The poems function as subtext for what cannot be spoken plainly, and the greenhouse as life-preserving space housing death-work creates purposeful tension. However, the final third edges toward overt articulation: "individual grief was a solitary note, but collective grief was the chord," "grief had no single shape but infinite dimensions," and the closing image of "the book that would never close" risk stating rather than embodying the thematic question. The spectral mentorship enables insight without forcing Elias to discover it through harder friction. Strongest moment: the ribbon becoming "a timeline...marking not just the dead but the spaces between them where the living continued to love," which trusts image over declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—meditative, attuned to breath and rhythm—is coherent and voice-specific. Dialogue (the grandmother's lines and traded poems) carries purpose and subtext, distinguishing her spectral timbre from Elias's spoken verses. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register that exceeds the moment's organic texture: "thundering calm," "fiercely meditative," "the geometry of shared mourning," "infinite dimensions." These phrases feel imposed rather than arising from the carver's working idiom. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the grandmother's quoted directive and Elias's simultaneous understanding occasionally blur the line between her voice and his realization. Strongest control appears in tactile moments: "wrapped the woven ribbon roll around his wrist, feeling the pressure."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most sentences advancing character, atmosphere, or thematic material. Rhythm varies purposefully, and opening/closing images are charged. However, significant figurative overloading pervades peak beats: "the sun bled violet," "thundering calm," "trapped moonlight," "her voice like distant thunder rolling across a still lake," "a chord resonating across the migration season," "the mesh," "pressed flower between the pages," "thundering, perfect calm"—nearly every sentence in the final third stacks metaphor without letting image breathe. Template cadence emerges in repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun] [past tense]" constructions across the second half. Paraphrase loops appear: "grief had no single shape but infinite dimensions" closely echoes the prior "collective grief was the chord" realization. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum and flatten the closure image's specificity. Baseline −0.8 in Q7 for density and loop; an additional −0.3 for elevated register drift in peak beats; partial recovery for strong tactile anchors ("chisel," "mallet," "cut the ribbon").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship across butterfly migration, family poetry custom, and ribbon as measuring/connecting tool feels specific and non-obvious. The shift from mapping to retracing transforms the familiar "craftsman finds meaning" arc into a meditation on connective labor rather than solitary mastery. However, the core emotional journey—grief as connection rather than monument—is a well-worn insight, and the spectral grandmother functions as a gentle guide rather than forcing harder friction. The greenhouse and migration season provide fresh atmospheric texture, but the ending's articulation ("not a monument but a mesh") trends toward abstract summation rather than irreducible image. Strongest originality: the ribbon as both measurement tool and literal web across graves, a concrete metaphor that avoids pure symbol. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode but does not take structural or moral risks that would elevate synthesis into bold territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias appears in every beat, and his decision to retrace rather than carve new and to tie ribbons across graves drives the narrative's key turn and closure. Setup is immediate, development shows him acting on his grandmother's directive, and payoff lands in the final carving scene where he works "for the living." However, much of the middle is observational and reflective rather than choice-driven; the grandmother's guidance enables rather than opposes. The character is essential but shares causal weight with the spectral mentor and the ribbon.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ribbon is handled in multiple distinct beats: laid across the slab, wrapped around Elias's wrist to feel the pressure of past measurements, unrolled across multiple graves to create a web, and finally cut and tied to connect stones. It evolves from measuring tool to symbol of collective connection, directly shaping the closure image. Setup is early, development shows tactile use under pressure, and payoff is explicit in the final act. The ribbon's unique property—its woven length and capacity to span graves—is irreplaceable. Strong integration, though it shares closure space with the carving action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship appears in setup (the grandmother materializes among orchids), constrains middle action (her directive to "retrace the grief" shifts Elias's approach), and is present at closure (she fades as the migration ends). The concept alters Elias's tactics from mapping to retracing and enables the insight about connection. However, the mentorship functions primarily as facilitation rather than creating friction or cost; the grandmother guides rather than opposes, and the relationship does not undergo a decisive change. The concept is functional across beats but ultimately swappable with any gentle advisory presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is introduced early as a label and illustrated by breath-matching and deliberate work rhythm. The trait appears in the final realization that "to be fiercely meditative was not to withdraw, but to press deeply." However, this articulation is declarative rather than enacted through a choice where the trait creates visible cost or trade-off. The attribute colors voice and pacing but does not constrain an on-page action in a way that another temperament could not also accomplish. Present and thematically consistent, but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Retrace" drives the story's central turn: Elias shifts from carving new letters to following existing grooves, reweighting his project from documentation to connection. The action is set up by the grandmother's directive, enacted in the middle ("began to retrace the letters, not carving deeper, but following the existing grooves"), and echoed at closure. The verb's dual meaning—physically retracing letters and conceptually retracing grief's origin—charges the thematic question. Development and payoff are strong, though the action itself is brief and shares closure space with the ribbon-tying. Removing "retrace" would require a different verb and conceptual hinge, raising irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The poem-trading custom is introduced in the first third via backstory ("For three generations, his family had traded favorite poems at dinner"), shown in present action (Elias whispers Dickinson alone, then trades verses with his grandmother—Thomas and Oliver), and returns at closure ("They traded poems until the light failed completely"). The custom enables the spectral connection and provides a ritual frame for the mentorship. However, its mechanics do not constrain choices or create friction; it functions as atmospheric texture and thematic reinforcement rather than shaping tactics. Present across beats with thematic weight, but largely replaceable with any family ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse at dusk anchors every beat: glass dome frames the violet sky and butterfly swarms, humidity affects breath and atmosphere, orchids and ferns provide spatial markers for the ghost's presence, and the vents' rhythm matches Elias's breathing to constrain his carving. The setting is introduced immediately, pressures the spectral encounter (a liminal space between life and death), and charges the closure image with the glass creaking and butterflies departing. Strong setup, development, and payoff; the environment is essential to tone and enables the central encounter. Minor friction: the limestone slab and carving tools remain generic rather than greenhouse-specific, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The butterfly migration brackets the narrative (begins the previous spring, ends this dusk as the last monarchs depart) and structures the spectral mentorship's duration ("would continue until the last stragglers crossed the southern border"). The timeframe is set up early, mentioned in the middle, and explicit at closure ("final dusk of the migration," "butterflies departed"). However, it functions as seasonal marker rather than live clock that tightens on-page decisions; the single-dusk scene does not track minutes or create urgency through time pressure. The migration provides thematic resonance (transience, passage, cycles) but is swappable with any seasonal boundary. Present in all three gates but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire "to discover the shape of collective grief" is articulated early ("He had spent months trying to discover...he would find the geometry of shared mourning"), drives his shift from mapping to retracing, and is resolved at closure when he understands grief as "not a monument but a mesh." Setup and payoff are strong. Development shows the motivation tested: his mapping project is abandoned in favor of following existing grooves and connecting graves with ribbon, a visible cost. However, the motivation is more intellectualized than viscerally dramatized; we see Elias thinking about grief rather than feeling competing emotional pulls. The desire shapes the arc but remains somewhat abstract, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is introduced in the opening line ("the thundering calm of approaching dusk"), recurs in the grandmother's voice description ("like distant thunder rolling across a still lake"), is invoked twice in the final third ("Through the thundering calm of that dusk," "thundering, perfect calm"), and charges the ending image. The oxymoron fits the liminal atmosphere and the protagonist's meditative intensity. However, repetition trends toward incantation rather than modulation; the tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure. The phrase is vivid and voice-specific but does not evolve with escalation. Lyric reprise is purposeful, thematic fit is strong, but the tone lacks dynamic range to reach higher bands.</comment>
