<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The historian's motivation (anguished joy at forbidden knowledge) is embodied through erratic movement and sensory detail ("trembled not with fear but with the particular anguished joy"). Internal contradiction appears in "weeping and laughing in the same breath" at closure. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract constructions ("atoms of nostalgia," "end of innocence") that read more conceptual than character-particular, and the peak emotional beat uses diagnostic phrasing ("anguished joy") repeatedly rather than fresh embodiment. The final choice to "teach the living" feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the pagoda materialization, erratic dance, and data-core purification, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: "perfection was a poison" reweights the Serene Empire premise with conceptual cost (their suicide note). Orientation anchors (saffron-veil historian, obsidian archive, twilight) land by ~100 words. The closure unit is legible and the lens holds, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt—the historian's transformation is declared ("left the archive changed") more than shown through a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive's bioluminescent fungi, bronze pagoda tiers, and erratic spatial choreography ("stepping left then pausing, spinning once") create a vivid micro-setting. The pagoda's lowest tier opening "only to those who avoided patterns" directly constrains the historian's movement choices. However, much description is ornamental (saffron veil "billowing in shapes that defied geometry") without altering tactics, and the final walk home ("without repeating a single step") feels gestural rather than grounded in the archive's physical logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: acquire forbidden knowledge of the Empire's fall. The historian's erratic movement to bypass guardians provides one meaningful tightening (embodying chaos to defeat pattern-based security), and the dance to purify the data core narrows options. Agency is present in the decision to pursue and the method of chaotic movement. The cost at closure—carrying "the weight of what she had learned"—reads more metaphorical than a visible forfeiture; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the final teaching mission is volitional rather than forced by price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (chaos as cultural immune system vs. perfection as poison) emerges through the Empire's self-destruction and the historian's erratic dance. The final image of walking home "without repeating a single step" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, thematic statements appear overtly: "chaos was not the enemy but the immune system of culture" and "perfection was a poison" in the penultimate paragraph, replacing scene pressure with thesis. The atoms of nostalgia, while evocative, function more as symbolic convenience than earned particulars that constrain earlier choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("saffron-veil historian," "bronze prism pagoda," "anguished joy") with controlled elevation that matches the archival setting and the historian's scholarly POV. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Diction is purposefully heightened ("mathematical tyranny," "scribble of defiance") and consistent. However, repetitive sentence stems appear in the climactic dance sequence ("She had discovered," "She had what she came for," "She left"), and the register occasionally tips into abstraction ("atoms of nostalgia swarmed") that dilutes immediacy during peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "atoms of nostalgia," "violence and grace," "joy sharp as a knife," "grief bright as dawn." In the climax, nearly every sentence carries metaphor without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating cumulative opacity (−0.5). Mixed metaphors: "atoms…like dust motes…like golden fireflies" shifts vehicle mid-beat (−0.4). Template cadence in the final third: "She had…," "She was…," "She left…" (−0.4). Paraphrase loop: the penultimate and final paragraphs restate the historian's lesson about chaos without added detail (−0.2). Total artifact penalty: −1.5. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold phrases ("the particular anguished joy," "steadily unpredictable") recur without variation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise (civilization falls to its own perfection; chaos defeats pattern-based security) offers a conceptually interesting synthesis. The erratic-movement-as-resistance mechanic is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (scholar seeks truth, finds it, teaches the living) follows a template discovery plot. The "atoms of nostalgia" and "end of innocence" read as ornamental rather than inevitable: swapping them for "fragments of memory" and "collapse" would not fundamentally alter the story's logic or closure. The thematic conclusion (perfection = poison, chaos = immune system) is stated rather than discovered through surprising turns.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The saffron-veil historian frames the opening, drives the erratic approach to bypass guardians (middle beat), dances to purify the data core (climax), and carries the knowledge home (closure). Her choices—pursuing the archive, embodying chaos, accepting the burden—create all key turns. Setup early, development across at least three beats, payoff in final image. Causal pressure high; irreplaceable. Minor friction: her final teaching mission is volitional declaration rather than constrained by visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda materializes at twilight (setup), its tiers refract "atoms of nostalgia" (atmospheric development), its lowest tier opens to erratic touch (enables middle choice), and it fades after fulfilling its purpose (closure participation). Present across three beats with evolving function. However, the pagoda is largely a stage rather than a tool the historian manipulates under constraint; its mechanics (why it appears, why seven tiers) remain ornamental. Swappable with "crystal archive core" or similar repository without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Atoms of nostalgia appear early (setup), swarm during the erratic approach and dance (middle beats), and settle "like ash" as blessing/burden (closure image). They cleanse corrupted files and whisper secrets, enabling the purification action. Causal role in at least two beats and charged reprise at end. However, their mechanics are vague (how does contact purify?), and "atoms of nostalgia" could be replaced with "memory fragments" or "data shards" with only cosmetic edits. The concept shapes atmosphere more than it narrows tactical options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is seeded in the title of research subject, dramatized through the erratic gait ("stepping left then pausing, spinning once, advancing backward"), enables bypassing the guardians (causal middle beat), escalates in the non-repeating dance to purify the core (climax), and charges the final walk home "without repeating a single step" (closure). The attribute constrains movement choices with visible cost (the historian must abandon efficient paths) and is indispensable to the story's central mechanic. Setup, development, payoff all present; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Purify" frames the historian's goal ("to purify the historical record"), motivates the chaotic dance that cleanses corrupted files (climax), and achieves the extraction of truth (resolution). The action is causally central to the major turn and could not be swapped (e.g., "decode" or "retrieve") without losing the thematic link between chaos-as-cleansing and the Empire's rigid corruption. Setup early, development in climax beat, payoff in knowledge flood. Minor friction: the purification mechanics remain abstract (how does erratic dance purify data?).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Avoiding patterns" is seeded as the Empire's fatal flaw (second paragraph), becomes the vulnerability the historian exploits ("discovered this vulnerability in her third year"), drives the erratic approach to the pagoda (middle beat), escalates in the non-repeating dance and discordant melody (climax), and defines the final walk home (closure). The method shapes every key choice and tactic; removing it would collapse the story's logic. Setup, development across multiple beats, and payoff all strong. Causal pressure and irreplaceability both high; visible cost in the historian's inefficient, exhausting movements.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive anchors the setting from the opening line, houses the guardians that force erratic movement (middle constraint), contains the bronze pagoda and data core (climax resources), and is the space the historian leaves "changed" (closure frame). The archive's guardians supply immediate tactical pressure, and the bioluminescent fungi mark time (twilight cue). Setup early, development through guardian obstacle, payoff in exit. The archive is essential to the story's spatial and tactical logic, though some atmospheric details (obsidian wall, violet fungi) are ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across the end of innocence" appears in the opening paragraph as the historian's research subject (the Empire's collapse) and returns thematically in the climax realization ("their innocence had ended…with an equation solved too perfectly") and final carrying of "the end of innocence in her breast pocket." The timeframe frames theme but does not tighten on-page decisions or tactics; no live clock pressures the historian's movements. Setup and thematic payoff present, but no middle development that alters pacing or choices. Largely atmospheric and swappable with "fall of the Empire" or "final days."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To pursue forbidden knowledge" is stated early ("her motivation burned like a star in her chest"), drives the seventeen-year research and tonight's approach (setup and middle choices), overrides "every instinct for safety" during the erratic infiltration (causal pressure), and achieves payoff in the knowledge flood and teaching mission (closure). The motivation is dramatized through risk-taking choices and the final "anguished joy" at touching the Empire's suicide note. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal role strong. Minor friction: the motivation is declared more than it emerges through internal conflict or competing desires on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" is named in the opening paragraph ("particular anguished joy of approaching truth"), recurs during the knowledge flood ("weeping and laughing in the same breath, experiencing the anguished joy"), and charges the final image ("her joy sharp as a knife, her grief bright as dawn"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (trembling approach → climactic emotion → burdened exit). However, the phrase "anguished joy" is repeated verbatim rather than varied, and the oxymoron is stated rather than fully embodied through contradictory actions. Setup, development, and payoff present; closure linkage moderate.</comment>
