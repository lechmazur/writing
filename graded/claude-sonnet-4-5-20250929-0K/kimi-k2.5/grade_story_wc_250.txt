<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The guardian remains completely static—no internal contradiction, no micro-choices under pressure, no embodied emotion beyond label-only "spiralingly calm depths." The character performs gestures in service of an abstract lesson but never faces a dilemma, makes a trade-off, or reveals conflicting impulses. Motivation is declared ("to teach darkness the value of stars") but never tested or complicated on the page. The final act (lowering the mirror) carries no visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is present early (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-building through light/shadow orchestration. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs; the guardian begins the ritual, performs it, and ends it with the same stance and no legible cost. The "half-spoken secret" and "lesson" remain abstract declarations rather than dramatized pressure that tightens options or reweights meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vivid, purposeful sensory detail: "cobalt vapors," "liquid glass," "obsidian surface," filtered through a consistent perceptual lens. The dental mirror and shutters function as micro-setting elements that constrain the guardian's method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (dock, boathouse, canal) remains clear and the rain-slicked planks provide tactile grounding, though the setting does not force a choice or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("teach darkness the value of stars") is signaled early but never faces resistance, complication, or a moment where the guardian must adapt tactics or pay a price. No reversal, no tightening, no deepening—the ritual unfolds without friction. The fish breaking the surface is absorbed into the pattern without altering the guardian's approach. Escalation is absent; the piece operates as a static demonstration rather than a pressurized sequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (light/darkness, silence as communication) emerges from concrete images and avoids overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, which edges toward thesis ("darkness was not the enemy but a student"). The dental mirror and shuttered light offer resonant particulars, and the piece resists tidy resolution. However, the final image does not reweight prior material or answer a question the story posed; it restates the guardian's unchanging stance without new pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the prose favors lyric compression, patterned diction ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension"), and a consistent elevated register. POV is stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, the voice remains decorative rather than pressurized—diction does not modulate with urgency because no urgency exists. Purposeful repetition ("spiralingly calm," "half-spoken secret") is taught early but does not evolve or charge the closure beat with new cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>High figurative density without pattern-teaching or payoff in peak beats: "cobalt vapors," "liquid glass," "obsidian surface," "constellations," "tapestry of silver" cluster without adding causal pressure. Paraphrase loops present: paragraphs 5–6 restate "reflection not penetration" and "silent empathy" without advancing knowledge or stakes. Template cadence: "The guardian [verb]" appears in six paragraphs, flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors ("stars," "void," "darkness as student") lack character-specific inflection. Clarity remains intact; deductions route here per the Text Artifact Screen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise (silent figure teaching darkness through light patterns) offers mild freshness in the dental-mirror detail, but the emotional and thematic arc follows a familiar template: isolated figure performs ritual, conveys abstract lesson, completes task unchanged. No transformation, no risk, no earned turn in hindsight. The "half-spoken secret" and "teach darkness the value of stars" read as prompt-template language rather than lived particulars. Swappable setting and stakes suggest insufficient originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout; the guardian orchestrates light and adjusts shutters across multiple beats. However, no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path—observation and demonstration dominate. The final act (lowering the mirror) is completion, not choice with cost. Introduced early, involved in every beat, but causally passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 4), used in at least three beats (catching sky, amplifying light, tracing constellations, final lowering). Returns with mild reweighting in the closure paragraph. However, the mirror does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; it serves as a tool for the unchanging ritual. Present in closure but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Silent empathy" is named (paragraph 12) and illustrated through the guardian's wordless orchestration of light/shadow. It shapes the method (no speech, only gesture) but does not create friction, narrow options, or force a trade-off. The concept functions as thematic backdrop rather than stake-altering pressure. Label-only in key moments.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears three times (paragraphs 6, 14, 19) as a label for the guardian's rhythm and depths. It describes tone but does not constrain action or enable a choice with visible cost. No tradeoff (e.g., calmness preventing urgency, or spiral pattern creating delay) is dramatized. Ornamental recurrence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Weave" is named (paragraphs 7, 13, 18, 20) and enacted through the guardian's gestures, adjusting shutters, and tracing light. It defines the method across multiple beats and appears in the closure paragraph ("adjusted their weave"). However, the weaving does not face resistance or redefine options; it proceeds uninterrupted. Functional but replaceable with "arrange," "craft," or "pattern" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 10), used in at least three beats (paragraphs 10, 17, 20, 24), and mentioned in the final paragraph as a completed map. The shutters create geometric shadows and fractured light, shaping the guardian's demonstration. However, the mechanics do not constrain a choice or impose a cost; the guardian adjusts them freely. Present in closure but not causally charged there.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening line and revisited (paragraphs 1, 23, 27). The cobalt/indigo dock after rain provides vivid sensory grounding and the rain-slicked planks supply tactile detail that anchors the light-pattern work. The wet surface enables the reflected stars and the dock/boathouse geometry frames the guardian's movements. Setting pressures method and charges the final image but does not force a tactical choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears three times (paragraphs 8, 16, 21, 27) as a poetic timeframe. It evokes liminality but does not track elapsed time, impose a deadline, or tighten decisions. The guardian works "as midnight approached" (paragraph 22) without urgency. Time remains atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Stated explicitly (paragraphs 15, 17, 22) and illustrated through the light-pattern demonstration. The desire shapes the guardian's ongoing activity across beats. However, it is never conflicted, tested by resistance, or forced into a trade-off. The guardian teaches without friction; the motivation is told and enacted but not dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named (paragraphs 15, 20, 22) and maintained through the piece's calm, unhurried rhythm and the mirrored/reflected imagery. Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative design. However, it does not modulate under pressure (no pressure exists) or charge the final image with new cost. The tone remains static rather than escalating or reweighting stakes at closure.</comment>
