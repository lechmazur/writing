<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained across the piece, and her choices drive the action. However, her interiority remains largely observational and declarative rather than embodied with contradictory impulses. The custodian's shadow functions primarily as exposition vehicle rather than a relationship under pressure. Internal conflict is asserted ("driven by a singular obsession") but not dramatized through competing desires in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (spoons, shadows, loops, noon) and the final image reconfigures the premise with cost—Elara must close "many more loops" and the awakenings were preservation, not punishment. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (ongoing labor, reframed stakes). Orientation is clean by ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when she completes the first loop and sees the sealed awakenings, reweighting her task. Cost is legible in the final paragraph's commitment to future work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory, floating isle, brass orrery, and frost-traced sigils create vivid atmosphere and the orrery constrains the key action (inserting the key, walking loops). Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than pressure; the floating isle's "eternal twilight" and the observatory's isolation don't materially narrow her options or complicate her task. The orrery charges the closure adequately to enter mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding/restoring the sealed awakenings) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when she aligns the orrery and completes the first loop, forcing the sealed awakening to rupture and revealing the preservation logic. Agency is present (she acts, adjusts her stride, completes the path) but the task unfolds without meaningful obstruction or trade-off—she succeeds on her first attempt with no visible cost beyond future labor. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening reweights options adequately for mid-7s, but the lack of on-page friction or sacrifice caps higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (preservation vs. loss, the geometry of time, shadows as second selves) emerges organically from the spoon-bent reality and loop-closing mechanics. The final image—"she would need to close many more loops"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: restoration is iterative, not instant. The custodian's shadow revelation reweights the bent spoons from catastrophe to salvation. Subtext operates in the imagery (shadows as "sleepers," reality folding "like parchment") without overt thesis statements. Strong thematic cohesion elevates this into high-7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in rune-scholar diction ("old geometries," "recursive loops of spacetime") and the narrative voice modulates with the task's intensity. However, some register drift occurs: "the sealed awakenings had been sealed not as punishment but as preservation" reads as authorial summary rather than Elara's processing. Free indirect style is mostly clean. Diction remains within plausible lexicon for a budding scholar, though phrases like "dimensional fold" and "liminal space" lean toward exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful ("shadows stretching impossibly upward," "reality folded like parchment"). However, paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences appear: "She had to relearn the rhythm of her own movements, adjusting her pace until her stride matched exactly the frequency of the key's ticking" restates the task without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the middle passage ("Each step was a word, each breath a punctuation") reads decorative. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she had discovered," "she understood") dull immediacy. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so penalty is modest (−0.6 to −0.8 range).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Spoons bend reality" and "sealed awakenings" offer a fresh, non-obvious synthesis; the custodian's vanishing shadow and the loop-closing mechanics feel specific to this world. The emotional stakes (restoring trapped souls) and the geometric method (walking loops to close spacetime folds) cohere as a singular vision. However, the "chosen scholar solving ancient mystery" frame is familiar, and Elara's success on her first attempt reduces the sense of earned transformation. The specificity of the bent-spoon catastrophe and the shadow-preservation twist elevate this into solid 7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat, frames the goal ("to find where shadows go at noon"), deciphers logs, inserts the key, walks the loops, and completes the first closure. Her choices drive all major turns. She is causally active and present in the closure. Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage, placing her solidly in the 6.8–7.2 range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The key is introduced early (~para 2), handled in para 4 ("inserted the automaton key"), turned to rewind the orrery (para 5), and its ticking sets the rhythm Elara must match (para 6). It appears in the closure beat ("Elara removed the key") and enables the sealed awakening's rupture. Strong setup, middle use, and closure linkage with irreplaceable mechanics (only this key rewinds the orrery). High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" frame the inciting mystery, shape Elara's research (para 3), and the rupture in para 7 is the story's climax. The custodian's explanation in para 8 reweights the concept (preservation, not punishment) and the final image commits Elara to restoring them permanently. Present across all three gates, drives stakes, and participates in closure with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" appears twice as descriptor ("moved quietly deliberate," para 5; "quietly deliberate in her purpose," final line) but does not constrain or enable a visible choice with cost. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through a decision that could have gone differently if she were impulsive or hasty. Lyric reprise at closure offers modest thematic resonance but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Relearn" appears in the method discovery (para 3: "relearn the forgotten art of closing loops"), the orrery rewinding (para 5), the stride-matching (para 6: "had to relearn the rhythm of her own movements"), and closure framing ("the world could relearn how to hold them," para 8; implicit in "she knew the way," final line). Present in setup, middle causality, and closure context. However, the action is somewhat swappable with "rediscover" or "master." Solid integration across beats but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Closing loops" is introduced as the method in para 3 ("the forgotten art of closing loops"), shapes the middle action (para 5–6: "she began to close the first loop," "walking the circumference," "her path closing precisely where she had begun"), and the final image commits to "close many more loops." The method is mechanically specific (walking a path that completes itself, matching stride to the key's ticking) and irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory and floating isle anchor the scene early (para 1), the orrery supplies the mechanism (para 4–5), and the observatory walls flicker with ghost images (para 6). The setting provides the tool (orrery) and atmospheric charge but does not impose meaningful spatial constraint or alter Elara's tactics. Present in setup and middle with modest causal role; closure participation is atmospheric rather than decisive. Mid-6s for functional but not indispensable integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" frames the backstory ("six months past," para 1; "that terrible afternoon," para 3; "that day," para 6) and the orrery aligns with "that impossible noon six months prior" (para 5). Noon arrives at midnight in para 7, creating the rupture. Time is present in setup and middle logic, and the temporal paradox (noon at midnight) charges the climax. However, no ticking countdown pressures Elara's execution. Solid thematic and causal presence without tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To find where shadows go at noon" is stated as Elara's obsession (para 2), drives her ninety nights of observation, and the answer (para 3: "not in observation but in method") pivots her approach. The sealed awakenings rupture in para 7, revealing the custodian's shadow and answering the question. Motivation frames setup, redirects middle action, and is resolved at closure with cost (she must continue the work). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>
