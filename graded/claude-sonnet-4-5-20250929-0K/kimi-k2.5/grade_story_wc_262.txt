<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated ("to find where unused love is stored") but not dramatized through conflicting choices or trade-offs. Her psychometry journey involves observation and reception rather than agency-driven decisions that foreclose paths. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophical language ("climate-controlled vault," "geometry of redemption") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final departure carries no visible cost or renunciation—she simply walks away with knowledge, planning to return.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, though "when" remains vague beyond "twilight." The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: psychometry deepens through layered images (projectionist's grief, audience heartbreaks, beam of light) and culminates in a conceptual repricing—unused love stored "in the medium that carries image from source to surface." However, the closure lacks felt cost; Elara exits with understanding but no sacrifice or trade-off legible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (the realization shifts from physical archive to luminous corridor), satisfying minimal escalation for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The vintage projection booth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "celluloid teeth biting softly," "ozone and dust," "iron ladder," "warped speakers." The film strip functions as both recurring object and tactile anchor, heating in her hand and coiling like a question mark. Spatial details (booth as skull, theater as body, beam between projector and screen) constrain Elara's psychometric reading and charge the final image of unused love stored in light. The micro-setting of the projection booth and the film strip materially shapes her discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes love isn't in walls or seats but "in the space between the projector and the screen." However, the escalation is passive: she receives visions rather than making choices that narrow options or raise cost. The resolution involves discovery without sacrifice; she marks coordinates and plans to return, deferring any trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, the reweighting is legible but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the persistence and storage of unexpressed emotion—emerges organically from the projectionist's celluloid confessions and the theater's accumulated affect. The central question (where is unused love stored?) receives a resonant answer: not in matter but in the medium itself, the beam of light. However, the ending delivers this insight through assertion ("she had found the warehouse") rather than letting the final image carry it implicitly. The film strip as motif recurs meaningfully, shifting from physical object to neural pathway to "sleeping snake," but the closure leans toward philosophical summary rather than non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara's spatial imagination. The prose carries consistent lyric compression ("celluloid teeth biting softly," "hushed thunder") and purposeful metaphoric density. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for moment-to-moment perception: "climate-controlled vault," "geometry of redemption," "atmospheric weight of every unexpressed tenderness." Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice tilts toward authorial poeticism rather than character-specific texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or thematic layering. However, several beats lean toward overwriting: "hushed thunder" recurs three times as a label without fresh embodiment, and metaphoric density in peak moments (theater as body, film strip as neural pathway, love as warehouse) stacks without clear dramatization. Paraphrase loops appear: "The film strip coiled…like a question mark" and "The film strip snapped taut" repeat the object-focus without advancing pressure. The phrase "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" recurs as a rhythmic motif but remains ornamental, never constraining choice. Clarity remains intact, so artifact penalties stay within the non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry in a vintage cinema to locate stored emotions—offers a fresh synthesis of gothic inheritance and spatial metaphysics. The transformation of "unused love" from abstraction to "the beam of light itself" is specific and memorable. However, the core emotional arc (discovery without sacrifice) follows a well-trodden template: the seeker finds the answer and departs enriched. Elara's journey involves reception rather than risk; she descends the ladder unchanged except for knowledge, deferring any cost to "tomorrow." The lyric register and niche vocabulary (crystal gazer, psychometry, incubate) add texture but do not fundamentally transform the underlying structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs psychometry, but her role is receptive: she reads residue, sees visions, and understands. She makes no on-page choice that narrows options or incurs cost. Her decision to descend and return tomorrow is stated, not dramatized with friction. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is passive observation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The film strip appears in the opening beat (pressed to palm, coiling around fingers), heats during psychometry (middle), and is left "coiled on the projector's platter like a sleeping snake" at closure. It constrains Elara's reading through tactile feedback and recurring physical contact. Its goodbye letters drive the projectionist backstory and reweight at the end when she realizes they weren't farewells to a person. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Goodbye letters are present in setup (rumors, spliced between frames), developed in the middle vision (projectionist's handwriting, celluloid confessions), and reweighted at closure (not farewalls to a person but to "the capacity to love fully"). They shape Elara's understanding but do not narrow her options or force a trade-off. The concept charges the thematic discovery but does not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is labeled early ("mapping emotions as architecture") and recurs in imagery (theater as body, corridor of longing, warehouse with infinite shelves, "geometry of redemption"). However, it functions as descriptive lens rather than constraint. No on-page action is enabled or limited by this trait; it colors perception without forcing choice or incurring cost. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Incubate" is used twice: once as psychometry method ("incubate the residue clinging to its surface"), once as meta-commentary ("to incubate further"). It does not drive a distinct beat or constrain a choice; the psychometry reading could proceed identically with "absorb" or "deepen." The term is present in setup and middle but swappable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is signaled early, performed throughout (visions of the projectionist, theater seats breathing, quartz veins pulsing), and concludes with the discovery at closure. Its mechanics matter: touch triggers vision, duration allows deepening. However, Elara never encounters resistance or cost tied to the method itself; it succeeds smoothly. Present in all three gates, causally involved, but without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The vintage movie palace projection booth frames the entire piece. Elara climbs the iron ladder at opening, works within the booth's spatial constraints (film strip, projector, speakers below), and the booth's architecture (skull metaphor) organizes her discovery. The beam between projector and screen becomes the storage site, directly tying setting to closure. The booth pressures her psychometry and supplies the key resource (the projection apparatus) that shapes outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"While forgotten lyrics search for tune" recurs three times as a rhythmic refrain but never constrains a choice or creates urgency. Time remains untracked; Elara's psychometry could take minutes or hours without affecting tactics. The phrase is ornamental, establishing mood rather than tightening decisions. Present but non-functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is stated early, pursued consistently, and answered at closure (the beam of light). It organizes Elara's psychometry and the thematic discovery. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No on-page friction challenges this desire; she simply follows the vision to its conclusion. Desire shapes the arc but lacks dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" recurs three times and colors the atmosphere: quiet intensity, pressure without sound. The tone modulates subtly (building from "celluloid teeth biting softly" to "atmospheric weight" to the final hum), but remains static rather than shifting with escalation. It charges description but does not transform at closure. Coherent across beats, present in the final image ("the building itself seemed to hum"), but the tonal effect does not deepen with cost.</comment>
