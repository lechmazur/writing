<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marlow's dry-witted precision and atlas-editor temperament are embodied through selective perception (condensation patterns as braille) and diction ("particular disdain," "herald the discovery properly"). The subtly confident stride and decision to walk the ice demonstrate agency under pressure. Internal contradictions are minimal; the protagonist remains steady rather than conflicted, which limits depth. The final transmission feels earned by his methodology and temperament, with the cost residing in solitary exposure and professional stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates sensory particulars (frost-rimed horizon, condensation fractals, thermal vents) that converge at a single point of discovery. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marlow punches coordinates into the uplink, reweighting the frozen lake as "poised to become something else entirely" with visible professional and conceptual cost (every atlas will carry his correction). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the condensation pattern confirms his calculated coordinates, tightening his resolve and the reader's sense of inevitability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly rendered through corrugated skin shedding iron flakes, condensation fractals on glass, and the worrying stillness of ice. The condensation pattern constrains Marlow's method and charges the final image when the outpost "still weep[s] with the pattern" as he transmits. Spatial choreography is clean (outpost to lake center, falcon overhead). Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus: thermal signatures, grid lines, coordinates. The environment is purposeful, not ornamental, and the phrasebook's dog-ear functions as micro-setting object that alters his interpretive tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: completing the survey by finding the singular convergence of rivers before the thaw erases it. The falcon's empty-taloned return signals escalation; the condensation pattern deepens his understanding; walking onto the ice tests commitment. Agency is decision and execution (interpreting the pattern, transmitting coordinates) with visible professional cost (staking reputation on a single vent). One meaningful tightening occurs when the mist halo at the depression confirms his calculations. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the protagonist's steady confidence mutes internal conflict and the felt cost at closure is more professional validation than existential trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: water's memory, the boundary between mythology and geography, the authority of precision over ambiguity. The condensation-as-braille method and the phrasebook's phrase ("The water remembers its birth") seed the thematic terrain without overt statement. The final image—atlases corrected, the lake "poised to become something else"—offers a resonant answer to the question of how the invisible becomes visible. Marlow's unshakeable belief in accuracy charges the ending without moralizing. Minor slip: "heralded by a man with a dog-eared phrasebook and an unshakeable belief" edges toward summary, though it does not flatten the prior scene work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Marlow's atlas-editor idiom ("particular disdain," "subtly confident," "dry authority of an editor correcting a final proof") is consistent and voice-specific. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled, with purposeful compression ("the world folded inward like a paper map"). The falcon dialogue ("Yes, yes, I herald your return") feels slightly performed rather than natural, a minor slip. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure: longer descriptive sentences in observation beats, clipped syntax at the transmission moment. Filter verbs ("watching," "realizing") are sparse and voice-motivated. No pronoun confusion or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance setting, method, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, though a handful of openings recycle structure ("He was," "He stood," "He removed," "He punched"). The phrase "worrying tranquility" appears three times, creating mild template echo. Figurative language (condensation as braille, world folding like a paper map, falcon's gaze accusatory) is coherent and purposeful. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor overwriting: "the unseeable into grid lines and legend" and "the civilized world" edge toward elevated diction without undercutting clarity. Grammar and sequence are clean; no ambiguity or muddle in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The condensation-as-braille method offers a fresh synthesis of cartography and indigenous knowledge. The premise (singular convergence beneath ice where mythology and geography agree) transforms familiar "explorer discovers hidden truth" structure through specific professional idiom and an accumulative lens. The phrasebook as both object and interpretive key is particular to this voice. Minor replaceability: the falcon and dog-ear function as atmospheric props without transforming the arc; a similar signal device could substitute. The ending's "correction" stakes feel credible but not bold; the professional validation mutes emotional or moral risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marlow's atlas-editor trait shapes perception (reading condensation as braille), enables the method, and drives the final transmission decision. Appears in opening paragraph and all major beats. His dry wit and precision are embodied in syntax and micro-choices. Causal pressure: his professional temperament makes the singular convergence discovery inevitable. Closure linkage: the transmission is his culminating act. Cost: staking reputation on coordinates punched into the uplink. Irreplaceable: the editor idiom and subtly confident stride define the voice and method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phrasebook dog-ear is introduced early (page forty-three: "The water remembers its birth") and returns at the depression ("not to translate but to verify, pressing the dog-eared page against the ice"). Two beats; the dog-ear shifts from bookmark to arrow to verification tool. Causal work is moderate: it confirms rather than enables the discovery. Closure participation: absent from the final transmission image, though the phrase echoes thematically. Cost connection is weak; the phrasebook does not constrain a choice. Setup and development gates met; payoff is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Singular convergence is the dominant stake from the opening ("such sources only in whispers...a singular point beneath the ice") and shapes every tactical choice: reading condensation, walking to the depression, transmitting coordinates. Causal pressure: the convergence is the object of the survey and the climax of the discovery. Closure linkage: the final image ("this beginning, this point where the ice surrendered") is the convergence itself. Cost: professional and conceptual—every atlas will carry this correction. Irreplaceable: remove it and the story has no goal or resolution. Present in all three gates and central to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" appears twice: in the opening ("subtle confidence in his ability to render the unseeable") and in the walk across ice ("subtle confidence of a man who knew that borders were arbitrary but gravity was not"). Enables the final choice (walking onto uncertain ice, transmitting with authority). Causal work is light; the trait colors voice but does not constrain a decision with visible cost. Closure participation: the trait underwrites his final statement to the falcon and transmission, but the cost is professional validation rather than a consequence of overconfidence. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Herald" is seeded in the prompt to walk "to herald the discovery properly—not with trumpets, but with coordinates" and returns at the climax: "Yes, yes, I herald your return to the world of flowing water." The action redefines the professional act from validation to proclamation. Causal pressure: the transmission is the herald, and it closes the arc. Closure linkage: the story's final image rests on this heralding ("heralded by a man with a dog-eared phrasebook"). Cost: staking reputation on a single set of coordinates. Specificity: the dry-witted tone of "yes, yes" and the satellite uplink make it irreplaceable. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The condensation method is introduced early ("by reading the pattern of condensation on glass as one reads braille") and used in three beats: observation window fractals, the spiral pointing toward coordinates, the outpost "still weeping with the pattern" at closure. Causal pressure: the method enables the discovery and shapes Marlow's tactics (walking to the coordinates the pattern indicated). Closure linkage: the outpost windows still display the pattern as he transmits, charging the final image. Cost: trusting an unorthodox method stakes his professional credibility. Irreplaceable: remove it and the discovery becomes arbitrary. All three gates met with strong specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly rendered and present throughout. Setup: opening paragraphs establish both. Development: the outpost observation window provides the condensation pattern; the lake is the site of the convergence. Closure: the outpost "stood sentinel behind him" and the lake is "poised to become something else entirely." Causal work: the outpost supplies the method (condensation); the lake is the arena of discovery. Cost connection: walking onto the ice risks physical danger. Minor replaceability: another structure could supply condensation patterns. Strong sensory work elevates but does not reach indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the falcon returns" is signaled early ("When the falcon returned that morning, talons empty and gaze accusatory, Marlow understood that the thaw had finally begun"). The thaw provides urgency but is not tracked beat-to-beat; no live clock tightens decisions. Development: the thaw implies a deadline but does not force a tactical trade-off on the page. Closure participation: the ending mentions the lake "poised to become something else" but the thaw itself does not shape the final image. Setup and weak development gates met; payoff is thematic echo only. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where the rivers begin" is stated early ("He had come to find where the rivers begin") and drives every choice: reading condensation, walking the ice, transmitting coordinates. Causal pressure: the singular convergence is the rivers' origin, and discovering it is the goal. Closure linkage: the final image ("this beginning, this point") fulfills the motivation with visible professional cost (staking reputation on the transmission). Friction: the motivation is declarative rather than internally conflicted, limiting felt ambivalence. Cost: professional validation rather than personal sacrifice. All three gates met with strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is introduced early ("the worrying tranquility of the landscape settled like a held breath") and recurs at the convergence ("the worrying tranquility deepen[ed] into something almost reverent") and in the final paragraph ("The worrying tranquility held, but now it contained possibility"). Tone modulates from suspense to reverence to charged poise, supporting the Accumulative lens. Closure linkage: the tone charges the final image (the frozen lake "poised to become something else entirely"). Cost: the tone underscores the professional and conceptual stakes. Minor repetition (three identical uses) creates mild template echo. All three gates met; tone is coherent and purposeful but slightly over-signaled.</comment>
