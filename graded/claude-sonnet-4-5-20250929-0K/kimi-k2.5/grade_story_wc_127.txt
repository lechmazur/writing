<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority shows professional detachment ("affectionate detachment," "professionally thorough") repeated as labels rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The client's transformation is vivid and physically detailed, but Kael's motivation to "fuse insight with empathy" is asserted more than tested through micro-choices with visible cost. The final moment where Kael commits to "experiments until all half truths become whole" reads as a tidy declaration rather than a renunciation that forecloses a path. Diagnostic label-speak ("counterfeit emotion dealer," "synthetic sorrow and manufactured joy") flattens the professional texture in early beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the client chooses to stay, Kael commits to future experiments, and the grotto "holds its breath" in anticipation, crystallizing options with conceptual cost (Kael's commerce model shifts). The inferred lens is Hybrid (Accumulative texture early, Causal turn at the blotter moment, Situational pressure at the end). Orientation anchors are present by the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the counterfeit empathy becomes real through the grotto's resonance, narrowing Kael's cynical stance. Cost is felt but oblique; the final image charges prior material without decisive action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vividly rendered ("resinous walls glowing with captured sunsets," static electricity as atmospheric whisper) and constrains Kael's sensing method. The blotter petal and vials are handled across beats. Spatial choreography is clear (altar, walls, client approach). The grotto actively participates in the closure by supplying what Kael's chemistry lacks, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Kael's professional POV. The setting shapes the transformation outcome, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the client needs empathy before transformation completes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the counterfeit emotion unexpectedly becomes real through grotto resonance. The reversal is driven by the environment rather than Kael's agency, weakening protagonist pressure. The timeframe ("minutes," "dusk," "by morning") creates urgency but does not visibly alter tactics or force a trade-off on the page. Cost is present (Kael's half-truth model questioned) but remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The escalation fits the Hybrid lens but lacks a protagonist-driven decision that forecloses a live option with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the half-truth motif and the fusion of counterfeit/real emotions through the amber medium. The ending offers a non-literal answer (half truths can become whole in the grotto) but the resolution leans toward declaration ("I will be professionally thorough in my experiments") rather than dramatized cost. The blotter petal's resinous stain is a strong particular, but "professionally thorough" and "affectionate detachment" are repeated as labels without fresh inflection. Subtext operates in the client's choice to stay and the grotto's responsive pulse. The piece avoids moralizing but the thematic question is stated more than it accumulates pressure through particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in tight third limited to Kael. Perceptual signature is consistent (static electricity sensing, professional filter on emotions). Diction is elevated and purposeful ("subsume," "sympathetic vibration," "fossilized gold") and remains within Kael's dealer lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven and carries subtext ("You gave me more than half"). Free indirect style is clean. Rhythmic control is present, though some phrasing ("professionally thorough," "affectionate detachment") repeats without variation under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Voice is distinct and coherent through turns, supporting the tone of detached fascination.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and controlled with strong figurative language ("amber grotto breathed," "silk around a knife"). Information density is high in the transformation beats. However, template cadence appears: "Kael [verb]" stems run across multiple sentences ("Kael stood," "Kael withdrew," "Kael understood," "Kael applied," "Kael felt," "Kael stepped," "Kael looked"), creating mechanical rhythm in the first half. Paraphrase loop: "professionally thorough" appears three times without variation, flattening momentum. The blotter petal's description is vivid but the chemistry exposition ("synthetic compound," "chemical mimicry of compassion") abstracts rather than grounds the moment. Closure beats are clean and propulsive. Apply template-cadence penalty and paraphrase-loop penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise (counterfeit emotion dealer in an amber grotto with static-electric sensing) is fresh and commits fully to its speculative logic. The blotter petal as substrate is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The transformation from counterfeit to real emotion through sympathetic resonance with ancient resin is earned in hindsight by the grotto's established properties. "Half truths" as both commerce and metaphysical principle integrates well. The client's living-amber form is vivid and particular. Risk-taking in the speculative conceit heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The ending avoids neat resolution, leaving Kael's future experiments open. No close echoes of famous material detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes the key choice to continue experiments at closure. The character shapes two beats: applying the compound and witnessing the transformation. However, the grotto's resonance—not Kael's decision—creates the major reversal. Kael's final commitment is stated rather than enacted with visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but agency is diluted by environmental intervention.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blotter petal appears in three beats: withdrawal from pouch, application of synthetic compound, and final inspection when stained with real resin. Its function evolves from substrate to witness of transformation. The petal's ghost-scents and final resin stain charge the closure image. Specific properties (fragrance chemist origin, white paper strip, absorption capacity) matter and are irreplaceable. Causal pressure: the petal enables the empathy transfer and visibly changes state, altering Kael's understanding.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Half truths frame Kael's commerce model, shape the client interaction ("It is a half truth I sell you"), and are explicitly reweighted at closure ("The half truth I sold seems to have found its whole here in the amber"). The concept constrains Kael's methodology and the client's expectations. It drives the thematic question and the ending reconfiguration. Present in setup, middle dialogue, and closure. Causal pressure: the concept defines the product's limitations and the surprise when those limits dissolve. Visible cost: Kael's business model is questioned.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is mentioned three times as a label ("professionally thorough in arranging," "professionally thorough nature demanding documentation," "professionally thorough in my experiments") but does not constrain or enable a key choice with visible cost. The trait describes Kael's style without creating friction or tradeoff. Present in setup and closure but remains ornamental. No beat where thoroughness forces a difficult decision or alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears twice with escalating stakes: first as explanation ("The emotion will subsume your anxiety, swallow it into its structure") and then as observed action ("the manufactured emotion began to subume the creature's fear, wrapping around the panic like silk around a knife"). The action is central to the empathy transfer and the transformation's success. Its mechanics matter and drive the middle beat. Present in setup explanation and middle enactment. Causal pressure: subsumption enables the client's experience and triggers the grotto's resonance. Unique and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Static electricity sensing is signaled early ("the method of sensing through static electricity had never failed in this particular cave"), used to detect the client's approach ("This was how Kael sensed the client's approach—not through sound, but through the prickling charge"), tracks the transformation peak ("the static electricity in the grotto peaked"), and confirms the shift at closure ("Kael felt the static discharge, sensing through the fading electricity that something had shifted"). The method shapes Kael's perception across four beats and its mechanics (amber conducting atmospheric whispers) matter. Irreplaceable and causally active; visible arcs "connecting Kael to the client, the client to the walls, the walls to the petal" enable the unexpected transformation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The amber grotto is present throughout and its properties are indispensable: resinous walls glow and hum in sympathetic vibration, static electricity enables Kael's sensing and later coalesces into visible arcs, and the grotto itself supplies what Kael's chemistry lacks, transforming counterfeit into real. The setting actively drives the major reversal and charges the final image ("The amber grotto held its breath, waiting"). Specific mechanics (ancient tree-resin conducting whispers, static generation) constrain and enable actions. The client's choice to stay hinges on the grotto's unique power. Removal would collapse the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("The transformation completes in minutes," "by morning," "tomorrow's dusk") is signaled early and creates urgency. The client's need to feel before finishing the transformation drives the opening pressure. However, the ticking clock does not visibly alter Kael's tactics or force mid-scene adjustments. Time tightens the initial stakes but does not escalate or constrain choices in the middle beats. Present in setup, mentioned at closure ("The feeling will fade by morning"), but the mechanics do not shape the turning point. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to "fuse insight with empathy" is stated early ("that was Kael's true motivation beneath the commerce, the secret ambition") and referenced at closure ("Kael achieved the fusion long sought: insight into the mechanics of feeling finally married to empathy"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page friction between this ambition and Kael's commercial detachment; the fusion is granted by the grotto's intervention, not earned through Kael's struggle. Present in setup and closure summary, absent from middle pressure. Cost is conceptual but not felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" is signaled early and modulates across beats: Kael maintains professional distance while arranging vials, "understood this need perfectly, though maintained an affectionate detachment from the suffering," and collects empty vials "with affectionate detachment" at closure, smiling "with distant warmth." The tone is coherent and charges the final image by framing Kael's continued experiments. However, the phrase is repeated as a label rather than embodied through contrasting actions. Tone remains static rather than deepening under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure; functional but not indispensable.</comment>
