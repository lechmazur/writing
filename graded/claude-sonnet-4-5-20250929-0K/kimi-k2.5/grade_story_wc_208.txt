<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to honor timewoven alliances and scaffold complexity emerges clearly, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract epiphany rather than embodied contradiction. The night-long work session shows action but the internal conflict between imposing will and listening to material is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost. "Perpetually learning" appears as a label applied three times without constraining a choice. The final walk home carries resolution but the path from stranded sculptor to pavilion commission lacks the friction of genuine struggle—the storm teaches her rather than forcing painful trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Mara's shift from fighting material to collaborating with it). Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening. The magic lantern slide discovery provides one meaningful tightening that reweights her approach to sculpture, and the final image of projecting slides onto future work reconfigures her practice. However, the closure cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no specific path is visibly foreclosed, no felt price paid on the page. The storm's resolution and GPS remaining dead are noted but don't materially constrain her homeward journey or commission plans.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway functions as shelter and teacher, its stone curves and turbine-hum creating atmosphere. Sensory details are selective (salt-crusted stones, wet walls, wind gaps as metronome) and the setting pressures Mara's work through the storm's relentless energy. The archway's medieval bones and compression mathematics charge the final understanding of structure. However, spatial choreography of her driftwood arranging remains abstract—we don't track her hands, the floor layout, or how specific pieces relate spatially. The coastal highway and return walk are generic; the archway does the heavy lifting but could be more tactilely grounded in her sculptor's perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reimagining her sculptural practice—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lantern slide teaches her to read debris as messages rather than abandoned objects, shifting her approach from assemblage to conversation. However, escalation is primarily conceptual; the storm intensifies but Mara's choices don't narrow or face genuine trade-offs. She arranges driftwood "no longer fighting the storm but collaborating" without visible cost—no failed attempts, no sacrifice of a prior method, no foreclosed path. The meditation pavilion commission appears as future opportunity rather than a pressure point tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of honoring accumulated wisdom and yielding to material force emerges from the lantern slide's timewoven alliances and Mara's night work. The closing image of projecting ancient slides onto sculptures offers thematic resonance. However, the piece states its thesis repeatedly rather than earning it through dramatic particulars: "scaffold complexity with simplicity" appears four times, "timewoven alliances" six times, creating echo-chamber effect. The final paragraph's "after the GPS fails, we find our way not through satellite precision but through the layered meanings of place and material" reads as explicit moralizing (−0.6). The slide's shifting images (rope-to-crest, wave-to-name, constellation-in-barnacles) gesture at layered meaning but remain ornamental rather than constraining choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited to Mara throughout. Perceptual signature shows through her sculptor's lens (reading ocean moods, recognizing joinery, letting grain dictate form). However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with crisis urgency: "turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances," and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" repeat as phrase-patterns rather than voiced thought. Filter verbs appear appropriately ("she understood," "she realized," "she saw") without excess. The narrative maintains psychic distance but voice feels more like external narration of a sculptor than the sculptor's own lived perception under pressure. Syntax remains clear but falls into template cadence with repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" openings across adjacent paragraphs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Phrase-pattern artifacts pervade: "timewoven alliances" (6×), "scaffold complexity with simplicity" (4×), "turbine-hum reverie" (4×), "perpetually learning" (3×), "layered meanings" (4×), "magic lantern slide" (6×). These recycled phrases create synonym-loop effect even when not exact duplicates, dulling momentum (−1.0 cumulative in Q7). Template cadence appears in runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" paragraph openings (−0.4). Several adjacent sentences paraphrase without adding pressure: "The slide projected phantom figures… shipwrights, weavers, and stonemasons whose hands moved in collaborative patterns" followed immediately by interpretation of those same patterns. Information density is low; many sentences do one job where two would fit. The opening and closing lines carry voice but middle beats drag with exposition. Clarity remains high; no grammar breaks or sequence errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—sculptor learns from mystical artifact during storm—follows a familiar structure: isolation forces introspection, magical object provides wisdom, protagonist emerges transformed. The lantern slide's mechanics (glass etching that shifts in lightning, projecting phantom craftsmen) feel convenient rather than earned from world logic. Specific details like Japanese joinery and Inuit carving mention disciplines but don't particularize Mara's struggle. The emotional arc could transfer to any artist finding their voice with different names and setting. "Storm as teacher" and "ancient wisdom guides modern practice" are well-worn tropes executed competently but without fresh inflection. The projection-onto-future-sculptures closing gesture nods toward continuation but doesn't transform what came before.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her sculptor identity shapes perception (reading wood grain, recognizing joinery). She makes one key decision—to stop imposing will and let material guide her—which alters her approach in the archway and future commission. However, this choice arrives through received wisdom from the slide rather than internal friction forcing a costly renunciation. Her spirited nature is asserted but not tested; she doesn't struggle against the storm's teaching or resist the slide's lessons. The character constrains the premise (sculptor interpreting artifact) but could be replaced with another artist type with minor edits. Present in closure as she plans projection techniques. Two functional beats (discovery, night work) but neither involves high-stakes agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in five beats: discovery in brass cylinder, tilting toward lightning to see shifting images, studying layered meanings (rope/crest, wave/name, constellation/barnacles), projection flickering across her hands during work, and carried in pocket at closure with plan to project onto sculptures. It enables the key tightening (teaching her to read debris as messages) and charges the final image (projection plan). However, its mechanics remain unexplained—how glass etchings project phantom figures, why it shifts meaning with light—reducing specificity. The slide could be replaced with another mystical teacher-object (enchanted carving, ancestral scroll) with modest rewrites. Early signal (second paragraph), development (shapes understanding), and payoff (future use) all present. Functional across beats but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" appears six times as a label for the concept that craftsmen across centuries share techniques. It motivates Mara's thematic realization but doesn't create on-page pressure or alter tactics. She learns about the alliances through the slide's images and accepts the lesson without friction—no moment where honoring these alliances costs her a prior method or forces a difficult choice. The concept functions as theme vessel rather than stake driver. Present early (paragraph two), recurs frequently, mentioned at closure, but remains abstract. Could be replaced with "ancestral wisdom" or "historical continuity" without changing plot beats. Ornamental use that frames understanding but doesn't constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" appears three times as a character label: once describing her general approach to flotsam, once noting her study of joinery/carving, once at closure. It never constrains a choice or enables a tactical shift with cost—no moment where her openness to learning forces a sacrifice or where refusing to learn would alter the outcome. The trait justifies why she's receptive to the slide's teaching but could be omitted and the plot would run identically with "experienced sculptor discovers artifact." Label-only attribute without on-page friction. No setup-development-payoff structure; mentioned but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Reimagine" appears in two key moments: Mara needs to "reimagine her relationship with the wood she gathered" (paragraph two) and later must "reimagine architecture itself as a form of storytelling" for the pavilion commission (paragraph six). This action frames her shift from imposing will to listening to material, the story's central turn. However, the reimagining happens primarily as received epiphany from the slide rather than through failed attempts forcing a costly pivot. She arranges driftwood differently in the archway but we don't see a prior failed method on the page to make the reimagining decisive. The action shapes the resolution but is swappable with "rethink" or "transform" without structural loss. Present in middle and at closure; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" appears as method in three contexts: the slide contains "layered meanings hidden in imagery" (rope→crest, wave→name, constellation→barnacles), Mara works "through layered meanings" when arranging wood, and the GPS-failure lesson arrives "through the layered meanings of place and material." The method justifies how the slide teaches but its mechanics remain vague—how does perceiving multiple meanings change her wood-joining technique? The specific examples (rope/crest, wave/name) are noted but not used; they don't constrain her archway choices. Method is asserted rather than demonstrated through problem-solving that requires decoding layers to proceed. Present early, recurs, but ornamental. Could be "through careful study" with similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed archway provides the story's primary setting and functions as shelter, discovery site (brass cylinder wedged in stones), work space (floor where she arranges driftwood), and teacher (stone curves demonstrating compression/grace). Its medieval bones and turbine-hum create atmosphere and the wind through gaps becomes her metronome. The archway pressures her work by containing the storm's energy and its architectural logic directly informs her understanding of structure. Spatial details ground key beats: salt-crusted stones, wet walls for projection, gaps as sound source. The setting appears in opening, development (night work), and closure image (stone curves as model). Essential to multiple beats and shapes the final realization about yielding to force. Strong integration; removing the archway would require substantial rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the GPS fails" frames the opening predicament (lost coastal highway, dissolution into gray chaos) and returns in the final paragraph's thematic statement about finding one's way. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—the GPS failure creates initial disorientation but once Mara shelters in the archway, time pressure vanishes. She works "through the night" without urgency; dawn breaks but the GPS "remained dead" is noted without consequence since she "no longer needed satellite guidance." The timeframe sets up a problem that the story then ignores rather than escalates. Present at opening and closure but doesn't constrain middle choices or alter tactics. Functional framing device but swappable with any stranding mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To scaffold complexity with simplicity" appears four times as Mara's stated motivation: her general approach (paragraph four), examining the slide's interplay (paragraph four), trusting wood's language (paragraph five), and the archway's demonstration (paragraph six). This desire drives her thematic understanding and shapes the pavilion commission goal. However, it operates more as intellectual framework than dramatic want—no scene where pursuing simplicity costs her a complex solution, or where complexity tempts her from simple truth. The motivation explains why the slide's lesson resonates but doesn't create friction or force a choice between competing goods. Present early, recurs across beats, informs closure, but remains conceptual. Functional but told rather than tested with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" appears four times describing the archway's sound/atmosphere: stone bones vibrating with turbine-hum (paragraph one), deepening into meditative drone (paragraph three), becoming metronome (paragraph four), and resonating in Mara's mind on the return walk (paragraph seven). The tone creates a consistent meditative-industrial atmosphere that fits the synthesis of ancient craft and modern perception. However, the tone remains static—no modulation with pressure shifts, no moment where the hum intensifies or breaks to reflect escalation. It's a single sustained note rather than a dynamic element that charges turns. The phrase itself feels forced ("turbine-hum reverie") and repeats mechanically. Present in opening, middle, closure; coherent but ornamental. Adds texture without constraining choice or meaningfully charging the final image beyond ambient continuity.</comment>
