<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life remains abstract—we learn his "brazen calm" label but never witness contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cancer consumes with "patient hunger" (poetic but generic), yet no embodied degradation shapes his choices; he works "through declining health" without visible physical or emotional cost altering tactics. The final choice to sit and die is declared rather than earned through prior struggle between competing desires. Motivation stays monolithic: complete the work, with no friction between wanting legacy and wanting comfort.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred; the piece layers copper-wrapping beats toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elias completes his duty and dies as the pillars sing). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. Cost is legible—he forgoes treatment and dies—but the cost feels thematic rather than felt in scene; we never see him wrestle with pain or doubt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pillars pulse with light and species begin sharing space, reweighting the orchard's function.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The temple orchard and living stone pillars supply vivid, purposeful images (stone "breathing with subterranean tides," bioluminescent veins). Spatial choreography is clean across pruning, wire-wrapping, and final rest. The copper wire and oak branches constrain Elias's method and charge the closure image (wires gleaming, pillars singing). Sensory detail leans visual; touch, scent, and sound of orchard work remain generic. No occupational depth (arboriculture, grafting technique) pressures a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake: complete the interspecies embassy before death. Pressure accumulates through seasonal markers (autumn→winter→spring→summer→final month), but no on-page reversal tightens options—Elias wraps wire methodically without setback or surprise. The pillars' hum and species' coexistence are outcomes, not complications that force tactical shifts. Cost is declared (cancer, death) but never dramatizes a moment where pain or fatigue alters his method. Agency reads as endurance without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—interspecies respect, biological negotiation, legacy—emerges organically from copper-mediated symbiosis. The final image (pillars singing their first chord as Elias dies) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or sermon mars the ending. Weakness: the "brazen calm" and "gently systematic" approach flatten ambiguity; Elias never doubts or resents his predicament, so the theme feels thesis-forward rather than discovered through conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices orchard details with quiet precision—but voice converges toward elevated literary diction ("botanical fear," "gospel of coexistence") that doesn't modulate under stress. Diction remains stable yet slightly generic; many sentences open with subject-verb templates ("He wrapped," "Elias documented," "Visitors remarked"). Psychic distance stays mid-range throughout; no intimate compression during peak beats. No dialogue to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no loops or scaffold. Information density is uneven—many sentences restate the copper-wire mechanism without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in adjacent beats: "He wrapped the conductive metal... The diary explained... He wrapped wire... The living stone began..." Figurative language ("patient hunger," "living starlight," "gospel of coexistence") clusters without clear pattern-teaching or payoff. Rhythm is steady but rarely varies for urgency. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Premise—dying caretaker builds living embassy via copper-wrapped trees—synthesizes familiar tropes (terminal diagnosis, botanical mysticism, interspecies harmony) without obvious transformation. The copper-as-translator detail is specific and fresh. Emotional arc (calm acceptance throughout) lacks contradiction or risk; Elias never veers from his plan. No proximity echoes detected. The piece commits to its vision but plays it safe, avoiding bold perspectival or structural choices that might heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's choices—consult diary, wrap wire progressively, sit to die—create the accumulative structure. Setup clear (line 1), middle beats involve methodical wrapping, closure shows him seated as pillars sing. Decisions are systematic but not contested; he never adapts tactics under pressure. Cost is conceptual (forgoing treatment) rather than a pivot. Two-gate strong (setup, payoff); middle development is present but not causal. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, minus swappability −0.5, minus summary-only cost −0.4 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in beat 5 (predecessor's diary behind loose stone) and informs Elias's method (copper-wrapping). It reappears in his lap at closure ("original botanical diary resting... like a prayer book"). Three gates met (setup by first third, middle explanation, closure reprise). The diary enables but does not constrain; Elias could have discovered the method otherwise. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus swappability −0.6, minus ornamental final use −0.3 = ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Architectural secrets (pillars as calcified neural networks, founders' biological negotiation) frame the premise and shape Elias's wire-wrapping tactic. Setup clear (beat 6), middle explains copper-as-translator, closure shows pillars singing. The concept is present but does not tighten options or create friction; it functions as backstory that justifies the method. Score: early signal +0.7, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, minus swappability −0.5 (any mystical conduit would work), minus summary-only −0.4 = ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is labeled twice ("His approach remained gently systematic," "worked methodically") but never constrains a choice or trades off against urgency. It describes his manner without altering tactics. No visible cost for being systematic rather than rushed. Score: early mention +0.3, label-only −0.6, no beat involvement 0, no closure linkage 0, no cost 0 = ~4.2. Missing middle development cap at 3.4 does not apply since the label appears mid-story; generic label penalty −0.3 yields ~3.9, but two mentions lift slightly to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Remodel" anchors the premise (beat 8: "remodel the orchard into... a living embassy") and recurs (beat 28: "to remodel the world he would leave behind"). All three gates met: setup by first third, middle beats show progressive wrapping, closure states he remodeled the world. The action is load-bearing—removing it would collapse the frame. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure +1.2, cost connection +0.5, specificity +0.6 = ~7.8 (cap at 8.4 band edge for strong integration without perfect irreplaceability).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Copper wire wrapped around oak branches is signaled beat 9, repeated across beats 10–13, 22, and appears at closure (beat 28: "copper wires gleamed"). Three gates met. The method is specific and its mechanics (bioelectrical pathways) matter. Weakness: the wrapping is described rather than dramatized with setback; the wire never fails or requires adjustment. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.7, minus summary-only −0.6, minus no cost −0.3 = ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Temple orchard within living stone pillars anchors setting from beat 3 onward and supplies the closure image (pillars singing). Three gates met. The pillars pressure Elias's choices (which trees to wire, where to wrap) and the orchard's spatial logic (trees reaching toward pillars) is coherent. Weakness: the setting enables but does not constrain—he never runs out of wire or encounters a pillar that resists. Score: early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, causal pressure +0.9, minus no constraint −0.6, minus ornamental description −0.4 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Six-month timeframe is signaled beat 1 and tracked via seasons (beats 12, 20, 24). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is present (seasonal markers) but the clock never tightens a choice—Elias works at the same pace regardless. The deadline charges the closure (he dies on schedule) but does not alter tactics. Score: early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, minus no tactical pressure −0.8, minus summary-only tracking −0.4 = ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Foster interspecies respect" is stated beat 8, restated beat 15, and echoed at closure (beat 29: "teaching interspecies respect"). Setup and payoff met; middle development shows results (ants, lichen, species sharing branches) but no friction between the desire and competing wants. The motivation is told, not dramatized through conflicted choice. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus told-only −0.7, minus no friction −0.5 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Brazen calm" appears beats 2 and 20, describing Elias's manner. Tone is coherent—no panic or despair—but static; it does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image beyond label. The calm is asserted, not embodied in syntax or rhythm shifts. Score: early mention +0.4, two mentions +0.9, closure echo +0.5, minus label-only −0.6, minus no modulation −0.5, minus static mood −0.3 = ~5.1.</comment>
