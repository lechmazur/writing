<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand thresholds is present but her emotional interiority reads ornamental rather than contradictory—"featherly determined" functions as poetic label without cost. The father's maze becomes a sanctuary concept told through exposition rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that force tradeoffs. Internal conflict is implied in the phrase "lost child, though 'lost' implied she wished to be found, which she did not" but never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final threshold crossing feels inevitable from thematic design rather than from prior choices that foreclosed alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors drift: who Elara is becomes clear only after dense atmospheric description; the terrace's geothermal suspension and the maze's "folded space" location remain abstract past the 120-word mark without spatial grounding (−0.4). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with lyric compression, and the final image—Elara stepping into the maze carrying weather codes—offers Charged Poise where options crystallize. However, cost remains conceptual and felt rather than visible; no prior choice is demonstrably foreclosed on the page, weakening the closure's bite. The piece teaches its pattern of spiraling metaphor early enough, and the RR form is legible, so the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace charges the final image through its seventeen sunsets and crystalline facets that multiply Elara's reflection, and the oak grain becomes a tactile map that constrains her interpretive method. Spatial choreography within the terrace remains clear—drafting table, floorboard, eastern wall exit—and sensory details (glass vibration, knot indentation) anchor perception. Geothermal currents and "folded space" read as purposeful metaphysical setting rather than realist anchors, consistent with the post-butterfly-effect premise, so plausibility standards bend appropriately. The terrace's rotating light and the maze's vegetative geometry recur with escalating charge at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred versus hollow—is signaled early and coheres through the accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through spiral grain discovery, logbook alignment, and the final approach to the eastern wall, offering one meaningful deepening when Elara realizes "to become the threshold" herself. However, no prior option is visibly foreclosed; the decision to step through feels thematically inevitable rather than costly, and no tactic shift or trade-off appears on the page. The "necessary distances" concept shapes framing but does not narrow live choices under dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the spiraling wood grain, weather codes as liturgical instructions, and "necessary distances" rendered as sanctuary geometry—concrete particulars anchor the abstract question of sacred thresholds. The final image of cornstalks as "invitations to maintain the precise, holy distance between losing and finding" reweights prior material without overt moralizing, and the father's maze-as-intervals offers a non-literal answer earned through tactile discovery. Subtext operates in the oak's memory and the logbook's dual meteorological/emotional syntax. Minor slip: "become the threshold" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward theme statement, though embedded in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is controlled. Diction ("featherly determined," "mathematical tenderness," "liturgical instructions") sustains an elevated, lyric register throughout, matching the post-collapse metaphysical premise. However, the prose occasionally drifts into ornamental abstraction—"spectral geometries," "the fractured hush"—that reads as atmospheric overlay rather than Elara's perceptual signature under pressure. Perceptual filtering remains generic; urgency does not compress or sharpen her noticing in the final approach. Voice is consistent but not character-particular enough to feel irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure: "spectral geometries," "cartographer reading braille," "bow to one another without touching," "congregation of herself" cluster in adjacent lines, muddling rather than sharpening sense (−0.5). "Featherly determined" in the opening and "fractured hush" in the final paragraph read as stock literary ornament. Two paraphrase loops: the second paragraph's "lost child" claim and "necessary distances" recur in the third paragraph with synonym variation but no added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence appears in the sequence "She had found…She ran…She stood…She approached…She placed," relying on subject-verb-object stems without syntactic variety (−0.4). Information density is high in the grain-analysis beat, but scaffolding phrases ("she realized," "she understood now") externalize epiphany rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of corn maze architecture, pilot weather codes, wood-grain cartography, and post-butterfly atmospheric collapse offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The logbook-as-liturgy and necessary distances as vegetative geometry feel fresh and purposefully integrated. However, the core emotional arc—seeking the lost father's hidden message and stepping into his designed sanctuary—follows a familiar template: the child decoding the absent parent's symbolic legacy. Transformation occurs through the specificity of wood grain and meteorological syntax, lifting the piece above generic execution, but the final step into the maze reads as thematically preordained rather than a bold risk that heightens stakes with genuine uncertainty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (corn maze architect's lost child) is present throughout and makes the final choice to step into the maze. Setup clear, middle beat (analyzing grain), closure participation (steps through doorway). However, her agency reads as interpretive and contemplative rather than decisional with visible cost—she observes, realizes, and accepts rather than choosing between competing live options. The "lost child" identity frames her search but does not constrain a tactic or force a tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pilot logbook weather code appears in two beats: discovery three days prior (told) and alignment with wood grain in the present scene. The codes reweight from meteorological symbols to "liturgical instructions" and "necessary distances," charging the closure by providing the grammar Elara carries into the maze. Setup and closure participation present; middle development (the alignment beat) enables her final interpretation. Swappability moderate—another symbolic text could serve, though the weather-distance metaphor is specific.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" shapes stakes (understanding sacred versus hollow thresholds) and tactics (interpreting the maze as sanctuary of intervals). Present in opening exposition, returned in the grain-analysis beat ("the exact breadth required between human intention and natural consequence"), and charged in the final image ("precise, holy distance between losing and finding"). The concept constrains her interpretive frame and directly articulates the story's thematic question with visible cost (she must embody the distance to understand it). All three gates met; causal pressure moderate but closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears once in the opening paragraph as a label without constraining or enabling any on-page action. No cost, no tradeoff, no tactical consequence. Ornamental diction that could be removed without altering any beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears in the grain-analysis beat ("she could intuit the coordinates") and governs her method of interpreting the wood and aligning it with the logbook. Setup in opening third, development in middle (the grain-analysis turn), and closure participation (she "finally recognized" the maze patterns). The action is specific to her process and not easily swappable, though "interpret" or "decode" could replace it with minor edits. Two beats, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Analyzing the grain in wooden furniture is introduced early (second paragraph: "analyzing the grain…with the intensity of a cartographer"), drives the middle beat (tracing spirals, feeling knot indentations, aligning with logbook), and enables the closure realization ("patterns she finally recognized"). All three gates met; the method is specific, irreplaceable (no other method appears), and causally essential—without the grain analysis, she cannot access the escape routes or interpret the maze. Two beats, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Drifting prism terrace is introduced in paragraph one, houses the entire scene, and charges the final image through its seventeen sunsets and crystalline facets that multiply Elara's reflection into "a congregation of herself." The terrace supplies the eastern wall doorway that serves as the threshold exit. Setup, middle presence (shifting beneath her, refracting light), and closure participation all present. The setting constrains the exit and metaphorically mirrors the "necessary distances" theme, but does not force a tactical choice or trade-off. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" appears in the opening and sets the metaphysical premise (atmosphere's predictable rhythms unraveled, world became "necessary distances"). The timeframe justifies the drifting terrace and folded-space maze but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Present in setup and closure frame (the "fractured hush" callback), but passive—no urgency or tactical pressure. Functional backdrop, replaceable with another post-collapse premise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To discover why some thresholds feel sacred when crossed and hollow when ignored" is stated in the opening and drives Elara's interpretive search. The motivation surfaces in middle beats (the maze as sanctuary of intervals) and resolves in the penultimate realization ("to become the threshold"). Setup and closure participation present; middle development moderate (her analysis serves the question). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction—no competing pull (safety, grief, doubt) pressures the choice. Cost is conceptual (embodying the threshold) rather than visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" appears in the final paragraph and governs the lyric, elevated register throughout—suspended terrace, spectral geometries, quiet epiphanies. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly (contemplative opening, intensifying grain-analysis, poised ending). The hush charges the final image of Elara's "footsteps light, her resolve weightless." Closure participation strong, but the tone remains static (no sharp break or cadence shift under peak pressure). Setup implicit, payoff explicit, middle presence consistent.</comment>
