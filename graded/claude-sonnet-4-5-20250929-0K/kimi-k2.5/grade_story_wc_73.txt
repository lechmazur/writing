<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's grim optimism and cognitive approach are embodied through the charcoal proofs and dice handling, but her interior remains abstract and philosophically over-articulated rather than contradictory in scene. The final choice to "step through" feels more conceptual than psychologically earned; her hesitation at the brass door is told rather than dramatized with cost in the present. "Grim optimist by necessity, smiling at the cosmic absurdity" reads as a label that the narrative then illustrates rather than a lived contradiction acting under pressure. Dice and proofs function as symbolic tools but don't constrain her motives in a way that creates visible internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives cleanly (who, where, what) and the accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds through mathematical imagery, the chipped die's asymmetry, and the fissure. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the staircase "could not abide imperfection in its mathematical perfection"—with visible cost (she steps through, forfeiting the cycle). The dice-on-equation rupture delivers a decisive shift, though the causal mechanics lean heavily on metaphor ("subterranean frequency," "profound ringing silence") rather than concrete dramatized progression. One meaningful tightening is present; cost is legible in the final image of "warm and real and finite."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The staircase is vividly particular: "marble that never warmed, never weathered," amber light "neither dawn nor dusk," and the recurring brass handle anchor spatial and sensory detail in service of pressure. The micro-setting—dice in pocket, charcoal on wall, the grain of the handle—constrains her final choice and charges the closure image. Sensory selection (coolness of metal, hum in teeth, texture of roughness) reflects urgency and filters through Elara's mathematically inflected POV. The staircase's infinite architecture shapes her psychological trap and the rupture that frees her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape the staircase via acceptance of imperfection) is signaled early and tightens through the proof-writing beat. The reversal—abandoning observation to break the cycle—arises from her agency (the equation, dice placement) with visible cost (forfeiting the infinite climb, stepping into the fissure). Under an accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and the pattern-break of asymmetry. However, the escalation leans conceptual rather than embodied; her "trembling knees" and bleeding fingernails don't alter tactics on the page, and the choice to write proofs feels inevitable from the start rather than a risk forced by narrowing options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (perfection as trap, asymmetry as liberation) emerges organically from the chipped die, the proofs, and the rupture without overt statement. The final image—"the gritty, golden, impossible texture of the chance she had lost, now preserved in the palm of her hand like the last roll of loaded dice, warm and real and finite"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer rooted in specifics. The brass handle memory recurs with shifted meaning, charging closure. The piece resists moralizing; "grim optimist" and "boundless confinement" frame paradoxes that the ending resolves through image rather than thesis. Minor slip: "the seed of its own cancellation" and "observation" mechanics brush abstraction in the proof-writing paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (mathematical, paradoxical) colors diction ("coefficient of regret," "axiomatic weight"). However, register drifts elevated in peak beats: "abandon observation," "participate," "profound ringing silence," "manifest" read academic rather than urgent, flattening immediacy when Elara inscribes the final theorem and steps through. Purposeful compression ("Up is down...sideways is the universe's private joke") works in early whispers but the proof-writing beat stacks abstraction without embodied micro-choices. No head-hopping; the voice is consistent but tonally uniform across emotional peaks and valleys.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades without pattern-teaching or clear payoff: "pendulum," "perpetual motion engine of stone and sorrow," "cosmic absurdity," "dangerous potential of rupture," "waterfalls of logic" cluster in adjacent sentences, some mixing vehicles (sorrow has no engine, rupture has no potential). Template cadence in early paragraphs: "She had counted...she would whisper...She could still feel...She stopped...She withdrew" runs identical stems. Paraphrase loop: "the staircase was infinite not merely in its architectural length, but in her psychological refusal to descend" restates the prior paragraph's trap without new pressure. Information density is high in the dice and proof beats, but figurative muddle and scaffold in the climb/reflection sections dull propulsion. Closure image ("gritty, golden, impossible texture") is vivid and specific.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—infinite staircase escape via mathematical proof of observer-dependency, charged by a chipped die's asymmetry—is specific and non-obvious, transforming the Escher-staircase premise through the protagonist's cognitive method. The emotional arc (regret → acceptance of imperfection) ties to the conceptual apparatus organically. However, the core frame (trapped on symbolic architecture, philosopher escapes via insight) echoes allegory templates; the transformation rests on the dice's flaw and the brass-handle memory, which are fresh particulars. Risk is present in the proof mechanics and the rupture beat, but the resolution feels conceptually predetermined rather than earned through unpredictable character friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Grim optimist: Present early ("smiling at the cosmic absurdity"), shapes her persistence and the proof approach, and colors the final step through the fissure. The trait enables her to endure and theorize under pressure, but the label is declared rather than contradictorily acted; her choices (write proofs, place dice, step through) align with optimism without visible cost from the grimness. One key turn (final step) but the trait could swap for "determined rationalist" with minor edits. Two beats (early whisper, final step); closure linkage moderate; specificity mid.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dice: Introduced early (in pocket, "ivory older than memory, one chipped"), handled mid-story ("rolled in her palm," "damaged one settling against her thumb"), and placed on the equation at closure ("snake eyes, the chipped die's flaw making the pips uneven"). The chipped corner is the key to the rupture ("asymmetry was the key, the glitch in the system"). Three distinct beats; causal pressure high (the flaw enables escape); closure linkage strong; irreplaceable (perfection cannot house the flaw). Minor gap: the dice measure "weight of choices she no longer possessed" early but shift to active agent later without clear pivot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perpetual motion: Frames the staircase ("perpetual motion engine of stone and sorrow"), shapes her trap (observer-dependency), and is broken at closure ("proof that perpetual motion required an observer to remain perpetually trapped"). Early signal strong; the concept drives the proof approach and the rupture; causal pressure high; closure participation direct. The mechanics (marble hum, stone rupture) lean metaphorical but the concept alters options on the page. Specificity high; the ending would fail without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Balancedly daring: Label appears once ("Her approach was balancedly daring: too safe and the proof would remain an abstraction, too reckless and the logic would collapse"). The proof-writing and dice-placement are calculated risks, but the trait is told rather than demonstrated through visible tradeoff or cost. No second beat; no closure participation; swappable with "cautious boldness" or "measured risk." Ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Rupture: Signaled mid-story ("dangerous potential of rupture"), enacted at closure ("The stone ruptured...a tear in the fabric of the steps"), and redefines options (reveals the brass handle texture, allows escape). The rupture is the climax; causal pressure is high (triggered by asymmetry); closure linkage total; irreplaceable. Three beats (potential, enactment, effect); the action could not swap without breaking the ending. Specificity strong ("not with sound but with a profound, ringing silence").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs: Signaled early (paragraph 3 hints at "geometrically" folding infinity), enacted mid-story (charcoal theorems, "coefficient of regret," "axiomatic weight"), and placed on the wall at closure to trigger the rupture. The method shapes her tactics and the final proof is the fulcrum. Two beats (writing, placement); causal pressure solid; closure linkage strong. Minor swap risk: "logical argument" could replace "proof" with edits, but the mathematical idiom is specific and colors her voice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Infinite staircase: Present from line one ("spiraled upward and downward into gray oblivion"), pressures every choice (the climb, the count, the hesitation, the descent refusal), supplies the wall for the proofs, and remains behind her at closure ("still turning in its eternal revolutions"). Four beats minimum; causal pressure total (the trap is the stakes); closure participation direct (she steps through its rupture, it persists after). Irreplaceable; the story fails without it. The landing's amber light and marble hum are micro-setting details that shape the proof moment.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation (capture texture of missed opportunity): Stated early ("Elara sought to capture the texture of a missed opportunity"), dramatized through the brass handle memory ("the precise moment of hesitation that had stretched into eternity"), and fulfilled at closure ("the exact texture...the grain of that brass handle...now preserved in the palm of her hand"). Early signal strong; the desire drives the proof method (to manifest the memory); causal pressure high; closure linkage total. Friction between wanting the texture and fearing descent creates the trap. Three beats; irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Boundless confinement: Coherent from start ("walls receded infinitely yet pressed against her lungs") through turns ("infinite not merely in its architectural length, but in her psychological refusal"), modulates with pressure (hum, trembling, rupture silence), and charges the final image ("warm and real and finite" against "perpetual and unbroken"). Tone shapes every beat; the paradox (infinite space, trapped movement) is the story's texture. The amber light and sepia unreality sustain the mood without static repetition. Closure participation strong; the shift from boundless to finite is the emotional landing.</comment>
