<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias is motivated by discovered compassion and clear technical expertise, yet his interior life reads largely as reportage rather than embodied contradiction. The "conspiracy of kindness" framing arrives close to diagnostic label-speak ("profound emotional weight," "slyly heartfelt") and his trembling hands function more as stage direction than visceral stress. The final choice to falsify reports is stated but not dramatized with visible cost on the page—no supervisor confrontation, no peer discovery risk made concrete. Competence overwhelms struggle; he executes flawlessly without genuine on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land promptly. The closure unit—Elias's decision to preserve the old system and falsify logs—constitutes Earned Stasis (refusing the upgrade demand) with conceptual cost (professional deception, conspiracy across time). However, the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized: we are told he risks pension and certification, but no supervisor appears, no inspector threatens, no peer challenges. The decision feels inevitable from the discovered letter rather than a difficult pivot earned by prior on-page pressure. Drive lens reads Causal-leaning Hybrid (discovery → decoding → refusal), coherent but with low tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amphitheater-volcano setting is vivid, selective, and charged: geothermal breath, sulfur cracks, calcified aqueducts, and structural warnings all constrain access and underscore fragility. The surveyor's chain and brass fittings recur purposefully, grounding technical work in tactile specificity. The final image of the amphitheater "sighing with gratitude" edges toward overt symbolism but the prior spatial choreography (fluted columns, tiered seating, condemned sector) remains legible and pressure-supportive. Micro-setting (chain, gaskets, regulator housing) charges the ending gesture without becoming a postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve ancient safety versus modern output demand—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet the conflict unfolds almost entirely in retrospective summary: the "supervisors demanded" upgrade exists off-page, the decoding took "seventy-two sleepless hours" in ellipsis, and the final defiance (falsified reports, hidden modifications) occurs without on-page resistance or discovery risk. One meaningful tightening appears (the tremor, the decoded compassion reweighting his role) but escalation relies on assertion rather than dramatized reversals. Agency is present but the visible cost at closure is muted—no confrontation, no immediate trade-off, only stated future consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—harmonizing conflicting values, compassion encoded in infrastructure—emerges organically from the discovered satchel and the floodgate's dual function. The final choice to honor restraint over profit resonates without overt moralizing. However, phrases like "conspiracy of kindness," "profound human connection across the gulf of centuries," and "dappled resolve" tip toward thematic echo and label-speak, pulling the reader out of scene pressure into abstract philosophizing. The core question (progress vs. mercy) is non-obvious and earned through concrete detail (beeswax seals, brass fittings), but the ending's emotional charge is told more than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature leans technical (spectrometer traces, hydraulic choreography, graduated chain measurements) but interior texture often slips into elevated academic register ("crystalline clarity," "slyly heartfelt," "moral imagination") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic for a grease-stained machinist. The prose is legible and purposeful but the diction converges on an eloquent narrator voice disconnected from embodied stress—under peak pressure (tremor, discovery risk) syntax remains uniformly ornate rather than compressing or fracturing. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "remembered") are functional but cluster without urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every clause advances setting or stakes. However, the prose suffers from pervasive overwriting: figurative language ("stone ribs expanding," "whisper rather than roar," "dappled resolve," "conspiracies of kindness") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating decorative drag. Template cadence runs appear ("he had worked," "he had discovered," "he had risked," "he would not authorize") and synonym loops recur (tremor/tremble, breath/exhale/sigh). Mixed metaphors cluster: the amphitheater simultaneously "groans," "breathes," and "sighs," blurring coherence. The final third remains ornate where compression would serve momentum. Baseline −0.8 for density overload, −0.4 for template stems, −0.3 for metaphor muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—ancient engineers encoding moral philosophy in hydraulic design—offers a fresh synthesis of infrastructure, archaeology, and ethical calculus. The surveyor's chain as both measurement tool and talisman, the adhesive spectrometry discovery, and the volcano amphitheater setting all feel specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (lone expert honors secret wisdom against bureaucratic pressure) follows a familiar template without strong transformation. The cryptographic compassion conceit is inventive but the final defiance (falsified logs, hidden repairs) resolves predictably. Risk-taking in structure and voice remains modest; the piece commits to its premise but does not push into boldness or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his technical decisions (analyzing adhesive, decoding letters, adjusting the regulator, falsifying reports) drive the plot. However, most choices occur in summary (decoding took seventy-two hours off-page; the final modifications are recounted, not dramatized). He appears in setup, middle reflection, and ending action, meeting two gates, but causal pressure is diluted by retrospective framing. His ingenuity is asserted more than demonstrated in live problem-solving beats. Mid-band: functional but replaceable with another expert role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain is introduced early, handled physically (wound around forearm, traced for distance measurement, clinked against brass, coiled and placed in satchel), and explicitly reweighted at closure as "both tool and talisman." It appears in at least three distinct beats and the final image links it directly to the theme of measurement and moral connection. However, its causal pressure is modest—it measures distance but does not alter tactics or constrain a key choice. The reprise charges the ending but does not transform prior stakes. Solid integration across beats and ending, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion frames the discovered satchel and the decoded message, shapes Elias's realization of his "true role," and informs the final choice to preserve the ancient system. It appears in setup (the discovery), middle (the decoding), and ending (honoring the failsafe design). However, it functions largely as theme rather than on-page tactical constraint—the compassion is a discovery about the past, not a live pressure that narrows Elias's options. The concept reweights his motivation but does not create visible cost or a second-beat complication. Meets setup and payoff; middle development is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears once as a descriptor of Elias's movements ("his movements slyly heartfelt") but is not dramatized through distinct action or tradeoff. The phrase reads as label-only affect rather than a trait that constrains or enables choice. It does not recur, shape tactics, or carry cost. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Trembling appears twice with different sources: first the earth trembles (seismic shudder), then Elias's hands tremble against the regulator and again at the final bolt—"not from fear of discovery, but from profound emotional weight." The action signals pressure and emotional stakes, appears in setup and ending, and the shift from geological to personal tremor reweights meaning. However, it is reactive and does not drive a key turn; his hands tremble, but the choice to adjust the regulator and falsify logs proceeds regardless. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Analyzing adhesive with a portable spectrometer is the method by which Elias discovers the "hidden significance" (pine resin and charcoal traces) that leads to decoding the encrypted compassion. It appears in setup, is causally essential to the discovery, and primes the ending choice. However, the analysis itself occurs in a single summarized beat without dramatized problem-solving or tactical constraint—the spectrometer provides the answer cleanly, then disappears. Functional and irreplaceable for the discovery but not developed across beats or tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amphitheater inside the dormant volcano anchors every beat: geothermal pressure, structural warnings, condemned sector, calcified aqueduct, fluted columns, corroded brass fittings, and the building's "breath" all constrain Elias's access and underscore fragility. The setting is introduced immediately, recurs with evolving sensory detail (sulfur, spiderweb cracks, tiered seating), and the final image ("the amphitheater sighed around him") directly charges closure. The volcano's dual nature (power source and threat) mirrors the floodgate's dual function (irrigation and safety). The setting is indispensable to logic, tone, and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" functions as atmospheric texture rather than a ticking clock. The phrase recurs ("the building breathed again") and geological time (three centuries, seventeen years, three days prior, seventy-two hours) is mentioned, but no live deadline tightens Elias's choices on the page. The tremor signals urgency but does not compress decision windows or force faster action. Time is present thematically but does not constrain tactics. Functional mood-setting; replaceable with other atmospheric cues.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Harmonizing conflicting values (irrigation vs. safety, progress vs. restraint, output vs. mercy) is Elias's explicit realization and frames his final refusal to authorize the upgrade. The motivation is seeded in the discovered letter, articulated mid-story ("his true role"), and drives the ending choice. However, the conflict is largely internal and retrospective—no on-page scene dramatizes a supervisor demanding the upgrade or a peer challenging his stance. The desire is clear and thematically charged but the friction between want and cost remains asserted rather than tested in live interaction. Meets setup, development (realization), and payoff, but lacks visible on-page resistance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once, late, as a descriptor of Elias's emotional state ("the dappled resolve of those who had built"). The tone throughout is earnest, reverent, and ornate, modulating slightly with the tremor's introduction but remaining consistently elevated. "Dappled" (implying light-and-shadow variability) is not dramatized through tonal shifts or contradictory impulses; the prose maintains steady solemnity. The phrase feels ornamental rather than integrated across beats. Tone is coherent but static; the single mention does not charge the final image or reflect genuine pressure modulation.</comment>
