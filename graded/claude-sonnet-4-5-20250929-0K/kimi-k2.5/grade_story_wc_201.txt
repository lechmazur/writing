<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena's proprioceptive enhancement is established but her interior state relies heavily on label-like processing ("algorithm of forgiveness," "mathematics of mercy") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice—walking forward after the strap falls—feels more like a declared resolution than an earned renunciation with visible cost. No secondary character appears to test motives under pressure, and the interiority reads as therapeutic self-diagnosis ("trauma responses," "somatic memory") rather than embodied crisis perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening but the ultraviolet forest remains spatially vague—no legible distances or boundaries. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: sensory density increases and the strap's fall marks a micro turn. However, the closure image ("walked forward, no longer wearing the mask") lacks a decisive on-page cost; the "willingness to remain intact" is declared rather than dramatized as a forfeited option or visceral trade-off. The final equation-solving feels conceptual but the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest supplies vivid sensory anchors (violet light, bioluminescent moss, equations etched in bark) and the pewter strap is handled physically. Spatial choreography is weak—Elena kneels, braces, stands, moves, reaches a clearing, but distances and layout remain unclear. The strap constrains movement (tightens when she swallows) and charges the ending when it falls, qualifying as micro-setting that affects tactics. Occupational/world systems (the facility, interrogations) are gestured at but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when the strap falls and Elena "solved for x," yet this resolution is told rather than shown as a choice that forecloses a live option. No antagonist or secondary pressure appears to test her commitment. The ultraviolet penance concept complicates mood but does not narrow tactics on the page. Cost is implied (carrying the strap's impression) but not felt as a tangible sacrifice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through accumulative imagery (ultraviolet light, trauma geometry, equations) but the final paragraph articulates it overtly: "forgiveness equaled the integral of pain divided by the willingness to remain intact." This shifts from image to thesis statement. The strap's fall and scar-impression offer a non-literal answer, yet the moralizing calculus undercuts resonance. Subtext operates in the forest's sensory particulars but is flattened by the algebraic framing at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and texturally distinct—lyric, scientific, trauma-inflected—with a perceptual signature rooted in proprioceptive awareness. Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("algorithm of compassion," "divine constant seeking resolution") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue. Free indirect style remains clean. Psychic distance is stable. The final line's diction ("how much light could pass through a broken place") feels earned, but earlier equation metaphors read as thematic overlay rather than Elena's natural idiom under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("stars of her own damage," "silverware of her suffering," "voltage she now generated herself") and occasionally muddles clarity with mixed or strained vehicles. Template cadence appears in chains: "She was... She could feel... She understood... She reached... She braced..." Paraphrase loops cluster around the mathematics-of-mercy conceit without adding new pressure. The final image is evocative but the line "her roots dangling with the silverware of her suffering" contradicts physical logic. Proofreading is clean; information density is moderate; momentum sags in the middle third due to synonym churn around trauma vocabulary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The proprioceptive-enhancement premise offers a fresh angle on trauma narrative, and the ultraviolet-forest setting is vivid. However, the mathematics/equation metaphor pervades without transformation—Elena "solves for x" in a manner that reads as prompt-compliance rather than an inevitable synthesis. The emotional arc (torture survivor seeking mercy) follows a familiar template, and the algorithmic framing feels externally applied. The strap's fall is purposeful but predictable. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece opts for lyric accumulation over a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Elena's status as enhanced interrogation survivor is established early and her proprioceptive awareness shapes perception throughout. However, her key "choice"—to stand, move, and walk forward—feels more like passive reception of revelation than a decision that alters tactics. The survivor identity supplies backstory weight but does not drive on-page reversals. Present in setup and closure but functionally replaceable with a generic trauma-survivor role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The pewter mask strap appears in the opening (Elena traces it), tightens mid-scene (triggering somatic memory), and falls at the climax. Its physical handling and evolving emotional charge (anchor → conductor → released burden) qualify as development across beats. The final image carries its "impression in her skin," reweighting its meaning. However, the strap does not constrain a tactical choice—Elena does not decide whether to remove it; it "snapped free" on its own. Strong recurrence and closure linkage, but agency is passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance is introduced early ("the forest demanded ultraviolet penance") and colors the atmosphere, but its mechanics remain abstract. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page—Elena navigates by proprioception, not by responding to penance-specific pressures. The concept is summarized at closure ("ultraviolet penance was not punishment but translation") as thematic statement rather than dramatized cost. Functional mood-setter but swappable with another metaphor for reckoning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement is established immediately and shapes Elena's perceptual stream throughout (exact angles, torque, vertebrae positions). It enables navigation ("internal gyroscope of her own damage") and charges the sensory texture. However, no on-page action hinges on this trait with a visible cost—it amplifies description but does not force a trade-off or tactical pivot. The trait is label-heavy ("proprioceptively enhanced," "proprioceptive map") and reads more as atmospheric detail than a constraint with stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Brace appears in multiple beats: Elena braces palms against moss (opening), braces against a trunk (middle), braces against revelation (clearing). Each instance grounds her physically and the action recurs with escalating stakes. The final brace ("braced herself against the revelation") links to the closure moment when the strap falls. However, the action is easily swappable with "steadied" or "pressed" without structural loss. Strong recurrence and closure participation, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses is named early ("let her body remember through trauma responses") and described in detail (waterboarding rhythm, electricity staccato, joint dislocations). It supplies the method for Elena's internal navigation but does not shape on-page tactics or decisions—she walks and stands, guided by memory, yet no choice turns on this method. The mechanics are told rather than enacted as a process with friction. Present across beats but functionally ornamental; a near-synonym like "embodied recall" could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is introduced immediately and supplies vivid sensory pressure (humming frequency, bioluminescent moss, violet light, equations in bark). It enables Elena's navigation and appears in the closure clearing. However, the forest does not constrain movement—Elena moves freely, bracing as she chooses, with no physical obstacle that alters tactics. The setting charges mood and the final image but does not force a trade-off or supply a resource she must use. Strong atmospheric presence and closure linkage; micro-setting (strap, body) does constrain. Cap softened by lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wore off" anchors the opening moment but the timeframe remains static—no clock tightens decisions. The narrative unfolds in one continuous interior sequence with no urgency or deadline. The anesthesia detail supplies a transition cue but does not pressure tactics or alter the ending. Mentioned once at setup; absent in development and closure. Functional transit marker but swappable with "when she woke" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The desire "to discover the mathematics of mercy" is stated explicitly in the opening paragraph and recurs as thematic refrain ("algorithm of forgiveness," "inverse algorithm of compassion," equation at clearing). However, it remains abstract—Elena does not face a concrete choice between competing goods tied to mercy. The motivation is told rather than dramatized as friction between want and cost. Present across beats and at closure but functions as thematic overlay rather than a stake tested by action. No visible trade-off or renunciation tied to this specific desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Displaced rooted" is introduced early as a descriptor and recurs near the end ("displaced rooted, a tree uprooted yet growing"). The tone—suspended between trauma and transcendence—modulates subtly as sensory intensity increases but remains coherent. The oxymoron charges the final image (roots dangling, branches reaching). However, the tone is named rather than enacted through rhythm or syntax shift under pressure. Lyric-resonance qualifies for mid-band; charged reprise at closure lifts the score slightly above purely ornamental mention.</comment>
