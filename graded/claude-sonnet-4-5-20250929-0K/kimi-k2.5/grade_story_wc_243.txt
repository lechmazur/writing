<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is dense and character-particular ("haunted euphoria," the physics of grief-as-sedimentation), and her occupation constrains her methods on the page. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective exposition rather than micro-choices under pressure; her actions—walking carefully, writing, touching the locket—are ritualistic but not genuinely conflicted. The final turn ("the covenant had been regenerated...by her documentation") reads as assertion rather than a visible forfeiture or stance crystallization that forecloses a live path. Embodied emotion is present but the cost of her decision remains conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece orients cleanly (archivist, jetty, twilight, decade bloom cycle) and accumulates density through layered description and reflection. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara's continued documentation regenerates the covenant, and the final image of "carrying the past gently, thoroughly, into whatever context came next" reconfigures her stance with a felt cost (another decade of bearing witness). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through the final cadence shift. However, the cost is more implied than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture or choice that visibly narrows options—and the ending leans on thematic summary ("the covenant had been regenerated...by her documentation") rather than a single charged image that reweights prior material without explanation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty is vivid and purposeful: flowers from memory-cracks, salinity altered by grief, steep slope navigated with care. Setting details are filtered through Mara's archival POV and constrain her movement ("one misstep...and the entire...covenant might collapse"). The locket, inkwell, and concrete are handled tactilely, and the final image of closing blooms charges the ending. However, the environment primarily serves as symbolic backdrop rather than forcing a tactical choice at closure; the steep slope is noted but does not create a pivot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory and regenerating the covenant—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is more density-increase than genuine tightening; Mara's actions are methodical and unopposed, with no reversal or complication that forces a trade-off. The "context changed" opening and the urgency of working "before twilight faded" gesture toward pressure, but no on-page event tests or narrows her options. The cost ("already preparing her heart for the next blooming") is announced rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or realization that alters her stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory, loss, and the ethics of preservation—emerges organically from imagery (walnut ink fading, flowers closing, silver nitrate surrendering to entropy) and Mara's choices. The piece resists moralizing and invites reflection on transience versus permanence. The ending offers a resonant image (carrying the past "gently, thoroughly") that reweights prior material without explicit thesis. However, the final paragraph slips into thematic summary ("the covenant had been regenerated...by her documentation") that slightly undercuts the otherwise earned resonance, and "haunted euphoria" is labeled rather than fully embodied in contradictory action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: diction choices ("mnemonic," "sedimented," "proximate causes") fit an archivist's perceptual signature, and syntax modulates between long reflective rhythms and shorter present anchors. Purposeful compression ("not magic but physics through proximate causes") and metaphor density are pattern-taught and mostly legible. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are voice-motivated. However, some elevated register choices ("steeping the atmosphere," "forgiving obscurity of time") drift slightly above immediate perception under pressure, and a few near-repetitions in the final third ("gently, thoroughly" recurs without reweighting) suggest minor template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is dense and image-rich, with high information load per sentence and purposeful metaphor (flowers as paper lanterns, grief altering salinity). Rhythm varies, and the opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "gently thorough" is restated three times across the piece without new pressure; "the covenant" and "proximate causes" recur as conceptual labels rather than evolving images; and the final paragraph summarizes the closure beat rather than letting the image speak. Minor filter-verb clusters ("felt the haunted euphoria rising," "felt it in the shift") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8 to −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist-as-grief-worker, mnemonic flowers, and ink-as-fading-mercy is fresh and internally coherent. The piece commits fully to its metaphysical premise and follows its implications without retreat. However, the core emotional arc—solitary ritualist tending memory on an anniversary—echoes familiar territory, and the closure (documentation as regeneration) feels more conceptually satisfying than surprising in hindsight. The walnut-ink and blooming-jetty specifics elevate the premise, but the piece does not risk bold structural or perspectival choices that might heighten stakes further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist role frames expectation early and governs method throughout: dipping pen with hesitation, working quickly before twilight fades, navigating the steep jetty with care. However, her decisions are ritualistic and unopposed rather than generative of key turns. The archival work happens on the page but does not alter her options or force a trade-off; she completes the task as planned. The role is essential to voice and world logic but does not drive a causal reversal or visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The locket appears in two beats: Mara studies the photograph mid-story, then touches it without opening at the end, "knowing that the weight of small moments required no image to survive." The second touch reweights the first by affirming memory beyond the physical artifact, charging the closure image. However, the locket does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it is reflective anchor rather than agent. It is present in the ending but not causally active there.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The regenerated covenant shapes the stakes (Mara must work before twilight fades to secure another decade) and the ticking-clock urgency. The concept is signaled early ("the covenant...was regenerating again"), explained through the physics of accumulated grief, and affirmed at closure ("the covenant had been regenerated"). However, it functions more as thematic frame than as a mechanism that alters Mara's tactics or forces a trade-off on the page. The cost is conceptual (another decade of bearing witness) rather than a visible forfeiture tied to the covenant's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is introduced in the opening, embodied in Mara's careful navigation of the steep jetty ("placing each foot with reverence"), and reprised in the final image ("carrying the past gently, thoroughly"). The trait constrains her method (slowness to avoid crushing flowers) and charges the ending. However, it does not create a visible trade-off or cost on the page; it is character-consistent behavior rather than a choice under conflicting pressure. The recurrence is purposeful but the attribute itself is more label than enacted dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Steep" appears twice: "the jetty was steep here, sloping toward the water" and Mara navigates "the incline with the care of someone who understood that destruction traveled through chains of tiny, adjacent events." The steepness motivates her caution and ties to the proximate-causes theme, but it does not drive a turn or force a choice. Removing the slope would not break the story's logic or closure; Mara could work carefully on flat ground with minor edits. The action is present but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is signaled early ("physics through proximate causes," "chains of tiny, adjacent events") and shapes Mara's understanding of how the covenant operates. It recurs in the final paragraph ("the proximate causes having rippled outward"). However, the method is more thematic explanation than dramatized mechanic; Mara does not enact or discover proximate causality on the page in a way that alters her tactics or the outcome. It is coherent world logic but not a lever that drives beats or closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors the entire piece: flowers opening from concrete cracks, fog filtering violet light, steep slope requiring careful navigation, salt spray where blooms grow thickest, and the closing of flowers as twilight drains. The setting pressures Mara's choices (work quickly, move carefully, preserve before dark erases distinctions) and charges the final image. The jetty is causally active across multiple beats and indispensable to closure. However, the constraint is primarily temporal (twilight fading) rather than spatial; the jetty's physical features support atmosphere more than alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When context changes" frames the opening ("Tonight, the context changed") and the decade bloom cycle creates urgency: Mara must document before twilight fades and the blooms close. The timeframe is signaled, tracked ("as the final light drained from the sky"), and resolved on the page ("the blooms...were closing now, their work done"). However, the clock does not force a visible trade-off or alter Mara's tactics mid-scene; she completes her work as planned. The timeframe shapes stakes and closure participation but does not narrow options through escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve the weight of small moments is introduced early ("why she had dedicated her life to preserving...the way light hit a teacup...the silence between heartbeats") and drives her archival work throughout. It is dramatized in her careful documentation and the final image of "carrying the past...into whatever context came next." However, the desire is unopposed and unconficted; Mara does not weigh preservation against another want or cost on the page. The motivation is essential to character and stakes but lacks friction or visible trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is labeled once ("Mara felt the haunted euphoria rising in her chest, that terrible joy of holding something precious as it dissolved") and modulates through the piece: violet light and pale blooms create melancholy beauty, grief steeps the atmosphere, and the ending mixes loss with renewal. The tone is coherent and charges the final image of preparing "for the next blooming." However, the euphoria is told rather than fully embodied in contradictory action, and the label itself is a one-time assertion rather than a pattern that evolves under pressure.</comment>
