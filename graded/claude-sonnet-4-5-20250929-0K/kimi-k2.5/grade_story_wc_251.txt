<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's attribute (hearing unspoken words) is established early, but his interiority remains abstract—we receive poetic summaries of what he hears rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice (placing the queen, descending) feels more ritual than renunciation with visible cost; no path is foreclosed on the page. The motivation ("to plant forests of second thoughts") is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is conveyed through elevated metaphor rather than specific physical states under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the synchronized window displays build toward a pattern revelation, and the final image in the grotto aims for a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who and where within the opening but the "timeframe" remains vague until late. The closure unit—Elias standing in the grotto as the displays darken—offers a conceptual reweighting (hesitation as seed), yet the cost is asserted in summary ("a boy was deciding...") rather than shown. The chosen lens holds, but the RR relies on告知 summary of off-page effects rather than a single on-page image that makes the cost undeniable, pushing the score into mid-band rather than high.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt library, river-mist, and magnetic grotto are vivid and specific, with sensory detail filtered through an elevated, lyric register. The grotto's properties (compass needles spin, heartbeats sound like drums) constrain the final beat and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography across town and between library/grotto remains coherent. The setting satisfies the 9+ gate (grotto constrains the final action and charges the image), but the prose leans heavily on atmospheric catalog rather than selective detail that reflects urgency, preventing entry into the highest band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating a moment of collective hesitation—is signaled early and pursued through the window-display gambit. One meaningful deepening occurs when the displays coalesce into the chess pattern and the unspoken words rise "not as noise but as harmony." However, escalation is enacted through Elias's patient organizing rather than a tightening that forecloses options; coincidence (cosmic alignment, mist, starlight) charges the grotto scene without Elias making a tactical sacrifice. Agency is present (he organizes, places the queen) but the cost is conceptual and asserted off-page ("a boy was deciding...") rather than a visible trade-off that narrows his own options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—second thoughts as seeds, hesitation as forest—emerges through the window-display pattern and the metaphor of the Italian Game ("possibility rather than aggression"). The final image (queen on stone, town's internal monologue shifting) offers a non-literal answer without stating a moral. Yet the piece edges toward Thematic Echo: "A second thought is a seed; given space, it becomes woodland" arrives as direct statement rather than earned through scene pressure. The metaphor of light and attention reweights prior material, but the reliance on summary assertion ("knowing that somewhere below...") dilutes resonance, keeping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—elevated diction, patterned syntax ("the father's unvoiced fear...the librarian's silent grief...the children's wordless panic")—that is consistent and voice-motivated. However, under peak pressure (the grotto climax), the narration does not compress or shift rhythm; it maintains the same ornate register throughout, which flattens the sense of urgency. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping, but the uniformly poetic register risks becoming a single-note voice that does not modulate with scene stakes, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often beautiful ("cobalt library...stones the color of deep ocean held captive in architecture"), but appears in nearly every sentence, including high-pressure beats, without pattern-teaching or payoff that charges closure—triggering the Overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops are present: "unspoken words...trembling frequencies of thoughts people swallowed" and "unheard sentences" restate the same concept across adjacent lines (−0.2). Template cadence appears in the litany structure ("the father's unvoiced fear...the librarian's silent grief...the children's wordless panic"), which recurs without tension or variation (−0.4). The final third sustains ornate metaphor ("amplified quiet within him like a lantern that needed no flame") that clouds propulsion. Cumulative artifact penalty and density issues lower the score; no loops or scaffold clutter touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies (−0.8 for two distinct issues: density + template cadence).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess coaching, unspoken-word perception, and synchronized light as rebellion is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar "quiet resistance" trope through the particulars of the Italian Game and the magnetic grotto. However, the core emotional arc (lonely empath orchestrates collective shift) follows a recognizable template, and the closure's assertion of off-page effects ("a boy was deciding...a woman was choosing...a man was picking up the phone") leans on stock outcomes rather than a singular, irreplaceable final image. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode, but the reliance on elevated abstraction over lived detail and the lack of a sharp, non-obvious turn at closure keep it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, frames the story, and his organizing drives the middle beats. Setup is clear (first paragraph). Development: he moves through town coordinating displays (middle third). Closure: he places the queen and listens in the grotto. However, his choices do not create key turns; the displays accumulate rather than forcing him to trade off or alter tactics. The queen-placement is more ritual than decision with visible cost. Two gates met (setup, closure presence), eligible to ~6.0, but causal pressure and cost connection are weak, so the score trends mid-band. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure presence (cameo, not causally active) +0.3, swappability −0.6, ornamental use of the attribute −0.5 = baseline ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto appears in setup (mentioned as destination), is described in the climax (its properties—compass spin, amplified quiet—charge the atmosphere), and houses the final image (queen on stalagmite, town pattern visible from grotto). Three gates met. The grotto's unique physics (magnetic field, silence amplified) enable the convergence of the window displays into a legible constellation and create the "amplified quiet" that allows Elias to hear the town's shift. It is not easily swappable; removing it would require a different spatial/sensory mechanism for the closure image. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, late first full appearance (final third) −0.5 = ~7.2, round down to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "humble rebellion" is named explicitly and frames Elias's project: organizing the displays as an act of resistance. Setup: stated as motivation in the opening. Development: the organizing itself is the rebellion's method. Closure: the rebellion's effect is asserted (hesitations planted). However, the rebellion is more thematic claim than on-page tactical constraint; Elias faces no opposition or cost tied to the rebellion itself—he simply coordinates willing participants. The concept shapes the story's premise but does not create a live dilemma or alter his options under pressure. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (theme-level) +0.4, ornamental (no on-page friction) −0.8, summary-only effect −0.6 = ~5.3, round down to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elias's ability to hear unspoken words is established in the first paragraph, used throughout to color his perception (he hears the baker's enthusiasm, the mechanic's longing, the widow's wish), and referenced at closure ("the town's internal monologue shifted"). Setup clear. Development: the attribute informs his organizing but does not constrain or force a trade-off on the page. Closure: it allows him to perceive the shift, but the shift is asserted, not shown. The trait is more atmospheric label than active lever; no visible cost or tactical dilemma arises from it. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure presence +0.4, label-only use −0.6, ornamental (no pressure) −0.7 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Cradle" appears three times: Elias cradles the wooden queen en route to the grotto, places it on the stalagmite, and then cradles "nothing now, the queen given to the stone." Setup (second third), development (the act of cradling en route), closure (the release and empty hands). The action is specific and symbolic—cradling implies care and eventual release—and the final image ("cradling nothing") reweights the gesture. However, the action does not create a major turn in tactics or stakes; it is more lyric reprise than causal hinge. Two gates +0.9, closure linkage (image-level) +0.9, specificity +0.5, late signal (second third) −0.3, swappable (could be "carry" or "hold") −0.4 = ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method—synchronized window displays—is signaled early ("organizing synchronized window displays across town"), described in the middle (three weeks of coordination, sketches, exact timing), and delivers the closure image (thirty-seven squares of light in the Italian Game pattern). Setup clear, development detailed, closure participation strong. The method is specific and irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on the coordinated pattern becoming visible from the grotto. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.7, summary-only development (told rather than shown beat-by-beat) −0.5 = ~6.5, but the lyric reprise (early seed → final constellation) justifies mid-6s under the allowance, round down to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt library is introduced in the opening line, serves as the anchor for Elias's chess coaching, and is referenced at closure ("In the cobalt library below...students arriving"). Setup immediate. Development: the library is the site of Elias's work and the baseline from which he launches the rebellion. Closure: students look up from the library to see the pattern. The library provides spatial grounding and a recurring anchor, but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it is more setting-as-stage than setting-as-pressure. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure presence +0.5, postcard description (vivid but passive) −0.6 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe—"the hush where past meets prophecy, that indigo hour when the day's regrets and tomorrow's fears hold equal weight"—is poetic and evocative but vague. It is mentioned in the opening third and again at closure ("displays darkened at nine"), but the temporal pressure is asserted rather than tracked. No live clock tightens Elias's decisions; the three-week organizing period is summarized, and the "final evening" unfolds without time-driven escalation. Setup (metaphorical) present, closure (nine o'clock) noted, but development is summary-only. Early signal +0.4, closure presence +0.3, vague/untracked −0.7, summary-only −0.6 = ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to plant forests of second thoughts"—is stated explicitly in the opening and drives the organizing project. Setup clear. Development: Elias's organizing is the enactment of this desire. Closure: the motivation is fulfilled conceptually when hesitations take root. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or a moment of doubt; Elias never wavers or pays a personal cost tied to this goal. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (thematic) +0.6, told-only (no friction) −0.7, ornamental (no on-page trade-off) −0.5 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone—"amplified quiet"—is established through the library mist, the grotto's silence ("so silent that heartbeats sounded like drums"), and the final image of Elias carrying "the amplified quiet within him like a lantern." The tone is coherent across all beats and modulates subtly (mist → magnetic hush → ordinary night). It charges the final image by making the silence itself a transferable state. Setup (mist, library hush), development (grotto acoustics), closure (internalized quiet). Three gates met. The tone is specific and irreplaceable, but it does not constrain a choice or create tactical pressure; it is more atmospheric than functional. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.1, specificity +0.5, static mood (no tension shift) −0.4 = ~6.7.</comment>
