<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her telepathic trait creates embodied contradiction ("tasted like lightning and chlorophyll"), but her agency at the climax feels preordained rather than chosen under pressure. The plants direct her through most key beats, reducing her stakes to executing their will. Internal conflict is present in the tradition-versus-evolution tension, but the resolution lacks visible cost—she smiles and feels gratitude, no path foreclosed. The final choice reads inevitable rather than renunciatory or transformative with on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the kite script, plant voices, and amber convergence building density toward the unsealing. Closure is a Decisive Change—the embryo released—but the cost is implied rather than legibly dramatized; Mira's smile and the plants' gratitude flatten the price. One meaningful tightening occurs when the kite reveals the thermal sequence, narrowing her options. Causality holds throughout with motivated ellipsis (fifteen years of reconstruction compressed), but the final image lacks the felt or conceptual cost required to enter the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs constrain the unsealing—only precisely calibrated temperature works—and the kite tangled in mineral deposits charges the middle beat. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "minerals crystallizing into alien gardens," "thermal vents hissed secrets." The body and tool (amber pendant, kite) function as micro-setting that shapes choice. The setting subtly mirrors Mira's internal state (toxic waters as nursery, roots knitting soil). Spatial choreography is clean; the pool, terraces, and ferns track coherently.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unseal the embryo to evolve tradition—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the kite script reveals the thermal sequence, narrowing options. But the plants lead Mira through every step; her agency is execution rather than choice under friction. The resolution lacks visible cost: the amber splits, the embryo thrives, Mira smiles—no path foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The price is conceptual (cracking tradition) but not felt on the page at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—tradition must transform, not preserve—emerges from concrete action (unsealing the amber) and the kite's repurposed resistance language. The final image of roots knitting soil and the kite fluttering free offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the plants' telepathic urgency and the elders' absent objection. However, the ending paragraph edges toward thematic summary: "knowing that tradition had finally learned to grow toward the light" articulates the thesis rather than trusting the image. The sequoia's destiny and Mira's bridge metaphor are slightly over-explained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices plant voices, mineral deposits, cipher games. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with botanical and insurgent idiom ("insurgent's courage," "roots against stone"). Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the unsealing crescendo. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with embodied urgency: "To unseal it required both the mathematical precision of the kite's code and the biological permission of the plant collective" reads expository in a high-pressure beat. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high, but several artifacts dull momentum. Paraphrase loop: "She had come here to unseal the future, not merely rebuild the past" and "Tradition had always been about preservation, about keeping the embryo sealed forever in protective stasis" restate without added pressure. Register drift in peak beats: "the mathematical precision of the kite's code and the biological permission of the plant collective" intrudes with academic diction. Template cadence: "The elders called it sacrilege… Mira called it evolution with intent" and "not a command but a potential" repeat parallel structures mechanically. Minimal filter-verb stacking; grammar is clean. Apply −0.8 for loop and register drift touching closure area.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathic botany, encrypted resistance script, and bio-engineered embryo is specific and non-obvious. The kite repurposed by vegetation that absorbed archive data is a fresh inflection. However, the grandmother-insurgent archetype and the sealed-potential-released arc are familiar; transformation comes through the plant telepathy angle rather than the emotional or moral calculus. The volcanic nursery setting and the contract-between-innovation-and-adaptation frame offer distinctive world logic. Risk-taking is present in the lyric density and plant-voice mechanism, though closure clarity holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her final choice—lowering the amber—is the climax. She is signaled early, drives two beats (reaching for the kite, unsealing the embryo), and her insurgent past motivates the unsealing. However, the plants guide every step; her agency reads as execution rather than contested decision. Her grandmother role is mentioned once but does not constrain choice. Cost is implied (defying elders) but not dramatized. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.5 causal pressure, +0.7 closure linkage, −0.5 for guided agency, −0.4 swappability (another insurgent could execute).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber pendant is handled in three beats: Mira brushes it (opening), decodes the script that reveals its unsealing method (middle), lowers it into the pool (climax). It is irreplaceable—only this embryo with implanted destiny fulfills the thematic contract. The amber splitting is the Decisive Change. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.2 causal pressure (unseal is the plot), +1.8 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity, +0.6 cost (opening what was safe). No major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes on the page: the embryo's genes are designed to thrive in toxic waters, and releasing it requires both precision and biological permission. It is dramatized in the unsealing and the immediate surge of growth. Setup early, development in the kite revelation, payoff in the final image of roots and filtered air. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure (the destiny is the plot driver), +1.4 closure linkage, +0.5 specificity, +0.3 cost. Minor friction: the concept is slightly over-explained ("implanted destiny was not a command but a potential").</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Telepathy enables two on-page actions with visible mechanics: the ferns transmit the correct interpretation of the kite script (middle), and the plant chorus surges during the unsealing (climax). It constrains—Mira can only act with plant permission—and the feedback loop makes her eyes water. Setup early ("accidentally telepathic"), development in the fern transmission, payoff in the crescendo. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.3 causal pressure (enables the unsealing), +1.2 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity, +0.4 cost (sensory overload). No major frictions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The unsealing is the climax and the Decisive Change; every prior beat builds to it. It is irreplaceable—no synonym action works. Setup in the opening ("come here to unseal the future"), development in the thermal sequence discovery, payoff when the amber splits and the embryo drifts free. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.6 causal pressure (the action is the plot apex), +1.8 closure linkage, +0.8 specificity, +0.5 cost (cracking tradition). No swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The kite and its cryptic script are signaled early (abandoned kite in deposits), drive the middle beat (Mira decodes with fern help to learn the thermal sequence), and the mechanics matter—without it, she cannot unseal. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.1 causal pressure (unlocks method), +0.9 closure linkage (kite flutters free), +0.7 specificity (cipher games callback), +0.4 cost (repurposed resistance language). Minor friction: the kite's final flutter reads slightly ornamental rather than causally charged.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs constrain the unsealing—only precisely calibrated temperature dissolves the amber—and supply the resource (mineral water). The setting drives two beats: Mira climbs the terraces, then lowers the amber into the pool. The churning springs and plant surge charge the climax. Setup early, development in the vent selection, payoff in the thermal pool unsealing. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.4 causal pressure (only here works), +1.3 closure linkage, +0.7 specificity (sulfur-tolerant bacteria), +0.4 cost. Minor friction: postcard description in opening ("minerals crystallizing into alien gardens") slightly delays action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Reconstruction is mentioned in the opening ("fifteen years of reconstruction") and frames Mira's motivation, but time does not tighten decisions on the page. No live clock; the unsealing proceeds at discovery pace without temporal pressure. The timeframe is functional context but replaceable. Setup present, development absent (no middle choice constrained by time), payoff weak (no temporal cost). Apply +0.3 early signal, +0.4 one beat (opening context), −0.5 late/weak development, −0.6 no closure tightening. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development gate).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's desire to evolve tradition is dramatized in the unsealing choice and conflicted against the elders' view (sacrilege). The motivation drives two beats: her decision to come here and the final unsealing act. Friction between want (transform) and implied cost (defy tradition) is present but not sharply felt—she smiles, no visible renunciation. Setup early, development in the kite revelation (evolution requires intent), payoff in the unsealing. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.0 causal pressure, +1.0 closure linkage, +0.5 specificity, −0.4 told-only cost (elders are absent, no confrontation).</comment>
