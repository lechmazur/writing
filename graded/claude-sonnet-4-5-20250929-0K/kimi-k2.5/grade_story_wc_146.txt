<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's seventeen-year commitment and final choice to place the fork against the keystone show endurance and decision with cost. Her interiority remains abstract ("infinitely patient by necessity," "motivated by the single truth") rather than embodied contradiction. The piece avoids diagnostic label-speak, but internal conflict never acts simultaneously—patience is declared, not tested by competing impulses. Micro-choices lack visible hierarchy; her escalation to "quickened into a dance" feels asserted rather than earned by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered rhythm imagery, culminating in the archway singing and new structures rising. Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the keystone moment crystallizes the seventeen-year walk's meaning with felt cost (the endless vigil). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first lines. One meaningful deepening occurs (dissonance detected, pace increased, final fork placement), though the causal link between her footsteps and physical regeneration rests on assertion rather than dramatized mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The archway constrains her choice (keystone dissonance forces the quickened pace) and charges the final image (singing, mortar flowing). Cobblestones produce distinct notes and glow amber—micro-setting details that enable her method. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus (tuning-fork vibration, stone dust, street hum). The ebony fork and cobblestones function as setting elements at this scale, directly shaping tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restore the city via rhythm) is signaled early and tightens once: the fork shudders, collapse is imminent, she increases pace. Her agency (placing the fork, quickening the dance) drives the turn, though coincidence—detecting dissonance "today"—initiates the escalation. One meaningful deepening narrows options (final collapse vs. restoration), and the cost is legible (seventeen years of solitary walking). No live tradeoff appears on-page; the resolution unfolds without friction or visible loss in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (reciprocity between civilization and wilderness) emerges from concrete action: footsteps regenerate mortar, the city "would grow anew from the rhythm she had established." The final image (archway "newborn, holding the wild hush...like a held breath about to become a name") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. One line edges into thematic echo: "restoration required balance rather than conquest" reads prompt-like but remains integrated. Subtext operates in "ghosts not of the dead but of the not-yet-born."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with high psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent (sound-focused, patient, archival) but lacks idiosyncratic texture—diction could belong to many solemn chroniclers. No dialogue to test. Prose rhythm modulates effectively (short urgent beats at the quickening, longer reflection earlier). Register occasionally drifts elevated ("polyrhythm that spoke of acceptance rather than dominion") without voice-specific grounding, and the phrase "infinitely patient" recurs as a tell rather than shown constraint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere or stakes. Paraphrase loops appear: "infinitely patient" (twice within four lines), "wild hush" (three times), and the cobblestones/footsteps/rhythm cluster repeats without new detail. Template cadence in the middle third: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences. Figurative density is purposeful and pattern-taught (rhythm, resonance, tuning motifs), but "pregnant with the possibility of return" and "held breath about to become a name" edge into stock metaphor. Clarity remains intact; momentum flags briefly in the reflection on merchant greed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—cryptic bell tuner + footstep rhythm as ghost-town revival mechanism—feels specific and non-obvious. Transformation test: the arc (patient restoration via sound) depends on these exact particulars. Risk-taking (accumulative structure, no antagonist, quiet agency) heightens coherence. The premise (sound-based urban restoration, reciprocal balance) carries a fresh angle, though the "teaching stones to listen" and "wild hush" phrases echo familiar eco-mystical templates. Execution elevates the material; no proximity echoes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's choices—seventeen-year walk, detecting dissonance, increasing pace, placing the fork—create the key turns. Setup early, middle choice (quicken), closure action (keystone placement). Decisions alter tactics and drive closure. Observation dominates the middle third, lowering involvement slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ebony fork appears in opening, middle (shudders, detects dissonance), and closure (placed against keystone, concentrates seventeen years). Three distinct beats; unique properties (absorbs light, detects dissonance, resonates) matter. Causal pressure: enables detection and final restoration. Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the dominant stake, shapes all tactics (walking, rhythm, tuning), and drives closure (city begins to rise). Setup immediate, middle development (dissonance threatens collapse), payoff (new structure rises). Irreplaceable; removing it breaks story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" appears three times but functions as label rather than lived constraint. No on-page moment where impatience tempts her or patience costs her an alternative. The trait enables the seventeen-year duration (told) but never constrains a visible choice. Setup present, development absent, payoff implied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the story's spine: every beat (walk, tap fork, detect dissonance, quicken, place fork) enacts it. Setup immediate, middle escalation (threatened collapse), closure (rebuilding succeeds). Causal pressure throughout; major turns trace directly to this action. Swapping "rebuild" for another goal would require full rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Footstep rhythm is signaled early (cobblestones produce notes, "polyrhythm"), enables middle tactics (quickened pace in complex meter), and delivers closure (cobblestones hum, mortar regenerates). Three beats; mechanics matter (distinct notes, rhythm accumulation). Causal and irreplaceable; the method is the means of restoration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ancient archway pressures all choices: it groans (threatens collapse), its keystone holds dissonance (triggers escalation), and it transforms at closure (ceases groaning, sings, becomes newborn). Setup, development, payoff all present. Archway is indispensable; story logic fails without it. Micro-setting that alters every tactic and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" frames backstory (three centuries prior) but does not constrain present action. No live clock; the phrase "today" marks the climax but timeframe itself exerts no pressure. Setup vague, development absent, payoff minimal. Swappable with "before the restoration succeeds."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Restore shared balance" is stated and dramatized: she rebuilds the contract (footsteps vs. mortar), proves reciprocity (city without silencing land), and achieves balance at closure. Setup early, middle choice (quicken to prevent collapse), payoff (balance restored). Friction between want and cost is thin—no visible sacrifice beyond time already spent. Still, the motivation drives all beats and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Wild hush" appears three times, modulates from empty (opening) to pregnant (middle) to broken into harmonies (closure). Tone supports the reverent, patient atmosphere and charges the final image (archway "holding the wild hush...like a held breath"). Setup, development (deepens), payoff (transforms). Coherent through turns and integral to the ending's resonance.</comment>
