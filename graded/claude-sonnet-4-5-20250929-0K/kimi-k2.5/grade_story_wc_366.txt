<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and contradictory—she protects silence while bottling safety, embodied in her handling of sea glass and cairn-building. Her "warmly observant" trait constrains choices (noticing rust, gull avoidance) and the final renunciation of the written letter shows genuine cost. Interiority occasionally slips toward elevated diction ("crystalline clarity," "luminescent ache") that reads slightly above a working skipper's natural register under pressure, though voice remains mostly coherent. The ghosts' presence is atmospheric but their agency never truly tests Elara's choices, leaving secondary pressure underdeveloped.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Elara, lighthouse, dusk delivery). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (extinguished lamp, cairns, sea glass, ghosts) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she seals the jar and builds a new cairn, crystallizing her stance to protect silence rather than send the letter. Cost is visible: she forecloses direct connection to preserve anonymous communion. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands her motivation ("to bottle the feeling of safety") and acts on it, altering the cairn arrangement and the viewer (the ghost) at dawn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is vivid and specific (phosphorescent mist, iron stairs with rust, shadows pooling differently), and it constrains Elara's timing ("always came after dark, when failure of the lamp created sanctuary"). The widow's walk and gallery rail function as micro-settings that enable the cairn messages. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her professional gaze (wick, reservoir, lamp mechanism by memory). The ghost at the window holding the jar charges the final image, making the setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the anonymous communion through cairns and objects while protecting silence—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara decides not to add the written letter, choosing instead to seal the sea glass in the jar, forecloses direct communication with visible cost (loneliness remains). The agency is renunciation with clear price: she remains unseen and unknown. The ghosts complicate atmosphere but do not oppose her directly, so external pressure is light; escalation is driven by her internal recognition and the choice to maintain the covenant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: isolation as native tongue, the covenant of being seen without being known, and the foundation versus the beam. The cairn arrangement (flat shale for sorrow, round granite for persistence) and the sealed jar with sea glass operate as non-literal answers to the story's central question about connection and anonymity. The final image—the ghost holding the jar to first light—resonates without moralizing, reweighting prior motifs (the lamp, the glass, the watching) with undeniable emotional and conceptual cost. No thematic echo or sermon mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable single third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture ("cairns left on the widow's walk," "the vocabulary of currents"), though elevated diction in peak beats ("crystalline clarity," "translucent need," "luminescent ache") occasionally drifts above Elara's working register. Perceptual signature is specific (rust as coastal flowers, solitude's angle in a keeper's spine) and remains character-bound. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated, and tense/stance remain stable throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("drowned in their own vigilance," "stones scattered like failed punctuation," "folded tight as a fish's spine"). Several register into elevated or slightly mixed vehicles ("the vocabulary of currents," "luminescent ache," "failed punctuation"), though most remain coherent. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "she [verb]" openers across multiple lines. Information density is strong, and propulsion holds, but the persistent figurative overlay in crisis moments dulls immediacy slightly. No major clarity breaks, but the overwriting is pervasive enough to prevent entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—anonymous communion via stacked stones and found objects between a supply skipper and vanished keeper—is specific and non-obvious. The cairn syntax (flat shale for sorrow, quartz for hope) and the decision to protect silence rather than send the letter offer fresh synthesis. Emotional specificity (bottling safety in the hollow between vigilance and vulnerability) avoids generic templates. The ghost holding the jar at dawn is a bold, lyric choice that heightens stakes and meaning without gimmickry, earning the within-band risk distinction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara (reticent lighthouse supply skipper) is present throughout and makes the key decision not to send the letter, instead building a new cairn and sealing the jar. She appears in the setup (arrival, climbing stairs), middle development (examining sea glass, understanding motivation), and closure (building cairn, descending). Her reticence shapes the choice to protect silence with visible cost. Two distinct beats involve her choices: recognizing the message in sea glass and deciding to seal it instead of adding the written letter. Causal pressure is moderate; her decision narrows options and forecloses direct connection.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece of sea glass appears in three beats: Elara finds it beside the jar, lifts it to moonlight to read its "message," and then seals it inside the oil jar at the end. It is handled on the page and its meaning evolves from received message to sent object, reweighting the anonymous exchange. It participates in closure by being placed in the sealed jar, which the ghost holds at dawn. Specificity is strong ("color of a bruised twilight sky," "frosted surface"), and the element could not be swapped without losing the tactile communion logic. Causal pressure is present but moderate; it enables rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain (conducted via cairns and objects) is present in setup (described as sustaining her through three seasons), middle development (she examines the previous keeper's toppled stack), and closure (she builds a new cairn). It shapes the dominant stake (preserving the communion) and the final choice (not to send the written letter, protecting silence). The mechanics are explained and matter to her tactics. However, the letter chain itself does not constrain a choice under pressure; it is the context Elara acts within rather than an active force. Two beats involve it (finding the toppled stones, building the new cairn), and it is essential to the ending's charge, but the element does not drive a reversal or narrow options directly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is present as a trait (she notices rust, gulls avoiding the window, solitude's angle) and is labeled on the page. It enables her to read the sea glass message and understand the ghosts' presence without flinching. However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; observation informs but does not force action. Setup is clear, middle development shows her noticing shadow changes, and closure references moving "with the comfort of the warmly observant." The attribute is functional but largely swappable with "perceptive" or "attentive" without structural loss. No single beat hinges on this exact trait, and no tradeoff is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Protect" is signaled early (she comes after dark to create sanctuary, understands her motivation "to bottle the feeling of safety") and drives the climax: she protects the silence by not sending the letter and sealing the jar. The action shapes two distinct beats (understanding her motivation and the final choice to build the cairn) and is indispensable to closure. The mechanics of protection (bottling, sealing with wax, stacking stones) are specific and could not be swapped for "preserve" or "guard" without losing the tactile, contained quality central to her choice. Causal pressure is strong; the action narrows options (she forecloses direct communication) with visible cost (enduring isolation). The final image (ghost holding the jar) reweights the protection as received rather than given.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "way of stacking stones as messages" is introduced in the setup (flat shale for sorrow, round granite for persistence, white quartz for hope) and returns at closure when Elara builds a new cairn ("three flat stones for the past, one round stone for the present"). The method is described with specific mechanics that matter to the communion's syntax. It shapes one beat in the middle (she finds the toppled stack) and one at the end (she builds the new arrangement), and it charges the final image by establishing the covenant. However, the method does not constrain a choice under pressure; Elara's decision to build the cairn is not forced by the method itself but by her desire to protect silence. The element is essential to the thematic logic but does not drive escalation or create friction. Swappability is low due to the specificity of the stone types and their meanings.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is present throughout (setup, middle, closure) and pressures Elara's choices: she comes after dark because the extinguished lamp creates sanctuary where living and dead share space. The room's mechanics (wick, reservoir, lamp mechanism) constrain her actions, and the ghosts' presence enables her to work "with the comfort of the warmly observant." The setting charges the final image (the ghost at the window holding the jar to first light). The phosphorescent mist, shadows pooling differently, and the gallery rail are specific and irreplaceable. Two distinct beats involve the setting: her arrival and understanding of the sanctuary, and the final lamp-lighting deferred to build the cairn. Causal pressure is strong; the room's state (lamp out) is why she can do this work now.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lamp flickers out" is signaled immediately ("the lamp had flickered out moments before her arrival") and frames the entire scene. The extinguished lamp creates the sanctuary condition that allows Elara to work with the ghosts. The ending references "before it ignites again" and shows her descending "at dawn," establishing a bounded window. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elara works methodically without a live clock pressuring her. The mechanics matter (lamp out = sanctuary, lamp relit = end of communion), but no beat shows her racing against time or altering tactics due to temporal pressure. The element is functional and shapes the scene's logic but does not drive escalation. Present in setup and closure; middle development does not track time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to bottle the feeling of safety" is dramatized on the page: Elara understands it "with crystalline clarity" and acts on it by sealing the sea glass in the jar with wax. The desire is conflicted—safety exists "only here, in the hollow where absolute vigilance met absolute vulnerability"—and the choice to protect silence rather than send the letter shows the friction between wanting connection and needing distance. The motivation shapes two beats: the moment of recognition and the final sealing/cairn-building. It is present in setup (implicit in her return visits), middle development (explicit realization), and closure (enacted). The cost is visible: she remains isolated but bottles the safety for exchange. Specificity is high; "safety" here is the precise state of being seen without being known, not generic security.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone "luminescent ache" is established early ("that peculiar glow that exists only when light has recently died and memory still burns") and coheres through all beats: the phosphorescent mist, salt-cold ghosts, and "residual presence" sustain a consistent register of longing and faint radiance. The tone modulates appropriately with pressure (calmer description during lamp inspection, heightened lyricism at the moment of understanding) and charges the final image (the ghost holding the jar to catch first light). Diction throughout supports the tone without breaking into discord. The element is indispensable; removing the luminescent-ache register would flatten the story's emotional texture and make the ghost encounter merely eerie rather than elegiac. The tone is not static; it deepens from atmospheric to charged at closure.</comment>
