<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's interiority is ambitious but often defaults to abstract philosophizing ("archaeology of forgiveness") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The shift from revolutionary to custodian is declared more than earned through on-page micro-choices with visible cost. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (the final weeping) but much of the arc unfolds in summary reflection rather than pressure-tested decision points. The motivation to "reimagine an entire civilization" reads thematic rather than dramatized through conflicting wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (Kaelen's shift to custodian, covering mirrors "from poetry," and his decision to remain). Cost is present but muted: the final choice to stay and tend visible time forecloses his departure with the expedition, yet the stakes feel more conceptual than viscerally narrowed. The orientation is established early (chapel dome, asteroid, Kaelen's defunct status), and the lens holds, but the escalation unfolds largely through reflection rather than scene pressure, weakening the felt urgency of the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful, with "visible time" pooling like amber wine and architecture as temporal pressure valve. The crystal vase shard charges the final image and constrains Kaelen's methodology. Spatial choreography is clean across locations (chapel, orrery, council, chamber). The micro-setting (shard, mirrors, storms) shapes choices and the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reimagining the civilization's purpose—is signaled early and sustained. However, the escalation unfolds largely in Kaelen's internal reweighting rather than external pressure that narrows options. The council presentation and mirror experiment provide one modest tightening, but the resolution ("dispute resolved not through evidence but through recognition") avoids a hard trade-off. Cost is conceptual (renouncing his revolutionary identity) but lacks the visceral felt price that would elevate this under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the crystal shard's poetry and the contrast between conquest and reverence. The final image—Kaelen remaining as custodian, mirrors covered, composing verses—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The motif of visible time and shattered vases accumulates pressure and reweights prior material at closure. Minor deduction for occasional abstract philosophizing ("archaeology of forgiveness") that edges toward thematic statement, but the particulars (shard, storms, mirrors) carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable single-narrator with a distinct, elevated register ("burnished sorrow," "baroque spires"). The perceptual signature is consistent—Kaelen notices temporal swirls, architectural ornamentation, poetic inscriptions—but the voice occasionally drifts into authorial lyricism ("his words joining the amber currents") that reads more posed than character-urgent. Dialogue is absent; the council scene is summarized rather than dramatized. Under pressure (storms, presentation), the diction remains ornate rather than compressing, which slightly flattens immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is ambitious and often striking ("visible time pooled like amber wine," "sorrow polish their understanding like metal against velvet"), but figurative density is high throughout, creating occasional coherence strain ("burnished sorrow of his voice commanded silence"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("He found... He explained... He demonstrated"). Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the ornate register in peak beats (council presentation, final paragraph) slows propulsion. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, but others ornament without advancing stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—visible time on a baroque asteroid, reinterpreting ancient architects—offers fresh synthesis and avoids template plots. The transformation of revolution into custodianship and the mirrors-as-modesty reading provide non-obvious angles. However, the emotional arc (defunct revolutionary finds new purpose through archaeological insight) follows a recognizable redemption template. The specificity of "visible time" and the crystal vase shard as apology rather than tool elevate originality, but the resolution's elegiac register trends toward a familiar poetic safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout and his defunct-revolutionary status frames his stance, but his choices (working through storms, presenting findings, deciding to remain) are narrated more than dramatized. The attribute shapes theme but does not create key on-page turns with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard appears in at least three beats: discovery beneath the orrery, use during the storm experiments, placement on the windowsill at closure. It enables Kaelen's new methodology, drives the council argument, and charges the final image. Its poetry-as-light property is specific and irreplaceable, though its use could be more viscerally constraining.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute (Voss's enslavement theory versus Kaelen's reverence reading) is established early and shapes the council presentation. It drives the dominant stake and the methodology shift. However, the dispute resolves "through recognition" rather than a hard-fought turn, weakening its causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is stated early ("He stood poetically inclined toward ruins") and colors Kaelen's perception throughout (interpreting inscriptions as poetry, composing verses at the end). It enables his reinterpretation but does not visibly constrain a choice with on-page cost; the trait functions more as lens than friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Devise" appears explicitly ("began to devise a new methodology") and drives the middle section (working through storms, refusing to cover mirrors). This action enables the council presentation and the final decision to remain. However, the devising itself is summarized rather than shown in granular choice-making, reducing its causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Covering mirrors is introduced early (expedition superstition during storms), tested mid-story (Kaelen refuses to cover his mirrors to observe time), and reprised at closure ("covered his chamber's mirrors... from the poetry of the gesture"). The method's mechanics (preventing paradox loops, preserving dignity) matter and reweight meaning at the end, though it could constrain choices more tightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is present from the opening line and supplies resources (visible time, crystal shard, architecture as pressure valve) that shape Kaelen's methodology and final choice. The setting's micro-elements (chapel dome, orrery, windowsill) ground key beats and the ending. Removing the asteroid's specific properties would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after time becomes visible" is established early and governs the entire narrative; visible time is the medium Kaelen interprets and tends. However, the temporal mechanics do not tighten decisions in real-time; the frame is more premise than active clock that alters tactics beat by beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The motivation "to reimagine an entire civilization" is stated explicitly and drives the middle and ending (discovery crystallizes it, council presentation enacts it, decision to remain fulfills it). However, the desire is more thematic than dramatized through conflicting wants; Kaelen's commitment faces little friction on the page, reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" is woven throughout (Kaelen's voice at the council, weeping at closure, elegizing the past) and modulates with pressure (quiet observation, storm intensity, final tenderness). The tone is coherent and charges the final image, though it remains relatively static rather than shifting decisively across turns.</comment>
