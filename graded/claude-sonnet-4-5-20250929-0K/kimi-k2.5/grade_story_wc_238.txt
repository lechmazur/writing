<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are clear and embodied through concrete actions (setting up the theremin, opening the perfume bottle), with her professional gossip-column expertise tangibly informing her approach to the supernatural. Internal conflict registers in the abandonment of metaphor ("I am sorry") after a career of indirection, and the final cost—column left unwritten, pen dry—forecloses a path. Minor slip: the composer's emotional arc feels more asserted than earned through prior beats, relying on static description ("eyes that held the weight") rather than dramatized contradiction. The choice to kneel and speak plainly is earned, but the spirit's forgiveness reads as given rather than wrestled.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural, with causal turns present. Orientation anchors early (who, where, when by the second paragraph). Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara delivers the apology, the circuit breaks, and she sits alone with column unwritten—a visible cost that forecloses her prior method. The orchard's fall and the spirit's dispersal into roots reweight the opening premise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she abandons metaphor, narrowing her rhetorical options. The acoustic anchor and time pressure (dawn chainsaws) shape tactics throughout. Cost is legible on the page in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sheet music archive is vividly rendered (dust motes as silver fish, stained glass, steel shelving groaning under parchment) and the setting constrains the ritual: the shelving becomes the circuit conduit, and the orchard's acoustic properties anchor the ghost. The perfume bottle, theremin, and spatial choreography (kneeling on concrete, sheet music whirlwind) are integrated into action. The orchard's impending destruction tightens the time window and charges the final image when the trees begin to fall. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's dual expertise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver apology before orchard falls) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: Elara's abandonment of metaphor represents a professional and personal cost, narrowing her rhetorical options. The induced currents peak, forcing the moment of direct speech. The resolution—apology delivered, circuit broken, spirit dispersed—is driven by her agency and forecloses a return to her prior method (column left unwritten). The composer's nod and whispered correction ("Like seeds") introduces a micro-turn that reweights the image without requiring a second reversal. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the final cost (pen dry, trees falling) is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (imperfect redemption, scars versus healing) emerges organically from the perfume bottle's shattering, the spirit's partial forgiveness, and Elara's shift from metaphor to raw apology. The orchard/seed motif reweights the premise without overt moralizing: destruction as transformation rather than mere loss. The piece resists tidy resolution—"miracles are imperfect; they mend the tear but leave the scar tissue"—and the final image (trees falling, pen dry) offers a non-literal answer to whether apologies can undo harm. One slip: "I cannot un-ring a bell" and the explicit framing of miracles as imperfect edge toward thematic statement, though they remain anchored in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara, with narrative distance tightening under pressure (micro-setting detail narrows to the perfume bottle vibrating, the spirit's form sharpening). Voice is distinct and consistent: "trafficked in both ink and ectoplasm," "copper wire" metaphors, "ethereal grit." Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with the spirit's static-translated cello strings and ventilation-whisper creating subtext. One register slip: "weaving meaning like copper wire, because direct speech lacked the voltage necessary for miracles" reads slightly over-elevated for the moment's urgency, though it fits her metaphor-driven character. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates intentionally at the apology beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong in the ritual sequence (terminals connected, bottle vibrating, spirit materializing). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. Minor loop: "the imperfect miracle began to unfold" followed by "The composer's form materialized" restates the same content. Template cadence appears in the closure third: "The apology delivered, the circuit broke. / The perfume bottle shattered, its purpose spent, and the composer's spirit dissipated..." pairs summary declaratives without added pressure. Filter verbs ("looked at her with eyes," "carried the weight") dull immediacy in a high-pressure beat. No artifacts touch the closure image itself, but the stack lowers momentum slightly in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gossip-columnist-as-exorcist premise is fresh, and the induced-currents method (theremin wired to shelving) offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The orchard's acoustic anchor and perfume bottle as distilled aria integrate smoothly. The abandonment of metaphor at the peak beat feels earned and particular to this character. Minor derivative note: the "cannot un-ring a bell" metaphor is widely used, though transformed through Elara's habitual metaphor-speak. The final seed/tree correction by the spirit elevates the image beyond the expected. Risk-taking (ethereal technical ritual + journalistic guilt) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Gossip-column exorcist: present early, drives setup (she wrote the damaging column), middle choice (connecting the theremin, adjusting currents), and closure (kneeling, abandoning metaphor, column left unwritten). The dual expertise constrains her method (advises through metaphors) and the cost (pen dry) is tied to her professional identity. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Antique perfume bottle: signaled in paragraph four, used in multiple beats (set on shelving, vibrates to release sound, opened fully, shatters at closure). Its purpose (contains the distilled aria) enables the ritual and its destruction marks the apology's completion. The shattered bottle charges the final image with finality. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles: frames the stakes early ("miracles are imperfect; they mend the tear but leave the scar tissue") and shapes Elara's expectation throughout. The concept constrains tactics—she cannot restore reputation, only offer partial redemption—and the closure image (spirit dispersed, column unwritten, trees falling) embodies the imperfect outcome. Strong thematic integration, but the concept is more thematic frame than on-page action constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Advises through metaphors: signaled early ("she advised through metaphors, weaving meaning like copper wire"), shapes her dialogue ("You cannot un-ring a bell," "Like trees, we are both being cut down"), and the abandonment of metaphor at the apology beat creates visible cost and marks the turning point. The trait constrains her method until the peak choice. Solid causal work, though the payoff (direct apology) is brief.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reconnect: the action is the spine of the plot. She physically reconnects terminals to create the circuit, "bridging the gap between accusation and absolution," and the spirit's reaching-out gesture completes the reconnection before dispersal. The verb appears multiple times with evolving meaning (electrical circuit, human relationship). Essential to closure; the circuit breaking marks the completed action. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Through induced currents: method signaled at setup (modified theremin, terminals connected to shelving), used in middle beats (currents translate static into cello strings, adjusting currents sharpens the spirit's form), and peaks at closure (currents peak, shelving becomes organs of lightning). The technical specificity (ballasts singing, ventilation system) shapes the ritual's mechanics. The method is irreplaceable, though slightly ornamental in early description.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sheet music archive: introduced early, supplies the resources (steel shelving as circuit conductor, centuries of parchment that rustle in the climax), and the acoustic properties (converted cathedral) justify the spirit's anchor. The cold concrete floor and fluorescent lights ground the kneeling apology. The archive's physical properties constrain and enable the ritual. Essential to the plot's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>During the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down: timeframe anchors the urgency (dawn chainsaws arrive, "this final night"), tightens the decision window, and the orchard's destruction will "sever the geographic anchor for this specific haunting." The first chainsaw coughs to life as Elara sits alone, marking the deadline's arrival. Time pressure shapes tactics (immediate apology) and charges the final image. The hush/chainsaws bracket the action with live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To deliver an overdue apology: the desire is dramatized through guilt ("the accusation was only half-true"), drives the setup (bringing the perfume bottle, creating the circuit), and the peak choice (kneeling, abandoning metaphor for direct speech). Friction arises between her habitual indirection and the need for raw honesty. The apology's delivery completes the arc, and the cost (column unwritten, pen dry) is visible. Indispensable to the emotional spine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Ethereal grit: tone is coherent and modulates with pressure. Early (dust motes as silver fish, "silver fish through shafts of dying sunlight") establishes the ethereal; grit appears in concrete detail (steel shelving, cold concrete, grit of dust mixing with ether). The tone charges the final image (chainsaws coughing, dust settling, trees falling) without breaking. "Trafficked in both ink and ectoplasm" and "copper wire" metaphors sustain the register. Solidly integrated, though the ethereal occasionally edges toward overwrought ("visible shimmer—a melody that wrapped around both of them like chains of light").</comment>
