<comment>The titan is characterized entirely through label and description ("regally unpretentious," "diminutive," "graceful") without micro-choices under pressure that reveal contradictory impulses. The pretender's unmasking proceeds without internal friction or embodied emotion—his face "sloughs away" and he "screams" but we see no fear-driven micro-decision, no attempt to bargain or flee that would make him dimensional. The titan's final gesture and "sundering word" are plot mechanisms rather than character-revealing actions shaped by cost or ambivalence. Interiority is absent; the prose asserts dignity and terror without anchoring either in body or choice.</comment>

<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly by the opening paragraph, satisfying the basic test. The closure unit—the pretender unmasked and the library dissolving—occurs on the page, but causality is opaque: the "rune of drift" and "sundering word" are invoked without prior setup of their mechanics or cost, reading as authorial fiat rather than earned consequence. The pretender's downfall is not shaped by his own choices or the titan's tactical sacrifice; the magic simply works when needed. Under a Causal lens (the piece gestures toward cause/effect with "because I solved your riddles" and the ink-fragment assembly), the lack of motivated linkage between the riddles, the rune's activation, and the specific form of unmasking undermines closure validity.</comment>

<comment>The ancient temple library is vividly rendered with marble corridors, broken dome, mosaic floor, and Bronze Age columns, creating strong atmospheric texture. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no spatial feature constrains a choice or tactic—the titan does not use the architecture, the ink-stained volumes, or the crumbling columns to solve a problem or force a decision. The library's "elegant dissolution" at the end is thematically resonant but does not charge the closure through environmental constraint. Sensory detail (moonlight, dust, cold marble) is selective and voice-filtered, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; the dissolution is decorative consequence, not causal participant.</comment>

<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and remains clear. However, escalation is absent: the titan executes a plan without visible friction, cost, or reversal. The pretender arrives, sneers, and is immediately undone by magic the titan controls without struggle. No tightening occurs; the rune assembles itself, the titan "speaks the sundering word," and the false king's disguise peels away with "inevitable separation"—phrasing that describes fate rather than hard-won agency. The resolution is not earned by a protagonist choice that forecloses an option or pays a price; the ink pellet "dissolves into shadow" only after its work is done, a passive consequence rather than a sacrifice that alters tactics. Under the selected Causal lens, the lack of a meaningful turn or deepening that narrows options prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<comment>Theme—justice, patient truth, humility as crown—emerges through the titan's millennial wait and the final image of humility carried "invisibly within his ancient heart." The rune of drift as "revealing what static truth could not see" offers a conceptual frame, and the pretender's unmasking dramatizes the premise. However, the ending delivers a stated moral ("You were never king") and closes with an explicit thesis ("humility was the only crown he had ever sought") rather than allowing the final image to reweight prior material without assertion. The library's dissolution into "myth and memory" is evocative but does not pose a non-literal question; the story tells its meaning rather than trusting the titan's walk into starlight to resonate. The 9+ gate (resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral) is not met.</comment>

<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-person limited on the titan with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("the pause of shifting constellations," "the weight of epochs") that is consistent but risks liturgical distance—diction often abstracts rather than embodying the titan's perceptual signature. The pretender's dialogue ("I have solved your riddles, little librarian") is serviceable but generic villain-speak without subtext or distinct idiom. The titan's single line of dialogue ("You were never king...") is declarative summary rather than goal-driven action. Filter verbs are sparse, but the narration relies on passive constructions ("was spoken," "began their graceful collapse") that dull immediacy in peak beats. Perceptual signature is weak; the titan's way of noticing does not feel character-specific or selective under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>4.7</grade>
<comment>Overwriting pervades: "the weight of epochs bowed his shoulders with regally unpretentious dignity" stacks modifiers; "the inevitable separation of water from oil, truth from fabrication" is a mixed metaphor (separation is neither water-from-oil nor truth-from-fabrication in concrete terms). Template cadence runs appear ("He had wandered... He had waited... he had spent millennia...") and multiple sentences open with "The" across paragraphs without variation. Stock metaphors abound ("turning pages in an empty room," "falling leaves," "dust fine as pollen"). Purple prose ("the pause of shifting constellations," "the great clock completing its cosmic cycle") elevates diction past POV plausibility and obscures concrete action. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the climax without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density and coherence penalties. The closure beat—"humility was the only crown he had ever sought to wear, and that he carried invisibly within his ancient heart"—is an abstract assertion rather than a concrete image, dulling the final moment. Paraphrase loops (the pretender's disguise "sloughed away" / "peeled back" / "split completely") recycle the same event.</comment>

<comment>The premise—ancient guardian unmasks usurper through cryptic library magic—is a stock fantasy template (wise mentor, false king, hidden truth) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The rune of drift and iron gall ink are named but not given unique properties that constrain the protagonist's method; they could be swapped for any magical sigil and reagent. The titan's millennia-long wait and the library's dissolution are presented as lyric grandeur but do not surprise or reweight expectation—the story delivers exactly what the setup promises with no hinge moment that feels inevitable only in hindsight. Emotional specificity is absent; the titan has no flaws, doubts, or costs that complicate the unmasking, and the pretender is a one-note villain. The derivative premise and lack of fresh inflection warrant the baseline adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The diminutive titan is present throughout, frames the setup, and executes the climax by opening the volume and speaking the sundering word. He drives two beats: the preparation (etching runes across millennia) and the unmasking (assembling the rune and speaking the word). However, his "decisions" are presented as patient execution of a predetermined plan without on-page friction, trade-off, or cost; he does not choose between competing tactics or pay a visible price. The character is causally active but not shaped by dilemma. Early signal +0.5, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability (any wise guardian could fill the role) −0.6 and no visible cost −0.5 yield mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>4.3</grade>
<comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears in three paragraphs: carried in the titan's pocket (setup), used to etch messages across millennia (backstory summary), and dissolves into shadow at the end (closure cameo). The object is mentioned but not handled or used in distinct on-page beats; its millennial etching is told rather than shown, and its final dissolution is passive consequence rather than active use. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in the present scene. Early signal +0.5, closure cameo +0.4, but summary-only use −0.6, swappability (any magical ink or reagent) −0.5, and missing middle development (cap 3.4) combine to limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The rune of drift is named in paragraph two, described as "a sigil that moved through time like water through stone," assembled from fragments in the climax, and rotates to unmask the pretender. It appears in setup and drives the ending, but its mechanics—how it "reveals what static truth could not see" or why fragments scattered across volumes become a spell—are asserted rather than demonstrated through on-page constraint. The concept shapes the climax but does not narrow the titan's options or impose a visible cost; it works as declared. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +1.0, two beats (fragments mentioned, rune assembled) +0.9, but swappability (any truth-magic) −0.6 and no causal pressure (the rune succeeds without friction) −0.8 place it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>3.1</grade>
<comment>"Regally unpretentious" is applied twice as a label—"the weight of epochs bowed his shoulders with regally unpretentious dignity" (opening) and "with a gesture regally unpretentious in its terrible finality" (climax)—but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is decorative phrasing rather than a tradeoff that shapes choice (e.g., humility preventing a quicker, harsher method, or regal bearing imposing a social cost). Label-only use −0.6, no causal pressure −0.8, and missing middle development (cap 3.4) severely limit the score.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>"Sunder" appears explicitly when the titan "spoke the sundering word that broke all false things apart," and the pretender's disguise sunders/splits in the following lines. The action is the climax's hinge: it transforms the situation from confrontation to unmasking and drives the ending. However, it arrives late (final third) without prior setup or constraint—no earlier beat shows the titan weighing whether to sunder, what the cost might be, or why this word rather than another. The action is causally central but not irreplaceable; any revelation-magic could substitute. Late arrival −0.4, closure linkage +1.2, one beat +0.4, but swappability −0.6 and no cost tied to the act −0.5 place it solidly mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.9</grade>
<comment>Cryptic messages left in library books are introduced in paragraph two ("scratching cryptic messages into the margins of forgotten grimoires") and return at the climax when the titan "opened the nearest volume to reveal pages tattooed with iron gall ink." The method is signaled and shapes the setup (millennia of preparation) and the ending (the assembled rune from scattered fragments). However, the mechanics are summarized rather than shown in distinct beats—we do not see the titan choosing which books, how the fragments coordinate, or the risk of discovery. The method enables the climax but does not constrain a present choice or impose visible cost. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.9, two beats +0.9, but summary-only use −0.6 and swappability (any hidden-clue method) −0.5 yield near mid-band placement.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The ancient temple library lost in time is established in the opening, anchors all action, and dissolves at the end in a thematically charged sequence. The setting provides atmosphere and symbolic weight (marble corridors, broken dome, Bronze Age columns crumbling to dust) and is present in setup, middle (pretender's entrance disturbs "dust of ages"), and ending. However, no spatial feature constrains a tactic or choice—the titan does not use the architecture, the stacks, or the library's isolation to force the pretender into a position or pay a price. The library acts on its own ("began their graceful collapse") rather than being leveraged by the protagonist. Early signal +0.7, three beats (opening, entrance, dissolution) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but no causal pressure (setting is backdrop, not tactical constraint) −1.2 yields low 6-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.8</grade>
<comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" appears in the opening and returns at the ending when "new constellations burned clear and cold, signaling that time would resume." The timeframe is poetic and frames the story's mythic scope, but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—no clock pressures the titan, and the "final configuration" arrives on schedule without tension. The element is present in setup and ending (two gates) but does not constrain middle action. Early signal +0.5, closure cameo +0.4, but no causal pressure (vague/untracked time) −0.8, swappability (any mythic timer) −0.5, and missing middle development (cap 3.4) combine to place it low-band, elevated slightly by lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The motivation to unmask the pretender is signaled in paragraph three ("his masquerade would finally end"), drives the titan's preparation (millennial message-etching), and is fulfilled in the climax when the false king is revealed. The desire is clear and causally central, appearing in setup, shaping implied backstory, and resolving at closure. However, the motivation is never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—the titan does not weigh mercy versus justice, risk versus certainty, or endure doubt. It is a stated goal executed without friction. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.2, two beats (setup, climax) +0.9, but no on-page conflict (told-only, no friction) −0.8 and no visible cost tied to the desire −0.5 yield mid-6 placement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Graceful collapse" is named in the library's dissolution ("graceful collapse, crumbling not into rubble but into dust fine as pollen") and pervades the final third: the columns crumble with "quiet dignity," the titan walks into "fading starlight," the library completes "its elegant dissolution." The tone is coherent, modulates from patient setup to lyric dissolution, and charges the final image with elegiac weight. It appears in setup (implied in "the weight of epochs"), intensifies at closure, and reweights the unmasking from violent triumph to serene inevitability. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.4, two beats (midpoint library sigh, ending dissolution) +0.9, causal pressure (tone shapes the reader's experience of closure) +0.8, but slight decorative excess (the tone is asserted more than earned through micro-choices) −0.4 yields solid mid-6 placement.</comment>
