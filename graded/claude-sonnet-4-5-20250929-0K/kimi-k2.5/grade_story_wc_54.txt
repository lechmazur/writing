<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's engineering mindset is consistently rendered through her perception of systems and flows, and her choices trace logically from survey to salvage to retrofit. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract formulations ("stoic wonder," "equations for hope") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final stance—sitting cross-legged, writing equations—feels more summarized than earned through visible struggle or competing impulses in scene. No other character pressures her choices, so relationship dynamics remain untested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: patterns of decay seed the retrofit solution, and the ending reweights "departure" into "sustenance." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the terminal lives again as greenhouse), and the cost is conceptual—the original purpose is foreclosed—but the piece never dramatizes Maya confronting a meaningful trade-off or obstacle that forces her to alter tactics. The night's work compresses into summary ("She worked through the night, rerouting…"), so escalation reads as told rather than shown, and no on-page reversal narrows her options mid-scene.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The spaceport is vividly specific: popcorn kernels, cracked terrazzo, stained glass skylight, carnival-installed pumps. These details anchor Maya's perceptual priorities (infrastructure, flow) and the carnival's auxiliary systems directly enable her solution, making setting causally active. The sextant piece recurs with shifted function (navigation tool → sunlight angle measure → paperweight), charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across mezzanine, central hub, and hydroponic rails.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving the terminal can serve a new purpose—is signaled early and sustained. Maya's agency is clear: she maps, reroutes, salvages, and measures. However, no on-page obstacle forces her to pivot or trade off competing goods; the carnival's leftover pumps solve the problem without visible cost or struggle. The ending crystallizes her thesis ("Hope...was not a finite resource"), but this conceptual reweighting lacks a dramatized moment where her choice forecloses a live alternative or exacts a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—resurrection through redirection, hope as differential pressure—emerges from concrete particulars (flows, salvaged rails, condensation) rather than assertion. The sextant's arc ("navigation without destination") and the final image of "teaching concrete and steel to photosynthesize" avoid overt moralizing. Yet the closing formulation ("Hope...was not a finite resource to be conserved but a pressure differential") edges toward thematic statement, and Maya's equations-in-margin epiphany summarizes rather than dramatizes the insight's cost or surprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Maya's engineer's lexicon ("circulatory systems," "pressure differential," "channeling"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she sees "bridges where others saw barriers" and reads decay as pattern. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("stoic wonder," "grammar of sustenance") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, especially under what should be high-pressure decision points. No dialogue present; internal monologue remains singular and controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language (maze, fossilized hearts, translation metaphor) serves thematic coherence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "not as it was intended, but as it needed to be" echoes earlier "not as a spaceport, but as a greenhouse"; "maze of intentions" recurs three times without evolving function. Key climactic work ("She worked through the night, rerouting...creating loops") is summarized rather than shown, flattening momentum. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she perceived patterns," "she felt the stoic wonder") dull immediacy in high-importance beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—intern retrofits abandoned spaceport into greenhouse via carnival infrastructure—offers a fresh synthesis of salvage, systems thinking, and adaptive reuse. The sextant-as-angle-measure turn is specific and non-obvious. Yet the emotional arc (lone surveyor discovers solution, writes equations) follows a familiar template of solitary problem-solving without interpersonal friction or moral complication. The piece commits fully to its logic but does not risk structural or perspectival unconventionality; the ending lands where the opening implies it will.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout, and her choices (mapping, rerouting, measuring) drive the retrofit. However, these decisions unfold without visible conflict or trade-off; no on-page reversal tests her commitment. The "curious" trait appears only in setup ("As a curious civil engineer intern"); later actions demonstrate methodical competence rather than curiosity under pressure. Her final stance (writing equations, descending into garden) participates in closure but does not reshape prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in three beats: discovery, sunlight measurement, and final paperweight. Its specific geometry (calibrated arc) enables the solar-collector angle calculation, a functional use. However, the piece's necessity is unclear—Maya could measure angles with other tools—and the "navigation without destination" metaphor remains ornamental rather than constraining a choice. The closure reprise reweights it as "no longer a broken relic but a paperweight," but this shift is asserted, not dramatized through cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is named three times: corridors designed to herd crowds, architectural intentions channeling obsolescence, and nutrient guidance through spiral gardens. The concept thematically frames the retrofit (redirection of designed flows), but it does not alter Maya's tactics on the page. She encounters no labyrinth that confuses or traps her; the term functions as metaphor rather than structural constraint. Integration is thematic, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is stated once in exposition ("she was functionally creative by nature, seeing bridges where others saw barriers"). The retrofit demonstrates creative problem-solving, but the trait itself does not impose a visible cost or enable a choice that another descriptor (e.g., "ingenious," "adaptive") could not. The label appears early but remains abstract; no on-page moment dramatizes creativity constrained by function or vice versa.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is signaled early ("resurrection did not require miracles") and governs the central action: Maya awakens dormant systems, cycles water, and revives atmospheric processors. The ending declares "The terminal lived again," directly fulfilling the action. The verb shapes two key beats (generator reroute, first water cycle) and charges the closure image. However, the resurrection is achieved without on-page failure or sacrifice, limiting felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled in setup ("the courage to redirect what remained") and enacted across multiple beats: rerouting generators through carnival filtration, redirecting flows against original design, creating loops. The method is specific—she does not build new, she rechannels—and the carnival's auxiliary pumps make this tactic possible. Yet the mechanics remain summary-level ("rerouting...redirecting...creating loops"), so the method's difficulty and trade-offs are told rather than shown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The spaceport anchors all action: its failed life support creates the problem, its cracked terrazzo and dormant machinery supply Maya's survey material, the carnival's installed pumps enable her solution, and the atrium becomes the greenhouse. The setting's dual history (spaceport/carnival) directly generates the salvage resources. Spatial elements (mezzanine, central hub, hydroponic rails) constrain and guide Maya's choices. The ending image (colonists arriving, terminal as sanctuary) is inseparable from the location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The carnival's departure is named in the opening ("after the carnival's departure") and motivates the popcorn-kernel detritus. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Maya works "through the night" without deadline pressure, and "by dawn" she completes the retrofit. The three-year gap since life-support failure is mentioned but does not constrain tactics. Time functions as backdrop, not driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To puzzle out new equations for hope" is stated in setup ("her true purpose lingered in the margins of her notebooks") and restated at closure ("she wrote her equations...Hope...was not a finite resource"). The motivation frames her goal, but the piece does not dramatize competing desires or friction between this abstract aim and concrete costs. Maya pursues the retrofit without visible doubt or sacrifice, so the motivation remains thematic rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is named once ("Maya felt the stoic wonder settle into her chest—a quiet awe that required no exclamation") and colors the ending's subdued register. The tone is coherent: no melodrama, controlled interiority, quiet confidence. However, it does not modulate under pressure—Maya's emotional register remains even throughout—and the label itself ("stoic wonder") is told rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or restrained reaction to setback. The tone supports theme but does not charge the final image with felt tension.</comment>
