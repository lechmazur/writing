<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's professional methodical precision is established early, but her interior life reads largely as exposition about her craft rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic choice to place the fragment on the oscillator feels more like puzzle-solving than a decision rooted in visible internal conflict or cost. Her "trembling hands" at the end assert emotion without prior embodied struggle, and the vindication moment skips over what she sacrifices or risks by succeeding. Backstory about "three decades" and her predecessor's death anchors motivation but does not create on-page friction between competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative texture: Elara's decision to invert protocol drives the discovery. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit—detecting protostellar ignition within galactic death—lands on the page with conceptual resonance, but the felt cost remains abstract: "trembling hands" and "vindicated" tell emotion rather than showing a foreclosed path or tangible sacrifice. The "by discarding assumptions" method appears suddenly in paragraph four without prior setup of what assumptions she wrestled with, creating a mini-causality gap. One meaningful tightening occurs (lunar perigee peak forcing the attempt), sufficient for this length, but the cost at closure is more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The suspended city, gorge winds, iron catwalks, and transmission spire are vivid and specific. The "hollywood star fragment" warming in her hands supplies a tactile anchor that recurs and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean: she climbs the spire, reaches the platform, places the fragment on the oscillator. The lunar perigee floods the gorge with silver light at the climax, directly shaping the moment of discovery and thus qualifying as constraint on the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus (resonance goggles, guy wires humming), though some phrases ("serenely electric") drift toward elevated diction without grounding in how she perceives electricity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving the "beginning in every ending" cosmic signal—is signaled early and sustained. The lunar perigee tightens the window for the attempt, and Elara's choice to discard protocol by placing the fragment directly on the oscillator constitutes one meaningful reversal that narrows options. However, the escalation lacks visible trade-off or loss: no failed prior attempt on the page, no dramatized risk of the towers collapsing, no mention of what happens if she's wrong. The predecessor's death is backstory, not present pressure. The resolution feels like puzzle-unlock rather than a choice with felt sacrifice, keeping this in mid-band despite coherent pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—"beginning in every ending," signal within silence, wisdom of emptiness—emerges from the fragment's function and the inversion of receiver logic. The final image of protostellar ignition within galactic collapse offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the piece leans heavily on telling: "exactly as the ancient transmission texts had promised but no one had proven" and "her life's work vindicated" are thematic echo phrases that flatten the discovery into prompt language. The shard of hush as negative imprint is a strong conceptual turn, but it arrives late and is explained rather than dramatized through earlier friction or failed choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and often specific ("guy wires humming a low modal drone," "quantum foam of space time"), but several phrases drift into elevated register that clashes with moment-to-moment perception: "serenely electric" repeated twice, "fantasy practicality" as a label rather than enacted stance, "the wisdom of emptiness" at closure. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("death scream…twelve billion years ago, preserved in the quantum foam") is legible and voice-motivated. Filter verbs are sparse. Perceptual signature is professional-technical but lacks idiosyncratic bias—Elara notices like a generalized scientist rather than a singular mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and strong specific nouns ("meteoric iron," "crystalline lattice," "transmission spire"). Information density is high in world-building passages. However, several loops and scaffold phrases appear: "serenely electric" used identically in paragraphs three and five, "hollywood star fragment" repeated without variation across beats, and the phrase "The hollywood star fragment warmed in her hands" in paragraph three is echoed by "The hollywood star fragment began to sing" in paragraph five. Template cadence in paragraph two: "She had always approached…treating cosmic mysteries…" and "But this fragment defied…resisting all attempts…" follow parallel stems. Figurative language is dense in peak beats without payoff ("carving meaning into pure silence," "seed in winter soil") but remains legible. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence touching closure vicinity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—tuning silence rather than amplifying signal, "shard of hush" as cosmic archive—offers a fresh angle on decoding-the-stars plots. The inversion of receiver logic (tuning for absence, not presence) is conceptually bold and specific to this world's rules. However, the execution leans on familiar beats: lone scientist at abandoned facility, lunar event deadline, dead predecessor, vindication of life's work. The "fantasy practicality" framing is asserted as a label rather than enacted through grinding problem-solving on the page. Transformation test flags that the emotional arc (professional vindication) could transfer to other discovery plots with minor edits, and the "beginning in every ending" phrasing echoes common mythic/philosophical templates without fully personalizing them through lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present in all five paragraphs and her choice to discard protocol (placing the fragment directly on the oscillator) drives the climactic discovery. She is signaled in the opening line and her professional identity shapes her approach. However, the interpretation work itself is largely summarized ("she adjusted the dials with minute precision") rather than dramatized through failed attempts or visible problem-solving friction. Her role trends toward observer-decoder in the final beat rather than active agent forcing the outcome through high-cost choice. Two beats (climbing the spire, inverting the gain) show decision; the ending shows her recording data, a lower-agency act. Cap consideration: setup strong, middle choice present, closure participation observational but causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fragment appears in paragraph one (cradled in her hands, noting unusual warmth), paragraph three (warming, responding to perigee), paragraph four (placed on the oscillator), and paragraph five (begins to sing, carves meaning into silence). Setup early, middle use alters tactics (discarding isolation protocol), closure participation direct (the fragment's "song" enables the discovery). The warmth escalates across beats, and its placement on the oscillator is the key causal choice. Specificity is high: meteoric iron, crystalline lattice, three-foot silence radius. However, "hollywood star fragment" as a phrase is repeated identically without variation, a minor texture slip. The fragment is indispensable to the plot and charges the final image, meeting high-band tests.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" is introduced in paragraph two, described as absorbing vibrational energy and creating absolute silence. It shapes the central problem (previous interpreters tried to circumvent it) and the solution (tuning *with* it rather than against it). Paragraph five reframes it as "not a barrier to communication; it was a negative imprint of everything that had ever been shouted into the cosmos," a conceptual repricing that reweights the premise. Setup at ~25%, middle friction (resisting harmonic analysis), closure participation (negative imprint revelation drives discovery). The concept constrains tactics (can't use conventional methods) and enables the ending. Slight deduction for the reframe arriving as explanation rather than dramatized realization through on-page trial.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" appears twice: paragraph three ("the night air serenely electric with potential energy") and paragraph five ("The serenely electric night air crystallized around her"). Both instances are descriptive atmosphere without constraining or enabling a choice. The trait does not alter Elara's tactics, create a tradeoff, or carry cost. It functions as tone-setting diction rather than a story-shaping attribute. No setup/development/payoff integration; purely ornamental. Late first use (second half of story) and static repetition without causal work caps this in the 4.0–5.0 range. The phrase's recurrence in the climax suggests an attempt at lyric reprise, but it does not reweight meaning or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Tune" and "tuning" anchor the protagonist's goal from paragraph one ("the impossible tuning that had killed her predecessor") through the climax. Paragraph four: she inverts the gain stages and tunes "not for signal but for the shape of the void itself." Paragraph five: "she matched the towers' resonance to this hollow frequency, the static resolved into coherent patterns." The action is irreplaceable: the story hinges on the method of tuning receivers to absence rather than presence. Setup early (first paragraph), middle development (protocol inversion), closure payoff (matching resonance enables discovery). Causal pressure and specificity are high. Minor deduction: the exact mechanics of "inverting the gain stages" and "matching the towers' resonance" remain abstract; we don't see failed tuning attempts or micro-adjustments that cost time or risk.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "by discarding assumptions" appears explicitly in paragraph four: "forcing herself to discard assumptions she had held since her apprenticeship began. She did not mount the fragment in the isolation chamber as protocol demanded… Instead, she placed it directly upon the primary oscillator." This moment is the key tactical choice that enables the discovery. However, the method is not signaled before paragraph four—no prior beat shows her wrestling with assumptions or testing and rejecting conventional approaches on the page. The phrase functions as a late tell rather than an earned pattern. Setup absent, development concentrated in one beat, closure participation indirect (the result of the method). Swappability moderate: the choice reads as insight rather than constraint-driven necessity. Score in mid-band for functional presence without full integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The setting—abandoned radio towers suspended over a gorge—is introduced in paragraph one and recurs in all major beats. Paragraph two mentions "the city's last celestial signal interpreter," anchoring the abandoned context. Paragraph three: she climbs the central transmission spire; paragraph four: she reaches the platform and accesses the oscillator. The towers' guy wires hum, the gorge winds blow, and the lunar light floods the space at the climax. The setting supplies the necessary infrastructure (towers, oscillator array) and the isolation (abandoned, last interpreter) that makes the attempt possible. However, the gorge itself is largely atmospheric; it does not constrain her choices or supply a resource she must work around. Spatial choreography is clear. The setting shapes mood and access but does not force tactical tradeoffs, keeping this in upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lunar perigee ("closest approach in eighteen years") is introduced in paragraph one, recurs as motivation in paragraph two, and peaks in paragraphs three and five: "as the lunar disc swelled," "the lunar perigee peaked, flooding the gorge with silver light." The timeframe tightens the decision window (tonight is the night) and the fragment responds to the perigee's gravitational influence, making the discovery possible only during this event. Setup early, middle pressure (she climbs as the moon swells), closure linkage direct (perigee peak coincides with discovery). The clock is live and tracked across beats. Slight deduction: no cost is shown for missing the window or arriving late; the urgency is declared but not tested by on-page friction (e.g., delays, equipment failure, time running out mid-attempt). Still, the timeframe shapes tactics and charges the final image, qualifying for the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the beginning in every ending" appears in paragraph three ("She was here to find the beginning in every ending, to prove that death throes of distant suns contained the birth cries of new solar systems") and is fulfilled in paragraph five ("The beginning in every ending, exactly as the ancient transmission texts had promised"). The desire drives the attempt and the closure delivers on it. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through competing wants or visible friction: no scene shows what she sacrifices to pursue this goal, no moment where she must choose it over safety or another priority. The phrasing is abstract and prompt-like. Setup mid-story (paragraph three), closure participation strong (discovery validates the quest), but lack of on-page cost or conflicted choice keeps this in the 6.0–7.0 range. The vindication is asserted ("her life's work vindicated") rather than felt through embodied reaction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" is introduced in paragraph two ("She had always approached her craft with fantasy practicality, treating cosmic mysteries as engineering problems") and recurs implicitly in her methodical protocol inversion. The tone—blending speculative cosmic elements with engineering problem-solving—is coherent across the piece. However, the label "fantasy practicality" itself is static tell; the tone is enacted through diction (resonance goggles, oscillator, gain stages, bandwidth) but does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image. The discovery moment in paragraph five shifts toward lyric awe ("carving meaning into pure silence," "seed in winter soil") without integrating the practical engineering texture, creating slight tonal drift. Setup mid-story, no clear development through conflicted beats, closure participation oblique. The tone is consistent but does not constrain choice or reweight meaning at the end, keeping this in mid-band.</comment>
