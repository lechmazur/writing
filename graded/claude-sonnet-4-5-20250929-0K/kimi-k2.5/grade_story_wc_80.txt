<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's professional motivation is clear and consistent—mapping abandoned dreams—but her interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The "stoically sensitive" attribute appears as description ("no gasp") rather than dramatized tension between competing impulses. Her final choice to return tomorrow reads as continuation rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost, limiting the sense of genuine stakes or internal conflict driving the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (surveyor, submerged pavilion, post-drawbridge) within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and thematic layering build toward a final image of preservation. However, no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs—Elara executes her survey work without complication, and the ending restates her opening intent ("she will return tomorrow") without decisive change or felt cost. The closure reads as stasis without the foreclosure or conceptual repricing that would elevate it to Earned Stasis or Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with specific tactile and visual detail (barnacles, seaweed, corroded door, moonlight through skylights). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The setting constrains Elara's movement (wading, straining against hinges) and charges the final image (harbor floor, raised drawbridge). Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional focus, and the environment subtly mirrors her thematic concern with permanence and decay.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting the pavilion before collapse—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no obstacles, time pressure, or trade-offs; she completes her survey as planned. The corroded door offers momentary physical resistance but opens without consequence. Under the Accumulative lens, one would expect density to reweight the stake or cadence to shift at closure, but the ending merely restates her commitment without a visible cost or narrowed option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme of preservation versus loss emerges through concrete images (toy horse, architect's fiancée, eroded marble) and the pavilion's slow collapse. However, the final paragraph risks moralizing: "people once believed in permanence, in beauty, in the durability of joy" edges toward thematic summary. The inkwell returns at the end but does not reweight prior material with fresh irony or cost; it confirms rather than complicates the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrative voice remains stable and employs elevated diction throughout ("interlaced absence," "hushed blaze," "watery cathedral"). However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—phrases like "invisible architecture of human longing" could belong to any lyric observer. Register stays consistently elevated even during physical exertion (wading, wrenching door), reducing the sense of stress modulation. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "the hushed blaze of her concentration," "invisible architecture of human longing," "tapestry of what was lost and what endures." Figurative density in most sentences flattens propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear ("The surveyor empties water" / "Elara walks toward her truck"). Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" sentence openings. Mixed metaphor: the building "slowly kneeling, as if in penance" after being described as "ribs of some beached leviathan." Line-level artifacts dull the closure image and trigger disallowance of 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—surveyor documenting a submerged historical site—follows a familiar elegiac structure without fresh synthesis. The "notes in foundation repairs" method and "archaeologist of abandoned dreams" frame read as stock metaphors for preservation work. Emotional truth is present but expressed through elevated abstractions ("geography of lost hope") rather than surprising particulars. The architect's drowned fiancée backstory arrives late as convenient pathos rather than earned complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as surveyor frames the premise and anchors her presence, but she makes no consequential choices—she executes her survey as planned from the opening. Observation dominates; her decision to "return tomorrow" at the end is continuation rather than a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The inkwell appears in three beats (paragraph 1, paragraph 3 opener, final paragraph), but its use is static—she opens it, writes with it, touches it. No evolving meaning or cost tied to the object; it serves as a prop for her note-taking without constraining choice or charging the closure beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is named in paragraph 2 and echoed thematically (missing dancers, drowned fiancée) but never shapes a tactical choice or alters Elara's options. It functions as theme-claim rather than on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" appears as label in paragraph 1 ("professional stoicism like armor") and again in paragraph 5 ("no gasp") but is told rather than dramatized through a choice with visible cost. The trait does not constrain or enable a key action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears twice: wresting truth (paragraph 2) and wresting the corroded door open (paragraph 5). The door moment involves physical effort but no consequence—it opens, and she continues her survey. The action is present but swappable with "pull" or "force" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method is introduced in paragraph 4 ("placing notes in foundation repairs") and executed in paragraph 6 (sealing the final note with epoxy). It shapes her activity across the middle and ending, qualifying for two-gate eligibility. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure or create a visible cost; she completes the task as planned.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion anchors every beat, provides tactile resistance (cold water, corroded hinges, anaerobic mud), and charges the final image (harbor floor, raised drawbridge). It constrains her movement and supplies the sensory particulars that define her work. Setup, middle involvement, and closure presence all met with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The drawbridge appears in the opening line and the penultimate paragraph but does not tighten decisions. No time pressure emerges; Elara works at her own pace. The timeframe anchors the setting but does not constrain tactics or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in paragraph 3 ("to become the archaeologist of abandoned dreams") and restated at the end ("she will return tomorrow"). It frames her presence but is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction between desire and cost. Told-only, with no on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is named twice (paragraphs 5 and 7) and the tone remains consistent—reverential, elegiac, quietly intense. The tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure or charge the final image beyond atmosphere. Present and coherent but static, landing mid-band per the guidance.</comment>
