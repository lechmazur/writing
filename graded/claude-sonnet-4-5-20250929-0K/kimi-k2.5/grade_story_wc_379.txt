<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's core motivation (prove that listening heals) is declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Her seventeen-year curator role is asserted but doesn't constrain her investigative choices; she moves through the neighborhood gathering stories without visible cost or internal friction. Mr. Alvarez's moment at the mailbox carries embodied weight, but Maya's role remains observational rather than decisively active. The agency gap and lack of on-page trade-offs prevent higher scoring despite solid supporting characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the end of paragraph one, satisfying the test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Maya gathers story fragments that accumulate toward the mailbox reveal. However, closure relies on Mr. Alvarez's off-stage decision to approach the box and Maya's unearned knowledge ("She wanted you to have this," admitted as guess). The mailbox key's sudden appearance and the construction crew's implausible pause dilute causal integrity. The resonance is present but the cost to Maya herself remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (amber rays, dust motes, marigolds). Spatial choreography tracks clearly through the flower cart, bakery, and mailbox perimeter. The locket and mailbox function as charged objects that recur meaningfully. However, the construction crews remain a distant backdrop rather than a tangible constraint that alters Maya's tactics, and the fifty-pace distance feels postcard-staged rather than pressure-driven. The setting supports atmosphere but does not force a key choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unlock the mailbox mystery before demolition) is signaled early and the timeframe (construction arrival) provides external pressure. Yet Maya's investigation proceeds without meaningful obstacle or tightening; neighbors simply share their fragments on request. The climactic mailbox opening belongs entirely to Mr. Alvarez; Maya's role as witness does not constitute protagonist agency. The foreman's unexplained pause removes the declared urgency at the moment it should bite hardest. One tightening (the time constraint) exists but does not foreclose options or exact visible cost from Maya.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of listening-as-healing emerges through accumulated testimony and the mailbox reveal. The locket-as-memory and locked-box-as-silence motifs recur purposefully. However, Maya explicitly names the theme in her stated motivation ("to prove that listening heals"), and the final paragraph borders on sermonic with "proving that listening heals not just individuals but the entire architecture of a place." The construction foreman's inexplicable bow and the community hand-holding feel orchestrated to deliver a thesis rather than arising from earned particulars. The emotional truth in Mr. Alvarez's reunion is undercut by the tidy communal catharsis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Maya's perceptual filter. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("deferred grief," "ritual older than their steel," "architecture of a place") that feels writerly rather than character-specific. Mrs. Rodriguez's dialogue ("They say she waited by the mailbox every day for thirty years") and Maya's unearned certainty about the locket's intended recipient both feel expository. The prose texture is controlled but lacks the idiom-specific signature that would distinguish Maya's interior voice under pressure. No head-hopping, but psychic distance widens at closure when collective emotional reaction is narrated with unwarranted certainty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple ornamental metaphors stack without causal purpose: "sandstorm frozen in time," "sandstorm calm," "healing water," "fine desert silt" repeat the desert image without developing it. Template cadence appears in the investigation sequence: "She began at... She moved through... She learned that..." Filter verbs ("watched," "saw," "knew") cluster in high-pressure moments. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs two and three both explain that Maya will solve the mystery by listening/following. The line "She wanted you to have this" is acknowledged as unearned within the text itself, breaking immersion. Artifactual phrasing ("the attribute of leads through following") reads as prompt-speak rather than natural narration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox-with-lost-love-letter premise is a familiar template (secret-that-explains-everything). The thrift-store-curator frame and neighborhood-demolition timeframe are conventional. Maya's method (gathering oral history) and the seventeen-year tenure offer specificity, but the execution follows predictable beats: clue discovery, elder interviews, key holder revealed, emotional letter read aloud, community catharsis. The construction foreman's inexplicable reverence and the too-tidy communal hand-holding signal a reluctance to complicate the redemptive arc. No fresh synthesis or risky transformation of the core material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya (the discerning thrift-store curator) is present across all beats and her profession enables the locket discovery. However, her curator's eye does not constrain or enable a key choice under pressure; her investigation could proceed identically if she were a teacher or librarian. The "discerning" trait is asserted but not demonstrated through on-page decisions that alter tactics or reveal a hierarchy of values. She observes and offers the locket but does not drive the closure turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The aged locket appears in paragraph one (discovery), recurs when Maya traces its engraving in paragraph two, and returns in the climax when she offers it to Mr. Alvarez. The initials E.L. and miniature portrait anchor its specificity. It bridges the mailbox mystery and charges the final recognition. However, the locket does not constrain Maya's choices or tactics; it functions primarily as a symbolic pass-key rather than a tool that shapes investigative method. Three beats and closure linkage earn mid-range scoring, but causal pressure and irreplaceability remain moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The locked mailbox mystery is the story's spine: it drives Maya's investigation, structures the accumulative testimony beats, and delivers the climactic reveal. The mystery shapes tactics (Maya follows the stories, tracks Mr. Alvarez) and the resolution reweights community memory. Present in setup (paragraph one), developed through middle testimony, and resolved at closure. The concept is indispensable; without it, the story collapses. Slight deduction because the mailbox itself remains off-stage until the final beat and the key's arrival is unexplained.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is named explicitly in paragraph two and demonstrated when Maya walks fifty paces behind Mr. Alvarez, allowing him to reach the box first. This attribute constrains her choice (she does not rush forward) and the restraint carries thematic cost (honoring his moment). However, the trait is announced in near-prompt language ("the attribute that would unlock this puzzle was leads through following") rather than emerging through action. One clear on-page constraint with visible cost, but late signal and label-heavy execution limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maya's primary action is to hear neighborhood stories, which accumulates testimony across paragraphs three and four. The method drives the investigation and enables the closure by establishing the emotional context for the mailbox reveal. However, "hear" as an action is passive; Maya listens but does not interrogate, challenge, or synthesize the fragments into new knowledge that alters her tactics. The stories flow to her without resistance. The action is present and functional but could be replaced with "ask" or "gather" with minimal structural impact. Setup, development, and thematic linkage to "listening heals" earn solid mid-range scoring, but causal pressure remains moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is signaled in paragraph three ("the method of neighborhood storytelling wove through the morning") and executed across the investigation: Mrs. Rodriguez, the baker, the retired postman, and children each contribute fragments. The method shapes Maya's investigative path and accumulates the pressure that charges the mailbox reveal. It is irreplaceable; a different method (archival research, direct interrogation) would break the thematic link to communal listening. Present in setup, developed across multiple beats, and tied to closure. The explicit label ("the method of neighborhood storytelling") feels slightly forced, preventing top-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The vibrant courtyard at dawn is vividly described in the opening and houses the mailbox, flower cart, and gathered community. It anchors spatial choreography and charges the final collective moment. However, the courtyard does not constrain Maya's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. The construction crews (mentioned as arriving "three streets over") never intrude upon the courtyard space itself. Setup and closure participation are present, but the setting remains postcard-descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "when the outside world intrudes" is introduced in paragraph one (construction crews arriving, eviction notices) and recurs when demolition crews begin their "jackhammer symphony." The foreman appears at the perimeter in the climax. However, the time pressure does not tighten Maya's decisions; she proceeds at her own pace and the foreman inexplicably pauses, removing the urgency at the moment it should force a trade-off. The clock is mentioned but not enforced. Setup and thematic presence without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Maya's motivation "to prove that listening heals" is explicitly stated in paragraph two and thematically reflected in her investigation method and the closure's communal hand-holding. However, the desire is told rather than tested through conflicting wants or visible costs. Maya never doubts, rushes, or faces a moment where listening must compete with another urgent need. The motivation frames the story but does not generate friction or force a choice that forecloses a path. Label-heavy and untested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" is named twice (paragraph one as "sandstorm frozen in time," paragraph three as "sandstorm calm") and echoed in the final paragraph's "profound silence." The tone attempts to balance urgency (construction, demolition) with stillness (dawn, gathering, ritual). However, the metaphor is ornamental rather than integrated; the sandstorm image does not modulate with pressure or charge the final beat in a specific way. Coherent but static, without the tonal shift that would elevate closure.</comment>
