<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is defined primarily through lyric description ("creature who existed only in the refraction") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The borrowed heartbeat mechanism provides a constraint, but his interior experience remains externalized and abstract—"perceptively calm" is asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The ending forecloses his presence with visible cost (the heartbeat fades, he vanishes), meeting baseline closure requirements, but the choice to leave feels inevitable rather than earned by prior contradiction or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered imagery (mirrors, singing, prism light) toward a final reconfiguration where possibilities linger in glass after Elias departs. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—he completes his work and vanishes, foreclosing continuation with visible cost (loss of borrowed heartbeat, evaporation into dark). Orientation anchors arrive late: "echoing terrace," "Elias," and "mirage painter" are present early, but his nature and the mirror's purpose clarify only after extended description, slightly past the ~120-word guideline without clear payoff for the delay. The Cost proof test: "leaving only wet footprints that evaporated" and "the borrowed heartbeat faded from his chest" make cost legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The terrace, glass, and prism parapet supply recurring spatial anchors; the mirror constrains Elias's action (he must approach it, press his palm, trace symbols) and the "prism parapet after rain" feeds energy to stabilize visions, meeting the micro-setting standard. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("spectral ladders," "clouded with humidity") with limited tactile or auditory specificity beyond bells. The final image—wet footprints evaporating, possibilities lingering in glass—charges closure by tying environment to thematic stakes, qualifying for the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and drives action. Pressure tightens once: the borrowed heartbeat begins to falter, forcing Elias to sing faster while maintaining composure, a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, agency reads passive; Elias executes a ritual whose outcome feels predetermined rather than forged by on-page choice with competing costs. The resolution (he completes the work, then vanishes) is more endurance than decision, and the cost—loss of heartbeat and dissolution—lands visibly but without prior friction or trade-off that would elevate the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—lives as fluid possibilities rather than fixed portraits—emerges through the mirror's shifting visions and Elias's transient nature without overt statement. The closing image ("possibilities he had painted lingered in the glass, waiting for one to look close enough to see life not as it was, but as it might become") reweights prior material and offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the implicit question of agency and potential. However, the metaphor is slightly over-articulated in the final lines, edging toward explanation rather than pure image, and "watercolors, bleeding with opportunity" feels decorative rather than earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited, filtered through Elias's perceptions ("perceptively calm," "knew that persuading mirrors"). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, consistent with the accumulative mode, though some phrases border on stock poeticism ("voice weaving through the damp air like smoke"). The brief dialogue ("Show them") serves as incantation rather than character interaction, appropriately muted. Perceptual signature is present but generalizes toward the mystical; under peak pressure (bells ringing, heartbeat fading) the syntax does not compress or shift rhythm to reflect urgency, maintaining uniform lyricism that slightly flattens embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("twilight pooled between the stone columns like ink," "spectral ladders," "dusky harmony shattered into a thousand ringing fragments") without sufficient pattern-teaching or payoff; multiple adjacent sentences in the opening and middle beats layer metaphor upon metaphor, triggering the overwriting density penalty (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "His borrowed heartbeat began to falter" followed immediately by "Elias sang faster… even as his medium threatened to dissolve" restates urgency without advancing action (−0.2). Clarity remains navigable, but momentum is dulled by ornamental phrasing ("creature who existed only in the refraction between rain and memory") that does not propel causality. Combined artifact deductions and high filter-verb presence ("began to hum," "remained stubborn," "began to sing") in peak beats disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—painter who uses borrowed heartbeats to coax mirrors into showing alternate futures—offers a fresh synthesis of mirage-artist and possibility-vision tropes. Execution leans into lyric accumulation rather than causal surprise, which is valid under the chosen lens. The ending's reconfiguration (possibilities linger after Elias departs) feels earned by prior particulars and commits fully to the premise without retreat. However, the core emotional arc (transient artist completes ephemeral work, then vanishes) follows a familiar mystical-artisan template without transformation through specific lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus, preventing higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias appears early, drives the singing and symbol-tracing across multiple beats, and his dissolution at closure is causally tied to the borrowed heartbeat's return. However, his choices feel more like ritual execution than live decision-making; he does not weigh competing options or face friction that alters tactics. Present in setup, middle, and payoff (three gates), with some causal pressure (needs heartbeat to work, must finish before bells), but the "elusive" and "mirage" descriptors remain ornamental labels rather than constraints that force visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prism parapet after rain is mentioned in the opening beat, reappears when it "caught his voice and shattered it into colors," and again when it "glowed with captured light, feeding energy into the transformation," then dims at closure as the sun surrenders. Three beats with evolving function (descriptive anchor → energy source → dimming signal). It shapes one key turn (stabilizing the visions) and contributes to closure's charge by marking the ritual's end. Meets all three gates with purposeful recurrence, but its properties are asserted rather than tested under pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is introduced early ("Tonight, Elias carried a borrowed heartbeat thrumming against his ribs"), explicitly constrains his ability ("Without this living rhythm, he was merely pigment and shade"), synchronizes with the song's hidden mathematics in the middle beat, begins to falter and forces faster action, and its return to the clockmaker at closure forecloses Elias's presence ("The borrowed heartbeat faded from his chest like a dream upon waking"). Present in all three gates, drives two escalation beats (synchronization and faltering), and is indispensable to the ending's cost and logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears twice as a descriptive label ("perceptively calm as he surveyed," "Elias remained perceptively calm, though his stolen pulse quickened") but does not visibly constrain or enable action with cost. The trait is asserted during pressure moments without dramatizing how calmness alters his choices or creates trade-offs; it reads as atmospheric diction rather than a functional attribute. Present in setup and middle but ornamental; no payoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Grace" is mentioned three times: "Elias moved across the wet tiles with grace," "He moved with grace, tracing symbols," and "his grace never wavering" during the final push. It describes his manner without shaping stakes or enabling specific tactics; easily replaceable with "fluidity" or "poise" with no structural impact. Label-only use across beats without causal pressure or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coded lullabies in children's songs are introduced early ("began to sing, his method unfolding through coded lullabies"), shape the middle beat ("each phrase a key turning in the lock of perception," "as he sang about stars and sheep and silver threads"), and continue through the escalation ("Through the coded lullabies… each verse coaxing another potential future"). The method's mechanics—unlocking spatial logic via ancient melody—are asserted but not tested under friction; Elias does not adjust or improvise the method when the heartbeat falters. Present in all three gates and involved in two beats, but the method functions as ritual rather than problem-solving tool, capping at mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The echoing terrace in spring is established in the opening line, returns as "the echoing terrace in spring" during the sacred-pause description, and closes the piece ("The terrace remained echoing and empty"). It provides spatial anchor and atmospheric container but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome; Elias's actions would proceed identically in any similar outdoor mirrored space. Lyric reprise (first line → final paragraph) reweights atmosphere without causal constraint, qualifying for mid-band under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe—"the hush before bells ring"—is introduced early, explicitly tracked ("the sacred pause before the evening bells marked the hour"), and tightens pressure in escalation ("His borrowed heartbeat began to falter," "Elias sang faster," "Then the first bell rang, shattering the dusky harmony"). The live clock directly alters tactics (he must accelerate) and triggers closure (bells mark the end, heartbeat fades). Present in all three gates, drives one key escalation beat, and is indispensable to the ending's timing and cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to persuade mirrors to show possibilities is stated early ("Show them," "persuading mirrors to show possibilities required absolute stillness"), drives the central action (singing, tracing symbols), and is fulfilled at closure ("the mirrors showed cascading possibilities"). However, the desire is never dramatized as conflicted; Elias does not weigh competing wants or face friction between the goal and its cost beyond the mechanical constraint of the fading heartbeat. Present in all three gates with functional involvement but minimal internal friction or trade-off, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dusky harmony appears early ("when the world softened into dusky harmony"), is shattered by the bells ("shattering the dusky harmony into a thousand ringing fragments"), and the tone modulates from stillness to urgency across the escalation. The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image (harmony breaks, Elias vanishes into "gathering dark"). However, the label "dusky harmony" is somewhat static and decorative; the tonal shift (calm → urgency → quiet aftermath) tracks pressure but does not reconfigure meaning at closure in a way that elevates thematic stakes.</comment>
