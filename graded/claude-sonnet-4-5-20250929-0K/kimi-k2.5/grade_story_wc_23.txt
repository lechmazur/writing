<comment>The protagonist's interiority is vivid and character-specific ("prosthetic leg drumming...in an arrhythmia that matched her heart"), with embodied emotion and contradictory impulses (walking backward through evacuation columns, anchored by gravity that isn't physical). However, much of the character work operates in reflective summary rather than on-page choice under pressure; the cognitive fluctuation attribute is told more than dramatized in a way that forecloses options. The final choice to activate the apparatus feels more like completion of an externally directed task than an internal struggle with visible cost. Mid-band entry appropriate given strong voice and texture, but the lack of a truly earned interior reversal caps higher scoring.</comment>

<comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds meaning through layered imagery (war salvage, coastlines, hydraulics, bronze censer) and arrives at a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she constructs a compass pointing toward loss and accepts inhabiting the ruin. The closure image ("understanding that reverse migration meant coming home to the ruin because it was the only geography left that recognized her name") carries conceptual cost and reweights the premise. Orientation anchors early (starlit signal station, failed hydraulics, midnight phone). One meaningful deepening occurs when she completes the apparatus and understands its purpose. However, the cost remains largely conceptual and abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page; the final beat reads more as thematic summation than a moment where options narrow with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<comment>The starlit signal station is vivid and purposeful: "rusted deck," "defunct hydraulic lines," "floor grates" with corrosion all anchor the space concretely. The setting constrains choice (hydraulics failed three weeks ago, she remains anchored) and charges the final image (the station becomes her instrument). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV bias (verdigris matching corrosion, bronze humming through patchwork joints). The micro-setting approach—body, prosthetic leg, bronze censer foot—functions as terrain that pressures the protagonist's stance. Spatial choreography stays coherent (observation deck, chapel ruins below, rotary phone). The piece meets the 9+ gate test by having environment constrain choice and charge the closure, though some details lean ornamental ("starlit") rather than functionally pressuring.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake is clear: navigate/map the geography of loss, build the apparatus instructed by the midnight voice. The piece offers one meaningful deepening when she understands the purpose ("The geography of loss wasn't terrain you crossed; it was terrain you constructed"). Agency at closure is present but muted—she completes the apparatus and activates it, achieving the goal without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The escalation reads more as gradual assembly than a tightening that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through layered imagery, but the final act feels like arrival at a pre-determined end rather than a choice that costs something on the page. No antagonist or external resistance; coincidence does not resolve, but the protagonist's will is never genuinely tested.</comment>

<comment>Theme (mapping loss as constructed geography, refusing evacuation to inhabit the ruin) emerges organically from imagery and action rather than statement. The bronze censer foot shifts meaning from chapel ruin artifact to ceremonial compass pivot, a purposeful reprise. Subtext operates in the midnight voice's cryptic instructions and the protagonist's backward migration against the flow. The final image offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing: "reverse migration meant coming home to the ruin because it was the only geography left that recognized her name." However, phrases like "raw solace—unpolished, grinding, honest" and "geography of loss" risk thematic echo, coming close to articulating the thesis. The piece avoids the explain-everything ending but hovers near explicit theme statement in the penultimate and final paragraphs.</comment>

<comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: diction is elevated but character-specific ("liminal tower," "meridian where the girl's voice had last bounced off satellites"), and the prose reflects the navigator's technical/geographic lexicon. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are present ("archipelago of absences," "topographical map of every goodbye") and taught early, remaining legible at closure. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-rooted ("negative spaces," "inverse migration") in a way that slightly dilutes voice particularity. Filter verbs are minimal. The rhythmic control under pressure is strong, with syntax tightening as understanding crystallizes.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The prose is lyric and dense, with vivid imagery ("skin grafted over titanium ribs," "moon was a rind," "verdigris matching the corrosion"). However, pervasive figurative density in nearly every sentence creates textural drag without clear pattern payoff: "bell a wound opening in the dark," "lunar tide filling her cognitive cracks with silver light," "archipelago of absences." Some metaphors feel strained or mixed (hydraulics as circulatory system for an engine that runs on memory). Paraphrase loops appear: "geography of loss" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in passages like "She understood now... She was building... She soldered..." creates rhythmic monotony. Information density is high but momentum sags under ornamental layering. Strong specific nouns and verbs, but the overwriting in peak beats (final third) triggers penalty and disallows 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<comment>The premise (reverse migration, building a loss-compass in a defunct lighthouse) offers a fresh synthesis of familiar post-apocalyptic imagery. The cognitive-fluctuation-with-moon-phases detail and the bronze censer foot as ceremonial pivot are specific and non-obvious. However, the core arc—solitary figure in a ruined station performing symbolic task to process grief—is a recognizable template. The ending reweights prior material but feels foreseeable: the apparatus completes, she understands its purpose, and achieves Earned Stasis by choosing to remain. Emotional specificity is present (daughter's voice lost in radio fuzz, patchwork body from war salvage), but the transformation test is borderline: swap names and setting details, and the emotional arc remains largely unchanged. The piece commits to its premise but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would heighten stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Patchwork navigator present from opening and focalizes throughout. She makes the decision to fit the censer foot and activate the apparatus, but these acts feel like completion of external instruction rather than choices that create key turns. Her observation and understanding dominate; the action of building is summarized more than dramatized in distinct beats with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Patina bronze censer foot introduced early (found in chapel ruins), handled in the peak beat (fitted into apparatus, locked with "a click like a bone settling"), and charged at closure (palm on warm bronze, throb matching her heart). It appears in three distinct beats: discovery context, installation, and final tactile contact. Its ceremonial weight anchors the compass pivot, a specific irreplaceable function. However, the object does not constrain an earlier choice or narrow options; it serves the predetermined assembly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Reverse migration shapes the stakes (walking backward through evacuation, returning to the tower) and the thematic center (constructing geography of loss). It appears in the opening, mid-story reflection, and closing line. The concept alters her tactics (refusing evacuation, remaining anchored) and charges the final image. However, it functions more as thematic frame than a mechanic that changes on-page options in a causal turn. Solid lyric-resonance reprise with felt cost in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.3</grade>
<comment>Cognitive precision fluctuating with moon phases is described in one reflective block (full moon clarity, new moon confusion) and mentioned again at the gibbous tonight when "her hands steadied." It provides texture but does not visibly constrain or enable a key choice with dramatized cost. The trait is told more than shown; we do not see her claw at walls or misidentify north on the page. Label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>"Build" is the protagonist's dominant action and frames the entire arc: building the apparatus from salvage, soldering the final wire, activating the switch. It drives the ending and is signaled early through the midnight voice's instruction. However, the act of building is largely summarized rather than dramatized in discrete, high-pressure beats. The major turn traces to completion of this action, but it feels more like fulfilling a task than a choice that redefines options. Solidly essential but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>Cryptic phone calls at midnight appear early (rotary phone shrieking, voice instructing placement of censer foot) and return at closure ("The midnight phone would ring again, but she no longer needed the cryptic instructions"). The method provides the blueprint for the build and bookends the piece. However, the phone itself is not shown ringing or answered in the peak beat; its mechanics do not shape attempts or constrain tactics on the page in a visible way.</comment>

<comment>Starlit signal station anchors the piece from the opening line and supplies key resources: rusted deck, defunct hydraulic lines, observation deck, chapel ruins below. The failed hydraulics provide the temporal frame (three weeks ago) and the material she repurposes into the apparatus. The setting constrains her choice to remain ("anchored by a gravity") and charges the final image (station as instrument, hydraulics as circulatory system). Micro-setting elements (floor grates, bronze foot) alter tactics. The station is indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Timeframe "after the hydraulics failed" anchors the opening and provides backstory (three weeks ago, pumps gave out). Tonight's gibbous moon tightens the present moment ("As the moon rose gibbous tonight, her hands steadied"). However, the temporal pressure is diffuse; no live clock alters moves within the single scene. The hydraulic failure is a past event whose consequence (no breathing lighthouse) frames the setup but does not tighten decisions on the page. Lyric reprise without middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Motivation to navigate the geography of loss is stated by the midnight voice and internalized by the protagonist in reflection ("She understood now..."). It drives her refusal to evacuate and her acceptance of the ruin at closure. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicted on-page choices with visible friction between want and cost. The protagonist completes the task without significant obstacle or internal contradiction that complicates the pursuit. Told and thematically present, but not deeply pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Tone of raw solace is coherent: the prose balances grief (daughter's voice lost, family dissolved into radio fuzz) with acceptance (building a beacon for those walking backward). The phrase "raw solace—unpolished, grinding, honest" appears explicitly at the peak, crystallizing the tone. It modulates appropriately (lunar clarity vs. new moon despair) and charges the final image ("understanding that reverse migration meant coming home to the ruin"). However, the explicit naming of the tone in the penultimate beat risks tell-not-show and slightly undercuts organic emergence.</comment>
