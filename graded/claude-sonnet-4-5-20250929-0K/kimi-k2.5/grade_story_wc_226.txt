<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's core motivation—to refract truth into many narratives—drives the opening moves, but the final shift to "surrender" feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The pivot from guarding purity to embracing reinterpretation arrives via meta-commentary ("understood then") instead of a dramatized micro-choice with visible cost. Lira's trait ("innocently mischievous") is label-only; her actions (releasing echoes, adding nonsense rhymes) advance plot but lack embodied contradiction or internal cost that would deepen her role. Interior language occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the willingness to let their truth be changed") without anchoring in concrete perception or gesture under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (poetry refracts, echoes multiply) and holds it through closure. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the second paragraph without debt. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing: the pale spire dims, revealing "not one path forward, but many," and the canyon hums with accumulated poetry—this reweights the premise (singular truth vs. multiplicity) with conceptual cost (Kael's voice fades, "becoming part of the bone itself"). One meaningful deepening occurs when Lira's jars shatter, releasing all echoes and destabilizing the Overseers' ritual. The cost is legible on the page: Kael's dissolution into the structure, the ultimate price for breaking truth into freedom.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon return at multiple beats, constraining action (groaning structures, rib-cage outcroppings, flat vertebrae) and charging the final image (towers "singing with the voices"). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "porous surface," "curved walls," "heavy silence," "pale spire in the western mist." Spatial choreography is clear; Kael's movements (tracing, sitting, standing) track coherently. The pale spire functions as both setting anchor and timeframe device, tightening pressure as it rotates and glows. The micro-setting of bone—handled, climbed, and ultimately absorbing Kael's voice—materially shapes the closure by making the artist's dissolution literal and spatial.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the Overseers from cementing singular history—is signaled early and escalates through accumulative pressure: Kael's seventeen mornings of poetry, Lira's echo-releasing, the approaching ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pale spire glows and Kael shifts tactics, abandoning polished verses for "raw, stumbling lines that admitted doubt." The cost is unmistakable: Kael's voice dissolves into the bone, forecloses the path of preserving a pure original vision, and the Overseers' ritual fails. Agency is protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (Lira's arrival) complicates but does not resolve, as Kael must choose to surrender control of the narrative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The thematic question—what does it cost to refract a single truth into many—emerges from action and image rather than assertion. The core concept (price of forgiveness) integrates through the closing lines: "Forgiveness costs the story. It costs the teller." Kael's arc from clinging to purity to surrendering narrative control embodies the theme without meta-commentary in the final beat. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the pale spire dims, infinite variations emerge, and Kael's voice becomes part of the bone—transformation without a stated moral. The canyon "singing with the voices of everyone who had ever needed to be heard" reweights prior material with conceptual cost, making the thematic charge undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Kael notices "porous surface," "hollow sound," "forged hush"—but some lines drift into elevated register ("the willingness to let their truth be changed") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under peak stress. Dialogue is minimal and goal-driven; Lira's child voice ("But you keep making noise") contrasts with Kael's whisper, creating distinction. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though one line ("They had sought to refract a single truth into many, yet clung desperately...") reads as narrator summary rather than embodied thought. Diction remains consistent with the fantastical setting, and no filter-verb stacks appear in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character, or pressure. However, three paraphrase loops touch key beats: "forged hush" appears three times without reweighting, "pale spire in the mist" recurs without evolving meaning mid-story, and the final paragraph contains near-duplicate phrasing ("became exactly that: infinite variations" echoes the prior image without added pressure). Register occasionally elevates ("the willingness to let their truth be changed") in moments that warrant tighter embodiment. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs appear. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "truth...refracted...into prismatic shards" and "seeds" work without contradiction. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—artist using poetry to fragment authoritarian narrative in a canyon of bone—offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The stakes (truth as multiplicity vs. singular law) avoid template plots, and the setting (calcified monuments, echo-wraiths, pale spire) particularizes the frame. The final turn—surrendering narrative purity to let others reinterpret—feels earned in hindsight from the accumulated poetry beats. The concept of "forged hush" as both silence and speech reshapes familiar resistance narratives. Risk-taking in the lyric, accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring causality, and the closure image (voice becoming bone, towers singing) feels inevitable rather than imposed. One proximity concern: the image of multiplicity defeating tyranny echoes common fables, though the specific mechanism (poetry refracting into echoes) personalizes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael (defiant artist) is present from the opening and drives three key beats: tracing the tower and conducting poetry (setup), shifting to raw, stumbling lines when the spire glows (middle choice under pressure), and calling out "Forgiveness costs the story" as their voice dissolves (closure participation). The final choice—surrendering narrative purity—alters tactics and forecloses the path of guarding a single truth with visible cost: Kael's voice fades, "becoming part of the bone itself." Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.5. No major frictions apply.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in three beats: initial anchor ("once the pale spire in the western mist completed its rotation, the truth would be locked"), glowing signal ("pale spire...began to glow, signaling the approaching ritual"), and closure ("pale spire dimmed, its mist dispersing to reveal not one path forward, but many"). The object tracks time pressure and charges the final image with reweighted meaning—from locking truth to revealing multiplicity. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4. Minor friction: the spire is observed rather than handled or used directly in on-page action −0.3. Swappability concern: a different timer/marker could function similarly with edits −0.5. Total adjustment: +2.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The price of forgiveness is invoked explicitly mid-story ("the price of forgiveness would not be paid in blood or treasure, but in the willingness to let their truth be changed") and echoed at closure ("Forgiveness costs the story. It costs the teller"). The concept shapes Kael's final choice to surrender narrative control and dissolve into the bone, altering tactics with visible cost. Setup in first third +0.5, middle beat (realization) +0.4, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.5. Major friction: the concept is stated rather than dramatized through competing goods or unavoidable harm in a single pivotal beat, reading more as thematic claim than operational stake −0.8. Total adjustment: +0.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lira's "innocently mischievous" trait is signaled ("giggle...high and bright," "particular delight of someone who did not yet understand consequence," "circled them...adding nonsense rhymes") and enables one middle beat: her jars shatter, releasing echoes that destabilize the ritual. The trait constrains her understanding of risk, but no visible tradeoff or cost is shown on her side; the price falls entirely on Kael. Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.7. Frictions: label-only in several mentions without embodied contradiction −0.3; no cost tied to Lira herself −0.4. Total adjustment: +0.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Refract" is the dominant action: Kael refracts forbidden history by speaking verses that split into "countless tonal variations" against the canyon walls, and the climax hinges on refracting "a single truth...through a thousand impromptu interpretations." Two major turns trace to this action: the shift to raw verses that admit doubt, and the final shattering of Lira's jars that releases all echoes at once, making the Overseers' ritual "unable to anchor to any one narrative." Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7. Minor friction: the mechanics of refraction (how poetry physically splits and multiplies) remain abstract rather than tactile −0.3. Total adjustment: +4.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Impromptu poetry sessions" are signaled early ("spent seventeen mornings...conducting impromptu poetry sessions") and shape two beats: the opening verses that "refracted against the curved walls," and the climax shift to "raw, stumbling lines" that multiply through the echo system. The method enables Kael's resistance tactic and is present at closure when "the towers began to hum with the accumulated poetry." Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. Friction: the method is described more than shown; we never see a complete poem or the specific mechanics of how verses split into variations −0.6. Total adjustment: +2.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are present in four beats: opening (Kael tracing the porous surface, climbing calcified monuments), middle (rib-cage outcropping, flat vertebrae as perch), climax (towers catching sounds and multiplying them), and closure (towers humming, standing taller, singing). The setting supplies the acoustic mechanics that enable Kael's tactic (echoes refract) and charges the final image (voice becomes part of the bone). Early signal +0.8, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.8. No major frictions. Total adjustment: +5.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the ritual" is signaled early ("hours remaining until the Overseers would cement their singular history") and tightens at two beats: the pale spire glowing signals "the approaching ritual," and "As the ritual commenced" marks the climax turn. The clock narrows Kael's window and forces the tactical shift from polished to raw verses. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9. Friction: elapsed time within the scene is vague; "seventeen mornings" are backstory, and the on-page urgency could be sharper −0.4. Total adjustment: +2.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's motivation "to refract a single truth into many" is dramatized from the opening ("break the single narrative into prismatic shards") and drives the entire arc. The desire conflicts with Kael's impulse to guard purity ("clung desperately to the purity of their original vision"), creating friction that peaks when Kael surrenders control. The final choice—dissolving into the bone to enable infinite variations—enacts the motivation with visible cost. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection +0.6. Minor friction: one line of meta-commentary ("understood then that the price of forgiveness...") tells the realization rather than showing it through embodied perception −0.3. Total adjustment: +4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Forged hush" is signaled early ("heavy silence," "pre-ritual hour," "sound felt like theft") and modulates with pressure: the ritual "requires silence," Overseers shout for it, and Kael's final understanding is "to forge hush into speech was not to break silence, but to reshape it." The tone charges the closure image when "the forged hush that followed" gives way to towers singing. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.4, tone modulation under pressure +0.8. Frictions: the phrase "forged hush" recurs without evolving meaning mid-story, reading as label rather than lived texture −0.4; some tonal beats (Lira's giggle, "innocently mischievous") tension the hush but feel ornamental rather than purposeful −0.3. Total adjustment: +1.8.</comment>
