<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior feels specific—charcoal-stained hands, accusatory eyes in her portraits—but her decisions unfold too smoothly without genuine contradiction. The emotional progression from crestfallen to cartographer reads as conceptual satisfaction rather than embodied struggle. No visceral mistake compounds the pressure; the untangling succeeds without meaningful friction or blind spots that would ground her agency. The final transformation lacks a visible, felt price that forecloses an earlier path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive within the opening paragraph (Mara, lighthouse library, present-tense crisis). The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: thread-untangling and image-layering build toward a reconfigured reality. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she becomes "cartographer of broken things" and the walls expand—but the cost remains abstract. The final image asserts transformation without pointing to a specific on-page sentence where a tangible or felt price is legible, weakening the closure proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse, library, and descending architecture are vivid and purpose-driven. Spatial choreography holds: shelves to floor to trapdoor to chamber. The threads function as micro-setting, constraining her method and charging the final lamp-ignition. The blue-white flame that "didn't burn" and the expanding walls deliver a clear sensory reconfiguration that supports the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: escape fragmented reality by redesigning perception. Pressure coheres as the walls close and threads accumulate. The tightening reads as deepening rather than a decisive turn that narrows options through protagonist agency. Untangling succeeds without visible loss—no stamina drain, no thread that resists, no alternate path foreclosed. The escalation under the Accumulative lens needs a felt or visible price on the page to enter the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: traps versus illumination, containment versus redesign, surfaces versus depths. The final rhetorical question ("Wasn't every ending simply a tangle waiting to be understood?") verges on thematic echo but remains grounded in Mara's toolkit and the broken box. The ending offers a non-literal answer—she carries luminescent ache as lantern—that reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates through image and gesture more than declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: artist idiom ("palette," "irises," "cartographer"), metaphor density. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from crisis urgency to conceptual poise. The prose sustains texture under pressure without head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("crestfallen," "bioluminescent," "luminescent ache") but remains voice-consistent; no therapy-speak intrusions. Minor register drift in peak beats ("catastrophic knots," "architecture of her perception") nudges below 8-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high but coherent. Two paraphrase loops: "What is a portrait if not…" / "What is a lighthouse if not…" back-to-back reads as template cadence (−0.4). The "walls close in" phrase appears three times without reweighting. Metaphor strings ("finger pointing at the dark," "cartographer of broken things") approach overwriting in the closure paragraph. No clarity breaks, but the artifact cluster in the final third disallows 9+ globally and nudges the score below 7.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library + tarot + thread-untangling synthesis is specific and less common than stock "artist finds self" templates. The transformation from portrait artist to "cartographer of broken things" offers a fresh angle, and the blue-white flame that doesn't burn is a vivid, non-obvious image. However, the emotional arc—crestfallen artist descends, untangles metaphor, emerges reborn—follows a familiar redemptive structure without sufficient lived friction or moral calculus to feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her artist identity motivates the tarot interpretation and thread-sorting precision. "Crestfallen" is named once in the opening and reprised obliquely at the end ("no longer crestfallen"). She makes two key choices: to descend and to untangle threads. The choices shape middle and closure beats, meeting two gates (setup, payoff). Development gate is weaker—her crestfallen state is more backdrop than constraint that forces a visible tradeoff. Causal pressure is present but moderate; no distinct cost tied to her artist identity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The broken box appears in paragraph two (setup), is handled again when Mara uses it to gather sorted threads (development), and is named in the penultimate paragraph as a kept reminder (payoff). Three touches across distinct beats. It enables her redesign method and charges the final stance. Swappability is moderate—a pouch or jar could serve a similar gathering function. The "broken" quality resonates with her splintered resolve but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Strong involvement but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fragmented reality" is named early, drives the inciting pressure (overlapping storm-pages, multiple self-portraits), and is the problem Mara's untangling solves. The concept shapes tactics throughout: she must separate timelines, sort strands, stabilize the reality. The closure moment explicitly states "The fragmented reality stabilized around her." Payoff is strong; the concept is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the story's logic and closure. Three gates met with high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear explicitly three times: "Wasn't this why…," two consecutive "What is a portrait / lighthouse if not…," and the final "Wasn't every ending…" They reflect Mara's introspective habit and lend texture, but they do not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. They function as stylistic accent rather than trait that alters tactics. Present and voice-consistent, but swappable with declarative introspection. Two gates (setup, payoff as stylistic reprise) but no middle development choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Redesign" is named in paragraph three as the method, appears again when she "redesigned their pattern into something new" (tarot reordering), and frames the trapdoor descent ("This was the redesign"). It is the conceptual spine of her agency and closure: she transforms from capturing surfaces to redesigning boundaries. Three beats, high causal pressure, and closure linkage. The verb is somewhat abstract—another synthesis term (rebuild, reweave) could serve similar duty—but the story's architecture depends on this exact framing. Nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Threads are introduced in paragraph four, their mechanics explained (silver filaments from book bindings, bioluminescent, holding half-memories). Mara spends paragraph five untangling them with artist precision, experiencing released memories. She gathers them in the box, uses them to fill the lamp, and they ignite to stabilize reality. Three gates met; the method drives the middle action and closure image. Specificity is high (silver, bioluminescent, knotted) and the untangling is irreplaceable to her success. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is named in the opening line, its circular cage and cracked windows establish the physical trap. It provides the books that spawn threads, the trapdoor she discovers, and the deep chamber holding the lamp. The descending architecture structures her path and the "walls close in" phrase recurs to tighten pressure. The setting is not mere backdrop—it supplies resources (threads, lamp) and constrains movement (downward only). Three gates, multiple beats, high causal integration, and closure payoff (lighthouse transformed, library settles). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is named in paragraph three and repeated in paragraph six ("As the walls close in further, crushing the shelves into splinters"). It signals urgency and forces Mara to work faster. The timeframe provides pressure but remains somewhat abstract—no live clock or countdown with legible increments. Two touches (setup, mid-action acceleration) with moderate causal effect. The phrase recurs at closure in past tense, confirming resolution. Functional and integral to pacing, but the mechanics are not specific enough to be irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To descend into necessary darkness" is articulated explicitly in paragraph three and enacted when she opens the trapdoor and descends twice. The motivation drives her key choice and reappears in the final line ("descended further, carrying the luminescent ache"). Three gates met. The desire is dramatized through action but not deeply conflicted—no on-page moment where she hesitates or pays a visible cost to go down. The phrasing is somewhat swappable with "confront the source" or similar. Strong presence but the friction between wants and costs is told more than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is named in paragraph four (threads "thrummed with the ache of things half-remembered, glowing softly"), recurs when rhetorical questions "became part of the luminescence, part of the ache," reappears as the blue-white flame spreads "the luminescent ache," and closes the story ("carrying the luminescent ache like a lantern"). Four distinct touches across setup, middle, climax, and final image. The tone is coherent, modulates with pressure (from passive thrumming to active spreading to carried agency), and charges the closure. High specificity and irreplaceability; the exact phrase is the story's emotional and imagistic spine.</comment>
