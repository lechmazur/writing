<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to trust Thomas's ghost messages is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her final action (ringing the bell, beginning rounds) feels enacted rather than earned by visible internal cost. The interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("kinship," "permanent yet strange," "brambled hope") that substitutes labels for embodied contradiction. Thomas exists only as benevolent function; no friction emerges between his altruism and the survivors' needs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The closure image—Mara understanding "some hauntings were simply love"—offers thematic repricing but the conceptual cost remains diffuse; the nebula's creation succeeds without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The causal chain (chalk messages → star charts → collective effort → nebula) reads as accumulative instruction rather than pressure-driven escalation. No meaningful tightening occurs; the problem is solved cooperatively without a trade-off that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and orchard provide a distinctive visual frame and anchor the nebula's formation mechanism. The watering bell's ceramic fragility and the butterfly garden's pollination role offer purposeful micro-setting. However, spatial choreography during the midnight assembly remains vague—seventy-three survivors position reflectors and collectors without legible movement or constraint. The nebula itself, though visually rendered, does not materially limit Mara's final choice; it appears as reward rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (long-term atmospheric survival) is declared but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed option. The midnight assembly proceeds without friction, obstacle, or dissent. Thomas's instructions guide rather than pressure; Mara's leadership faces no resistance. The nebula blooms as described, validating effort without visible trade-off. No reversal or tightening moment forecloses a live alternative or dramatizes a price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The final message ("Family takes care of family, even across the veil") states the theme rather than allowing it to emerge from image and cost. "Brambled hope" recurs as a descriptive phrase without being enacted through contradiction or ambiguity. The nebula functions as a symbolic reward that illustrates collective resilience but does not interrogate its cost or complicate the premise. The insight that "some hauntings were simply love" offers warmth but no friction, arriving as assertion rather than earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent register—lyric, SF-pastoral—and Mara's perceptual signature (notice of frost, chalk shimmer, lantern light) remains stable. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("brambled hope of survival," "nebula of respite") that feels imposed rather than character-native. The council dialogue is summarized rather than rendered, missing an opportunity for voice distinction. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Several paraphrase loops blur momentum: "The timeframe of after strangers become family had settled into her bones like the chill of the alien soil, permanent yet strange" restates the prior sentence's "kinship" transformation. "The ghost wasn't haunting them out of loneliness; he was trying to orchestrate collective effort" tells what the prior paragraph showed. Template cadence appears in the opening: "What began... had slowly transformed... though Mara still struggled..." Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "iridescent chalk that shimmered like dying stars," "brambled hope," "nebula of respite." The phrase "messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn" is repeated verbatim, creating a loop. Aggregated artifact presence in non-closure beats totals roughly −1.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The altruistic-ghost-as-guide and collective-survival-through-cooperation premise follows a familiar template without transformation. The nebula creation relies on SF ornamentation (ionized gas pockets, magnetic anomalies) rather than lived detail or moral calculus that would particularize the stake. Mara's arc—from distrust to acceptance—proceeds without surprise or counter-pressure. The watering bell and butterfly garden offer specificity, but the overall emotional trajectory and thematic resolution read as median choices that avoid risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Thomas appears in chalk messages and a translucent final image but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics. His altruism is described retrospectively (saving hydroponics, establishing the butterfly garden) and continues post-mortem as benevolent instruction. Setup is present (paragraph two), middle development occurs via messages, and he appears at closure pointing and nodding. However, his role is expository guide rather than agent; he does not face a dilemma or pay a cost on the page. Swappable with any benevolent mentor figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bell is introduced with backstory (Thomas's possession, used to mist the monarch habitat), handled at the council meeting (sits at center of table), and used twice in the climax (Mara carries it, rings it to resonate the atmosphere, rings it again in the final beat). Its fragility and musical quality tie to the pollination function and the nebula's crystalline sound. Setup, development (as memory object), and payoff (active use) all present. However, its specific properties (ceramic, delicate) do not constrain a choice or create a cost; it succeeds as intended without friction. Strong presence across beats but lacks irreplaceability—a similar resonant object could serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The nebula is named and explained (protective barrier of breathable vapor and soft radiance) and becomes the story's physical goal. Mara reexamines star charts to understand it, and the midnight assembly creates it. It appears in the title surrogate ("nebula of respite") and the final image ("pulsed overhead"). Setup via Thomas's messages, development via Mara's research, and closure payoff all present. However, it does not alter Mara's options or present a trade-off; it blooms as hoped, validating effort rather than pressuring choice. The concept shapes the plot's direction but not its stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is attributed to the ghost's messages in paragraph two ("she could never explain why the words felt strangely trustworthy"). Mara's trust enables her to follow instructions, but no on-page moment dramatizes the strangeness or forces a cost tied to that trust. The attribute is asserted once and assumed thereafter; no friction emerges between the strangeness and the trustworthiness. Present in setup, absent in middle development (trust is not tested), and not reweighted at closure. Label-only use without visible constraint or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reexamine" drives the major turn: Mara reviews star charts "during lunch," notices the arch-magnetic-anomaly alignment, and deduces the atmospheric-moisture cultivation method. This insight shifts the settlement's goal from "growing food" to cultivating ionized gas pockets, altering tactics for the climax. Setup (Thomas's messages prompt the need), development (the lunch reexamination), and payoff (the assembly executes the insight) all present. The action is specific and causal. However, the examination itself is summarized rather than dramatized, and the discovery arrives without visible cost or obstacle; she simply "noticed." Strong causal role with moderate irreplaceability—another research action could serve, though this one fits the SF frame.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Chalked messages on deserted sidewalks appear throughout: first message at dawn (paragraph two), referenced again ("Thomas's dawn messages that had appeared through messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn," paragraph five), final message in dust near the butterfly garden (paragraph eight). Setup, development (instructions guide middle actions), and closure (final message) all present. The method is specific (iridescent chalk, dawn timing, deserted sidewalks) and consistent. However, the mechanics do not constrain Thomas's communication or create friction; the messages simply appear when needed. The method could be replaced with another asynchronous medium (notes, frost patterns already mentioned) without altering story logic. Purposeful reprise with moderate specificity but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The orchard and floating rock arches frame every scene: frost in the orchards (opening line), arches casting shadows (paragraph one), eastern arch (first message), arches' alignment with magnetic anomalies (reexamination), highest point beneath largest arch (midnight assembly). Setup, development (arches supply the magnetic scaffolding for the nebula), and payoff (nebula blooms between arches) all present. The setting provides the physical mechanism for the climax and the final image's visual charge. However, the orchard itself does not pressure Mara's choices; the arches function as enabling infrastructure rather than obstacle. Strong visual presence and causal contribution to the nebula's formation, with moderate irreplaceability—another magnetic-anomaly landscape could serve, though the orchard-pollination-butterfly motif adds thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after strangers become family" is announced in paragraph one ("What began as a lifeboat of terrified survivors had slowly transformed into something resembling kinship") and echoed in the final message ("Family takes care of family"). The three-year post-crash duration is mentioned. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics; no deadline presses Mara, and the passage from strangers to family occurs off-page before the story opens. The assembly's timing (midnight, dawn) operates on a daily clock but does not create urgency. Setup present, no middle development, closure echo via theme statement. The timeframe provides context but does not constrain or escalate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Thomas's motivation to orchestrate collective effort is told in paragraph five ("The ghost wasn't haunting them out of loneliness; he was trying to orchestrate collective effort") and demonstrated via the instructional messages and the midnight assembly. His altruism drives the plot's direction. However, no friction complicates this desire; Thomas's motivation is pure and uncontested. Mara enacts the collective effort without dramatized resistance or internal conflict about leading it. Setup (Thomas's messages), development (Mara's council presentation and leadership), and payoff (the assembly succeeds) all present. The motivation is functional and clear but lacks on-page cost or competing want. Mid-range causal role with limited irreplaceability—another cooperative goal could serve.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" appears explicitly twice: "brambled hope of survival" (paragraph six) and "brambled, beautiful hope of continuing" (final sentence). The phrase is also implied in "tangled as it was with the risk of collapse and the thorns of their recent losses" (paragraph seven). The tone modulates between melancholy (frost, ghost, Thomas's death) and warmth (kinship, children pointing, satisfaction). However, the brambled quality—complexity, risk, thorns—is asserted more than enacted; the assembly proceeds without setback, and the nebula blooms as hoped. Setup (tone established in paragraph one's "permanent yet strange"), development (partial: melancholy and warmth coexist), and payoff (brambled hope named at closure) all present. The tone charges the final image but does not modulate under pressure or reflect a trade-off. Purposeful lyric reprise with moderate coherence but limited causal pressure.</comment>
