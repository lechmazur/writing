<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks understanding of the trees' memories—but her decisive agency arrives late. The climactic actions (deconstructing vials, pouring sorrow onto roots) feel enacted rather than chosen under dueling impulses. Interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("maintenance work was worship") rather than embodied contradiction, though the healing-hands detail grounds some physical experience. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending grants resolution without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (labyrinth, night shift, grief vials). The accumulative lens holds through dream-mapping beats, but closure lacks visible cost: Elara completes her task and achieves epiphany without forfeiting options or enduring friction. The pin-drop moment ("at the moment a pin was heard") promises a pivot but delivers only cognitive realization, not a choice that narrows tactics. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration via conceptual repricing of maintenance-as-worship, but the felt price remains off-page or implied rather than dramatized in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The labyrinth's petrified heartwood, amber vials, and moon-soaked tower create vivid, purposeful setting. The sextant catches dreams (micro-setting as tool), and moonlight enables Elara's healing, both constraining her nocturnal work pattern. The stormlit tower scene uses environment actively: lightning mixes with lunar light to charge the tree's response. Spatial choreography remains clear across corridors and tower climb, and sensory detail (bioluminescent bark hum "felt in her teeth") sharpens the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the trees' witness—signals early and persists. Pressure accumulates through dream-mapping, but escalation is cognitive rather than choice-driven: Elara realizes sorrow is fertilizer, then enacts the insight without on-page resistance or trade-off. The pin-drop beat promises a reversal but delivers exposition. No live option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts under friction. The ending reconfigures meaning (maintenance as gardening) but lacks a dramatized cost that alters later possibilities.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—grief as living testimony, maintenance as care—emerges organically from image and action rather than assertion. The sextant's shift from star-navigation to dream-catching, vials as fertilizer, and moonlight-as-healing layer without shouting. The final line ("allowing moonlight to illuminate the cracks without pretending they weren't there") risks overt moralizing but stays grounded in the story's tactile particulars (healing hands, broken instrument). The piece resists tidy binaries; sorrow fuels continuity rather than resolution, a quiet complexity that lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, perceptual signature consistent (Elara notices grain, vapor-trails, bioluminescence). Diction carries a purposeful elevated register ("testimony rather than judgment," "cartography of the soul") that risks slipping above the maintenance-worker frame but reads as voice-committed lyricism rather than drift. Rhythm modulates across beats: short syntax during the pin-drop realization, longer cadence in the tower scene. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak moments. The final paragraph edges toward thematic summary but anchors in concrete image (ear to trunk, instrument warming in hand).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates most lines ("honeycomb of corridors," "vapor-trails of sleeping minds," "condensation," "fireflies against ancient wood"), creating lush texture but occasional density overload without pattern-teaching payoff. Minor paraphrase loop: "distilled into measurable units" / "quantified sorrow—milliliters of mourning, grams of regret" restates the same content adjacently. Template cadence in early beats: multiple "she [verb]" stems without rhythmic variation. Propulsion slows mid-piece during dream-mapping exposition. Clarity remains high; no muddled metaphors, no orientation debt. Information density is solid but uneven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief archive, petrified-wood witness, and lunar-healing hands offers a non-obvious premise executed with specific world logic (sextant repurposed for dreams, sorrow as fertilizer). The maintenance-as-worship angle and trees-as-empathic-archivists avoid stock fantasy tropes. However, the emotional arc (curiosity → realization → acceptance) follows a predictable template, and the pin-drop pivot feels more like a reveal than an earned turn. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative pressure, lyric density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning modest positive adjustment within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara maps dreams, climbs the tower, deconstructs vials, and pours sorrow onto roots—four distinct beats across setup, middle, and closure. Her choices drive the ending action, though the final beats feel more enacted than contested. Swappability is low; her maintenance role and lunar constraint anchor the world. Cost linkage is weak: no visible trade-off pressures her decision. Early signal and closure participation are strong, but causal pressure (narrowing options under friction) is absent. Mid-band: functional across beats, but agency at closure lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sextant appears in paragraph three (early signal), reappears when Elara maps dreams (middle beat), and becomes the focusing tool in the tower climax (closure participation). It shifts function from broken star-measure to dream-catcher to light-refractor, accruing layered purpose. However, it enables rather than constrains: no cost or trade-off tied to its use. Irreplaceability is moderate; another optical tool could serve with edits. Three-gate presence and evolving use support solid mid-band score, but lack of felt cost caps upward movement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow frames the premise in paragraph two, shapes Elara's task (cataloguing vials), and is physically handled at closure (poured onto roots as fertilizer). The concept constrains her nocturnal work rhythm and reweights at the ending when sorrow becomes translation rather than storage. The pin-drop realization hinges on it. Early signal, middle beat involvement (vials on cart), and closure transformation with conceptual cost (shift from preservation to growth) meet all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate but present; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Moonlight healing is mentioned in paragraph eight and returns in the tower scene where Elara's hands "ceased their aching" and skin knits "without scar." It constrains her work schedule (nocturnal preference) and charges the final beat's sensory mix (lunar + lightning light). However, no on-page trade-off or cost is tied to the trait; it enables without friction. Setup gate met, closure participation present, middle development weak (no mid-story choice hinges on it). Moderate irreplaceability; another night-work constraint could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" signals in paragraph sixteen as Elara's need, enacted in paragraph twenty-four when she pours vials onto roots. The action drives the ending and cannot be swapped without breaking the sorrow-as-fertilizer logic. However, it appears late (final third) and resolves a question (how to free the sorrow) without prior on-page obstacle that built resistance. Setup weak, closure participation strong, middle development absent. Irreplaceability high, but late arrival and lack of prior friction cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Dream-mapping is introduced in paragraph nine, enacted in paragraph ten ("mapping scattered dreams with the broken instrument"), and the collected dreams illuminate the tree's bark at closure. The method shapes Elara's middle-beat tactics and primes the ending's bioluminescent response. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. However, the mechanics remain abstract (how dreams pool, how the sextant catches them) and swappability is moderate—another observational method could serve. Causal pressure present but not strong; cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stormlit tower appears in paragraph seven (early signal), becomes the climax location in paragraph eighteen, and the mixed lightning/lunar light creates the luminescence that enables the tree's response at closure. The setting constrains access (Elara must climb), supplies necessary resources (moon + storm light), and charges the final image. Setup, development (climb), and payoff gates met. Irreplaceability high: the exact световой mix matters. Causal pressure solid; the environment alters what's possible in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The pin-drop moment is named in paragraph twelve and triggers Elara's realization ("Elara understood"). It marks the cognitive pivot but does not constrain subsequent action timing or create urgency. The phrase "at the moment" reads more as narrative marker than live clock. Setup gate met (signaled at realization), but middle development and closure participation are absent—no later beat references the sound or its timing. Swappability high; any small sensory cue could replace it. Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire to know what the trees witnessed is stated in paragraph five, drives her nocturnal dream-mapping (middle beats), and finds answer at closure when she hears "the creak of branches remembering." Setup, development, payoff gates met. The motivation is told clearly but dramatized weakly—no on-page moment shows her choosing this quest over competing needs. Friction between want and cost is minimal; she achieves understanding without sacrifice. Irreplaceability moderate; curiosity could be reframed with minor edits. Solid presence, limited pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mundane-miracles tone is signaled early ("grief distilled into measurable units," maintenance cart) and sustains through the piece: ordinary labor (pouring vials, climbing) charged with transformation (sorrow-to-oxygen, broken tool made useful). The tone modulates across beats—workday rhythm in corridors, elevated lyricism in the tower—and the final line ("allowing moonlight to illuminate the cracks") anchors the ordinary/transcendent synthesis. However, the tone remains static rather than escalating; the miracle feels asserted more than earned through accumulating pressure. Coherent and purposeful but lacks the crescendo that would charge the ending image more decisively.</comment>
