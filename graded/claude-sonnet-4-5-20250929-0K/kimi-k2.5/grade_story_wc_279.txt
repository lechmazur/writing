<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her craft shapes the resolution, but her interior texture relies on stock poetic descriptions rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The shift from whimsy to serious purpose is told, not dramatized through micro-choices. "Socially perceptive enough to recognize that the grotto itself had been lonely" performs self-aware diagnostic label-speak at the climax, flattening what should be an embodied discovery. The mandala work is goal-driven, but the final realization arrives as summary rather than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story anchors who/where/when early and builds through a pattern of sensing disorder, mapping through sand, and disrupting to restore harmony. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the grotto's acoustic shift from cacophony to harmony), but cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path on the page. The pattern is taught and held, yet the final image of "twilight peace" softens rather than charges the stakes. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost test is barely met.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The grotto's parabolic symmetry and acoustic properties constrain Mara's approach; the mist, limestone texture, and calcite seam are purposefully filtered through her craft. The tile shard's vibration and the sand mandala function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The environment drives the diagnosis-and-cure structure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting must constrain choice or charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the grotto's coherence before the unlearning completes—is signaled early and one meaningful tightening occurs when Mara disrupts the mandala's eastern quadrant. However, the turn feels convenient rather than earned by prior tactical failure. No visible cost accompanies the choice; the tile crumbles and harmony follows without sacrifice or trade-off. Agency is present but lacks friction or price, limiting escalation impact under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the structure of disorder/order and communication as bidirectional, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "communication required both transmission and reception, order and entropy, listening as much as speaking." This thematic summary replaces earned resonance. The lilac imagery recurs but functions as decorative motif rather than constraint. The unlearning concept remains abstract and underused thematically, never pressing Mara's identity as artist in a way that would deepen the question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature tied to Mara's craft. Diction is purposeful and lyric but slips into elevated register during peak beats: "spontaneous organization," "reverent awe," "dialect of echoes" elevate beyond the POV's working texture. "Socially perceptive enough to recognize" is narratorial labeling rather than dramatized perception. Sentence rhythm varies and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice lacks the textural grit needed for 9+ consideration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Information density is high and most sentences advance action or atmosphere. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The unease deepened as the color spread" directly restates the prior sentence's mood. Figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff—"mist coiled," "architecture of doubt," "geometry of forgotten names," "bruised, feverish lilac"—creating decorative density that slows rather than propels. Template cadence in the opening beats ("Mara stepped," "She was," "She knelt") and filter-verb stacks ("realized," "understood," "watched") dull immediacy. Metaphor coherence is strained: "whispering gallery tile flake" is geologically implausible and "an ear cupped to receive sound" rendered in sand contradicts prior parabolic geometry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The combination of chalk artist, acoustic grotto, and sand mandala as diagnostic tool offers specificity, but the emotional arc is template: lone specialist arrives, senses disorder, applies craft, restores harmony without cost. The unlearning frame promises transformation yet never alters Mara's capabilities or choices. The premise reads as prompt-assembly rather than inevitable synthesis. No bold risk heightens stakes; the middle path avoids complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara appears early, drives all beats, and her craft enables the closure. However, her whimsicality is told in setup and never shapes a choice under pressure; the trait is swappable with "meticulous" or "intuitive" without affecting tactics. Two beats (sensing disorder, disrupting mandala) involve decisions, meeting mid-band threshold, but the closure choice lacks visible cost tied to her specific character traits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tile flake appears early (beat 8), vibrates against her palm to diagnose disorder (beat 19), and crumbles at closure (beat 24), participating in three beats. It enables the diagnosis and charges the final release, but its mechanics are vague—"ceramic atoms aligning to her new frequency" is metaphorical hand-waving. Irreplaceability is moderate; any resonant artifact could substitute with minor edits. Strong closure linkage lifts it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Emergent hush is the story's turning point and closure image: the grotto shifts from cacophony to "spontaneous organization" (beat 20) and the ending anchors on released voices resting "in patterned silence." The concept shapes Mara's tactic (disrupting the mandala to offer new grammar) and the final line reweights prior chaos as intelligible. It appears across setup, climax, and closure with causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Socially perceptive is invoked twice: once to "feel the stone's anxiety" (beat 6) and again to "recognize that the grotto itself had been lonely" (beat 25). Both are label-only assertions without on-page cost or enabling action. The trait could be removed and replaced with "attuned" or "empathic" without altering any choice. No beat involvement beyond decorative claim.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interject drives beat 17 ("offer the grotto a grammar it could understand") and the mandala disruption in beat 18, creating the story's sole reversal. The action is present in middle and shapes closure, but "interject" itself is abstract; the specific move—scattering sand into an ear shape—does the causal work. Swapping "interject" for "introduce" or "insert" would not alter structure. Solid beat involvement but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sand mandala is signaled early (beat 11), used across four beats (pouring, spiraling, disrupting quadrant, final alignment), and its pattern-diagnosis method is integral to plot and closure. Mechanics matter: the geometry maps disorder and the disruption offers new acoustic grammar. Removing it breaks the story's logic. Strong causal pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceability push it into the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whispering grotto frames all action, its parabolic acoustics create the problem, and the mist's behavior tracks Mara's progress (coiling, thickening, spiraling in time with breathing). The setting constrains her method (she must work within the gallery's resonance) and the final image depends on the grotto's restored acoustics. Environment is indispensable to both conflict and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The unlearning is invoked in beats 1, 4, 10, and 22 as ambient pressure ("before the unlearning completed its erasure"), but it never tightens tactics or creates a live clock. Mara works at her own pace; no beat shows urgency driven by temporal constraint. The timeframe is present and thematically consistent but functionally replaceable—removing it would not alter the plot. Mid-band functional presence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire to discover meaning is stated in beat 10 and drives her mandala work across middle beats. The motivation shapes two key choices (mapping disorder, disrupting the pattern) and the closure delivers on the promise. However, the motivation is not dramatized as conflicted; no cost or trade-off tests her commitment. Solid causal role across setup, middle, and closure, but lacks the friction needed for high-band scores.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lilac unease appears in six beats, coloring mist, chalk dust, sand, and vapor. Tone modulates from "lilac unease" (beat 2) to "bruised, feverish lilac" (beat 13) to "lilac unease lifted" and "twilight peace that tasted of amethyst" (beat 27), tracking the emotional arc. The hue charges the final image and remains coherent through turns. Integration is strong but the effect is more atmospheric than pressure-driven; removing "lilac" would not break causality, only reduce texture.</comment>
