<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The fox-headed librarian is particularized through hybrid physicality ("paws, more human than beast") and the interiorizing technique, but her journey from refugee to native-of-in-between unfolds mostly through summary reflection rather than on-page micro-choices under pressure. The "dimensionally homesick" attribute remains largely a label; we're told she fled seeking something and now accepts ambiguity, but no beat dramatizes a trade-off between the pendant's pull and her present attachment. The final curl around the oak root reads as achieved stasis without visible cost—she has "made friends with uncertainty" by declaration rather than through a sequence of difficult renunciations that foreclose options on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who (fox-headed librarian), where (frozen garden), and basic situation early, satisfying the Orientation Test. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the guardian refuses the pendant's call and commits to the liminal space, interiorizing the call itself. However, the cost is asserted rather than dramatically visible—no on-page action or forfeiture shows what she gives up by not answering her birth-dimension, and the final image ("slept…as a native of the in-between") declares arrival without felt sacrifice. Under the accumulative lens, the pattern of interiorization and boundary language does cohere, but the closure lacks the sharp cadence shift or reweighting that would make the before/after undeniable with pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen garden is richly rendered with selective, mood-congruent detail (crystallized roses, frost-covered branches, ice-locked peonies) and the mist functions as both atmosphere and metaphor. The interiorizing technique directly engages the setting—"the mist flowed into her lungs, the crystallized stems threaded through her ribs"—creating a micro-setting constraint that charges the protagonist's transformation. Spatial choreography is clean (thorny archway, frozen paths, sleeping oak root) and the cold, suspended environment mirrors the protagonist's liminal state, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to return home or remain in the liminal garden—is signaled early via the pendant and "dimensionally homesick." The piece offers one meaningful tightening when the pendant appears and "showed her the doorway home," but the protagonist's refusal is presented as already-achieved insight ("she understood that she had been waiting not for rescue but for permission to remain undefined") rather than a live, pressured choice with visible cost. No on-page reversal tests her commitment; she sits, practices interiorizing, and decides without friction. The resolution is her own stance crystallization, but luck (the pendant's convenient appearance) frames the problem rather than her decisions driving escalation, and the "ache had become a form of hospitality" reads as retrospective summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—home as question rather than answer, acceptance of liminality—emerges organically from the garden, pendant, and interiorizing action without overt moralizing. The final image ("native of the in-between…keys to doors that opened inward") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, several lines veer into abstraction ("building a new architecture from the interiorized landscape," "the ache had become a form of hospitality") that tell theme rather than enacting it through scene particulars. The piece resists tidy closure and invites reflection, but the thematic recurrence of boundaries and uncertainty occasionally reads as prompt-echo rather than lived specificity, and the protagonist's epiphany is asserted more than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and the perceptual signature is distinctive (hybrid beast/human, dimensionally inflected diction). The prose carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("foggy lucidity," "psychic architecture," "breathing membranes rather than walls") that suits the narrator's otherworldly stance. However, under peak moments—the pendant's appearance, the decision to stay—diction remains uniformly elevated without the compression or rhythm shift that would mark emotional pressure. No dialogue is present. The voice is coherent and purposeful, but does not modulate with stakes, reading more like constant meditation than lived experience under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense ("boundaries of light—where illumination ended and shadow began its true reign," "foggy lucidity—every droplet a clear thought suspended in ambiguous air"). Clarity is mostly maintained, but several lines loop conceptually: "interiorizing exteriors" is described twice in adjacent paragraphs, and "the boundaries of light" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She was learning to make friends with uncertainty…She had made friends with uncertainty at last") that restate arrival rather than advancing it. The final third sustains the ornate register without propulsive sentence work, and some metaphors ("the mist thickened into foggy lucidity") blur rather than sharpen the image. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty (atmosphere + interiority), but scaffold phrasing ("Through the veil of sleep, she understood…") dulls immediacy at a key beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The fox-headed librarian guarding a library of frost-grown books offers a vivid, specific synthesis, and "interiorizing exteriors" as a technique is non-obvious. The premise—refugee from rigid dimension learns to inhabit ambiguity—transforms familiar "homesick exile" material through the hybrid body and frozen-garden setting. However, the emotional arc (fleeing certainty, accepting uncertainty) follows a recognizable template of self-acceptance, and the pendant's arrival and refusal sequence does not surprise in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its lyric, liminal mode and avoids genre cliché, but the central turn (choosing to stay) is presented as foregone insight rather than a risky, on-page discovery with unforeseen cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The feral library guardian is introduced early and anchors the POV throughout. She handles the pendant (one beat), practices interiorizing (one beat), and makes the final choice to remain (closure beat), satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, her decisions are presented as already-resolved insights rather than live choices that alter tactics under pressure—she "understood" and "remembered" rather than acting against resistance. The final curl around the oak is passive arrival, not a choice that narrows options. Swappable with "exile" or "refugee" in most beats; the "feral" and "maternal ferocity" traits color description but do not drive causal turns. Mid-band: present across beats, but observation-dominant with limited decision pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pendant appears at the structural midpoint ("dangling from a thorny archway"), is handled and recognized ("closed around the warm metal"), and remains at her throat in the closure beat ("glowed at her throat…illuminating the liminal space"). It participates in three distinct beats: appearance, handling/recognition, and final presence. The pendant's specific function—showing the doorway home and marking boundaries—shapes the protagonist's central choice to refuse return. However, that choice is not dramatized as a struggle with visible cost; she simply internalizes the call rather than acting against the pendant's pull. The pendant is necessary to frame the problem but does not constrain tactics or evolve in meaning across beats. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal pressure moderate; specificity high (brass and obsidian, humming with boundaries). Mid-band: essential framing device with closure presence, but the pivot it enables is told rather than shown with friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"The boundaries of light" is introduced early via the pendant ("humming with the boundaries of light—where illumination ended and shadow began its true reign") and recurs in the final third ("boundaries of light shifted with her mood, casting shadows that spelled words"). It shapes the piece's thematic vocabulary and the protagonist's way of seeing her liminality. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics; the concept remains metaphorical framing rather than a mechanical force. The shadows she collects are described but not used to solve a problem or test a limit. Setup and closure-adjacent payoff present; development beat (middle choice constrained by the concept) is absent. Lyric reprise reweights the stake conceptually but does not change on-page options. Mid-band: thematic through-line with early signal and final charge, but no middle causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Dimensionally homesick" is introduced in the opening paragraph ("dimensionally homesick") and recurs in the closure section ("Her dimensionally homesick heart still ached, but the ache had become a form of hospitality"). It motivates the protagonist's three-hundred-winter wait and explains her recognition of the pendant. However, the attribute is primarily a label; no on-page beat shows her acting on homesickness with visible cost—she does not struggle between returning and staying in a dramatized way. The final reframing ("the ache had become a form of hospitality") is asserted insight rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Setup, thematic development, and closure presence met; causal constraint (a trade-off or visible price tied to homesickness) is absent. Mid-band: present across the arc and motivating backstory, but label-only in execution without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Wait" is the protagonist's central action, signaled early ("She had been waiting…for three hundred winters") and redefined in the middle ("the waiting was active now, a hunting of possibilities") and closure ("To wait in this state was to participate in the garden's metabolism"). The action is irreplaceable—removing "wait" would collapse the piece's structure, as the protagonist's transformation from passive endurance to active inhabiting is the narrative arc. However, the turns tied to waiting are conceptual rather than dramatized: she "understood" and "learned" rather than making a sequence of on-page choices with visible cost. Setup, development (reframed waiting), and closure (embodied waiting as native stance) all present; causal pressure is thematic and closure-shaping. High mid-band: the action is indispensable to the arc and participates in closure, but the escalation it drives is reflective rather than pressured decision-making.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Interiorizing exteriors" is introduced as "the ancient technique of swallowing the landscape into one's own psychic architecture" in the middle section and executed in one sustained beat ("the mist flowed into her lungs, the crystallized stems threaded through her ribs, the grey light pooled behind her eyes"). The method is specific, non-obvious, and directly enables the protagonist's transformation into "the library…her dreaming mind," which charges the closure stance as "native of the in-between." However, it appears only once as an on-page action; the technique is not signaled early (no setup gate) and does not shape a second distinct beat. Late first appearance (~40% mark) and single-beat development cap the score. Payoff and specificity are strong; the technique is irreplaceable and its execution is vivid. Mid-band: essential to closure transformation but lacks early signal and multiple-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen garden in mist is introduced in the opening paragraph and anchors every beat: the crystallized roses frame the opening, the thorny archway supplies the pendant, the ice-locked peonies are the site of interiorizing, the frozen paths are walked in the penultimate paragraph, and the sleeping oak root cradles the protagonist at closure. The setting's specific properties—frost, mist, suspended time—directly enable the interiorizing technique and metaphorically charge the liminal transformation. The garden constrains the protagonist's physicality (she crouches, sits, curls) and its atmosphere (grey air, perpetual mist) mirrors and intensifies her dimensionally homesick state. Setup, development (interiorizing beat), and closure all present; causal pressure moderate to high; irreplaceability high (the frozen, liminal garden is inseparable from the arc). Upper mid-band: setting is indispensable, participates across all major beats, and charges the final image, though it does not force a tactical choice with visible cost in a conflict-driven sense.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears in the opening ("through the veil of sleep for three hundred winters") and twice in the middle ("Through the veil of sleep, she understood…" and "Through the veil, she heard her birth-dimension calling"). It names the protagonist's liminal state and the story's temporal mode but does not function as a ticking clock or constrain on-page decisions. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical; no deadline or time pressure narrows options. The protagonist "slept" at closure, completing the frame, but the veil is more a metaphor for liminality than a time constraint. Setup and closure presence met; middle development (time shaping a choice) is absent. The element is swappable with "in dream" or "in suspension" without structural change. Low mid-band: present early and at closure as thematic frame, but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To make friends with uncertainty" is introduced in the middle section ("She was learning to make friends with uncertainty, to stroke its fur and find comfort in its unpredictable weight") and restated at closure ("She had made friends with uncertainty at last"). It names the protagonist's goal and the arc's emotional destination. However, the motivation is presented as achieved insight rather than conflicted desire tested under pressure—no beat dramatizes a moment where she must choose uncertainty over a competing want (e.g., the pull of home) with visible cost. The pendant offers a doorway, but her refusal is summary ("she did not rise to answer") without on-page friction between wants. Setup (implicit in "dimensionally homesick"), development (learning to make friends), and payoff (friends at last) all present; causal constraint (a choice that costs her something she wants) is absent. Mid-band: central to the arc and present at closure, but told rather than dramatized with trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is introduced explicitly in the middle ("The mist thickened into foggy lucidity—every droplet a clear thought suspended in ambiguous air") and the tone is sustained throughout: dream-logic causality, elevated lyric diction, suspended present tense that blurs past and now. The tone is coherent across beats and does not break during the pendant's appearance or the interiorizing sequence. It charges the final image ("slept…as a native of the in-between") by maintaining the misty, liminal register without collapse into plain exposition. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—high-stakes moments (pendant recognition, refusal of home) carry the same meditative cadence as descriptive passages, missing the opportunity for rhythm to tighten or breathe in step with escalation. Setup (mist and dream from line one), development (explicit naming and sustaining), and closure (tone charges final image) all present. Upper mid-band: coherent, purposeful, and closure-integrated, but static across pressure points rather than dynamically responsive.</comment>
