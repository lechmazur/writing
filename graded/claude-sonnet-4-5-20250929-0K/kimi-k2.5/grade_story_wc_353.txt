<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and particular—"symphonically minded, her brain wiring patterns around rhythms that no longer existed"—and her goal is clear. The tree-reading method embodies her empathy through embodied micro-choices (finger tracing, bow pressure). However, the hedgehog remains ornamental, and the final breakthrough lacks a visible cost or foreclosed path; she weeps but no prior option is abandoned. Internal contradiction is minimal; the arc is more discovery than renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elara, siskin alder grove, post-Hush dawn) arrive early. Escalation proceeds through deepening engagement—fissure analysis, bow preparation, first hum—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the subsonic note, the alder's groan, the world remembering). Cost is felt emotionally (tears) but not transactional; no prior path is visibly foreclosed. The lens holds, and the closure image reweights the premise, though the price remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator and stress cracks in the wood function as micro-setting, constraining Elara's method and charging the final image when the insulator trembles and amplifies the note. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (frost, bark texture, morning light on crazed glaze), filtered through Elara's symphonic perception. Spatial choreography is clean, and the alder's wounds serve as both map and instrument, directly shaping the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring sound—is signaled early and tightens through Elara's method (analyzing, stroking, visualizing). The piece accumulates pressure via deepening engagement rather than reversals; the hum is a breakthrough, not a crisis. Agency is present (she earns the right to strum through empathy), but the final cost is more emotional validation than a trade-off. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, though the hedgehog's uncurling constraint never materializes as pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: trauma as history, empathy as analysis, the Great Hush as lost vibration. The porcelain insulator and stress cracks recur with shifting weight, and the final image—"after the hedgehog uncurls, the world remembers how to listen"—reweights the premise without stating a moral. No overt philosophizing; the tree's suffering and Elara's symphonic mind interweave to offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable and apt; perceptual signature is consistent (symphonically minded, grain-reading). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("cambium," "lignin," "subsonic whisper"), grounding the voice in Elara's expertise without register drift. Psychic distance modulates intentionally at the climax (the hum, the tears). No head-hopping, and the prose reflects Elara's analytical yet reverent stance throughout. Minor reliance on filter verbs ("detected," "visualized") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and auditory texture. Information density is high (each line advances setting, method, or stakes), and the loop check is clean—no paraphrase cycles. Minor overwriting: "symphonically minded" appears twice in close proximity, and "empathy in motion" is repeated verbatim. The final paragraph risks slight abstraction ("teach the silent earth to sing again"), but the closure image remains concrete. Zero template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—tree-song sculptor in a silent world—offers a fresh synthesis of post-apocalyptic muteness, arboreal memory, and sonic restoration. The porcelain insulator as resonator and stress cracks as sheet music are specific and non-obvious. However, the Great Hush backstory (three centuries, vibration stolen) reads generic, and the hedgehog framing device is ornamental. The emotional arc (earning the right to strum through empathy) feels inevitable in hindsight, though the final turn lacks bold risk. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (approach, trace, prepare, stroke, draw) create the key turn (the hum). She is signaled early, drives all beats, and is causally active at closure. However, her decisions feel more like method execution than high-cost dilemmas; no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Two gates (setup, payoff) met; middle development is more observation than choice. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator appears early (ancient relic, green-glazed), recurs in the middle (catching light, mapping networks), and is causally active at closure (trembles, amplifies frequency). It serves as resonator, enabling the breakthrough. Three gates met; two distinct beats (description, climax); causal pressure high; closure linkage direct. Irreplaceability is strong (its properties matter). Slight swappability: another resonator could function with minor edits, but the insulator's history (electricity valleys, noisy past) charges the thematic contrast.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is named twice and frames Elara's method: understanding the tree's suffering to earn the right to strum. It shapes her approach (patience, reverence, becoming the tree) and arguably enables the breakthrough. Setup is early, development is implicit (her aching with the tree's winters), and payoff is thematic (honoring suffering). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it remains more thematic claim than on-page friction. Two gates weakly met; closure linkage is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" is named twice and describes Elara's perception ("brain wiring patterns around rhythms," "fingers finding the next chord"). It colors her method but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. Label-only mentions; no visible trade-off. Setup present; middle and closure participation are thematic rather than causal. Swappable with "musically inclined" or similar. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation as a causal force.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Strum" is signaled early (her art's core action), prepared in the middle (bow across fissures), and executed at closure (draws the bow, the alder groans). The action is causally central: strumming the stress lines produces the hum, the breakthrough, the world's first note. Three gates met; three beats (preparation, visualization, execution); high causal pressure; strong closure linkage. Irreplaceability is high; removing "strum" would break the closure. Slight abstraction: the mechanics are more metaphorical than physical, but the effect is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method (analyzing stress cracks in the tree-as-sculpture) is signaled early and shapes all middle beats: tracing fissures, reading grain, detecting micro-fractures, feeling resistance. It is causally active at closure (primary fissure releases the note). Three gates met; three beats; high causal pressure; strong closure linkage. Specificity is high (the cracks function as sheet music). Minor swappability: another damage-reading method could substitute, but the sculpture framing and stress-crack particulars are integral.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is named early and houses the action. The ancient alder at the grove's heart supplies the instrument (wounds, bark, roots). The setting enables the method and the closure (ground hums, root system amplifies). Three gates met; one direct beat (the alder as instrument). Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong. However, the grove itself is passive backdrop; the alder's specific wounds do the work. The siskins' final head-cock is ornamental. Lyric reprise qualifies but lacks cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the hedgehog uncurls" frames the opening and closing, establishing a temporal marker. Elara waits for the moment, and the final line echoes it thematically. However, the hedgehog's uncurling does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; it is a poetic boundary, not a live clock. Setup and payoff present (lyric reprise); middle development absent. No causal pressure; closure linkage is thematic resonance only. Swappable with any natural patience marker. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; further reduced for ornamental function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation (create music in a silent world) is signaled early, drives all choices (patience, analysis, bow preparation), and is fulfilled at closure (the first note). Three gates met; three beats; high causal pressure; strong closure linkage. Friction between want (music) and cost (empathy, reverence, tears) is present but muted—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The motivation is dramatized through action, not merely told. Irreplaceability is high; removing this desire would collapse the story.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is coherent throughout: the silent world, subsonic hum, soft groan, soundless tears. Tone modulates subtly under pressure (the hedgehog's stillness, Elara's swaying, the climactic whisper) without breaking into noise. The final image ("without sound") charges the paradox of restored vibration. Setup is implicit; development and payoff are strong. Tone shapes the closure effect (quiet breakthrough) with undeniable pressure. High irreplaceability; loud resolution would betray the premise. Minor: "intensely" is slightly over-claimed for the on-page texture, which reads more as steady quiet than pressurized silence.</comment>
