<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is motivated and his teaching mission is clear, but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("expectantly resigned reverence," "traveled stillness") rather than embodied contradiction. The three students remain largely interchangeable; their trembling and leaning are gestural poverty without distinct internal conflict. The final transformation—seeing one another "not as enemies, but as musicians"—is asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that foreclose paths with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors arrive early (velvet library, autumn, Elias, zither). The piece accumulates through layered reflection and the demonstration beat, arriving at a Resonant Reconfiguration (the students discover shared language). However, cost remains conceptual and implied rather than sharply legible on the page; the final note "fading into the heavy velvet curtains" offers atmospheric closure but lacks a visible price or foreclosed option that would crystallize the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The velvet library, autumn light, mahogany table, and zither are vividly anchored and recur throughout. The rosette's carved petals and soundhole serve as a focal object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (students lean, fingers are positioned, sound hangs in the air), and the setting subtly pressures the intimate, enclosed teaching moment, qualifying as effective micro-setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: teaching reconciliation through the old songs. One meaningful tightening occurs when the miner's daughter plays, choosing "absence instead of assertion," and the refugee joins in restraint. However, escalation is primarily thematic accumulation rather than a dramatized reversal that narrows options. The cost—potential failure, hatred proving "too loud"—is felt but remains abstract; no concrete loss or trade-off visibly alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (harmony through subtraction, unlearning hatred) emerges organically from the rosette's pattern, the damping demonstration, and the students' choices. The final image—"a map of absences that had finally led them home"—reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, phrases like "vanishing arts," "traveled stillness," and "expectantly resigned" edge toward label-speak, and the piece occasionally gestures at profundity ("a place before memory of wrongs") rather than earning it through stark particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited focalization is stable and anchored in Elias's perceptual bias (the rosette "seemed to pulse," sounds "like incense or memory"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("denote," "consonance," "resonance") that, while consistent, flattens immediacy under pressure. The three students lack distinct speech or interior voice; their collective leaning and trembling read as template gestures rather than individual perceptual signatures.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: "expectantly resigned reverence," "traveled stillness—a quality earned through years of navigating suspicion and loss," "frequencies of fear." Figurative density ("like incense or memory," "portal to another understanding," "map of absences") appears in most sentences of key beats without payoff that sharpens closure. Template cadence runs: "The sound was incomplete… waiting for other tones… he had created through precise restraint." Paraphrase loops ("harmony came not by adding complexity, but by subtracting noise—stripping away the discordant frequencies") dull momentum. These artifacts touch the closure image, triggering −1.7 baseline plus register drift and stock metaphor penalties totaling approximately −2.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The core premise—teaching reconciliation through musical subtraction—offers a thoughtful synthesis of conflict resolution and art. The rosette as map, the damping technique, and the velvet library setting feel specific. However, the emotional arc (former enemies learning to listen, discovering shared humanity) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived particulars. The final image's resonance is undercut by abstract phrasing ("place before memory of wrongs") that gestures at depth rather than delivering a non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and explains the rosette, demonstrates damping, and watches the students play. However, his choices do not create key turns; he observes and instructs while the students execute the transformation. His interior mission is established early but does not meaningfully narrow or alter by the end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette appears in the opening (fingers tracing), the explanation beat (pointing to carved petals), and the final image (gleaming in dying light). Its geometric pattern is tied causally to the method of subtraction and charges the closure by reweighting "absences." Strong setup, development through teaching, and closure linkage with thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Vanishing arts" is introduced early, referenced in Elias's mission and the traditions "nearly lost," and frames the stakes (the art might still vanish). It shapes the dominant concern but does not constrain a specific on-page choice or tactic; it functions more as atmospheric context than a mechanism that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" appears as a label in the opening and again when the miner's daughter trembles "with the expectantly resigned knowledge that she might fail." The trait is named rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in action. It flavors tone but does not visibly constrain or enable a choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Denote" is used three times: the rosette would "denote the exact method," "Each gap denotes a voice you must release," and the final sound "seemed to denote peace." It signals the teaching method and accumulates meaning across beats, contributing to closure by linking pattern to outcome. Functional across setup, middle explanation, and ending, though somewhat interchangeable with "signify" or "mark."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By subtracting noise" is seeded early ("true harmony came not by adding complexity, but by subtracting noise"), demonstrated when Elias damps a string to create resonance, and executed when the students omit sharp notes and choose "absence instead of assertion." The method is signaled, taught, and enacted across multiple beats, shaping the students' tactics and the final harmony.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The velvet library in autumn is anchored early, recurs (velvet shelves, velvet air, heavy velvet curtains, autumn light casting shadows, dying autumn light), and creates an intimate, enclosed pressure. It supplies the quiet necessary for listening and contrasts with "the world outside" that "roared with new conflicts," framing the stakes. Micro-setting that pressures choices and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" frames the temporal scope (thirty years of teaching, students' "years of navigating suspicion"). However, the scene's present-tense duration is vague; no live clock tightens decisions. The timeframe is thematic backdrop rather than a mechanism that alters tactics or raises cost in the demonstration beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To braid diverse voices into harmony" is Elias's stated mission, introduced early, and dramatized when the three students play together, their voices "braided." The desire shapes the dominant stake and is tested when the students must choose restraint over assertion. Friction between the want (harmony) and the cost (unlearning hatred, potential failure) is present but largely told rather than enacted through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears as a trait of the students and settles "deeper into [Elias's] bones" in the penultimate beat. It modulates coherently with the quiet, contemplative atmosphere and charges the moment when the final note fades. The tone is consistent but largely static; it does not shift under pressure or create a cadence break that reweights the stake.</comment>
