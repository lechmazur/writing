<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation is established and his arc from puppeteer to listener is clear, but the change feels partially asserted rather than fully dramatized. The blind storyteller encounter compresses his realization into received wisdom rather than embodied struggle. Internal contradiction appears in his self-deception about "exploring ethics," but the pivot to understanding happens too quickly after one story. The final renunciation (burning puppets and scripts) carries symbolic weight but minimal visible cost—no dramatized consequence of what he loses by ending his troupe.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Marcus's choices (descending to the storyteller, burning the puppets) link causally, while the dome and story-stick accumulate symbolic weight. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—he sits beside ashes having renounced manipulation. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. The cost is somewhat abstract: we see fire and ashes but not what Marcus sacrifices socially or materially by dismantling his troupe. One meaningful tightening occurs when the blind woman's story mirrors his own emptiness, narrowing his options to renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome constrains choice—Marcus returns to it twice, uses its isolation for reflection, and builds the fire there. The campfire story stick (carved from antenna scrap) functions as micro-setting, handled across beats and charged at closure when fed to flames. Sensory detail is selective: chilled air, visible breath, geometric ribs, Edison bulb half-light, alley grime. The dome's history (Cold War relic, radar technician's fictions) enriches theme without becoming a tour. Spatial choreography is clean across the three locations (dome, bar alley, dome).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Marcus's ethical reckoning with his manipulation. One meaningful tightening: the blind woman's story forces him to recognize his own reflection, narrowing options to confession or continued denial. He chooses renunciation (burning the puppets), but the escalation is more conceptual than pressure-tested—no antagonist resists, no external cost dramatized. Julian's accusation opens the story but disappears; the argument's heat doesn't carry forward as tactical friction. The final act is Marcus's alone, uncontested, so agency reads as internal realization rather than choice under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (the ethics of storytelling as manipulation vs. listening) emerges from particulars: puppet shows, drunk audiences, the radar technician broadcasting fictions to empty skies. The blind storyteller's tale functions as a non-literal answer, mirroring Marcus's emptiness without stating a moral. The campfire story stick's notches, the rewound tape, and the dome's Cold War legacy all resonate without symbolic convenience. Minor slip: "calligrapher who had confused the beauty of letterforms with the morality of messages" edges toward thematic statement, though it's embedded in his realization. The final image (smoke rising, meteor-hush silence) reweights prior material without neat resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marcus; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (calligrapher's precision, "urbane sophistication dissolving"). Diction occasionally drifts elevated: "subversive puppet shows," "plausible deniability," "consensus reality" feel more essayistic than character-particular under stress. The blind woman's dialogue is brief but distinct. Two filter-verb stacks appear in reflective passages ("understood that," "recognized his own reflection"), dulling immediacy. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between scene and reflection, though the ratio of summary to dramatized choice tilts toward telling in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "memories like furniture in a dark room," "meteor hush," "liminal glow," "story enter his bloodstream like a toxin or sacrament," "reverse motion…of intent." In peak beats (argument aftermath, storyteller encounter, burning), nearly every sentence carries metaphor, creating register drift and slowing propulsion. Template cadence appears: "The [noun] [past-tense verb]" opens multiple sentences. Paraphrase loop: "epiphany arrived incomplete and trembling" / "second half-lit epiphany followed" restates the two-part structure without added pressure. Clarity remains intact but momentum sags under ornament. No major grammatical errors; pronoun references track.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise (ethical storytelling explored via puppet manipulation) is thoughtful but not entirely fresh—parallels to media-manipulation parables are evident. The synthesis of calligrapher + puppeteer + radar dome + campfire story stick is specific and memorable. The radar technician backstory (broadcasting fictions to empty skies) provides a strong, non-obvious mirror. Risk-taking is moderate: the structure is linear with one descent-and-return arc; the ending renunciation is earnest but predictable once the blind woman's story lands. Transformation test: swapping "calligrapher" and "radar dome" for "writer" and "abandoned theater" would leave the arc largely unchanged, suggesting the freshness relies more on texture than irreplaceable synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus (urbane calligrapher) is present throughout and makes two key choices: descending to the storyteller (middle) and burning the puppets (end). Early setup establishes his profession and manipulative intent. His urbane nature shapes his self-justification ("exploring ethical storytelling") and his dissolution in the alley. Causal pressure: his calligrapher's precision contrasts with his ethical blindness, and the trait enables his puppet craft. Closure linkage: he returns "uncommonly serene," echoing the opening cuffs-adjusting scene but transformed. Cost: he dismantles his troupe, though the social/financial price is implied rather than dramatized. Swappability: "calligrapher" could be "illustrator" or "designer" with minor edits; the specific skill (letterforms) is mentioned but not leveraged in a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The campfire story stick appears in four beats: Marcus clutches it in the dome (opening), its notches record performances (early exposition), he offers it to the blind woman (middle choice), he feeds it into the fire (closure). Early setup and closure participation are strong. Development: offering the stick is a symbolic surrender but the woman doesn't use it on-page; Marcus asks for a story but the stick's role in that exchange is passive. The notches and scrap-antenna origin tie to theme (recording manipulations, Cold War fictions). Cost: burning it represents renunciation, though it's one item among many (marionettes, scripts). Specificity: carved from radar antenna scrap links dome and story-stick, but that detail could be "driftwood" or "stage timber" without breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Half-lit epiphanies shape the middle section: Marcus realizes he cannot study ethics from above (first), then that he must become audience (second). Setup is late (midpoint); they arrive after the argument but before the descent. Development: the two epiphanies narrow his options, driving him to the storyteller. Closure: the final image mentions "half-lit epiphanies now fully illuminated," reprising the phrase. The concept is more thematic than tactical—his realizations don't constrain a physical choice with visible cost; they summarize an internal shift. The "incomplete and trembling" / "second half-lit" framing feels ornamental rather than pressure-generating. Swappability: "partial insights" or "dawning awareness" could replace the phrase with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" appears three times: opening (Marcus in the dome post-argument), the dome described as having "uncommonly serene silence," and closing (Marcus "uncommonly serene beside the ashes"). Setup is immediate. The trait frames his state but doesn't constrain action—serenity is a result, not a lever. No visible tradeoff: we don't see him choose serenity over another impulse, or pay a cost to achieve it. The attribute is label-only; no embodied behavior demonstrates what "uncommonly serene" looks like under pressure (breath, gesture, micro-choice). Closure reprise reweights it (post-renunciation calm vs. post-argument composure), which lifts it slightly, but it remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Reverse" appears in four instances: argument leaves hush "behind," Marcus rewinds tape to watch creation "undo itself frame by frame," "reverse motion not of tape or time, but of intent," and the meteor "silent before it chooses whether to burn or to strike" (implied reversal of trajectory). Setup is early (tape-rewinding beat). Development: rewinding the tape is a literal action that dramatizes undoing, prompting his realization. Closure: "reverse motion…of intent" shifts from exploration to restoration, and burning the materials enacts that reversal. The action is more metaphorical than plot-driving—rewinding tape doesn't causally enable the descent or burning. Specificity: "reverse" ties the beats together thematically, but the middle and end choices (descending, burning) would function without the tape-rewind scene.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars are mentioned in exposition (second paragraph: "true purpose," "waterfront bars," Julian's accusation) and the blind woman is "outside the bar where he usually performed." Setup is early. Development: the shows are the source of conflict (Julian's anger, Marcus's guilt) but no performance is dramatized; we see neither the mechanics nor a specific lie planted. Closure: Marcus burns the marionettes and scripts, ending the shows. The method shapes his guilt and the stakes (ethical manipulation), but it's told rather than shown. Swappability: "subversive theater troupe" or "late-night storytelling sessions" could replace it without altering the arc. The bars and puppets are atmospheric but not tactically essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is present in five beats: opening (Marcus alone post-argument), its Cold War history supplies the campfire stick, the blind woman's story reveals a radar technician worked there, Marcus returns at dawn, and he builds the fire on its concrete floor. Setup is immediate. Development: the dome's isolation enables reflection; its "geometric ribs" and "crack" are used (smoke escapes through the crack at closure). Closure: the dome houses the final renunciation. The setting supplies a resource (antenna scrap for the stick) and its history charges the blind woman's mirror-story. Spatial coherence is maintained. Cost: Marcus's choice to return and burn the puppets there is intentional, using the dome's containment. The dome is integral but not irreplaceable—an abandoned theater would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the hush left behind by a heated argument" anchors the opening and recurs as "meteor hush" throughout. Setup is immediate (first line). The argument with Julian is recent (shouted "moments ago"), creating urgency. Development: the hush is more atmospheric than a live clock; we don't track hours or feel time pressure tightening Marcus's choices. The descent to the storyteller and return to the dome happen "tonight" and "at dawn," but the gap is summarized ("As the blind woman's voice filled the space"). Closure: "hush now transformed into something breathable and honest" reprises the frame. The timeframe is a lyric container rather than a tactical constraint; no decision is forced by a deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation "to explore ethical storytelling" is stated in exposition (fifth paragraph) and drives the setup (puppet shows "served a higher purpose"). Development: Julian's accusation and the blind woman's story force Marcus to confront that his exploration was actually "mastering manipulation." The motivation is conflicted (he convinces himself it's ethical inquiry, but it's control), creating internal friction. Closure: his intent shifts "from exploration to restoration," and burning the materials enacts that change. The desire is told more than dramatized—we don't see him choose a specific manipulation or test a boundary on-page. Cost: abandoning his exploration/troupe is implied but not concretely shown (no Julian reconciliation, no audience fallout). The motivation shapes his guilt but is more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears four times: opening ("uncommonly serene silence"), "meteor hush pressing against the dome's exterior," the storyteller scene is "quiet" (implied hush), and closing ("finally silent in the way a meteor is silent before it chooses whether to burn or to strike"). Setup is early. The tone is consistent—contemplative, charged with latent energy—and modulates subtly (argument's heat → reflective calm → honest breathability). Closure: the final meteor image charges the ending with potential violence or grace, reweighting the hush as anticipatory rather than passive. The tone supports theme (storytelling's impact as meteor-strike) but is more atmospheric than structural. Swappability: "heavy silence" or "charged quiet" could replace it with minor tonal shift but no plot change.</comment>
