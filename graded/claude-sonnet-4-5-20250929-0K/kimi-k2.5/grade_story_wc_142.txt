<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's dual allegiance is established early and her choices show internal contradiction (wearing both corporate badge and grandmother's tokens), but the interiority often defaults to abstract labels like "hopeful desperation" rather than embodied sensation. Her micro-choices—tagging walls, using the stone chip to score glyphs—show agency under pressure. The culture shock absorber role remains mostly decorative; we never see her actually translating or mediating between groups in scene, which undercuts the occupation's constraint on her choices. The final "smile" while adjusting her badge reads as tidy resolution rather than sustained contradiction with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal: Maya's graffiti network activates a resistance that will survive privatization, and the ending shows the corporate boats arriving while her encoded system operates invisibly. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure is a Charged Poise—Maya stands ready to translate while the hidden infrastructure persists—with conceptual cost legible (the carnival's culture will endure only in encoded form, not openly). One meaningful tightening occurs when the juggler recognizes her mark and the network activates. However, the three-night backstory of tagging "specific walls" is told rather than dramatized, and the legal loopholes she encodes are asserted without on-page demonstration of how they work or what they cost her to discover.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The raft city's sensory texture is vivid and purposeful: "damp wall," "rusted steel," "neon-drenched corridors," "layered graffiti that covered every surface like barnacles." The carnival's spatial logic is coherent—aerialists above gambling dens, central promenade, lower decks—and the graffiti-covered walls serve as both setting and tactical medium. The foundation stone chip's "irregular edge" is used twice (once to authenticate, once to score a fresh glyph), constraining Maya's method. Micro-setting qualifier is met: the walls and their graffiti language directly enable her resistance strategy and charge the final image of messages spreading invisibly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving community bonds through gentrification—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when the gentrification notices arrive and Maya must finalize her network before the buyout. The juggler's mid-toss recognition and the teenager photographing the tag provide one meaningful escalation as the network activates cell by cell. However, Maya faces no on-page failure or adaptation; the plan works as conceived with no visible friction or trade-off. The corporate boats' arrival at dawn provides external pressure, but Maya's response is a smile of confidence rather than a choice that forecloses an option with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: roots versus floating, joy versus spreadsheet, visible carnival versus invisible infrastructure. The foundation stone as "compass and conscience" and later as "cryptographic key" shows purposeful evolution of meaning. The piece resists moralizing until the final beat, where "the future, that fragile bridge between what was and what must be" tips toward thesis statement. The encoded graffiti versus corporate drones creates meaningful dramatic irony. The ending's conceptual repricing—culture surviving through hidden encoding rather than open expression—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether preservation can coexist with privatization, though the ease of Maya's success softens the thematic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "underutilized verticality," "as if joy could be spreadsheeted and history depreciated" captures Maya's professional-yet-rooted stance. Perceptual signature shows her dual lens ("orderly intuitive" translates to mapping systems while reading emotional currents). However, register occasionally drifts into prompt-echo abstraction: "orderly intuitive by nature" and "hopeful desperation" are diagnostic labels rather than embodied perception. The prose carries distinct texture in metaphor (barnacles, tide water, bruised purples), and psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider carnival observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The raft city of Carnevale had never known silence" establishes setting, character history, and current tension). However, several passages loop conceptually: the dual allegiance is restated three times in the opening (lapel badge vs. grandmother's tokens, boardroom vs. salt-crusted community, straddling worlds), and "orderly intuitive" is both told as trait and then explained as "mapping complex systems while her gut read emotional currents." The phrase "hopeful desperation" appears twice, once as label and once as embodied "rise in her chest like tide water"—the second instance is stronger but the repetition signals scaffold. Figurative language occasionally stacks without adding pressure: "threatening and buoyant all at once" reads as decorative balance. No severe artifacts touch the closure beat, which remains clear and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The raft city carnival offers a fresh micro-setting, and encoding resistance in graffiti art provides a specific, non-obvious tactical layer. The "culture shock absorber" occupation is inventive nomenclature but functions mostly as label; we don't see translation work that would demonstrate its unique constraints. The dual allegiance frame and gentrification-via-encoded-resistance arc feel structurally familiar (underdog community resists corporate takeover through hidden means), though the graffiti-as-legal-map detail and foundation stone as cryptographic key add specificity. Transformation test: the emotional arc and plot structure could transfer to other settings (urban neighborhood, immigrant enclave) with surface changes, suggesting the freshness is more in texture than in premise or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya as culture shock absorber is present throughout and her dual position (corporate badge, grandmother's tokens) frames the conflict. However, the actual work of translating between raft-dwellers and corporate architects never appears on the page; we see her tagging walls and planning, but no scene of mediation. Her final act—greeting the corporate boats while the hidden network operates—ties to the role thematically but not through occupational constraint. Setup clear, middle development thin (the role doesn't constrain her graffiti plan), closure participation thematic rather than causal. Two gates met, lyric reprise weak. Mid-band functional use without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Foundation stone chip appears early (second paragraph) as heirloom with clear symbolic weight ("roots mattered even when you floated"). Maya uses it twice on the page: once to score a glyph into wet paint, once as a cryptographic key whose texture authenticates secret communications. The object drives two distinct beats (mapping legal loopholes, activating the network) and its texture/irregularity becomes tactically necessary. Closure linkage: the final paragraph references "the foundation stone's legacy spread across the walls," charging the ending image. Strong setup, clear middle development, solid closure participation. Causal pressure moderate (enables encoding but doesn't narrow options with visible trade-off). Three gates met, specificity high, cost connection implicit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dual allegiance is signaled early (corporate badge vs. grandmother's tokens, "straddling worlds that were about to collide") and shapes Maya's dominant stake: navigate gentrification without betraying either side. The concept drives her tactical choice to encode resistance rather than openly oppose. Middle development: "The dual allegiance that had tormented her...finally resolved into action that served both masters without betraying either" makes the friction explicit and shows the concept constraining her method. Closure: her smile while adjusting the translator's badge as corporate boats arrive crystallizes the duality in the final image. However, the torment is mostly told; we don't see an on-page beat where she must choose between corporate and community interests with visible cost. Three gates met, causal pressure moderate, specificity solid.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is introduced in paragraph two as a label: "her mind mapping complex systems while her gut read the emotional currents." The trait appears functionally when Maya creates the glyph—"The mark was a map, orderly yet organic"—linking order (legal loopholes) and intuition (people will understand). Setup clear, but middle development is thin (no on-page moment where order and intuition conflict or where one mode fails and the other saves). Closure: the attribute is implied in her readiness to translate while trusting the hidden network, but not explicitly reweighted. Two gates marginally met. Label-only introduction (−0.3), no visible trade-off cost (remains mid-band).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reorganize" appears prominently: gentrification notices promise to "reorganize the chaotic sprawl," and Maya counters by having "reorganized the community's resistance into something that could survive the transformation." The action is central to her strategy—she reorganizes ownership of communal kitchens through legal loopholes, reorganizes communication through encoded graffiti. Setup by end of first third, middle beats show the reorganization in progress (tagging walls, network activating), closure explicitly states the survival infrastructure as reorganized. The verb is thematically load-bearing (turning corporate language against itself) and irreplaceable without losing that irony. Three gates met, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Graffiti encoding is introduced early: "Working through messages encoded in graffiti art, she had spent three nights tagging specific walls with symbols that looked like decorative carnival flourishes...but spoke plainly to the locals." The method's mechanics matter: spiral = gather supplies, fractured mask = safe houses, stone-breaking-waves = founding families' oaths. Middle beat: Maya scores a fresh glyph that maps legal loopholes. Closure: "the foundation stone's legacy spread across the walls in paint and encoded meaning" and the teenager photographs the tag, activating memory. Three gates met. However, the encoding is mostly told in summary ("three nights tagging") rather than dramatized in a scene where Maya must choose what to encode or risk discovery. Swappability moderate (could use another covert channel), but the visual-language specificity (graffiti as carnival decoration) is well-integrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The raft city carnival is anchored immediately ("starboard flotation barrel," "perpetual carnival's generators," "bobbing endlessly on the Pacific gyre") and saturates the piece with sensory detail: neon corridors, aerialists above gambling dens, layered graffiti as barnacles, fire-eaters and fortune-tellers on temporary stages. The setting enables Maya's tactic—walls everywhere provide encoding surfaces, the visual chaos camouflages her symbols from corporate drones. Middle beats: she moves "through the neon-drenched corridors," trails fingers across graffiti, uses the central promenade wall. Closure: the carnival music swells as corporate boats arrive, and the invisible messages persist "across the walls." The perpetual-motion, layered-chaos quality directly pressures the gentrification conflict (corporate "efficient zones" vs. "chaotic sprawl") and supplies the medium of resistance. Three gates met, causal pressure high, irreplaceability strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Timeframe "before privatization" is established early: gentrification notices arrived "that morning," the buyout finalizes "next week," and Maya has "three nights" of tagging behind her. The clock tightens decisions—she must complete the network before the buyout—and the dawn arrival of corporate boats marks the deadline's approach. However, the time pressure is more structural than tactical; we don't see Maya racing against the clock or making a forced choice because time ran out. The "next week" deadline hovers as context but doesn't visibly constrain a specific on-page action with cost. Setup clear, middle development (three nights) told rather than dramatized, closure marks time's arrival (dawn, boats) but doesn't show a consequence of the time limit. Two-plus gates met, causal linkage moderate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to navigate gentrification (preserve community bonds while acknowledging corporate inevitability) is the story's spine. Paragraph one: "She was a culture shock absorber by trade, translating between...the corporate architects who circled like sharks." Paragraph three: "Maya knew she couldn't stop the money, but she could navigate the gentrification to preserve the community's invisible bonds." Her choices—encoding messages, mapping legal loopholes, activating the network—all serve this goal. Middle friction: "The dual allegiance that had tormented her" shows internal cost, though the torment is told more than shown. Closure: she's "ready to greet them while behind her...the foundation stone's legacy spread," crystallizing her navigational stance. Three gates met, desire dramatized through action, but the lack of on-page failure or adaptation (everything works as planned) softens the friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone blends hope and desperation from the opening: "rhythm felt frantic, a heartbeat before the scalpel" and "standing between the boardroom's sleek projections and the salt-crusted community." Paragraph seven makes it explicit: "hopeful desperation rise in her chest like tide water, threatening and buoyant all at once." The tone modulates with pressure—early dread, mid-story tactical focus, closing confidence ("Maya smiled"). However, the label "hopeful desperation" appears twice, once as direct assertion, suggesting the tone is told as much as enacted. Closure: the "brassy and defiant" carnival music and Maya's smile tilt toward hope, with desperation implicit in the hidden-only survival of culture. The tone charges the final image but the explicit labeling and minor tonal drift (torment → confidence) keep it from full integration.</comment>
