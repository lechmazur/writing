<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is established—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—and her work deciphering the cast notes shows professional interiority. However, her "shrewdly innocent" trait remains label-only without constraining a single choice; she never faces a dilemma between concealment and transparency. The boy is unconscious throughout, offering no relational crucible. Emotional embodiment leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("lotus-hearted ache") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through coral-as-metaphor and cast-note fragments, then shifts cadence in the final two paragraphs to a promise of "grafted wholeness." Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three; no penalty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara places the coral as sentinel and frames the boy's future healing with visible conceptual cost—she carries "the smudged lexicon of fear in her own marrow." Cost is legible but relies on assertion more than dramatized forfeiture, keeping the score mid-7s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly rendered and frames the entire piece; sensory detail (vapor, copper light, glass walls) is filtered through Mara's translator's gaze. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting: held, turned, warmed in her palm, then placed on the windowsill to charge the final image. The cast itself—plaster with smudged notes—constrains her decryption work and anchors the scene's central action, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to graft new meaning onto old wounds by decrypting the cast notes. The piece signals this early and shows one meaningful deepening when Mara recognizes the notes as "collective confession" and "map of trauma." However, no live opposition or reversal tightens her options; she completes the decryption without friction, and the resolution (placing the coral, framing the boy's future) is contemplative rather than a choice under pressure. One tightening meets the 600–800 baseline but lacks the visible trade-off or foreclosed path that would lift it into the 8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—survival encoded in margins, grafting life onto ruin—emerges organically from coral metaphor, cast notes, and Mara's vigil. The final line "holding the lotus-hearted ache like a lantern" offers a resonant image that reweights isolation into shared ritual without stated moral. "Lotus-hearted ache" recurs but remains abstract; the metaphor does not constrain a choice or accumulate pressure across beats, only decorates. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the coral, tracing the cast) and the piece avoids thesis statements, though some phrasing ("shrewdly innocent in their defiance") edges toward allegory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Mara; psychic distance is controlled and perceptual signature (translator's eye, surgical precision) is character-specific. Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally slips into academic register ("encrypting their grief," "decrypting it daily") that feels authorial rather than character-lived. No dialogue on the page. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control is strong in the opening and closing paragraphs but the middle section loops similar syntactic patterns ("She began to unknot… She had come… She would tell").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "breathing thing of vapor," "chemical surrender," "calcium channels reminding her of neural networks," "lotus-hearted ache," "carrying the smudged lexicon of fear in her own marrow." In the middle beats, metaphors stack without clear propulsion, creating textural richness at the cost of momentum. Template cadence appears in paragraph-opening stems: "She turned it over… She leaned closer… She recognized… She began to unknot… She understood… She had come… She would tell." Paraphrase loop: "converting isolation into shared ritual, turning the fragment of a broken reef into a promise of grafted wholeness" restates the prior sentence's content. No text artifacts touch the closure image directly, but pervasive density and loops lower the score by −0.8 to −1.0 in mid-passage.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of brain coral as neural-pathway metaphor, war-zone trauma encoded on a child's cast, and translator-as-decryptor is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative premise and follows through with the coral placement as sentinel. However, the core frame—witness/translator discovering hidden suffering in a conflict zone and reframing it as resilience—is a familiar template in contemporary literary fiction. Transformation occurs through the cast-notes device and coral motif, but emotional specificity is diluted by elevated diction and abstract metaphor ("lotus-hearted ache") rather than lived, contradictory detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara the translator is present throughout and her professional skill (deciphering smudged notes) shapes the middle beats. She makes one micro-choice: placing the coral on the windowsill as sentinel. However, observation dominates; she does not face a live decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup is immediate, middle use is functional, and the ending frames her ongoing vigil, meeting two gates and enabling mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The brain coral fragment is introduced in paragraph two, handled in paragraph three ("turned it over," "grew warm in her palm"), and placed on the windowsill in the penultimate paragraph with charged meaning ("a sentinel for when the boy woke"). Three distinct beats; early signal; closure linkage. However, the coral's properties (maze-like surface, calcium channels) are described rather than used to constrain a choice or alter tactics. Reprise reweights but does not impose cost, placing it in the 6.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Shared anxieties" is signaled in paragraph four: "The shared anxieties bound them all… into a single organism of worry and hope." The cast notes embody collective confession and Mara's work converts "isolation into shared ritual." The concept shapes the piece's thematic stakes and middle action (decrypting the notes). Closure invokes it implicitly ("others might sleep without the weight of unspoken dread"). Two gates clear; concept alters tactics (decryption as communal translation) but does not impose a visible choice-level cost, landing mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" appears twice as label: Mara's face "belied the surgical precision," and she is "shrewdly innocent in the gathering dark" at the end. The trait is asserted but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost; no moment shows her leveraging harmlessness to conceal insight or making a trade-off tied to this attribute. Present but ornamental, scoring low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unknot" is named in paragraph four: "She began to unknot the tangled syntax," and whispered to the boy in paragraph six: "Unknot this." The action is central to the middle beat (decrypting the cast notes) and shapes the thematic turn (recognizing the notes as collective map). However, the decryption proceeds without friction or failure; swapping "unknot" for "decipher" or "decode" would require only minor edits. Two gates, functional use, but mid-band due to replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method—decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast—is signaled in paragraph three and executed in paragraphs four and five. Mara reads the water-blurred messages, recognizes handwriting, and decodes collective confession. The mechanics matter: plaster endures where paper burns, and the notes constrain her interpretive work. The method drives the middle beat and feeds the closure ("notes on his cast were not stains but seeds"). Three gates; causal linkage; low irreplaceability (any inscribed surface could serve), placing it at the 6.0–6.9 threshold.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is anchored in the opening line and returned to in the penultimate paragraph ("the mist pressed against the glass walls"). Twilight's "copper light" and "gathering dark" mark time and mood. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions as atmospheric container. Early signal and closure presence meet two gates, but postcard-level integration caps it below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthetic kicks in" is signaled in paragraph two: "After the anesthetic kicked in, the boy's breathing deepened." The child's unconsciousness permits Mara's uninterrupted work, but no live clock tightens her decisions; she could work indefinitely. Time is present and functional but does not escalate pressure or alter tactics, landing in the 4.5–5.0 replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to graft new meaning onto old wounds"—is stated in paragraph five and dramatized through her decryption work and coral placement. The desire is coherent and feeds the closure image ("grafted wholeness"). However, no friction appears: no cost, doubt, or competing want tests her commitment. The motivation shapes beats but is not conflicted, placing it at the 6.0–6.9 band for single-beat causal role without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" is named in paragraph six and returned to in the final line: "holding the lotus-hearted ache like a lantern." The tone is consistent and modulates across beats—mist and vapor in the opening, intimacy in the middle, charged vigil at the end. The phrase charges the final image and reweights the piece's central sorrow-within-beauty paradox. Early seed and closure reprise earn mid-6s; abstract phrasing and single-note application prevent higher scores.</comment>
