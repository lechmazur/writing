<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is present but operates largely in retrospective exposition rather than live contradiction under pressure. The young man's transformation reads as passive reception rather than earned agency—he observes, understands, and departs without a visible internal conflict forcing a costly choice. Motivation is declared ("to teach withering to bloom again") but never tested by a competing want or fear that would make her action costly in the moment. Embodied emotion is thin; grief is labeled and discussed rather than enacted through contradictory impulses during the key beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece opens without anchoring who/where/when until ~150 words in (the observatory is named, but Elara's present situation and the timeframe remain vague until the young man arrives). The closure unit—Elara teaching the young man to fold coordinates and leave them for others—reads as Earned Stasis or Charged Poise, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; she performs the same ritual she's been performing, without a visible foreclosure or shift. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building through repeated imagery), yet the ending does not break or reconfigure the pattern with undeniable pressure; it restates the thesis. The Cost Proof Test fails: no single sentence makes the price legible at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful—brass telescopes, copper dome, amber beam, vellum stencils—and anchors the central action. However, spatial choreography is loose (where exactly are the refractor, the bench, the threshold?) and the environment does not constrain a choice at closure; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The micro-setting of vellum and magnets comes closest to shaping tactics, but the young man's transformation occurs through conversation and observation, not through a tool-constrained move. The setting charges the mood but does not pressure the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara teaching the young man a ritual of grief transformation—is present but never escalates under pressure. The young man arrives, receives instruction, and departs; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option or forces a trade-off. Elara's past loss (her daughter) is backstory that frames her stance but does not create live friction. The closure involves repeating the ritual without a visible cost or narrowing of paths; the young man's acceptance reads as smooth uptake rather than a choice between competing goods or harms. One meaningful pressure point is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme—grief as transformation, the architecture of loss—is stated overtly rather than emerging from particulars. Key phrases like "genuinely artificial in their manufactured permanence yet achingly authentic" and "The withering teaches us the necessary structure of blooming" read as thesis statements rather than discoveries earned by concrete action. The final image (Elara folding new wings) restates the premise without reweighting it; there is no resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, only a confirmation of what was declared at the start. Thematic Echo penalty applies: "to teach withering to bloom again" is articulated in prompt-like language throughout, including near closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited anchored to Elara, and the prose carries a distinct lyric register ("curtains of intention," "subdued ardor"). However, the diction often drifts into elevated philosophical abstraction ("architecture of truth," "coordinates of loss") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is sparse; the young man's two lines are functional but carry little subtext or goal. The perceptual signature is poetic but not selective in character-specific ways—Elara notices symbols and metaphors rather than lived details. Psychic distance remains consistent but does not modulate with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "curtains of intention hung between the visible and the remembered, translucent veils that shifted" and "genuinely artificial memorials—permanent records of impermanent grief, authentic precisely in their deliberate falseness" load figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff. Mixed metaphors appear ("curtains" as barriers that "parted" yet also "veils that shifted"). Paraphrase loops occur: the concept of "genuinely artificial" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is mild but present in the repeated "She [verb]..." stems. Information density is low in expository blocks; many sentences restate the same conceptual claim. Patterned-artifact penalty applies: −1.0 for density, coherence, and loops combined.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The core premise—mourning jewelry maker in a timeless observatory teaching grief rituals—offers a fresh frame, but the execution leans heavily on writing-prompt templates: symbolic objects (vellum, origami, stars), a mentor figure who has "hit rock bottom," and a young seeker who arrives at midnight. The emotional arc (acceptance of loss through ritualized craft) is familiar and proceeds without surprise. The "genuinely artificial" paradox is stated rather than dramatized; the story tells us the tattoo stencils are honest about impermanence but does not show a moment where that honesty costs something or creates friction. Transformation test: swap the specifics (jewelry for pottery, stars for gardens) and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her past as mourning jewelry maker frames her role, but her choices do not create key turns. She receives the young man, explains her ritual, and demonstrates it; he accepts without resistance. Her agency is instructional rather than decisional. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (two: arrival and instruction) +0.9, but no causal pressure or closure linkage beyond restating her established practice. Swappability: she could be any grief counselor or craftsperson with minor edits −0.6. No visible cost tied to her role at closure −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil on vellum appears in two beats: Elara's opening ritual and the instruction scene where she pins one against the refractor lens. It is handled and its mechanics (vellum against amber beam, magnets) are specified. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (two) +0.9, some specificity (material and method matter) +0.4. However, it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the ending focuses on origami figures instead. Missing closure linkage −0.8. The stencil is thematically load-bearing ("genuinely artificial") but does not alter tactics or outcomes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The phrase "curtains of intention" appears twice: early framing and at the moment they "parted" when the young man recognizes his brother's stars. It is described as a barrier that shifts with focus and need, but the mechanics are metaphorical rather than causal. Early signal +0.4, one distinct beat (the parting moment) +0.4, but it does not shape stakes or constrain action—Elara and the young man's moves proceed identically whether the curtains exist or not. Ornamental use −0.7. Swappability: could be replaced with "threshold of understanding" or similar abstraction −0.6. Summary-only at the key moment −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The attribute "genuinely artificial" is explained at length in dialogue and narration, framing the tattoo stencils and the broader project. Early signal +0.6, appears in two beats (initial setup and explanation to the young man) +0.9. However, it functions as a thematic label rather than a trait that constrains action. No on-page moment where the "genuinely artificial" quality forces a tradeoff or enables a tactic that an alternative approach could not. Label-only −0.7, swappability −0.5. The young man's transformation is not contingent on this exact paradox.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The action "illuminate" appears three times: Elara illuminates barriers by holding vellum against the projector, she rotates the dome to allow moonlight to illuminate the stencil, and the ending references stencils "that would illuminate particular darkness." Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (three) +1.4, and the second beat (moonlight through the stencil) is the moment the young man's transformation crystallizes +0.6. However, the action is not irreplaceable; "project," "reveal," or "cast" could serve the same function with minor edits −0.6. The specificity of light-work fits the observatory setting but does not impose unique constraints.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method of leaving origami figures with coordinates inside is introduced early (Elara folds rice paper cranes and boats each morning, leaving them at crossroads and hospital gates). The young man arrives clutching one such crane, its mechanics paid off when he unfolds it. In the ending, Elara teaches him to fold his own and leave it for the next traveler. Early signal +0.7, three beats (setup, arrival, instruction/closure) +1.4, causal pressure (the method enables the young man's arrival and seeds the story's continuity) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. Swappability is low; the origami-coordinates system is specific and interlocking. Missing: a visible cost tied to the method −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeless observatory provides spatial anchor and thematic resonance (extinct stars, copper dome, telescopes). Early signal +0.6, appears across all beats +1.4, and supplies the tools (refractor, projector, lenses) that enable Elara's ritual. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure or alter tactics under pressure; the young man could receive the same instruction in any workshop. The observatory enriches atmosphere but functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. Postcard description in opening paragraphs −0.5, no micro-setting constraint at the ending −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after hitting rock bottom" is mentioned twice (Elara arrived three winters ago after her daughter's funeral, and she had learned this "after hitting rock bottom" in reflection). It frames her backstory but does not tighten present decisions. No live clock; the young man's visit unfolds at an undefined pace. Summary-only −0.6, no middle development (the "after" state is static throughout the present-tense action) −0.8, missing closure participation −0.9. The timeframe is functional backstory but does not shape the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach withering to bloom again" is stated directly in narration and drives Elara's daily practice (folding origami, crafting stencils, instructing the young man). Early signal +0.6, two beats (her ritual and the instruction scene) +0.9, and it provides the thematic spine. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. No on-page moment where teaching costs her something or where she must choose between helping the young man and protecting herself. Told-only −0.8, no friction between want and cost −0.7. The young man's easy acceptance flattens the motivation's test.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The tone "subdued ardor" is explicitly named and sustained: Elara's "calm exterior" and "subdued ardor warming the cold air" without "theatrical heights." The prose maintains a restrained, lyric register throughout. Early signal +0.5, coherent across all beats +1.0. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure; the instruction scene and the ending hold the same emotional temperature as the opening. Static mood −0.6. The final image does not charge or break the tone; it restates it. The tone supports theme but does not escalate with the story's arc.</comment>
