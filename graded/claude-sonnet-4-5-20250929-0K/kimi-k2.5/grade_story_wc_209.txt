<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's interiority is vivid and purposeful, embodied through her work and spatial movement. The transformation from "questions she never voiced aloud" to "silence contained conversation rather than isolation" shows earned progression. However, the mother remains abstract—a device for Lyra's realization rather than a felt presence. The final shift reads slightly too smooth; the grief-to-understanding arc would benefit from one moment of contradictory impulse under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens cleanly: winter passage → cathedral visits → layered-glass discovery → mural transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding replaces misreading) with conceptual cost visible in "years of misunderstanding." The orientation is delayed—"amber pavilion" and "behind the pavilion's garden wall" don't fully anchor spatial layout until paragraph two, but the effect serves the meditative mode and pays off at closure, waiving penalty. One meaningful deepening (the etched-glass revelation) reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, frost, melting snow, and cathedral window constrain Lyra's choices across beats: she returns daily, compares postcards, waits through winter. The sexton's hands "smelled of beeswax" and water "dripping from the eaves in a rhythm like the counting of rosary beads" are sensory and POV-filtered. The etched glass—three laminated sheets with air pockets—provides the technical specificity that charges the final image. Minor: the garden wall flowers are named but never shown growing or opening on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her mother's devotion to night-blooming flowers—is signaled early and tightens through the sexton's revelation: "not facing upward toward the safety of darkness, but eastward, already yearning toward a dawn." This reweights Lyra's prior misreading and narrows options (she cannot return to the melancholy interpretation). The mural changes from "somber purples and blacks" to "golds that pulsed beneath the surface," showing visible cost in reworked labor. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The night-blooming flower motif evolves from melancholy symbol to "radical hope" without stating a moral. The postcards-as-maps-of-faith and the laminated glass structure converge in the final image: "roots deep in soil, stems reaching through imagined glass layers, and petals unfurled toward an unseen sun." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor: "umbral tenderness" and "dawning hush" appear as labeled themes in the final paragraph, stepping close to overstatement, but the mural image anchors them in concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lyra; perceptual signature is consistent (artist noticing "burnt sienna," "honeyed light," "layers of shadow and silver"). The sexton's single line of dialogue feels natural and purposeful. However, diction drifts elevated in peak beats: "reckon with the years," "sediment clearing from deep water," "umbral tenderness" read slightly above Lyra's working artist register. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Narrative distance holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "bell of suspended amber," "spectral roots and invisible stems," "sediment clearing from deep water," "shadows soft as velvet," "a second heartbeat." In the final paragraph, nearly every sentence carries metaphor, flattening propulsion. "Umbral tenderness" appears twice in close proximity (paragraphs four and seven). Paraphrase loop: "not to hide from the sun, but to be ready for its first ray" echoes "already yearning toward a dawn they could not yet see but trusted completely." Template cadence: "She was a vivid mural artist... She worked with... She understood at last..." Baseline −0.8 for density + loop + cadence, escalated to −1.0 because metaphor stacking touches the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The laminated-glass structure as metaphor for layered faith is a fresh synthesis. The night-blooming flowers reframed as anticipatory rather than reclusive offers a non-obvious emotional turn. However, the grief-into-understanding arc and artist-discovers-mother's-lesson template are familiar; the piece does not transform them through surprising lived detail or moral calculus. The mural change and sexton's technical revelation feel earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate; the lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning +0.2 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's decisions—setting brushes in the pavilion, walking to the cathedral daily, changing the mural—create key turns. She is present in all major beats. The final mural alteration (somber purples to golds) alters the work and her stance. Setup clear, middle development via cathedral visits, payoff in mural transformation. However, the choices are observational and cumulative rather than high-cost dilemmas; the turn is realization-driven, not a forked decision under pressure. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.5 (another artist could fill the role with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The postcards appear in paragraph one, are carried to the cathedral across winter, and are reframed as "maps of faith" in the resolution. Three beats (setup, cathedral comparison, thematic reprise). Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4 (same cathedral window, mother's voice). Slight swappability −0.4 (photographs or sketches could serve similarly). The postcards enable comparison but do not constrain a choice with visible cost; the reweighting is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears as the blue hour when Lyra enters the cathedral and again in the final line: "the dawning hush that lives in all things that endure the dark to witness the day." It frames the thematic question and charges the closure image. Setup (blue hour anchor) +0.5, closure linkage +1.2, lyric reprise +0.6. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice mid-scene; it operates as tonal concept. Swappability −0.5 ("twilight threshold" or "liminal quiet" could substitute). No middle beat development −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is established in paragraph one ("spoke in whispers, quietly driven by questions") and echoed in paragraph four ("worked with the quietly driven intensity"). It characterizes Lyra's approach but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Setup +0.5, closure-adjacent beat +0.5, label-only mentions −0.6. The trait is consistent but replaceable ("determined," "focused" would function identically). No moment where being quiet versus vocal alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears once in paragraph three: "She began to reckon with the years of misunderstanding." This is the pivot beat where Lyra's interpretation shifts. Setup via prior misreading +0.4, one beat (the turn) +0.4, closure linkage +0.8 (the reckoning enables the mural change). However, the action is cognitive, not embodied; the scene does not show Lyra wrestling with contradictory impulses. Swappability −0.5 ("confront," "recognize," "grasp" would serve). The mechanics of reckoning are summary rather than dramatized deliberation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled in paragraph two (cathedral window, etched glass), demonstrated in paragraph three (the sexton shows three laminated sheets with air pockets), and explicitly shapes Lyra's understanding: "the night-blooming flowers... were not facing upward... but eastward." This discovery drives the thematic turn and the mural's new design ("stems reaching through imagined glass layers"). Setup +0.7, two beats (sexton's explanation, Lyra's mural application) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6 (three-sheet laminate with air pockets is irreplaceable). The mechanics matter and are taught on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The amber pavilion is introduced in the opening line, houses Lyra's work across winter, and is the site of the final mural. The frost "blur[ring] the glass into something milky and remote" isolates her; melting snow in paragraph four signals seasonal shift and the mural's transformation. Setup +0.7, three beats (autumn setup, winter isolation, spring thaw/mural completion) +1.4, closure linkage +0.8. However, the pavilion does not constrain a choice tactically (she could work elsewhere). Cost connection weak −0.4; the space is atmospheric rather than limiting. Lyric reprise +0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in paragraph one ("last oak leaves fell"), paragraph two ("Winter arrived early"), and paragraph four ("When the last snow melted"). It tightens decisions: Lyra returns daily "across the melting of winter's last snow," and the mural changes "as the snow began to melt in earnest." Setup +0.6, two beats (winter's passage pressures the work, thaw enables completion) +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.6 (seasonal rhythm shapes the revelation's timing). However, the clock is loose—"across winter" does not create urgent day-by-day tension. Late first explicit mention of the phrase ("across the melting") −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation—"to understand the living flowers that opened only after dark"—is stated in paragraph one and drives her cathedral visits and mural revision. Setup +0.7, three beats (initial question, cathedral discovery, mural transformation) +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8 (the desire structures all choices). However, the motivation is told rather than shown in friction; we do not see Lyra torn between competing wants or facing a cost to pursue this understanding. Swappability −0.5 (another artistic or interpretive goal could serve). Summary-only in key moments −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" appears in paragraph four ("The umbral tenderness of the pavilion embraced her") and again in the final line ("to wait awake in the umbral tenderness of shadows"). The tone is consistent—soft, meditative, shadowed-yet-hopeful—across all beats. Setup (implicit in autumn amber light) +0.4, closure linkage +1.2, lyric reprise +0.6, modulates under pressure +0.5 (tone darkens in winter isolation, warms at thaw). However, the phrase itself is late (first explicit mention paragraph four, 60% through) and slightly ornamental. Late arrival −0.4, swappability −0.4 ("gentle shadow," "tender dark" could substitute). The tone charges the final image but does not constrain a choice.</comment>
