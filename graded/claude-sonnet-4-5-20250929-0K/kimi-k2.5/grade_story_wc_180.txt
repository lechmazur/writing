<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior is richly embodied through her professional expertise and sensory particulars (the quartz eyes seeing stress fractures), and her micro-choices—pruning water sprouts, securing the ribbon—advance the pressure. The grandmother and daughter remain ghostly presences whose interiority is asserted rather than dramatized, and the final shift toward acceptance feels slightly told ("She realized that bridging generational wisdom meant..."). The monologue to absent figures risks ventriloquism, but the embodied sap-and-dust finale and the ribbon-as-contract gesture earn the arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Mara, cathedral, five years post-breach) land early. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (orchard-in-ruin, ribbon-as-marker, forgotten tools) and a cadence shift at the ribbon moment tightens pressure, culminating in the seasonal-contract image that reweights commitment with conceptual cost (unwritten, deciduous promise vs. fixed contract). One meaningful deepening is present. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she accepts the ruin-as-garden and offers a seasonal return, foreclosing the restoration path). Cost is legible in the final image but leans interpretive rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid and particular (apple trees through transept, pear branches in Gothic arches), and the setting constrains Mara's choices: she uses only the forgotten tools, the limestone corbels dictate her pruning moves, and the tree hollow becomes the contract repository. Spatial choreography is clear (northern tower ascent, eastern arcade, belfry). Quartz eyes as micro-setting charge the ending with the rainbow-across-nave image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping the final image, but line-level descriptor density occasionally stalls momentum ("green prayers" reads ornamental).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to restore or accept transformation—signals early and tightens when Mara reaches for her professional kit but chooses the grandmother's tools instead, a micro-reversal that narrows options. The final seasonal-contract image reweights the breach with visible opportunity cost (she abandons fixed restoration). Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a density increase (orchard discovery → ribbon recovery → tool choice → seasonal vow) rather than causal narrowing, meeting the lens's requirement for one meaningful deepening. The cost is conceptual and relational (foreclosing the restoration path, opening the silence with her daughter) but not viscerally urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—growth requires shedding, honest vows are seasonal—emerges from the orchard-ruin particulars and Mara's tool choice rather than assertion. The ribbon-to-knife transfer offers a non-literal answer to the generational-wisdom question. The final image (quartz rainbows, ruin-becoming-garden) resonates without moralizing. One slip: "accidental wisdom came to her not as revelation but as recognition" edge toward thematic echo, and "some sacred things are saved not by being fixed, but by being allowed to change" in the final line risks sermonizing, though it's embedded in the image sequence and stays within the narrator's voice rather than a character articulation, mitigating the penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance; Mara's perceptual signature (quartz-eye stress-fracture vision, professional mender diction) is consistent and character-specific. The monologue to absent figures ("She spoke of how some breaches...") compresses dialogue into summary-tell, flattening immediacy when a single dramatized micro-exchange could have lifted it. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooms to sap-stained hands at twilight). One register hiccup: "deciduous vows were not lesser promises, but honest ones, acknowledging that growth required shedding" reads slightly elevated for mid-crisis interiority, though it's narratorial and not unearned.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Information density is high (each line advances setting, character, or theme), and rhythm modulates well (long descriptive opener, tighter action mid-passage, breath at twilight). Two loop artifacts: "breach" recurs five times (breach of contract, breaches could not be mended, breach into bounty) with synonym churn that dulls the closure callback; "sacred" appears three times in similar constructions. Template cadence in the tool-list paragraph (comma-stacked inventory) briefly stalls momentum. The final image ("a mender who had finally learned...") risks moralizing summary but stays tied to the quartz-rainbow visual, partially redeeming it. Deduct −0.6 for loops touching closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cathedral-as-accidental-orchard premise is specific and non-obvious; the quartz prosthetic eyes that see structural stress fractures add verifiable detail that shapes Mara's work. The seasonal-contract gesture transforms the fixed-restoration trope through Mara's professional lens and the deciduous-vow concept. The ribbon-to-grafting-knife transfer is a fresh synthesis. One risk: the grandmother-mother-daughter generational arc risks template familiarity, but the tools-as-inheritance angle and the seasonal-promise closure individualize it enough to avoid derivative penalties. Emotional specificity (sap-and-stone-dust hands, faded scarlet-to-rust ribbon) anchors universals in particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's choices—climbing the tower, selecting antique tools over professional kit, pruning water sprouts, untying and re-securing the ribbon, leaving the seasonal contract—create every turn. Present in setup, middle tool-choice reversal, and closure. The quartz eyes enable the stress-fracture observation that justifies her professional credibility and charge the rainbow ending. Decision drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in three beats: discovery (scarlet-to-rust, sixteen-year silence marker), physical reach, and closure transfer to the grafting knife. Its faded state tracks time's passage, and the final repositioning reweights it from argument-marker to seasonal promise. The middle beat (Mara reaching for it) is brief and observational; a tactile handling moment would have deepened integration. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Deciduous vows frame the central question (seasonal promises vs. fixed contracts) and the closure delivers on it with the unwritten seasonal return. The concept shapes Mara's acceptance that "some walls must crack to let in light" and her rejection of the preservation-society contract. Setup and payoff present; middle development is thematic reflection rather than a choice constrained by the concept's mechanics. Strong lyric reprise (early mention of daughter's changing vows → final seasonal contract) with cost (foreclosing restoration path).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" appears once as a label ("endearingly feisty as ever, muttering curses at the pigeons") without on-page cost or constraint. The pigeon-cursing gesture is brief color; no later choice hinges on feistiness. Setup-only; no middle or closure participation. Ornamental trait mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Persist" drives the arc: Mara persists where the preservation society failed, nature persisted to create the orchard, and the final seasonal vow is itself an act of persistence ("promising only that she would return when the leaves fell"). Present in setup (orchard persistence observation), middle (her decision to persist "not to fulfill the broken contract, but because the structure needed her"), and closure (returning promise). The action redefines options by shifting from fixed restoration to seasonal acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten bag contents (grandmother's grafting knife, resin, wire, letters) are discovered in the belfry, supply the means for stabilizing the eastern arcade, and the knife becomes the closure object tied with the ribbon. Setup, middle use (pruning and securing masonry), and closure reprise all present. The mechanics matter: using antique tools instead of the professional kit is the story's central material reversal. Specificity (iron grafting knife, pine resin, copper wire, cedar smell) is high and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The orchard-in-cathedral setting supplies every tactical constraint: corbels dictate pruning moves, the tree hollow holds the closure contract, the branches provide Mara's ascent path, and the transept collapse frames the breach-into-bounty theme. The setting is indispensable across setup (impossible sight that greets her), middle (pruning water sprouts to protect limestone), and closure (oldest tree as repository, nave as breathing ruin-garden). The final quartz-rainbow image charges the space with meaning. Micro-setting (quartz eyes, stone dust, sap) alters tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The five-year post-breach timeframe anchors backstory (bankruptcy, silence with daughter) and motivates Mara's return, but elapsed time within the single workday is vague ("By twilight...") and does not tighten decisions. The ribbon's scarlet-to-rust fade tracks years but does not create present urgency. Setup participation strong; no live clock in middle or closure. Time reweights meaning (generational span, seasonal cycles) but does not constrain on-page tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To bridge generational wisdom" is named early ("she had come to bridge generational wisdom, though she would have scoffed at the poetry"), drives the tool choice (grandmother's grafting knife vs. professional kit), and resolves in the closure image (new kind of contract, seasonal promise). The motivation is somewhat told ("She realized that bridging generational wisdom meant...") rather than fully dramatized through friction. Setup and closure present; middle friction is thin. Cost is visible (foreclosing fixed restoration) but interpretive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Accidental-wisdom tone is signaled early ("would have scoffed at the poetry"), modulates through the work sequence (practical pruning, muttered curses, professional precision), and charges the closure ("accidental wisdom came...as recognition"). The tone coheres through pressure: professional pragmatism softens into acceptance without sentimentality. The final line ("a mender who had finally learned...") edges toward overt wisdom-claim but stays grounded in the quartz-rainbow image, keeping the tone wry rather than preachy. Tone reweights the closure with conceptual cost.</comment>
