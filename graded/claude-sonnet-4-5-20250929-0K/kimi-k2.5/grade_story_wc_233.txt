<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's trajectory from disbelieving queen to "seamstress of the torn heavens" shows arc structure, but her choices feel narrated rather than dramatized—she "softly commands" the mountain and later the pool without visible internal conflict or cost in those moments. Mara's sudden presence introduces a relationship dimension, yet their shared history ("childhood they had shared before crowns intervened") arrives via summary rather than shaping an on-page choice. The abdication is declared but not enacted through a concrete forfeiture that closes a door; the final gesture of trailing fingers through liquid light reads more as symbolic completion than a decision with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive late: "Elara" is named in line three, but her spatial position and the grotto's relationship to her kingdom remain vague until mid-story. The closure unit—Elara reaching into the pool to heal the starlight—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; we're told she has "renounced earthly power," yet the crown was already left in ashes and no on-page action forecloses a return. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (dreams → climb → grotto → cosmic wound → fireflies → realization), but the final tightening ("courage" replacing crown) restates rather than reweights prior pressure. Orientation debt (−0.4) and modest cost legibility prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto with bioluminescent walls and the breathing pool anchors the climactic sequence, and the fireflies provide a charged sensory contrast ("impossibly golden against the bleeding starlight"). Spatial choreography is mostly clear—base of ridge, above cloud line, shelf, interior—but the mountain's responsiveness to Elara's commands ("yield," "part") introduces a magical convenience that isn't grounded in prior world rules. The grotto's transformation from "lacy menace" to "workshop of creation" reweights the space at closure, meeting the micro-setting criterion for the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery of recurring dreams—is signaled early and drives the climb. Yet the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than choice-driven: Elara ascends, finds Mara, and receives exposition ("The dreams were never yours alone") that delivers answers rather than forcing a high-cost decision. The final act (trailing fingers through the pool) is presented as a successful command with no visible friction or failed attempt; the starlight "stopped bleeding" on cue. One meaningful tightening occurs (realization that dreams are invitations), but the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: throne of bones, bleeding starlight, fireflies as bridge between worlds. The abdication-to-purpose arc avoids overt moralizing, and the final image—"queens became weavers and gods learned to bleed"—offers a resonant reweighting of power and sacrifice. However, "threads of willing sacrifice" and "raw material of new constellations" edge toward abstraction, and the handmaiden's sudden appearance feels like a thematic convenience (shared prophecy, shared childhood) rather than an organically developed relationship. The piece earns credit for synthesizing cosmic stakes with personal renunciation without a thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds throughout, filtered through Elara's perspective. Voice texture is consistent—elevated, lyric register with embedded metaphor ("swallowed stone," "lacy menace")—but the prose occasionally drifts into declarative summary ("In that shared breath, the mystery unraveled itself") that abstracts what could be shown. Mara's dialogue ("You came," "The dreams were never yours alone") feels functional rather than character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable, though the final paragraph's cosmic overview ("the summer that would never end") pulls back from Elara's immediate experience without clear motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "cobwebs of silver dread," "lacy menace of mineral deposits threading through the rock like veins in an elderly hand poised to strangle," "the peculiar scent of ending things." Mixed metaphors (the grotto "breathing warmth" while also pulsing with "lacy menace") muddle clarity. Sentence stems repeat ("The dreams were," "The ember grotto was," "The water mirrored"). The closing paragraph runs three compound-complex sentences that stack dependent clauses without breathing room, and key turns are told rather than enacted: "the mystery unraveled itself, threads of dream logic weaving into waking understanding" summarizes rather than dramatizes the realization. Deductions: overwriting density (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.2), template cadence (−0.4), total −1.2 routed here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cosmic wound, abdication, and fireflies as threshold offers a non-obvious angle on the reluctant-monarch trope. Yet the handmaiden's sudden appearance and shared prophecy feels convenient, and the resolution—touching the pool to heal the stars—echoes familiar chosen-one mechanics without a fresh complication. The "queens became weavers" image is memorable, but the piece hedges risk by granting Elara success without cost or failure. Derivative Premise adjustment (−0.5): the abdication-to-cosmic-purpose frame maps closely to established templates; partial transformation through the firefly motif restores some ground.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the climb (setup ✓) and the final gesture of commanding the pool (closure ✓), but her key "decision" to abdicate is narrated as already complete ("her crown left deliberately in the ashes") before the story opens. Development beat: she commands the mountain and mist, which oblige without friction—observation rather than contested choice. The final act (trailing fingers, commanding chaos to heal) succeeds on first attempt with no visible cost tied to her queenship. Two gates plus a causal gesture, but the specificity of "disenchanted queen" (versus "disenchanted ruler" or "reluctant leader") is marginal. 5.8 reflects functional presence across setup and closure with modest development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears at midpoint (setup gate missed), but it anchors two beats: Elara enters and perceives the bioluminescent walls and breathing pool (development ✓), and the space transforms into "workshop of creation" at closure (payoff ✓). The grotto's "breathing warmth" and the pool's cosmic display pressure her understanding, and the final transformation reweights the location from destination to threshold. Two gates plus causal involvement and closure linkage earn 7+. Swappability check: another mystical cave could serve similar function with edits, capping ceiling. 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is introduced mid-story in the pool's reflection (setup late, −0.3), dominates the grotto sequence as the visual problem Elara must address (development ✓), and the story closes with her stopping the bleed and threading new patterns (closure ✓). The concept shapes her final action—trailing fingers to "settle, weave, heal"—and its resolution is the story's climax. Three gates plus closure linkage and causal pressure. Cost connection: the "willing sacrifice" is told rather than shown, and "bleeding starlight" could be replaced with "unraveling stars" or "wounded cosmos" with minor rewording (modest irreplaceability, −0.4). 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" is demonstrated twice: Elara murmurs commands to the mountain ("yield," "part"), which oblige (development beat ✓), and later commands the pool's chaos to heal (closure beat ✓). Setup present via the astrologers' "trembling voices" establishing her residual authority. However, the trait enables without cost—the mountain and starlight comply on cue with no resistance or tradeoff. The specificity of "softly" (versus "firmly" or "quietly") is slight. Two gates plus closure participation, but label-only cost and high swappability. 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The climb is signaled early ("She stood now at the base of the ridge"), occupies a full beat with concrete obstacles ("hands finding purchase in the chill stone," wind, roots, mist), and delivers her to the grotto where all subsequent action unfolds (setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓ via arrival enabling closure). Removing the climb breaks the story's geography and the movement from forsaken throne to cosmic threshold. The action is irreplaceable: no other single move bridges the two locations. Three gates, strong causal pressure, closure linkage. 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The shared exhale and fireflies appear only in the final third (late, −0.5). Setup absent. Development: the fireflies prompt the realization that reweights the dreams ("threads of dream logic weaving into waking understanding"), serving as catalyst (development ✓). Closure: the fireflies "bridging the gap between earth and the wounded sky" anchor the thematic image and the moment of understanding (payoff ✓). Two gates. The mechanics (exhale + fireflies → understanding) are shown but not prepared earlier. Specificity: "first fireflies of summer" is evocative but could be replaced with another liminal natural event (dawn light, falling star) with modest rewording (−0.4 swappability). 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto is introduced at midpoint (setup late, −0.3), but it dominates the second half: Elara enters and perceives its bioluminescence and the breathing pool (development ✓), and the final transformation into "workshop of creation" charges the closure image (payoff ✓). The setting supplies the pool that enables Elara's final action and the spatial intimacy for the Mara reunion. Two gates plus closure linkage and modest causal pressure (the grotto's warmth and atmosphere guide her deeper). Irreplaceability: another mystical high-altitude cave could serve similar function, but "cobalt" and "above clouds" add charged specificity. 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the final warning" frames the story's urgency (setup ✓) and connects to "three nights prior" when Mara vanished, establishing a rough timeline. However, the timeframe does not tighten choices or tactics on the page—Elara's climb and the grotto encounter unfold without a live clock or competing deadline. Development and payoff gates missing. The warning is mentioned but not revisited or reweighted at closure. Functional framing, but the temporal constraint is declared rather than felt. 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to unravel recurring dreams is signaled immediately ("though the dreams had already begun to etch themselves behind her eyes") and detailed in the second sentence ("thirteen nights, each one weaving cobwebs of silver dread") (setup ✓). Development: the climb is driven by this desire, and Mara's revelation ("The dreams were never yours alone") reframes the mystery (development ✓). Closure: the realization that "dreams were not warnings…but invitations to ascend" completes the mystery's unraveling (payoff ✓). Three gates, causal pressure. Friction between want and cost is modest—Elara's renunciation of the crown is narrated as already complete, so the dream-quest does not force a new sacrifice on the page (−0.3 for minimal on-page cost). 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" is invoked explicitly for the bioluminescent mineral deposits and modulates through "bruised violet" atmosphere, the pool's "terrible drips," and the grotto's final transformation into something "delicate and dangerous and finally understood." The tone is coherent across turns and charges the final image by integrating menace with creation. However, "lacy menace" as a specific phrase appears once and is partly ornamental; the menace is more asserted than dramatized through hostile action or cost. Two beats (grotto entry, closure transformation) plus closure linkage. Irreplaceability modest: "eerie beauty" or "threatening grace" could substitute with minor edits (−0.4). 6.6.</comment>
