<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's archival work and decision to give the valve to the woman show consistent motivation, and his reactively visionary nature is embodied through touch-triggered impressions. The internal experience is specific (mapping empty spaces, navigating absences), but the final realization about loss becoming legible feels abstractly stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses. The woman's transformation is clean, but Kael's arc lacks genuine friction—his insights arrive smoothly without visible cost or resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates impressions and fragments toward the closing insight that "meaning does not arrive whole; it must be assembled." The valve shifts from failed signal to connection symbol, creating a legible before/after with felt emotional cost in the woman's transformation. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One escalation via the valve handoff deepens the archival mission; the closure reweights prior material through the image of the valve gleaming in candlelight. Cost is visible in the woman's grief-to-acceptance arc, though Kael's own cost remains implied rather than dramatically foregrounded.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ivory harbor's post-rain textures (waterlogged planks, wet luminescence, pale stones like bones) are vivid and atmospheric. The valve—tarnished green, humming with residual purpose—functions as micro-setting that constrains Kael's archival choice and charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clear (pier, customs house, archive tower), and the setting reflects Kael's focus on absence and reconstruction. However, the environment is more backdrop than active pressure; it does not significantly narrow his options or alter his tactics during the core scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to compile fragments into meaning and resist collective forgetting. The woman's arrival introduces one meaningful complication—Kael must choose whether to keep the valve or return it—and his decision to give it away reweights his archival mission from preservation to connection. The tightening is modest but legible: the valve moves from artifact to relational anchor. Cost is visible in the woman's grief acknowledgment ("It heartens me to know he tried"), though Kael's own price—letting go of a key piece—could be sharpened on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: archives as resistance, navigated absences becoming legible through mapping rather than filling, and meaning assembled via patience. The valve's shift from failed signal to enduring connection is a non-literal answer to the central question. The final image—valve gleaming in candlelight—resonates without moralizing. One slip: "loss became legible" and the final paragraph's "meaning does not arrive whole" veer toward thematic summary rather than trusting the dramatized valve exchange to carry the insight alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices "absences," "empty spaces," "invisible coastlines." Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the vision sequence. The woman's dialect ("cracking like dried seaweed") is vivid but not distinct from Kael's narration; her brief speech does not establish a separate voice. Some filter verbs ("he realized," "he understood") are acceptable given the reflective register, but "Kael realized that to navigate absences was not to fill them" shifts into expository summary rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and many lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "pale stones resembling bones" anchors setting and theme). However, paraphrase loops appear: "compile fragments into meaning" recurs verbatim across beats without reweighting; "staggered intervals" is repeated mechanically; "navigated absences" becomes a stock phrase. The final paragraph stacks abstract concepts ("enduring connection," "loss became legible," "meaning does not arrive whole") that summarize rather than propel. Template cadence in the vision sequence ("He saw the moment… the valve sticking, the note dying") flattens momentum. These artifacts touch but do not obscure the closure, so penalties remain within-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ocean-spray archivist role and the visionary touch-response offer fresh angles on post-exile recovery. The valve as a failed retreat signal that becomes a symbol of enduring connection is a specific synthesis. However, the arc—returning exile finds object, gives it to grieving survivor, both find meaning—follows a familiar template of rediscovered artifacts healing trauma. The piece does not transform the premise through surprising moral calculus or non-obvious tactics; the woman's straightening shoulders and Kael's realization arrive predictably. Specificity in setting and the archival frame provide texture but not structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael (ocean-spray archivist) is present throughout and his choice to give the valve to the woman is the story's key turn. His archival work frames the opening and closing, and his visionary response drives the middle beat. Removing the archivist role would collapse the motivation and method. Causal pressure is clear; closure linkage is strong (he returns to records with the valve's story integrated). However, the character is more observer than agent in the climactic exchange—the woman's transformation does most of the thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in three beats: discovery (half-buried, tarnished), vision (Kael sees its failed note), and transfer (pressed into the woman's hands, later worn on a cord, gleaming in candlelight). Its properties matter: the stuck valve caused the retreat signal to fail, and that failure becomes the story's emotional hinge. The valve's return with reweighted meaning (from failed signal to connection) charges the ending. Removing this exact object would break the closure; no generic relic could carry the same weight. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" is foregrounded early (Kael charts empty spaces, trails fingers along missing ropes, voices silenced by time) and recurs at closure ("to navigate absences was not to fill them, but to map their contours"). It shapes his archival method and the thematic insight. However, it functions more as theme than as a constraint on tactics—Kael never faces a choice between filling an absence versus mapping it; the concept describes his work rather than pressuring it. The reweighting at the end is conceptual rather than causal, placing this in mid-band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is signaled early (touch triggers impressions) and dramatized in the valve vision sequence (he sees the moment the herald tried to sound retreat). The trait enables the key beat—without the vision, Kael would not know the valve's story to share with the woman. However, there is no visible cost or constraint: the visions arrive smoothly, with no indication of drain, disorientation, or tradeoff. The trait is functional but not pressured; removing it would require rewriting the vision beat, but the vision itself could be externalized (e.g., the woman tells him) with minor structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hearten" appears twice: Kael chooses words "that might hearten her broken spirit," and the woman later says "It heartens me to know he tried." The action drives the woman's transformation (shoulders straighten, step lighter) and charges the closure. However, "hearten" is more emotional register than distinct physical action; swapping it for "comfort" or "console" would not alter the scene's mechanics. The verb matters thematically (matching the herald's call), but the causal role is the giving of the valve, not the specific word choice. Lyric resonance (early seed, final reprise) and thematic linkage lift this into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through staggered intervals" recurs four times, marking Kael's temporal experience (moments of clarity punctuated by displacement, morning becoming afternoon, moving between piers, community reassembling). It is signaled early and appears at closure, but the mechanics never constrain a choice—Kael's work proceeds regardless of the intervals. The phrase reads as descriptive texture rather than method that shapes attempts. Removing it would not alter the plot; it is a label for his perceptual state, not a tactic. Present across beats but ornamental, fitting the 3–5 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "ivory harbor after rain" anchors who/where/when in the opening line and recurs at dusk ("violet hues") and night. The wet planks, driftwood, and reclaimed archive tower provide spatial coherence. The harbor is where the woman finds Kael, enabling the valve exchange, and the final scene in the archive tower houses the gleaming valve. However, the setting does not pressure Kael's choices—he could perform the same archival work elsewhere. The rain's aftermath adds atmosphere but no constraint. Setup and closure presence are strong; middle development (the setting altering tactics) is weak, placing this in the 5–6 band with a lyric-resonance bump.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" frames the timeframe in the opening paragraph (ended three days prior) and recurs in the final reflection ("After the exile ends, meaning does not arrive whole"). The temporal anchor is clear, but the three-day gap does not tighten decisions—Kael could be three days or three weeks post-exile with no change to stakes or tactics. The timeframe provides context but no urgency or cost. Setup is present; development and closure participation are thematic rather than causal. Fits the 5–6 band for functional but replaceable presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" is Kael's stated motivation, repeated verbatim across beats (opening, midpoint, closure). It drives his archival work and the decision to organize findings in the tower. The woman's arrival complicates this—Kael must choose whether the valve's meaning is archival or relational, and he chooses the latter. The motivation is dramatized in the handoff and the final tower scene. However, friction is minimal; Kael never hesitates or doubts, and the cost of giving away a key fragment is not explored. The motivation is consistent and shapes two beats but lacks internal conflict, placing this in the 6–7 band.</comment>
