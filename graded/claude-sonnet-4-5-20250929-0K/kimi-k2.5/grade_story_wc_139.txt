<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's mathematical mindset is established early and her internal conflict between honesty and deception shows promise, but her interior voice frequently slips into abstract philosophizing ("cosmic inversion," "algebraic proofs as metaphor") rather than embodied contradiction. The father remains entirely off-stage except as backstory, weakening the relational crucible. Key motivations—why she would drug a judge for a con-artist father—feel under-dramatized; the choice arrives without sufficient on-page struggle between her rigid morality and familial loyalty.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece lacks a legible closure unit with visible cost. Maya's smile and calculation at the end promise future action but do not constitute a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—no path is foreclosed, no option reweighted on the page. The orientation test is violated: we don't learn who Maya is, where precisely she stands, or her immediate situation until deep into the text. Causality is murky: how did she gain access to the prep room, why tonight specifically, and how does "waiting actively" for a guard seven minutes early constitute a breach opportunity? The drive lens reads as intended-causal but collapses into summary of future intent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is vividly rendered with specific sensory anchors—cobalt glass, chemical tanks, industrial refrigeration hum, casket storage. Spatial choreography is mostly clear. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a meaningful way; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure. The 2:17 AM guard rotation and server room remain abstract, lacking the micro-detail that would make the breach tactically legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—securing her father's asylum—is signaled, but no meaningful tightening or on-page choice occurs. Maya observes, waits, and plans, but never faces a live decision that narrows options or incurs visible cost. The story ends on the threshold of action ("the precise moment to begin") rather than a choice that alters the present. Escalation is entirely prospective: she *will* add drops to tea, she *will* breach the server room. Coincidence (guard arriving seven minutes early) is framed as opportunity without dramatized risk or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The thematic question—redemption versus complicity, justice as transaction—is clearly articulated but remains abstract and tell-heavy. Key lines like "how much of a monster's redemption was worth a nation's most dangerous secrets?" and "radical honesty required its own sophisticated forms of deception" read as thesis statements rather than emergent insight. The final image of Maya smiling in chemical glow gestures toward "deathly vitality" but does not reweigh prior material with earned resonance. No concrete particular on the page answers the thematic question; the mathematics of fair trade is posed but not solved or refused with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The voice attempts a literary register—"cosmic inversion," "algebraic proofs," "deathly vitality"—but diction drifts into abstraction under pressure rather than tightening to Maya's mathematical particularity. Psychic distance wobbles: we get close interiority ("her mathematically honest mind") yet also omniscient framing ("the formula eluded her still"). Filter verbs proliferate without voice motivation. No dialogue appears, so character distinction through speech is untested. The prose reads competent but not voice-specific; another character could narrate these beats with minimal adjustment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Significant loop and scaffold issues undermine momentum. "Deathly vitality" appears three times as a thematic label without earned variation. Paraphrase loops: "waiting actively" is restated across multiple paragraphs; the ink pot's effects are described, then re-described. Sentence stems repeat: "She had always been," "She understood that," "Maya recognized." The final third stacks conceptual claims—"radical honesty required," "waiting actively required," "the mathematics of a fair trade demanded"—in place of scene pressure. Register drifts into philosophical abstraction ("liquefied rigid thinking," "absolutism dissolving like sugar") that clashes with the prep-room immediacy. Template cadence is evident in the closing sequence of declarative will-statements.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—honest daughter of con artist using stolen compliance drug to secure his asylum—offers a fresh moral calculus, and the funeral home prep room as staging ground is specific. However, the magical ink compound that "literally liquefies rigid thinking" strains credulity and feels convenience-plotted; it solves the problem it did not help create. The framework of "mathematics of a fair trade" and repeated "deathly vitality" read as prompt-label decoration rather than organic discovery. Emotional and tactical beats echo familiar asylum-thriller templates without transformation through lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya (con artist's honest child) is present throughout and her internal contradiction is stated early. However, her choices do not create key turns on the page—she observes, calculates, and defers action to an off-page future. The role is functional but largely observational; setup and development gates are met, but closure participation is missing because no decision alters present options. Swappable with "reluctant accomplice" or similar archetype with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot appears in the opening beat (setup), is handled and examined mid-story (development: "dipped a sterile needle"), and is carried to the server room at the end (payoff). It enables the drugging tactic and carries symbolic weight (her father's theft, the regime's secret). However, its properties—liquefying rigid thinking—feel ornamental and convenience-plotted rather than causally pressured. Specificity is high (cobalt glass, iron-gall residue), but the object does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it is a tool awaiting future use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Political asylum is the explicit stake driving Maya's plan and is seeded early. It shapes her father's situation and her objective. However, the asylum process itself remains abstract—referenced but not dramatized. The piece does not engage asylum procedure, interview dynamics, or legal constraints in a way that alters Maya's tactics on the page. Present in setup and framing but underdeveloped in middle pressure and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is described in detail (the chemical compound, its effect on bureaucrats) but never demonstrated on the page. We are told it will dissolve the judge's dogmatism, but no on-page action tests or costs this trait. It is label-only: setup present, closure participation promised but not enacted. Swappable with any compliance drug or persuasion mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Breach" is named in the text ("breach the asylum processing center's server room") and Maya moves toward it in the final beat, but the action does not occur on the page. The story ends on the threshold—"the precise moment to begin"—so the breach itself is prospective. Setup is present (the plan is stated), but development and payoff are absent. No turn traces to this action because it has not yet happened.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is seeded early, repeated as a method, and the guard's early arrival is framed as the fruit of patient observation. The concept is thematically charged ("radical honesty required…waiting actively required a vitality"). However, the mechanics are vague—what constitutes active waiting versus passive?—and the method does not visibly shape attempts or constrain choices with cost. It reads more as thematic label than tactical pressure. Setup and thematic presence earn mid-band, but functional swappability and lack of closure mechanics prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is vividly described (embalming table, chemical tanks, refrigeration hum, casket storage) and provides the physical location for Maya's wait and her father's hiding. Setup is strong, and the setting supplies the "deathly vitality" tone. However, the room does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Maya could execute the same plan from any secure location. The prep room enriches atmosphere but does not pressure tactics. Specificity without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To find the mathematics of a fair trade" is stated explicitly and repeated, driving Maya's internal questioning about her father's redemption versus prosecution. The motivation is seeded early and runs through her reflections. However, it is largely told rather than dramatized—she calculates, she wonders, but does not face an on-page choice that tests what price she will accept. The desire shapes framing but not embodied friction or a closure turn with visible cost. Thematic presence without decisive agency.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" appears three times as a phrase and is supported by the prep-room setting (death work, preservation chemicals, humming life). The tone is coherent in concept but applied unevenly—some beats lean lyric and abstract, others tactical and procedural. It does not modulate meaningfully with pressure or charge the final image in a way that reweights the stake. The tone reads more as atmospheric label than integrated emotional current. Present and thematically consistent, but static and ornamental rather than dynamically charged.</comment>
