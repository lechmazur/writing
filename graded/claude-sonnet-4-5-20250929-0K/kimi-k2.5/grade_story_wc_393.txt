<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority remains consistent—guilt-driven resolve anchored in seventeen years of self-doubt—and his final choice (public vindication) traces cleanly from early regret. However, his emotional arc relies heavily on summary and reflection rather than embodied contradiction; the phrase "secretly doubted could be redeemed" leans diagnostic, and the repairman remains a functional prop without pressure or status friction. The chaplain's micro-choices (unwrapping the heart, placing his palm as oath) signal commitment, but the peak beat delivers epiphany via convenient light rather than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Causal. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (chaplain, shop, afternoon storm). The closure—Elias discovering the serial number via sudden light, committing to public action—lands on the page with visible cost (seventeen years of complicity now transformed into a public obligation). The light-through-clouds mechanism feels coincidental rather than earned by prior causality, softening the turn's inevitability. One meaningful tightening occurs (storm → light → revelation → oath), sufficient for this length, though the repairman's observation ("serial number") arrives conveniently late without prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shop is anchored early (antique repair, high windows, counter) and the storm pressures the atmosphere throughout. The clockwork heart—handled twice, unwrapped and examined—constrains the central choice by revealing the serial number. Sensory detail is selective (ozone, rain-soaked hush, golden light) and filtered through Elias's guilt-laden attention. However, the shop itself remains generic beyond "high windows" and "counter"; no tool, spatial constraint, or micro-setting detail alters tactics or charges the final image beyond the convenient shaft of light.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clearing Marcus's name—signals early and drives Elias's visit. The storm-to-light sequence tightens pressure once, revealing the serial number and forcing the chaplain's oath. However, escalation relies on coincidence (light breaking at the precise moment) rather than protagonist agency; Elias's choices (unwrapping the heart, listening to the repairman) are passive until the final vow. The three-week repair timeline promises future cost but does not constrain the present beat. One meaningful turn with felt consequence meets baseline, but the protagonist's agency in the discovery itself is minimal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—second opinions as courage to re-examine settled judgments—emerges from Elias's arc and the clockwork metaphor. The final image (stepping into ozone and possibility) reweights his guilt without explicit moralizing. However, lines like "redemption was mechanical, requiring the right pressure at the precise moment of release" and "second opinions were not merely about doubt, but about the courage to re-examine" veer into thematic echo, articulating the premise rather than embodying it. The music-box motif (frozen heart, restored melody) is purposeful but slightly too neat, lacking ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is largely consistent (penitentiary, slate gray, vibrant hush), though phrases like "aptly deliberate" and "vibrant hush" recur as mannered tics. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven ("I need a second opinion," "How long?"), carrying subtext of regret and urgency. The repairman's lines are distinct in craft-specific idiom ("Comtoise movement," "mainspring"), but his internal stance remains opaque. The prose modulates well under emotional pressure (short sentences at the oath moment), and free indirect style is clean. One flaw: "aptly deliberate" appears twice, once as narrator commentary and once attributed to the repairman, blurring voice slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (long reflective sentences, short oath moment). Information density is high in the discovery beat ("serial number matching… not the replica"). However, the piece accumulates text artifacts: "vibrant hush" recurs three times without pattern payoff; "aptly deliberate" appears twice in similar phrasing; "the clockwork heart" is repeated across adjacent paragraphs without reweighting. Figurative language clusters densely ("dust motes," "violet desperation," "hammered notes") without coherent pattern. The phrase "embodying the vibrant hush" in the opening paragraph mixes metaphor (voice cannot embody hush). Sentence stems repeat ("He had come," "He would carry," "He would not rush"). Apply −1.0 cumulative for loop and artifact spread.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—chaplain discovers posthumous innocence via a music box—is familiar (wrongful execution + belated evidence). Transformation is limited: the serial-number revelation and light-through-clouds mechanism are stock detective and spiritual-epiphany beats. The "second opinion" frame is conceptually tidy but does not yield a non-obvious moral calculus or lived specificity that distinguishes this execution from template. The repairman's craft detail (Comtoise movement, mainspring) adds texture but remains ornamental. The storm-to-light progression is visually clear but metaphorically expected. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the arc follows a predictable guilt-to-redemption path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias (penitentiary chaplain) drives the visit, unwrapping, listening, and taking the oath—three distinct beats. His decision to "force the administration to confront the evidence" alters tactics (public vindication vs. private regret). Closure depends on his vow. Early signal (opening line) and closure participation qualify all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate; the discovery itself is handed to him by light and the repairman's observation rather than his own investigative choice. Score: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure (moderate agency) +0.6, swappability (any seeker of truth could fill the role with minor edits) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0, round down to 6.0. Adjustment for strong closure participation +0.8 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The clockwork heart appears in five beats: carried in, unwrapped, examined (mainspring inscription), discovered (serial number via light), and remains as the repairman's project. It enables the central revelation (serial number) and its "frozen gears" metaphor charges Elias's guilt. Early signal (first paragraph), middle development (inscription discovery), closure participation (revelation scene). Causal pressure: the object's specific marking drives the turn. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (serial number is unique) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0, round to 8.0. Adjustment for strong irreplaceability +0.2 = 8.2, round down to 8.2. Final: 7.2 after reconsidering that the heart is mostly static description between beats; it does not evolve in state or use beyond being examined. Adjust to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Second opinions" frames the opening line ("I need a second opinion") and recurs thematically ("second opinions were not merely about doubt"). It shapes Elias's visit (seeking validation) and his resolution (forcing re-examination). However, the concept functions more as theme than on-page stakes-driver; the repairman provides information, not a competing opinion that Elias must weigh. No middle choice directly tests competing judgments. Score: early signal +0.5, one beat (opening) +0.4, closure participation (thematic echo in reflection) +0.4, thematic rather than tactical role −0.6, swappability (could be "expert consultation" with minor edits) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.2 = 3.2, round to 3.2. Lyric-resonance allowance (opening → thematic return) +2.6 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Aptly deliberate" appears twice: once describing the repairman's lens adjustment, once in Elias's internal vow ("would be aptly deliberate in his documentation"). It functions as label-only description without constraining on-page action or creating visible cost. No middle development beat; it does not enable or prevent a choice. Score: late first use (repairman's gesture, ~15% mark) −0.3, ornamental (describes manner without consequence) −0.8, label-only −0.3, no closure participation (mentioned in reflection, not action) −0.6. Base 3.0 − 2.0 = 1.0, round to 1.0. Adjusting for two mentions across beats +0.4, thematic consistency +0.3 = 1.7. Reconsidering: the phrase does recur and ties to Elias's methodology, allowing mid-band. Final: 4.1 after crediting thematic consistency and dual mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Deserve" appears in Elias's admission ("The man who owned this deserved more than I gave him") and closing reflection ("would deserve the forgiveness he sought"). It motivates the visit and anchors his vow, shaping the dominant stake (earning moral standing via action). Early signal, closure participation. However, the action is largely internal and reflected rather than dramatized in choice; Elias does not face a on-page trade-off testing whether he will pursue public vindication at personal cost. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats (admission, closing reflection) +0.9, motivational anchor (drives visit and vow) +0.8, closure linkage +0.8, swappability (could be "owe" or "failed" with minor edits) −0.6, summary-only (key involvement recounted, not tested) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, round to 4.9. Lyric reprise allowance +1.4 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Light breaks through storm clouds" is signaled early (storm intensifies, presses windows), recurs as atmospheric pressure (slate gray, violet desperation), and delivers the revelation ("Light broke through the storm clouds… illuminating the brass heart with sudden, golden clarity"). The method is mechanical: light enables visibility of the serial number. Setup and closure participation are clear, but no middle development beat uses light as a constraint or tactic. Score: early signal (storm throughout) +0.6, closure participation (light reveals number) +1.4, causal pressure (light enables discovery) +0.8, specificity (golden clarity at exact moment) +0.4, coincidental timing (light arrives conveniently, not earned by protagonist action) −0.8. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, round to 5.4. Adjustment for strong closure linkage +1.5 = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The antique music box repair shop anchors setting from the opening line and supplies the repairman's expertise (Comtoise identification, mainspring examination). It provides the counter and high windows for the light-revelation. Early signal, closure participation. However, the shop's specific resources (tools, spatial layout, inventory) do not constrain Elias's choices or alter tactics; it functions as a neutral container for the conversation. Score: early signal +0.7, closure participation (light through high windows) +0.9, one beat (examination) +0.4, postcard description (shop details remain generic) −0.7, no tactical constraint −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.8 = 3.8, round to 3.8. Adjustment for micro-setting (counter, windows) that charges final image +1.9 = 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Calm before realization" describes the discovery moment ("that suspended breath where ignorance and understanding balance perfectly"). It appears once, late (~60% mark), as metaphorical framing rather than a timed stake. No clock pressure; the three-week repair timeline is mentioned but does not tighten present decisions. Score: late first appearance (final third) −0.8, ornamental (metaphorical description, not a ticking constraint) −0.9, no closure participation (does not shape the oath or vow) −0.6, one mention only −0.4. Base 3.0 − 2.7 = 0.3, round to 0.3. Adjustment for lyric specificity (the phrase does crystallize the discovery beat) +4.3 = 4.6, capped by missing setup and development gates at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To turn an apology into action" is voiced by Elias ("He had come to turn an apology into action") and drives the visit, the listening, and the final oath. Early signal, closure participation. The motivation is dramatized in his physical choices (unwrapping, placing palm) and internal friction (guilt vs. resolve). Score: early signal +0.7, two beats (arrival, oath) +0.9, causal pressure (drives visit and vow) +1.0, closure linkage (oath is the action) +1.1, friction (guilt vs. public obligation) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" recurs three times (opening, repairman's words, softening rain) as tonal anchor. It modulates with the storm (pressing, intensifying, softening) and charges the final image (ozone and possibility). Early signal, closure participation. However, the phrase itself is repeated identically without evolving meaning, and the tone remains static (solemn reflection) across pressure beats; no tonal shift at the discovery moment. Score: early signal +0.6, three mentions +1.4, closure participation (final paragraph) +0.9, modulation (storm arc) +0.5, static repetition without reweighting −0.8, ornamental recurrence −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.2 = 5.2, round to 5.2. Adjustment for coherent atmospheric pressure +0.1 = 5.3.</comment>
