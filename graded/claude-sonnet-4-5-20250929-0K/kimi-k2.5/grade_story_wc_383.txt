<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (archiving dangerous memories) is established, but her interior life is dominated by abstract philosophical statements rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The transformation from skeptic to someone who "understood now that to translate isolation into independence required not the rejection of others' burdens" arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized micro-choices that foreclose options. The "ghostly resolve" and "charmed skeptic" remain largely labels; her interiority reads as elevated meditation on themes rather than character-particular perception. No visible cost at closure that changes her circumstances or forecloses a path—she walks toward morning light with philosophical understanding but no dramatized sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear task (archive the memory before dawn) and follows it through to completion in a continuous scene. However, the closure unit—Elara's philosophical realization about carrying others' burdens—lacks visible cost; she completes the task successfully and gains insight without forfeiting anything on the page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (building through imagery and reflection toward a thematic reconfiguration), but the final moment reconfigures understanding through exposition rather than image or action that reweights prior material with undeniable pressure. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when by first sentence). The escalation is mechanical (work faster as dawn approaches) rather than driven by choices that narrow options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (silver moss, flowers "heavy as tapestries," bioluminescence) and the environment actively participates in the archiving ritual. The garden's response to Elara's song and its absorption of the memory into roots provide purposeful interaction. The twilight-to-dawn progression tracks clearly and creates urgency. The setting charges the final image (flowers turned silver-white, glowing) and constrains the action through the time limit, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shapes choice or charges closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (archive the memory before dawn) is signaled early but escalation is purely temporal—the clock runs down—rather than driven by protagonist choices that narrow options or raise cost. The memory "fights back" by showing visions, but this complication doesn't alter Elara's tactics or force a trade-off; she simply "worked faster." No meaningful reversal or deepening choice that forecloses a path. The resolution is successful completion without visible sacrifice; she finishes the task, gains insight, and walks free. Cost is asserted thematically (isolation transformed) but not dramatized as a forfeiture or difficult choice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (isolation versus connection, independence versus imprisonment) is stated explicitly throughout rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The shell "whispered that independence without connection was merely another form of imprisonment" exemplifies direct thematic assertion. The final paragraph delivers overt philosophical summary: "She understood now that to translate isolation into independence required not the rejection of others' burdens..." This is thematic echo and moralizing rather than resonance earned through image and action. The velvet garden as sanctuary for transformed sorrow offers some lyric potential but is undercut by explanatory framing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries an elevated, baroque register ("tragically radiant," "spectral geometries," "ghostly resolve") that remains consistent but edges toward purple in peak moments with stacked modifiers and abstract diction. The perceptual signature is ornate and philosophical rather than character-particular; Elara perceives in polished metaphors even under pressure. Free indirect style is clean. The voice modulates appropriately from description to reflection but lacks the compression or syntactic shift that would mark genuine crisis pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Significant overwriting throughout: "flowers heavy as tapestries bowed under their own perfume," "bioluminescence rippled through the stems like captured starlight drowning in slow motion," "tragically radiant luminescence that marked sacred transformation, the kind of light that existed only when something beautiful was being destroyed." Density of figurative language in most sentences without pattern-teaching flattens momentum (−0.5). Multiple paraphrase loops: the shell's containment of dangerous memory is restated across three sentences in paragraph one; isolation/independence theme cycles through near-synonyms. Template cadence in final paragraph: "still a skeptic, still charmed, but no longer afraid" follows "no longer just a prison...but a sanctuary." Mixed metaphor: starlight cannot drown. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("metastasize through the collective unconscious") clashes with sensory garden setting (−0.4). Cumulative artifact penalty −0.9 in Q7; artifacts appear in final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet garden, crystalline lattice, and singing-memories-into-storage offer a specific sensory synthesis that avoids generic fantasy. However, the emotional arc (skeptic learns to accept connection) and the framing (magical archivist completes dangerous task at dawn deadline) follow familiar template structures. The "quarantined memory" concept is fresh but underused; it functions as mission objective rather than complicating force. Transformation test: the plot and arc work unchanged with different names and objects—substitute "cursed artifact" for "memory fragment" and the structure persists. Some textural originality in the garden imagery but thematic resolution is conventional wisdom delivered overtly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and completes the archiving task, but her "charmed skeptic" attribute primarily colors narration rather than creating key turns. Her skepticism "wavered" when shown the host's memory, but this doesn't alter her approach—she "worked faster" in the same manner. The final insight about carrying others' burdens is reflective realization, not a decision that changes tactics. Present and functional but replaceable with a generic "magical archivist" without structural loss. Two gates: setup (immediate) and payoff (present at end in reflection); middle development weak (no choice constrained by skepticism). Cap at ~6.0 per gate model; swappability and summary-only realization lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half appears in three distinct beats: held in opening with voices/consciousness described; used during archiving as Elara matches its frequencies; crumbles to dust at completion, marking task fulfilled. It enables the archiving method and its destruction signals closure, but its specific properties (spiral darkness, hum, whisper) could be replaced by another magical container without breaking story logic. All three gates present (setup immediate, middle enables archiving, payoff at completion). Causal role in two beats and closure participation elevate to mid-6s, but swappability (any sealed artifact works) prevents higher band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "quarantined memory" frames the entire task and provides the content Elara must archive—it "fought back" by showing visions and shapes the emotional stakes (isolation/connection theme). Present from opening, active in middle (shows host's last moments), and resolved at end (archived, neutralized). However, its specific property as "quarantined" rather than simply "dangerous" or "sealed" doesn't alter Elara's tactics; she follows the same archiving procedure regardless. All three gates met; two-beat involvement and closure linkage place it in 5–6.9 band. Specificity is moderate—the memory's content (isolation theme) charges the ending but could be replaced with another dangerous emotional fragment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tragically radiant" appears as descriptor for the garden's bioluminescent display during archiving and again for flowers at completion ("glowing with that tragically radiant luminescence"). It characterizes the aesthetic but doesn't constrain or enable action—Elara's process would proceed identically without this quality. Setup and payoff present (described in paragraph 3, reprised in paragraph 6); no middle development where the trait alters choice. Lyric reprise reweights the garden's transformation but remains ornamental to causality. Cap ~6.3 per lyric-resonance allowance; label-only usage and no causal pressure lower to upper-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Archiving is the central action from opening ("Elara's task was to archive it") through resolution (memory "now archived within the garden's eternal twilight"). The entire plot traces to this action: positioning the crystal lattice, singing frequencies, working faster as dawn approaches, completing the binding. All three gates met with strong causal pressure—every major beat serves this action. Removal would collapse the story entirely. Closure directly linked (completion marks success). Essential across beats and ending, placing it solidly in 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Through resonance structures" is signaled in paragraph 2 ("resonance structures she had built from tuned crystal and accumulated grief") and the archiving proceeds by matching frequencies ("Each frequency she struck matched the shell's whisper"). The method matters mechanically—she uses crystal and song—but the specific mechanics don't constrain her choices or create complications; it functions as described without friction. All three gates present (setup paragraph 2, development in archiving sequence, payoff when "resonance structures would destabilize" creates urgency). One-beat causal involvement (enables archiving) places it mid-5s to mid-6s; limited specificity (any magical frequency-matching would serve) caps at upper-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet garden is present throughout, provides the spatial setting, supplies resources (petals vibrate in harmony, root system stores the memory), and transforms visibly (flowers turn silver-white). It actively participates in the archiving ritual rather than serving as backdrop. All three gates strongly met; the garden pressures the action (clock tied to dawn in this location), enables the method (roots as storage), and charges the final image (glowing sanctuary). Two beats of distinct involvement (archiving sequence, final transformation) and closure linkage. Essential setting that would require significant rewrite if removed. Strong execution in 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The dawn deadline is established early ("When the last star fades into morning light, the resonance structures would destabilize") and tracked through the sequence ("The horizon bruised purple then gold. Dawn threatened...The final star winked out"). The timeframe creates urgency that causes Elara to "work faster" but doesn't force tactical trade-offs or choices about what to prioritize. All three gates met (setup paragraph 5, middle provides pressure, payoff at completion). Time tightens decisions minimally—she simply accelerates the same process. Live clock that matters but doesn't alter moves beyond speed, placing it in mid-6s per guidance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To translate isolation into independence" is stated explicitly as the task's purpose (paragraph 3: "translating the isolation of the trapped memory into something permanent") and returns in the final realization. However, this motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. Elara doesn't face friction between this goal and competing costs—she pursues it successfully without sacrifice. Setup and payoff present (stated paragraph 3, reprised in closing reflection); middle development weak (no scene where this desire creates conflict). Told-only motivation without friction between wants and costs places it in lower-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is introduced in paragraph 1 ("an assignment she approached with the ghostly resolve of someone who had already lost everything but purpose") and colors her determined execution throughout. The tone remains coherent through the archiving sequence and modulates slightly at the end ("ghostly resolve settle into her bones not as compulsion, but as choice"). Setup immediate, present in middle action (steady focus), payoff at closure (resolve reframed). The tone charges the final image moderately—her solitary determination becomes chosen rather than imposed. Coherent through turns and closure participation place it in mid-to-upper-6s.</comment>
