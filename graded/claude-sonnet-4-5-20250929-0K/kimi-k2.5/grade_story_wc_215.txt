<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivations are established—seven years silent, drawn to preserve unspoken words—but interiority is heavily abstract ("weight that pulled at his ribs like a hooked line," "tangled covenant") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under stress. The final acceptance of his role as repository is told rather than earned through a dramatized internal conflict; no competing impulse resists the burden. Embodied emotion is sparse; most sensation is metaphorical or summary ("tranquilly perceptive," "astonished recluse"). The ghost woman's gesture transfers memory, but Elias never wrestles with refusal or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: Elias, abandoned oasis, post-barrier-dissolution timeframe established early. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered description and the ghosts' selective movements until the final image reweights the stained glass box as archive. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias accepts his role as keeper of silence—but the cost is asserted in metaphor ("gravity of everything never voiced") rather than shown through a forfeited alternative or visible trade-off. The letter remains sealed, a setup without payoff. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost touches the box and "the covenant untangl[es] itself," but this moment lacks causal tension or price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis is vividly rendered: empty hives, peeling paint, scorched earth, charred acacia trees. Sensory details (clover scent where no clover grows, humming in teeth, fractured rainbows) are selective and atmospheric. The northern quadrant avoidance by ghosts and the stained glass box's panels filtering light both subtly guide perception. Micro-setting (the box itself) and the hives function as spatial anchors. The setting constrains Elias's choice to remain and charges the final image of the box collecting "permanent stains upon air," satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested by competing pressures. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elias observes, understands, and accepts without friction. The ghost's gesture transfers memory, but this is coincidental enablement rather than protagonist agency. Opening the box and witnessing the ghosts constitute observation, not decision with cost. The covenant "untangling" and Elias's choice to "maintain this oasis" are told culminations without on-page struggle or forfeited path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is required; here the prose deepens thematically but does not narrow options or impose a felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—the preservation and weight of unspoken words—emerges organically from the broken covenant between keepers, bees, and land. The stained glass box and honeycomb serve as concrete anchors. Subtext operates in the ghosts' silent gestures and Elias's own muteness mirroring the beekeepers' unsaid apologies. The ending resists moralizing and offers a resonant image: the box as archive of absences, refracting silence into color. However, the thematic statement "To preserve the weight of unspoken words required no voice, only witness" veers toward direct articulation rather than pure dramatization, and the final paragraph edges into summarizing the purpose ("maintain this oasis not for honey, but for the gravity of everything never voiced") rather than leaving it implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization through Elias. Perceptual signature is consistent: long, meditative sentences with elevated diction ("mute eloquence," "luminous thread," "architecture of abandonment"). Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to Elias's interior without head-hopping. Diction is lush and metaphor-dense but remains coherent and voice-motivated; the register fits a contemplative recluse. No dialogue present. The prose modulates subtly with the scene's quiet intensity. Minor filter-verb reliance ("watching," "observing") but within tolerance for this reflective mode. Syntax varies purposefully, creating a lyric rhythm that supports tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm is lyric and controlled, with varied sentence openings and lengths. Information density is high in descriptive passages but momentum stalls in mid-story summary ("The beekeepers had promised..."). Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every line in the middle third carries stacked metaphor ("weight that pulled at his ribs like a hooked line," "heavy as honey, bitter as smoke, accumulating like sediment," "transferring the burden of memory...thread by luminous thread"). Mixed or extended metaphors blur clarity ("tangled covenant," "hooked line," "suspended in amber light" without clear vehicle coherence). Synonym churn and paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "unspoken words suspended" / "unspoken words he had never possessed courage to read" / "everything never voiced." Template cadence: "He observed how...how...how..." runs across three clauses. Filter-verb stack in the observation passage. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (opening the box, ghost contact) triggers −0.7; template and loops add −0.6. Artifacts do not obscure causality but dull immediacy and tighten pacing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—mute keeper in a dead oasis witnesses ghosts and accepts the role of memory archive—synthesizes familiar elements (post-apocalyptic setting, spectral visitation, symbolic inheritance) with specificity: beekeeping lore, stained glass as prism, the covenant between species. The astonished-yet-silent recluse and "tranquilly perceptive" attribute offer fresh character texture. However, the emotional arc is contemplative stasis rather than transformation, and the ending's thematic articulation ("maintain this oasis...for the gravity of everything never voiced") feels predictable once the ghosts appear. The letter remains sealed, a missed opportunity for ingenuity. Risk is moderate: the lyric mode and ghost-as-silent-witness conceit are executed with care but do not subvert expectations or impose structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout as focalizer and recipient of the ghosts' message. His choice to open the box occurs mid-story but does not create a turn; observation dominates. The final decision to "maintain this oasis" is stated rather than enacted through a dramatized choice with cost. The character's silence and perceptiveness are traits, not drivers of causal pressure. Two beats (opening the box, accepting the ghost's touch) involve him, but neither alters tactics or forecloses an alternative. Setup gate met; development and payoff are weak. Functional but largely observational role caps the score in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box is introduced early (paragraph two), excavated three winters prior. It is handled in three distinct beats: carried while watching ghosts, opened mid-story to reveal honeycomb and letter, and touched by the ghost to transfer memory. Its panels refract light throughout, and the ending centers on the box remaining open to collect "the weight of absences." The box's color projections become "permanent stains upon air," reweighting the object as archive. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The box constrains Elias's purpose and charges the closure image. Specificity (sapphire/amber bees, leaded lines) and irreplaceability are strong. Cost linkage is implicit but undeniable in the final image. Minor deduction: the box does not narrow options in a dramatized choice; its role is symbolic containment rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tangled covenant (keeper/bees/land) is introduced early and explained in a summary paragraph. It shapes the thematic premise but does not alter Elias's tactics or force a decision on the page. The ghosts' movements (pausing at certain hives, avoiding the northern quadrant) imply the covenant's traces, and the ghost's touch "untangles" it, but this is enacted on Elias rather than by him. The concept charges the ending's thematic resonance ("archive them in the silence of his continued existence") but remains abstract. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak. One key turn (covenant transferring to Elias) involves the concept, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" is applied as a label in paragraph four: "Elias became tranquilly perceptive." The trait is then illustrated by his observation of ghost movements. It does not constrain a choice or impose a visible trade-off; the perception enables understanding but not decision. The attribute is mentioned once, in one beat, and does not return or evolve. Setup gate met (early signal); development and payoff gates missing. Swappable with "keenly observant" or "calmly attentive" without structural change. Ornamental use and late-first-third appearance combine for a low-3s score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias gazes at ghosts (paragraph four), into the stained glass (penultimate paragraph), and the final line references "colors shift as figures moved behind panels." Gazing is the primary mode of engagement throughout. It enables understanding ("through contextual clues") and frames the ending's archive role. Two distinct beats involve gazing (observation of ghosts, studying the box). However, the action is passive and does not drive a turn; any contemplative verb (watch, study, witness) could replace it. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure is minimal; gazing is method rather than catalyst. Mid-6s for presence across beats without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is signaled twice: once in paragraph three (morning light, scent, humming) and again in paragraph four (ghosts' movements, bowed heads, silence). The method enables Elias's understanding of the covenant and the ghosts' purpose. It shapes two beats (recognizing the barrier dissolved, recognizing the covenant) but does not alter his tactics or impose cost. The mechanics are shown: sensory cues and behavioral patterns yield insight. Setup and development gates met; payoff is thematic rather than causal. Swappable with "by observing" without major edits. Functional role in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis is established in the opening line and detailed throughout: empty hives, collapsed chapel, scorched wasteland. The setting supplies the honeycomb, the stained glass box (excavated from the chapel), and the spatial logic of ghost movements (avoiding the northern quadrant where fire started). The oasis anchors Elias's choice to remain and charges the final image of him sitting "among the empty hives" as "part of architecture of abandonment." Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The setting constrains Elias's purpose (preserve this place) and provides the closure's spatial frame. Specificity (acacia trees, hive corridors, cracked earth) and irreplaceability are strong. Minor deduction: the setting enables rather than pressures; no rival location tempts Elias.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after ghosts become visible" is anchored in the opening line ("when the ghosts first flickered into view") and sustained throughout the single scene. Time progression is marked: morning light, sun descending, dusk, night cooling, dawn threatening. The timeframe enables the ghost encounter but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. Elias's actions (opening the box, accepting the ghost's touch) occur without temporal pressure. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak. The timeframe is a backdrop rather than a tactical constraint. One key turn (ghosts appearing) is enabled by the timeframe, placing it in the high-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to preserve the weight of unspoken words" is stated explicitly near the end ("He would maintain this oasis...for the gravity of everything never voiced"). The motivation is implied earlier through his keeping of the stained glass box ("heavy with significance") and his acceptance of the ghosts' presence. It drives two beats: opening the box and accepting the ghost's transfer. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No alternative desire (leave, speak, destroy the box) creates friction. Setup and payoff gates met; development shows understanding but not struggle. Thematic articulation is clear; causal pressure on choices is limited. Mid-6s for presence and thematic coherence without on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone of "mute eloquence" is established early (Elias's seven-year silence, ghosts' "serene masks of mute eloquence") and sustained through the prose's elevated, meditative register. The tone modulates subtly: wonder at the ghosts' appearance, solemnity in opening the box, reverence in the final acceptance. Sentence rhythm and diction (long, lyric constructions with metaphor density) embody the tone consistently. The tone charges the final image: silent figures "permanent stains upon air," colors "speak[ing] without sound." Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The tone is indispensable to the story's effect and coherent through all turns. Strong execution in the 7+ band.</comment>
