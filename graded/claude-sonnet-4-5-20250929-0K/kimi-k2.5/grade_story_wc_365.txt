<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to discover her mentor's secret is clear and drives her through the bay, but her internal conflict remains abstract—we see her cataloging sensory data rather than wrestling with contradictory impulses about whether she *should* uncover this truth. The final choice to "honor" rather than redirect feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle between competing goods. Embodied emotion is scarce; most interiority consists of perceptual metaphors ("heard not sound but distance") that describe her mapping ability but don't reveal character-specific stakes or flaws under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure: Elara's realization that "weight was not a burden to be discarded but a coordinate to be honored" reweights her mentor's silence and her own role. Orientation is delayed—"who" and baseline reality anchor only after the green shard appears—but the disorientation serves the cyclical-spontaneous premise. The causal chain from discovery (mentor sabotaged the launch) to choice (document rather than redirect) is present, but the cost of that choice remains conceptual and asserted ("she too would withhold truths") rather than viscerally dramatized with a visible forfeiture on the page. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a conceptual-repricing ending, held consistently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The repair bay is vivid and specific—rusted hull plates, eastern hangar door, ozone and copper variants across universes—and it constrains Elara's exploration (she was kept away from the eastern door, the convergence point matters tactically). The sensory catalogue is dense and POV-filtered through her mapping discipline. The green shard functions as micro-setting object, warming and pulsing, cutting the air to enable passage; it charges the final image by dissolving into her palm. The bay's transformation in the closing beats (no longer abandoned but "inhabited by the resonance of acceptance") reweights the space with thematic cost, pushing this into the 7-band despite the heavy reliance on abstract sensory metaphors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the mentor's secret—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through cyclical universe-hopping that intensifies from hours to heartbeats, and the seventh universe delivers the revelation (sabotage for mercy over hope). The choice at convergence (redirect vs. document) offers a tightening, but Elara's decision feels more like thematic acceptance than a dramatized trade-off with visible cost; we don't see what she surrenders or risks by choosing documentation over reversal. The escalation is legible under an Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening, but lacks the on-page price or foreclosed option that would elevate conflict clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—burden as coordinate rather than curse, the weight of withheld truths—emerges through the green shard, the cyclical universes, and the mentor's secret, avoiding overt statement until the final reflection. The closing image of Elara as living map ("her body a legend of scars and coordinates, her heart the scale") offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the final two paragraphs drift toward abstract philosophizing ("cyclical nature of that mercy, spontaneous and inevitable as sunrise across infinite parallel dawns") that edges into thematic echo rather than letting the particulars speak. The piece resists tidy binaries but loses some emotional specificity in its lyric register.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in her sensory-mapping discipline ("ghost vibrations," "stretching void between parallel universes"). The prose maintains elevated diction throughout, which fits the abstract premise but occasionally drifts intoorporate register ("cartographic senses," "topography of his withheld truth") that feels less like character voice and more like authorial framing. No head-hopping. Distance control is consistent, though the final paragraphs telescope forward in time ("The work took years measured in breaths") without clear scenic anchoring, creating a summary effect that dilutes immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language—nearly every sentence in the opening and middle sections carries metaphor or sensory abstraction—creating a lush but occasionally opaque texture. Paraphrase loops appear: "weight of a withheld truth" / "heft of the silence" / "gravity of unspoken things" recycle the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the closing paragraphs with repeated "she would" constructions. The final third includes stock phrasing ("necessary pressure that kept her grounded while her mind wandered") and thematic summary that tells rather than shows. Information density is high, but clarity suffers under the figurative load; at least one mixed metaphor ("weaving between worlds… the shard cut the air") blurs the mechanics of her movement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory cartography, parallel universes, and cyclical time offers a fresh SF-literary frame, and the mentor's choice (sabotage for mercy over exile) provides a non-obvious moral calculus. The green shard as recurring object with shifting function (follower, tool, then internalized compass) shows purposeful design. However, the emotional arc—acceptance of burden as wisdom—follows a familiar contemplative template, and the parallel-universe mechanics remain abstract enough to feel like set-dressing for a thematic meditation rather than a lived constraint. The piece commits to its premise but doesn't fully transform the "burden-as-gift" trope through specific lived detail or an unexpected turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's sensory-mapping discipline is signaled early, enables her to read the bay and navigate universes, and drives the middle beats (cataloging fragments across realities). Her final choice—to map rather than redirect—grows from her mapping identity and forecloses the path of reversal. The character trait is causally active across setup, middle, and closure, shaping tactics and the ending image (she becomes the map).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears early, follows Elara through seven iterations, cuts the air to enable passage, and dissolves into her palm at closure, becoming "a permanent reminder of the distance between salvation and survival." It is handled across at least three beats (appearance, use as tool, internalization) and its final transformation reweights its earlier mystery. The shard's mechanics remain somewhat vague (why it cuts reality, how it chose her), but its recurring presence and charged ending earn solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds structures the middle exploration—Elara steps through the wound in air, moves among parallel bays, assembles the truth from fragments. The concept enables the plot and shapes her tactics (she must visit seven universes to complete the puzzle). At closure, she steps back into native reality, choosing documentation over redirection, a choice that depends on having seen the parallel outcomes. The concept is causal and present across beats, though its mechanics are more atmospheric than rigorously constrained.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is named in the opening ("Time here moved in spirals, cyclically spontaneous") and intensified in the middle ("cycles intensified, spontaneous jumps occurring with heartbeats"), but it functions more as world-flavor than a constraint that forces a trade-off. The attribute colors the setting but doesn't demonstrably narrow Elara's options or impose a visible cost; she navigates the cycles without apparent friction. Label-only with thematic echo, no on-page price tied to spontaneity itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The redirect action appears at the convergence point as the central choice: Elara "could redirect the flow now, use the cyclical spontaneity to undo the original decision" but chooses not to. This decision defines the closure and forecloses the path of reversal. However, the action is framed as a contemplated option rather than an attempted move with on-page consequences; we don't see her test or enact redirection, only decide against it. Present in closure with cost, but the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Parallel universes are introduced early (the shard lets her hear "the stretching void between parallel universes"), enable the middle exploration (seven universes yield fragments of the secret), and frame the final choice (redirect across timelines vs. accept this one). The method is signaled, used across multiple beats, and shapes the ending stakes. The mechanics are loose—how she selects which universe, what governs access—but the method is causally necessary to the plot and present at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is established in the opening sentence, serves as the stable spatial anchor across all beats, and holds the mentor's secret (the sabotaged launch vessel, the eastern hangar door). The bay's transformation in the closing paragraph ("no longer abandoned but inhabited by the resonance of acceptance") reweights the space and charges the ending image. The setting pressures Elara's exploration (she must map this specific bay to understand the silence) and provides the convergence point. Essential across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears in the opening as atmospheric descriptor and recurs in the closing frame ("the bay where one could hear the murmur of half-remembered dreams"). It colors tone but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions; no ticking clock or deadline pressures Elara's choices. The phrase is more motif than temporal constraint, earning credit for lyric reprise but not for shaping tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Discovering "the weight of a withheld truth" is stated as Elara's need in the opening and drives every beat: she reads the bay, follows the shard, weaves through universes, assembles the secret, and ultimately chooses to document rather than erase it. The motivation is dramatized through exploration and choice, and the final realization (weight as coordinate to be honored) grows from that pursuit. The desire is persistent, conflicted with the option to redirect, and resolved with visible cost (she will carry the weight and withhold truths in turn). Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>
