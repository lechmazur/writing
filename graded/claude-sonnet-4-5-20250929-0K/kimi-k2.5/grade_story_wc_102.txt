<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her "spiritually curious nature finally satisfied" reads as narrator summary rather than embodied discovery. The past-life nurse appears as exposition to explain stored love rather than complicating present choices. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly from setup to epiphany without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who Maya is beyond "pilgrim of sparks" and what concrete problem she faces remain unclear until well into the piece. The closure offers thematic assertion ("to hold on is to wither, and to let go is to bloom") rather than a decisive change with visible cost; the tear melts and love disperses, but no on-page choice or renunciation forecloses a path. Causality is obscured by metaphor: how the camera reveals sparks, how the tear operates, and what Maya risks remain abstract. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the final image summarizes meaning rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The viaduct's "breathing" and wisteria-in-bloom are vivid, and the foggy twilight charges the atmosphere. However, the gorge, masonry, and iron rivets remain postcard descriptions without constraining Maya's choices. The camera obscura projects sparks but does not shape her tactics—she stands, looks, and presses the tear without environmental friction. Spatial choreography is thin; her collapse and the camera's fall are the only physical moves tracked.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared but never tested by opposition or consequence. Maya arrives, sees, understands, and releases without a single on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The tear melts on contact with no visible cost or trade-off; the structure exhales and heals. Coincidence (the monk's gift, the precise twilight hour) enables rather than complicates, and no agency choice forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("to hold on is to wither, and to let go is to bloom"), replacing scene pressure with moral summary. "Unused love is stored...in the breathing spaces between what we remember and what we dare to release" is prompt-language philosophizing rather than emergence from particulars. The wisteria and breathing viaduct recur but do not constrain or reweight; they ornament the thesis. No counter-reading is available; the piece telegraphs its lesson.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Register oscillates between lyric abstraction ("pilgrim of sparks," "foggy lucidity") and New Age therapy-speak ("spiritually curious," "convert grief into grace through the alchemy of acknowledgment"). "The memory had surfaced three days ago—a death in another century" withholds causally available knowledge to manufacture mystery. Diction in peak beats (e.g., "condensed compassion of ten thousand prayers," "the vault where affection never spent calcified into grief") reads as elevated catalog rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Dense figurative language pervades without pattern-teaching: "pilgrim of sparks," "reservoir to irrigate the deserts of abandoned affection," "bellows to fan the embers of hidden truth into flame," "circulatory system of capillary cracks." Mixed metaphors cluster—sparks/embers/fire blend with irrigation/reservoir, and the viaduct breathes yet also has capillary cracks. Paraphrase loops: "unused love...stored...withheld tenderness...stored love...unused love is stored" across three beats. Template stems recur: "She saw...She felt...She had come...She pressed...She understood." Information density is low; many sentences restate the theme without advancing action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise—past-life healing pilgrimage with mystical object—follows New Age template without transformation. The camera obscura, Kwan Yin's tear, and breathing viaduct are exotic tokens rather than irreplaceable story engines; swap for a crystal ball, holy water, and enchanted bridge with minor edits. The "where unused love is stored" question receives a stated answer rather than a dramatized discovery. No risk or unconventional choice heightens stakes; the piece remains safely abstract.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Maya observes and receives revelation but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics. She positions the camera, watches, and presses the tear—actions without conflict or cost. Her collapse is passive result, not choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tear is pressed into Maya's palm (beat 1) and later pressed against the viaduct railing where it melts and disperses (beat 2). It enables the healing but does not constrain any choice or create friction; Maya uses it exactly as instructed without complication.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" appears as narrator label in paragraph 1 and again as "sparks" imagery in the camera projection and wisteria. It colors theme but does not shape tactics or narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is mentioned twice as a trait label but never dramatized. No on-page action shows curiosity constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Heal" is the stated goal and the climax action (releasing stored love), appearing in beats across the middle and ending. However, it resolves without friction; the tear melts and the viaduct exhales on contact. Swappable with "release" or "restore" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Breathing is mentioned in beat 1 (viaduct respiration), then as the method ("three counts in, seven counts out, the pattern of revelation"), and again in the climax ("breath hitched...sacred pause"). The method is signaled but its mechanics remain abstract; Maya's breath does not visibly fail or succeed to shape the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The viaduct appears in every major beat, frames the action, and houses the stored love in its mortar and rivets. However, it does not constrain Maya's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—it is stage rather than obstacle or tool.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"Three days ago" establishes the memory trigger, but no on-page clock tightens decisions. The twilight hour is atmosphere, not deadline; Maya could perform this ritual at any dusk without consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The desire to find where unused love is stored drives Maya to the viaduct and frames the revelation. However, it is never dramatized in conflict—no competing want, no cost of pursuing it, no moment where she weighs whether to continue.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named explicitly and sustained through "mist that somehow made everything clearer" and the twilight atmosphere. The tone modulates slightly (trembling → collapse) but remains consistently abstract and reverent. It charges the final image through the projected embrace in clouds.</comment>
