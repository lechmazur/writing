<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elian's motivation—defiance against hopelessness—is declared but never contradicted or complicated by genuine internal conflict; he moves through the fortress with confident mastery, his "serious playfulness" label-only rather than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies on abstract statements ("filtering the atmosphere through ambient awareness," "he could feel the despair pooling") without embodied sensation or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final descent registers no visible cost or foreclosed path; he leaves "his motivation satisfied" without having risked or renounced anything on the page. Diagnostic label-speak ("gravity of hopelessness," "serious playfulness") in peak beats triggers deduction per Q1 guidance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece presents an accumulative/textural structure but lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. Elian performs his ritual, the sky remains starless, ceramic shards fall—yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs; he descends "his motivation satisfied" without visible price, foreclosed option, or altered stance. The "note in mosaic" setup promises a formula but its discovery and use feel like steps in a checklist rather than beats that narrow options or deepen stakes. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive by the second paragraph, avoiding the Orientation Test penalty, but the causal chain is thin: events happen in sequence without because/therefore linkage that tightens pressure or changes knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The blooming fortress at dusk, the ivy-covered walls with luminous flowers, and the mosaic floor with its ceramic formula are vivid and selective. The kerosene rag knot and the mosaic's central depression constrain Elian's ritual in two beats (ignition, chanting spiral), and the final ceramic-shard courtyard charges the ending image with specificity. However, spatial choreography weakens in the tower climb—how the mosaic "frequencies" interact with rainwater ignition and how the vibration shakes loose wall fragments remain mechanically unclear. The micro-setting (body, tool, mosaic) meets the 9+ gate test by constraining choice and charging the final image, but ambiguities in physical logic and the lack of pressure-driven sensory narrowing cap the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defying hopelessness through a fireworks ritual—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through agency-driven reversals. Elian encounters no meaningful resistance, adaptation, or trade-off; the siege's despair is declared pooling "heavy as mercury" yet never complicates his chanting or ritual execution. The courtyard faces tilt upward and children will whistle tomorrow, but these outcomes arrive without visible cost or foreclosed path for Elian himself. One tightening occurs (ignition whispers instead of roars, colors "shouldn't exist"), but it reads as texture rather than a pressure point that narrows options. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the lack of a legible price at closure—no renunciation, no visible sacrifice—keeps escalation functional but not charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (beauty and combustion as defiance of despair) emerges through image and action rather than overt statement, and the final ceramic-shard courtyard offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "note in mosaic" and "serious playfulness" motifs recur, but their returns feel ornamental rather than reweighted by prior cost or choice. Subtext operates in the image of "burning the map to find the territory," yet Elian's interior remains free of contradictory wants or friction between playfulness and despair's gravity. The piece invites reflection through specificity (ceramic frequencies, sulfur and magnesium dreams) but lacks the particularized human struggle that would anchor the abstraction in earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, elevated diction ("filtering the atmosphere through ambient awareness," "hush of a night with no stars," "gravity of hopelessness") that remains consistent and voice-motivated, lending a lyric texture. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elian notices via abstract awareness rather than character-specific bias, and his rhythmic control under pressure does not compress or sharpen diction at peak beats. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative's confidence matches what the focalizer can plausibly know. Free indirect style is clean, but the lack of embodied, contradictory perception under stress and the reliance on elevated register without micro-variation keep the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence-level rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("fire spinner's kerosene rag knot, heavy with fuel, tucked inside his leather satchel like a beating heart"), but paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "filtering the atmosphere through ambient awareness" recurs in adjacent beats without added pressure, and "gravity of hopelessness" is restated three times. Stock metaphors ("heavy as mercury," "velvet darkness") and elevated diction that clashes with concrete action ("filtering upward through the fibers in blue and gold tendrils") create register drift in peak beats. No runs of identical stems, but the figurative density in the tower sequence (mosaic frequencies, heat spheres, sulfur dreams) without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers the overwriting check. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack (paraphrase loops, stock metaphors in peak beats): baseline −0.6 in Q7; total deduction ~−0.8 for spread across closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—fireworks designer uses ritual to lift siege despair—offers a fresh angle on familiar "art vs. despair" material, and the "note in mosaic" as ceramic frequency is a specific, non-obvious detail. However, the emotional arc and plot structure (arrival, discovery, ritual, departure) remain template-like and could transfer unchanged to a different medium or crisis without loss. The "serious playfulness" label and "gravity of hopelessness" phrasing read as prompt echoes rather than organically discovered motifs. No proximity check failures, but the lack of genuine risk-taking—Elian succeeds without complication, cost, or transformation—and the safety middle (median execution that avoids bold structural or emotional stakes) limit originality to functional novelty without deeper synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout and his choices (climb to tower, ignite knot, chant in spiral) advance the plot, but these are execution steps rather than high-stakes decisions under pressure. No key turn traces to a choice that narrows options or alters cost; he performs his ritual without complication or renunciation. Setup present (early), development (ignition and chanting), payoff (descent "motivation satisfied") all appear, meeting two gates. However, the wandering designer's agency does not create reversals or reweight prior material at closure—he leaves unchanged. Swappability is high: another artist type could replace him with minor edits. Baseline mid-functional, no causal pressure or closure linkage to drive score higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot appears in setup (carried in satchel, described as "beating heart"), development (unwrapped, dipped, ignited with colors that "shouldn't exist"), and payoff (crumbles to ash, left coiled on highest step as "dormant promise"). Handled and used in three distinct beats, it constrains the ritual's ignition sequence and charges the final image through the coiled-ash remnant. However, its unique properties (why this knot rather than any torch?) are not specified, and the piece does not dramatize a visible cost tied to its exhaustion—Elian simply descends satisfied. Positive signals: early seed +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9; friction: swappability −0.5, no tied cost −0.4. Strong development but lacks irreplaceability and cost connection to reach ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "note in mosaic" is introduced at the tower (setup absent from first third, late penalty applies), described as "frequencies rather than images, a musical score written in glazed stone." It enables the ignition and chanting sequence (development: Elian dips the knot into the mosaic's central depression, walks the spiral "mapping the note in mosaic onto the sky"), and the final shard-courtyard image implies children will whistle the frequencies. Three gates met (late setup, development, payoff). Causal pressure: the mosaic formula shapes the ritual's mechanics and the ending outcome. However, the concept's mechanics remain abstract—what does "frequencies in glazed stone" mean physically, and how do they transfer to children's whistling?—and the final transmission is told rather than shown. Positive: three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8; friction: late appearance −0.4, abstract mechanics −0.5. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Chants while walking" is signaled early (opening line: "his voice a low rhythmic murmur that kept time with his boots") and recurs in the tower sequence ("he resumed, walking now in a tightening spiral," "chanted while walking faster"). The chanting disrupts despair's accumulation and creates "interference patterns," and the final ceramic shards are arranged "by the vibration of his chants." Three beats, setup and payoff present. However, the attribute is mostly atmospheric—no on-page moment shows a visible cost or trade-off tied to chanting (e.g., breathlessness limiting speed, voice strain). Functional role in ritual execution, but label-only without dramatized constraint or price. Positive: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7; friction: ornamental use −0.6, no cost −0.5. Mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Filter" appears in three forms: "filtering the atmosphere through ambient awareness" (courtyard), "filtering upward through the fibers" (ignition), "filtering the darkness through prisms of chemical reaction" (final blaze). The action shapes Elian's perception and the ritual's mechanics, but no major turn traces exclusively to filtering—remove it and the plot (climb, ignite, chant, descend) remains unchanged. The verb is more stylistic signature than plot engine. Setup present, development (ignition and blaze descriptions), payoff (final filtering mention). Two gates met. Positive: early +0.4, two beats +0.9; friction: swappability −0.7, summary-only in final mention −0.5. Functional but easily replaced with "perceive," "channel," or "process."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Through ambient awareness" is signaled in the courtyard ("filtering the atmosphere through ambient awareness, letting the temperature shifts and wind patterns wash over his skin") and recurs at the tower blaze ("through ambient awareness of oxygen and fuel and the exact moment before consumption"). The method enables Elian's perception of despair and the ritual's timing, shaping two beats. Setup and development present, but payoff is weak—ambient awareness does not appear in or decisively shape the final descent image. The mechanics are abstract and swappable with "intuition" or "sensitivity." Positive: early +0.4, two beats +0.9; friction: late first functional use −0.2, abstract mechanics −0.5, no closure participation −0.7. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "blooming fortress at dusk" with ivy-covered walls, luminous white flowers, and starless velvet darkness is established early and sustained. The highest tower's mosaic floor supplies the formula that enables the ritual (causal pressure), and the courtyard's spatial layout frames the soldiers' upward gazes and the final shard arrangement. Setting constrains Elian's access (tower climb) and charges the ending image (courtyard glittering with ceramic fragments). Setup, development, and payoff all present. Positive: early +0.6, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9; friction: dusk/night inconsistency (dusk opening, "hush of a night" closure) −0.3. Strong integration, micro-setting (tower, mosaic) shapes tactics, but orientation inconsistency and generic "fortress under siege" frame limit irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "hush of a night with no stars" is mentioned in the opening paragraph ("a velvet darkness"), closing paragraph ("the hush of a night with no stars that was finally, mercifully ending"), and once mid-story. It sets atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time—Elian's ritual could occur at any hour without change. No live clock, no pressure from dawn approaching until the final line declares dawn "threatened." Setup and payoff present (first and last paragraphs), no middle development. Two gates met but lyric reprise does not reweight the stake with cost. Positive: early +0.3, lyric bookend +0.4; friction: ornamental −0.7, no tactical constraint −0.6, vague duration −0.4. Present but static.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To defy the gravity of hopelessness" is stated explicitly in paragraph two ("a defiance against the gravity of hopelessness that had settled over the fortress") and recurs in paragraph six ("the gravity of hopelessness was a physical weight he could feel in his knees") and closing ("the gravity of hopelessness temporarily repealed"). The motivation frames the ritual and charges the ending claim, but it is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—Elian never hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible price tied to this desire. Setup, development (knee-weight moment), and payoff (repealed claim) present. Positive: early +0.5, closure linkage +0.7; friction: label-only without friction −0.8, told not shown −0.6. Functional but lacks embodied struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Serious playfulness" is named explicitly in paragraph three ("unable to see the serious playfulness in his steps") and echoed in the closing ceramic-shard gift and the phrase "a prank against despair." The tone modulates slightly—opening rhythmic murmur, courtyard chanting disruption, tower spiral acceleration—but remains consistent rather than shifting under pressure. The final image (empty rag knot as "dormant promise") carries a playful-serious charge. Setup, development, and payoff present. Positive: early +0.5, closure linkage +0.8; friction: label-only without dramatized tension between serious and playful impulses −0.6, static mood −0.4. Coherent and purposeful but not deeply charged by pressure.</comment>
