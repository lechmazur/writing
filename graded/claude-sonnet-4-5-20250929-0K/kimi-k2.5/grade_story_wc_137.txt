<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's transformation from skeptic to believer is tracked through observable micro-choices (extracting the tile, pressing it to her forehead, designing renovations), but the arc lacks internal contradiction acting simultaneously. The final state shows her "courageously vulnerable in her newfound faith," yet the path from data-driven researcher to mystical guardian feels too smooth—no dramatized friction between her empirical training and the visions flooding in. The epiphany arrives fully formed without the messy hesitation or self-doubt that would mark genuine internal conflict under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density builds through whale song, comet, tile discovery, visions, and renovation design, culminating in the meditation-niche closure. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mara shifts stance from detached researcher to guardian—but the cost remains abstract ("no longer fighting the connection") rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the tile's arrival at the exact midpoint and its immediate unlocking of solutions feels convenient rather than causally earned from prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory tower is vividly rendered with salt wind, copper-green comet, limestone bones conducting whale song, and the magic square tile embedded in mortar—concrete details that constrain Mara's late-night work and shape the renovation design. Spatial choreography is clean (dome, parapet, library, meditation niches). The tower functions as both setting and instrument, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the final image when visitors arrange cushions in the new acoustics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to honor science alone or bridge it with mystery—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara discovers the tile and chooses to act on its visions. The renovation work represents agency, but the escalation feels declarative ("she would not dismiss") rather than tested by a second complication or visible trade-off. Whale migration provides atmospheric pressure but does not force a harder choice; the tower transformation proceeds without meaningful resistance or cost that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the science-versus-mystery premise and is embodied in the tile's "emotional architecture" and acoustic renovation, avoiding overt moralizing until the final instruction to the child ("this tower is the instrument"). However, the closing gesture—"translated isolation into communion"—states the theme rather than letting the final image resonate without summary. The tile as motif recurs with shifted meaning (discovery → mounting at apex), but the thematic answer feels pre-packaged rather than earned through ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with Mara's perceptual signature clear (spectacles, notebooks, empirical focus). Voice modulates appropriately under pressure—short bursts during the vision cascade, longer syntax during renovation planning. The single line of dialogue ("Close your eyes...") carries subtext and advances plot, but the narration occasionally slips into elevated diction ("braided together with the melancholy intelligence") that reads slightly outside Mara's established empirical register during peak emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid ("copper-green comet," "burned cold, then warm"), but the piece exhibits multiple line-level artifacts: paraphrase loops ("creating a sanctuary where...could briefly touch" / "sculpting...a space where...could finally be heard together"), template cadence in the vision sequence, and stock metaphors ("falling stars," "heartbeat"). Filter-verb stacks appear in reflective passages ("understood that," "realized her skepticism"). The final third accumulates synonym churn ("transcribed...translated...mapped") that dulls propulsion. Deductions: −0.8 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for filter stacks = baseline ~6.9, further lowered to 6.1 for artifacts touching closure gestures.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—skeptical astronomer discovers mystical artifact during celestial event—follows a familiar template (scientist confronts inexplicable phenomenon, undergoes transformation). The magic square tile with Sumerian astronomy and phosphorescence reads as decorative rather than transformed through specific lived detail. The whale-song-as-symphony concept is poetic but not novel, and the resolution (renovation to make inaudible audible) unfolds without friction or non-obvious moral calculus. Transformation test: swapping names/setting would leave the emotional arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara as sympathetic skeptic is present early (cataloging movements, dismissing hums, helping elderly astronomers) and her choice to press the tile and design renovations drives two beats, but her skepticism dissolves instantly upon contact rather than creating sustained friction. The attribute shapes tactics (transcription, alcove design) and appears in the closure (welcoming visitors), meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. However, the skeptic-to-believer shift lacks visible cost—no dramatized loss of former identity or peer standing—reducing irreplaceability. Strong beat involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (+0.8) lift the score, but swappability (another researcher archetype could serve) and summary-only transformation (−0.5) limit the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears at the structural midpoint (beat 1: extraction from mortar; beat 2: pressed to forehead unlocking visions; beat 3: transcription into architectural plans; beat 4: mounted at tower apex in closure). Its specific properties (jade, four inches squared, adds to thirty-four, phosphorescent, Sumerian patterns) enable Mara's acoustic design and are irreplaceable. Setup (+0.5), three-beat involvement (+1.4), causal pressure (narrows options from passive observation to active renovation, +1.0), and closure linkage (mounted apex, charging structure, +1.2) total ~4.1 baseline + adjustments = 6.8. Late first appearance (past 40% mark) applies cap at 4.6, but strong transformation and charged reprise in ending elevate within allowable lyric-resonance band to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Entangled memories is seeded early ("generations of stargazers...their solitude and wonder braided together") and drives the vision-cascade beat when Mara experiences "not her own but entangled memories," enabling her understanding of the tower's purpose. It shapes one key turn (realization) and primes the final communion gesture, meeting setup and payoff gates but minimal middle development. Causal pressure (+0.6), one-beat involvement (+0.4), closure linkage via thematic echo (+0.5) total ~4.5. However, the concept could be swapped for "collective consciousness" or "ancestral knowledge" with minor edits (−0.5), and its mechanics remain abstract rather than constraining specific tactics, capping the score at functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Courageously kind appears as label in "courageously kind determination" and "courageously vulnerable in her newfound faith," but on-page actions (helping elderly astronomers, patient explanations to children, arranging cushions) demonstrate kindness without visible cost tied to courage. The trait does not constrain a choice where kindness conflicts with another value or requires sacrifice. Setup present (early mentions of helping), closure label-drop (final paragraph), but no middle beat where the attribute forces a trade-off. Label-only use (−0.8) and ornamental function (−0.6) place this in the low-functional band despite brief closure mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transcribe appears explicitly in beat 3 ("began to transcribe the tile's matrix, translating its mathematical poetry into architectural plans") and implicitly in the renovation outcome, driving the middle turn from vision to action. The action is specific and irreplaceable—Mara's choice to encode the tile's geometry reshapes the tower's function and enables the final communion scene. Setup via foreshadowing (notebooks, calculations), strong development beat (+0.9), causal pressure (the transcription narrows options from passive wonder to active construction, +1.2), and closure linkage (the designed niches host the ending moment, +1.0) elevate the score. Swappability is low; "interpret" or "copy" would not carry the same translation mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Forgotten patterns appears in "forgotten patterns of Sumerian astronomy" (tile description) and "through forgotten patterns of sacred geometry" (design work), shaping Mara's method for the renovation. The phrase is present in two beats and its mechanics (geometric ratios, sound-conducting curves) matter to the acoustic outcome, meeting setup and development gates. However, "ancient knowledge" or "lost techniques" could replace it with minimal edits (−0.6), and the method is summary-described rather than dramatized step-by-step. One-beat involvement (+0.4), causal enabler (+0.6), closure contribution (designs realized in niches, +0.5) minus swappability = mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stargazer's open tower is present throughout, frames all action, and its physical features (dome, parapet with loose coping stone, library, whale-watching windows, meditation niches, apex) directly enable discovery (tile embedded in mortar), transformation (visions via limestone conducting whale song), and closure (visitors in acoustic alcoves). Setup immediate (+0.8), three-beat involvement (discovery, design, welcoming visitors, +1.4), causal pressure (architecture shapes tactics and constraints, +1.3), closure linkage (final image occurs within the redesigned space, +1.5), and irreplaceability (no generic observatory would offer the same acoustic/geometric properties, +0.6) total strong integration. The tower functions as both micro-setting and instrument, meeting the Q3 quick test for setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Whale migration is signaled early ("during whale migration, the tower filled with tourists") and actively shapes two beats: the vision-cascade moment ("as whales breached in the silvered distance, their songs vibrating through the tower's limestone bones") and the implicit timeframe for Mara's overnight renovation design ("by dawn"). The migration provides atmospheric pressure and tightens the window for action, but does not function as a live clock forcing harder trade-offs—Mara's work proceeds without visible time constraint or missed opportunity. Setup (+0.6), two-beat involvement (+0.9), causal atmosphere (+0.5), closure contribution (visitors arrive "that morning" within migration season, +0.4) minus lack of tactical pressure from ticking clock (−0.4) = mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To sculpt space for reflection is stated explicitly in the vision sequence ("the tower's true purpose: to sculpt space for reflection") and enacted through Mara's renovation design (alcoves, meditation niches, arranging cushions). The motivation drives her transcription and redesign choices across two beats, meeting development and payoff gates. However, the desire is declared via epiphany rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page friction between Mara's wish to create sanctuary and a competing professional or personal cost. Setup via implicit foreshadowing (helping others, patient explanations, +0.4), two-beat involvement (+0.9), causal shaping of tactics (+0.8), closure linkage (welcoming gesture, +0.6) minus told-only articulation (−0.5) = upper-5s range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unheard symphony is seeded early ("locals' insistence that the stones hummed," "unheard symphony directly") and modulates through the piece: initial skepticism, vision-cascade heightening ("music without notes, felt in the marrow"), renovation mechanics (sound-conducting curves to make songs "audible"), and closure instruction ("the migration creates an unheard symphony"). Tone coherence is strong—lyrical, wonder-focused—and the final image charges the concept by making the inaudible accessible. Setup (+0.6), three-beat modulation (+1.4), causal link to stakes (the symphony's inaccessibility is the problem Mara solves, +0.8), closure charge (+1.0) minus slight static repetition (the phrase recurs without evolving texture, −0.4) = low-6s, meeting the lyric-reprise allowance for tonal elements.</comment>
