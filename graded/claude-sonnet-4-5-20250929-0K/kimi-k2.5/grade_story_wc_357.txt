<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to find the source of resilience is clear and drives her through the inverted landscape, but her interior remains thin—she operates as a conduit for exposition rather than a character under genuine pressure. The "resilience wasn't biological but memorial" realization arrives as a download rather than an earned insight shaped by prior contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is sparse; her stomach lurches once, but most beats externalize observation without internal friction or micro-choices that reveal competing values. The ending gesture (touching the artifact, receiving knowledge) lacks visible cost or renunciation that would foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines, and the one-hour gravity window provides a clear structural container. Causality operates in a guided-tour mode: Kael navigates to the convergence point, finds the artifact, downloads its knowledge, and departs—each step follows because/therefore logic but lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing (resilience as continuity, encoded in geology), but the cost remains abstract; no on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path makes the price felt. The inferred lens is Causal with accumulative flavor, but the ending reconfigures meaning without dramatizing what Kael loses or risks to carry that resonance forward.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating arches, inverted orchards, and upward-flowing rivers create a vivid, purpose-driven environment that constrains navigation and charges several images. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the rig's ascent and the magnetic clamp engagement. The broken arrow tip embedded in the keystone functions as micro-setting, anchoring the convergence point and charging the final image with temporal/geological weight. Sensory selection (bioluminescent groves, mossy underside, chromatic waves) reflects urgency and prioritizes the extraordinary physics of the inversion without postcard cataloging.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience before gravity restores—is signaled early and tracked by the chronometer. However, the journey unfolds as a series of observations rather than escalating choices; no live option is foreclosed, and Kael faces no tactical trade-off or loss that alters her approach. The twelve-minute warning adds time pressure, but her response (calibrate sensors, dive downward) proceeds without friction or visible sacrifice. Escalation under a Causal lens requires a tightening that narrows options or raises cost; here, the inversion itself provides spectacle but not a choice-forcing crucible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the broken arrow tip's function as a memorial anchor, and the concept of resilience-as-continuity reweights the opening expectation (genetic mutation) with layered particulars. The spectral farmers and the rig's self-repair embody inherited endurance without overt moralizing. The final image—orchards "singing with the echoes of those who had tended them before"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, though the line teeters near sentimentality. The passage "intrepidness wasn't merely individual courage but inheritance" risks thematic summary but is anchored by prior scene work (touching the artifact, receiving cultivation techniques).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with psychic distance controlled and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in Kael's professional filter (charting arches, calibrating sensors) and the prose carries a consistent, elevated register. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("memorial," "continuity itself") that feels essayistic rather than character-particular under pressure. Dialogue is absent (acceptable), and free indirect style is clean when used. Sentence rhythm modulates with scene needs—short bursts during the flip, longer lines during discovery—but some template stems recur ("She discovered," "She understood," "She worked quickly").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with strong concrete images (magnetic clamps, chromatic waves, water spiraling skyward). Information density is high in the middle third. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "those stone bridges that hovered" immediately followed by spatial restatement, and the "gathering of echoes" concept is restated across three lines without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "She [verb]" stems. Stock metaphors ("frozen lightning," "whirling silence") recur without fresh transformation. The figurative language in peak beats (touching the artifact, the data flood) remains functional but leans toward generic high-concept phrasing rather than body-specific sensation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—a gravity-inverting orchard planet with temporal echoes encoded in geology—synthesizes familiar SF elements (hostile terraforming, archaeological mystery, time-loop preservation) into a coherent whole. The broken arrow tip as both artifact and anchor point offers a specific, non-obvious twist on the "ancient solution" trope. However, the emotional arc (scientist discovers mystery, gains knowledge, returns changed) follows a well-worn template without bold risk or transformation; swapping Kael for another research protagonist would leave the plot largely intact. The spectral farmers and accelerated growth provide fresh visual texture, but the resolution (download data, depart) avoids the harder choice of staying, integrating, or facing a living cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael appears in the opening and makes the decision to navigate to the convergence point, touch the artifact, and record its frequency. These choices drive two beats (mid-journey navigation, artifact interaction) and shape the ending (departure with data). However, her agency reads as procedural rather than conflicted; no competing impulse or trade-off complicates her path. Early signal (+0.6), two-beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.9), but swappability with a generic "scientist explorer" (−0.6) and lack of visible cost (−0.4) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The broken arrow tip is signaled mid-story (~40% mark), serves as the causal anchor for the accelerated growth and temporal echoes, and appears in the ending when Kael records its frequency. It drives two distinct beats (discovery, touching/downloading knowledge) and carries irreplaceable properties (gravitational singularity, memorial anchor). Late arrival (−0.3), but strong causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.3), and specificity (+0.6) elevate the score. The final image references it indirectly ("the broken arrow tip's frequency humming"), securing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"A gathering of echoes" is named explicitly when Kael realizes the spectral farmers represent temporal recursion. The concept shapes her understanding of resilience-as-continuity and reweights the premise from biological to memorial. It appears in the middle third and the ending ("the trees already stronger, singing with the echoes"). Two-beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), but the concept functions primarily as thematic claim rather than tactical constraint. Swappability with "temporal memory" or similar phrasing (−0.5) and late first mention (−0.3) cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Accelerated plant growth is shown on the page ("vegetation exploded with unnatural speed, vines wrapping the stone in seconds") and enables the rig's self-repair, which could alter later tactics but does not visibly do so in the narrative. The trait is signaled mid-story, used in one beat with modest consequence, and mentioned in passing at the ending (trees "already stronger"). One-beat involvement (+0.4), modest causal pressure (+0.5), closure echo (+0.3), but no visible trade-off or cost tied to the acceleration (−0.4), and the rig repair feels ornamental rather than plot-critical (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Discovery drives the entire narrative: Kael's goal is to discover the source of resilience, and the act of discovering the arrow tip and its function constitutes the story's central turn. The action shapes three beats (charting arches, finding the artifact, touching it) and defines the closure (departing with the discovery's data). Early signal (+0.7), three-beat involvement (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.6), strong irreplaceability (+0.7). The action is essential but operates in observe-and-record mode rather than forcing a high-stakes choice with visible sacrifice (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Navigating by water flow is signaled early ("Now she navigated by water flow, following the rivers") and used twice: ascending to the convergence point and descending after the inversion. The method shapes mid-story tactics and the return journey, bracketing the discovery sequence. Two-beat involvement (+0.9), early signal (+0.5), closure participation (descent) (+0.8), but the mechanics remain abstract—what about water flow allows navigation is not dramatized with cost or constraint (−0.5). Swappability with "following the current" or similar phrasing (−0.4) limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The floating rock arches structure the entire setting, provide the only solid ground during inversion, and supply the keystone where the arrow tip is embedded. The arches constrain Kael's navigation (magnetic clamps, following arch topology) and charge the final image (arches tumbling back toward upper atmosphere). Present by the second sentence, the arches drive three beats (ascent, convergence, descent) and are irreplaceable to the world's logic. Early signal (+0.8), three-beat involvement (+1.4), closure linkage (+1.2), high specificity (+0.7). However, the arches function as stage rather than active pressure; they enable but do not resist (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The one-hour gravity inversion is signaled in the opening ("chronometer ticked toward the inversion") and tracked at two points: the flip itself and the twelve-minute warning. The timeframe tightens Kael's window for exploration and shapes the descent, functioning as a live clock. Two-beat involvement (+0.9), early signal (+0.6), closure participation (+0.7), causal pressure (forces timely departure) (+0.8). However, the hour passes largely off-page; we do not feel the clock narrowing options beat by beat, and the twelve-minute warning triggers procedural action rather than a forced trade-off (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Finding the source of resilience is Kael's stated goal from paragraph four and drives her navigation to the convergence point. The motivation shapes two beats (mid-journey search, artifact discovery) and defines the closure (departing with the answer). Early signal (+0.7), two-beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.1). However, the desire is declared and pursued without internal friction or competing want; no cost or renunciation tests her commitment. The motivation reads as assignment rather than personal stake (−0.7), and it remains told more than embodied in conflicted choices (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" appears three times: the opening pre-inversion moment, the middle description of the spectral farmers' "chorus of silent expertise swirling in the whirling silence," and the closing line. The tone—paradoxical stillness charged with latent energy—modulates across the piece, supporting the tension between motion and recursion. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → last line) reweights the opening cue (+1.2), closure linkage (+0.9), coherence through turns (+0.6). However, the phrase functions primarily as atmospheric label; it does not constrain choice or alter a beat's outcome (−0.7). Stock poetic construction (whirling + silence as oxymoron) reduces specificity (−0.4).</comment>
