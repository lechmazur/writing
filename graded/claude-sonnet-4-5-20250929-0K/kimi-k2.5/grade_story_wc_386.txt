<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to expose truth is consistent, but interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("weaving truth carefully," "salvage something pure") rather than embodied contradiction. The ghost captain's hesitation offers a window, yet Elara's micro-choices feel driven by authorial design rather than lived stakes—she moves through research and pronouncement without visible internal friction. The final promise to "weave your truth carefully" lands as thematic echo rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (dream-journal fragments assembling into a mosaic). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing—the melted snow globe reweighted as transformation rather than damage—but the cost remains abstract: no on-page action or renunciation demonstrates what Elara sacrifices or forecloses by committing to write this truth. The final image ("weaving the truth carefully so that the windows of connection might remain open") gestures toward consequence without making the price legible in a concrete beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glacier shrine, obsidian altar, candle-lit ice walls, and melted snow globe are vivid and sensory; the shrine's physicality (candles guttering as temperature drops, glacier groaning outside) grounds the scene. The snow globe constrains Elara's interpretation twice—once as warped evidence, once as transformed artifact—and the shrine functions as both micro-setting and conceptual pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment charges the final image of "borrowed starlight" filtering through ice, though the shrine itself does not alter a tactical choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing the captain's innocence and the child's survival—is signaled early, but pressure remains largely declarative. Elara's research and ghost encounter do not narrow her options or force a visible trade-off; the captain's flicker of hesitation is the lone on-page tightening, yet it dissolves without cost. The ending declares intent to "weave the truth" but does not dramatize a choice that forecloses a competing path or pays a price. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is required; here the pattern of dream fragments coheres intellectually but does not reweight stakes with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of truth-salvage and redemption versus greed emerges from the snow globe's transformation and the dream-journal mosaic, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image of distorted glass "having flowed like water to cradle the toy in eternal embrace" offers a resonant metaphor for sacrifice. However, the piece leans on prompt vocabulary ("weave truth carefully," "windows of connection," "salvage something pure") in ways that occasionally read as thematic claim rather than enacted pressure. The captain's sacrifice is reconstructed rather than tested on the page, diluting the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third on Elara; perceptual signature is present in her attention to "cameo appearances" and "borrowed starlight," though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("residual warmth of that sacrifice," "mosaic clearer than any single memory") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The ghost captain's single line of dialogue carries appropriate otherworldly weight. No head-hopping; free indirect style is mostly clean, but some abstractions ("concentrated essence of a father's love") flatten immediacy at a key moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally purposeful ("salt stains like tear tracks," "voice like cracking ice"). However, several beats recycle conceptual ground: "weave truth carefully" appears three times across opening, middle, and close without pressure gain; "cameo appearances" and "windows of connection" are restated in adjacent lines without added detail. The final paragraph loops through "borrowed starlight" twice and re-summarizes the method ("piecing together truth from subconscious debris") already established. Template stems ("she had traced," "she had analyzed," "she thought of") cluster in the second half, creating mild momentum drag. No severe artifacts touch closure, but cumulative redundancy lowers density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of wreck-diver ghost whisperer, dream-journal evidence gathering, and glacier shrine offers a layered premise, but the emotional arc—vindication of a wronged captain—follows a familiar template of historical revisionism. The melted snow globe's transformation from damage to embrace is the story's strongest synthesis, yet prompt vocabulary ("weave truth carefully," "windows of connection," "salvage something pure") recurs without sufficient transformation into character-specific idiom. The piece commits to its premise but does not deliver a non-obvious turn; the captain's innocence is revealed through summary rather than a choice that risks or costs Elara something on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation (wreck-diver ghost whisperer) frames the stakes. She makes one micro-choice—pointing to the fisherman's sketch to confront the captain—that opens his hesitation, a functional beat. However, most of her activity is research summary and declaration of intent ("I will weave your truth carefully"); the final decision to write does not dramatize a trade-off or alter tactics. Present by setup, involved in one beat, but replaceable with "investigator" or "historian" with minor edits. Late first appearance of her active choice (second half) and ornamental use of the occupation label lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in the opening paragraph (setup), is handled and interpreted twice (warped by heat, distorted as transformation rather than damage), and returns in the penultimate paragraph to charge the final image ("turning it so the candlelight illuminated the trapped ship inside"). It constrains Elara's reading of the wreck and participates in closure by embodying the captain's sacrifice. Three distinct beats, causal pressure on interpretation, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (its melted state is the key evidence) all present. However, the glass's "flow like water" is asserted rather than discovered through a micro-choice, slightly weakening the payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is introduced early (second paragraph), recurs in the middle beat ("the window of connection open wider"), and is named again in the final lines as stakes ("windows of connection might remain open"). It shapes Elara's method—dream fragments as portals—but does not constrain a tactical choice or force a visible trade-off on the page. The concept functions thematically and metaphorically rather than as a live pressure; removing "windows" and substituting "links" or "threads" would leave the plot intact. Present across beats but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears in the opening paragraph as character description, is echoed in the middle ("Elara wove truth carefully, for the dead speak in riddles"), and recurs in the final promise ("I will weave your truth carefully"). The trait is stated rather than demonstrated through a visible cost or constraint; Elara's care does not prevent a mistake or force her to withhold information. The attribute functions as thematic label without altering tactics or outcome. Present but ornamental, and swappable with "constructs truth methodically."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Expose" is the dominant verb of Elara's goal, named in paragraph one ("exposing the truth of the *Sovereign's* sinking") and restated in the ending ("to expose the captain's innocence"). It frames the stakes but does not drive a specific turn; the act of exposure is declared rather than enacted on the page—no scene shows her presenting findings or facing resistance. The action is present in setup and closure but summary-only; replacing "expose" with "reveal" or "document" would require minimal edits. Functional stake but not irreplaceable execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method—analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams—is introduced early (journals "recording cameo appearances in strangers' dreams"), demonstrated in the middle beat (fisherman's dream sketch, pattern recognition across villages), and referenced at closure ("through the windows of connection she had opened—the dreams of strangers"). It shapes Elara's evidence-gathering across three beats and is specific enough to be irreplaceable (dream fragments as subconscious residue). However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized; no scene shows her questioning a villager or interpreting a dream under pressure. Setup, development, and payoff present but summary-only execution limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The shrine is anchored in the opening line, supplies sensory pressure (candles flickering, temperature drop, glacier groaning), and frames the final image ("borrowed starlight filtering through the glacier"). The obsidian altar and ice walls are handled twice (Elara kneeling at the shrine, later lifting the snow globe). However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara could conduct this research anywhere—and the shrine functions primarily as atmospheric stage rather than active pressure. Present across setup, middle, and closure; vivid but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is named early as Elara's motivation, repeated mid-story ("she sought to salvage something pure"), and echoed in the final paragraph ("to salvage something pure from the wreckage required not just recovering artifacts"). It drives the dominant stake and is tied to the ending image of transformation. However, the desire is told rather than tested; no on-page choice forces Elara to sacrifice competing goods or endure a cost. Present in setup, development, and closure; causal but not dramatized with friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears in the opening line, recurs twice in the middle ("dissolved into the borrowed starlight"), and closes the story ("this moment of borrowed starlight against the long polar night"). The tone is ethereal and elegiac, consistent across beats, and the metaphor charges the final image by linking light to transience and guardianship. However, the phrase functions primarily as lyric texture rather than pressure that modulates with conflict. Present and purposeful but ornamental; the story's tone could hold with "faint starlight" or similar substitutions.</comment>
