<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's perceptive trait is demonstrated through action (listening, detecting vibrations, reading echoes), and her understanding evolves from technical mapping to emotional archaeology. The character makes choices that advance the narrative—descending to the vault, studying the negative—but internal contradiction is minimal; she processes discovery in a steady, contemplative register without competing impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "carry the past so the walls could finally rest" feels thematically stated rather than dramatized through a visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page. Embodied emotion appears selectively (burden pressing against chest) but much interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who (Mara, corridor echo cartographer), where (ivy-veiled passage, eastern wing, cellar vault), and when (post-climate shifts) within the opening paragraphs, satisfying the orientation test. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through discovery layering (echoes → diaries → film negative → recognition of terrace → epiphany about walls dreaming of wholeness), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's understanding deepens and she accepts the burden with felt cost ("settled upon her shoulders"). The closure reweights her mapping mission from physical documentation to memory preservation. One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost is conceptual and emotional, legible in the final image of carrying the past forward. No causality breaks; the pattern holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposeful: damp stone, broken windows, cracked marble tiles, collapsed ceiling, flooded basement. The ivy-veiled passage returns as a framing device that charges the opening and closing. Sensory selection reflects the cartographer's professional filter (vibrations, echoes, structural details) and the post-apocalyptic context (pooled rain, moldy darkness, water-damaged books). The film negative's interaction with flashlight and the terrace recognition ground the climactic discovery spatially. The physical environment constrains Mara's movement (descent through darkness, rusted cabinet) and the vault location shapes the discovery sequence, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what walls witness and dream—is signaled early and drives each discovery beat. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens: echoes feel heavier → diaries reveal Elias's obsession → vault reference tightens the search → film negative provides the answer. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara recognizes the terrace and understands the burden of legacy. The cost is conceptual and felt ("burden settled upon her shoulders"), though it remains largely internalized rather than a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options. Agency is present in the descent, discovery, and acceptance, but the resolution leans toward epiphany rather than a decision that forecloses a live alternative with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars: the half-burned diaries, film negative of garden party, walls remembering laughter, stars now visible through broken ceiling. The concept of "legacy's burden" integrates naturally through Mara's evolving understanding rather than thesis statements, though phrases like "burden of legacy" and "what walls dream about" recur in ways that border on thematic echo. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Mara charts memory's topography, carrying the past so walls can rest—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between Elias's guilt and Mara's acceptance, in the film negative as ghost of color in a gray world. The story invites reflection on witness, preservation, and the cost of inaction through image and action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited focused on Mara; psychic distance is controlled and deepens appropriately at key moments. Voice carries a distinct poetic texture ("ivy-veiled passage," "topography of memory," "stubborn persistence of witness") that remains consistent and apt for a contemplative post-apocalyptic exploration. Perceptual signature is clear: Mara notices structural details, vibrations, and echoes that others would miss, filtered through her professional lens. Some diction verges on elevated register ("sensitively perceptive," "continuity, the stubborn persistence of witness") that reads slightly external to organic thought under discovery pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or POV leakage. The prose reflects Mara's contemplative mind, though a few phrases approach thematic summary rather than dramatized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies appropriately, and sensory detail is vivid. However, pattern artifacts accumulate: "burden of legacy" appears three times, "ivy-veiled passage" recurs mechanically, and several phrases loop conceptually ("walls remember/witness/dream"). Template cadence appears in parallel structures: "She entered... She descended... She climbed... She pressed... She packed... She stepped." Figurative language is dense without always advancing pressure: "ghost of color in a gray world," "topography of memory," "corridor echoed with footsteps that had ceased." Some filter-verb stacking ("she could almost hear," "she realized," "she understood") dulls immediacy in peak beats. The final paragraph's thematic summary ("She carried the past so the walls could finally rest") tells rather than showing the cost through image or action. Information density is generally high, but scaffold phrases and synonym churn (discover/glimpse/understand, burden/legacy/cost) drag momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise of an echo cartographer mapping abandoned buildings after climate collapse offers a fresh angle, and the film negative as preserved memory is a strong concrete choice. The story synthesizes familiar post-apocalyptic material with the specific occupational lens of acoustic archaeology. However, the emotional arc—solitary explorer discovers artifact, gains epiphanic understanding, accepts burden of preserving memory—follows a well-worn template without substantial transformation. The "what walls dream about" framing device is poetic but borders on abstraction; the answer (continuity, wholeness, occupancy) is somewhat predictable. The choice to interleave Elias's story through diaries adds complexity, but his arc (guilt → attempted burning → preservation) mirrors familiar climate-fiction tropes. Specificity in setting and the cartographer's perceptual filter provide freshness, yet the core journey from discovery to acceptance lacks a non-obvious turn that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as corridor echo cartographer shapes her perceptual filter (listening for building's pulse, detecting vibrations) and drives her method throughout. Her professional skill enables the discovery sequence (reading echoes, mapping space) and her understanding evolves from technical mapping to emotional archaeology. The character makes choices—descending to vault, studying the negative, deciding to carry the past forward—that advance the narrative. Present in setup, middle beats (descent, discovery), and ending (acceptance of burden). However, the choices are largely exploratory rather than constrained dilemmas; the cartographer role enables discovery but doesn't create meaningful friction or cost. Strong professional specificity and beat involvement, but agency leans observational.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The film negative strip is seeded in the diaries, discovered in the vault (middle beat), and examined via flashlight to reveal garden party images. It returns in the ending as "ghost of color in a gray world" and is packed into the protective case. The object enables the climactic recognition (terrace, children, wholeness) and charges the final understanding of what walls dream about. Three distinct beats: discovery, examination/revelation, and closure integration. Causal role is strong—the negative provides the evidence Elias preserved and the visual proof of lost continuity. Specificity is high (film negative, not photograph or diary entry) because its curled fragility and inverted shadows carry particular resonance. Strong setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" appears explicitly three times and shapes thematic resonance throughout. The concept is embodied in Elias's guilt and preservation attempt, in Mara's recognition of inheriting "a world too damaged to save," and in her final acceptance ("burden settled upon her shoulders"). It pressures Mara's understanding: she must decide whether to mourn or carry forward. However, the burden functions more as theme than as a stake that narrows tactical options on the page. The concept reweights the mapping mission from physical documentation to memory preservation, but this shift is contemplative rather than a choice with visible cost or forfeited alternative. Present in setup (Elias's entries), developed through discovery, and integrated at closure, but operates primarily at the thematic rather than tactical level.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's "sensitively perceptive nature" is mentioned once explicitly and demonstrated through her ability to detect vibrations others miss and read echoes differently. The trait enables her professional skill and drives her discovery of heavier, unspoken history in the echoes. However, it functions primarily as enabler without visible tradeoff or cost; there's no moment where heightened perception creates friction, overwhelm, or forces a difficult choice. The attribute shapes method (listening, detecting) but doesn't constrain action or impose burden on the page. Label-only mention trends low; demonstration through action elevates slightly, but absence of cost or complication caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Glimpse" appears twice: Mara tries to glimpse images in the negative, and Elias hoped someone would glimpse what was lost. The action drives the climactic recognition beat when inverted shadows resolve into garden party, terrace, children—the moment that redefines Mara's understanding and completes her quest. The glimpse is necessary for the revelation and cannot be swapped easily (examining or studying wouldn't carry the same fleeting, fragile quality). Present in the pivotal discovery beat and referenced in Elias's motivation, but not seeded early. Strong causal role at closure, but late first appearance and single primary beat limit integration depth.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries found in the fireplace are discovered in the eastern wing early (setup), provide the vault clue (middle development), and their final entries are transcribed at dawn (closure frame). The method shapes Mara's access to Elias's story and his preservation attempt; the fact that they're half-burned carries thematic weight (tried to burn guilt but saved evidence). The fireplace location is specific and the charred-but-legible state enables the discovery sequence. Three beats: discovery, reading for vault reference, dawn transcription. The method is irreplaceable—finding intact diaries elsewhere would lose the burned/preserved contradiction. Strong setup, development, and payoff with specific mechanics that matter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage frames the opening and closing, providing atmospheric continuity. It appears in four instances: opening description, Mara stepping through roots, return as sunset filters through, and final departure. However, the passage functions primarily as threshold and atmospheric anchor rather than constraint or tactical resource. It doesn't pressure choices or supply obstacles that alter Mara's movement or decisions; she passes through freely. The ivy and broken windows establish post-collapse setting vividly, but the passage itself is largely postcard description. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → final paragraph) reweights the dominant stake slightly, moving from witness to carrying forward, which qualifies for mid-band consideration under the allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the climate shifts" is established early and provides the causal context for the emptied coastal cities, Mara's return, and the building's abandonment. It shapes the why (mapping what remains, understanding loss) and the emotional stakes (inheriting damaged world). The twenty-year gap mentioned gives temporal specificity. However, the timeframe is static backdrop rather than live pressure; there's no ticking clock or temporal constraint that forces Mara's choices. The climate shifts enable the premise and charge the thematic weight (droughts, rising seas, grid death), but they function as completed past event rather than active pressure. Setup is clear, thematic weight is high, but tactical constraint is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to discover what walls dream about" is seeded in the opening (listening for building's pulse, walls remember everything), drives the exploration through diaries and vault descent, and is answered at closure (walls dream of wholeness, occupancy, continuity). The motivation creates friction when "echoes felt different, heavier" and when she recognizes the burden of witnessing. The question is dramatized through action—listening, reading, descending, glimpsing—rather than told. The answer reconfigures her mapping mission from physical charting to memory preservation with felt cost. Strong setup, beats throughout middle (each discovery step pursues the question), and payoff that reweights the stake. Specificity is high (not just "understand the past" but what walls dream). Minor limitation: the friction is contemplative rather than agonized choice between competing wants.</comment>
