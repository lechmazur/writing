<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and particular—"their fingers found the cylinder in their coat pocket, the carved handle warm"—but motivation operates primarily through declaration rather than contradictory impulses. The character performs righteous pursuit without visible cost or hesitation until the task is complete; no micro-choice tests commitment under pressure. Internal conflict is absent: Kael moves through the beats with singular focus, never wavering between competing goods or unavoidable harms.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The accumulative lens is inferred and held: the gramophone revelation deepens stakes by exposing coordinates, signatures, vault locations—each oscillating mote reweighting the dominant stake (collapsing the dynasty). Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: "by dawn, the Aureate name would be ash" crystallizes the ending with conceptual cost (the dynasty's end is certain, the evidence now in Kael's cipher book). One deduction: the causality is linear rather than because/therefore linked; Kael's success is uncontested, and no reversal tightens options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sepia reading room and the gramophone are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—"vanilla scent of aging deceit," dust motes forming letters. The resonator's brass throat and the standing waves constrain the final action: Kael must maintain the frequency to hold the truth aloft, and speaking would shatter the acoustic field. Spatial choreography is clean. Deduction: the room does not evolve with events; once the revelation begins, setting becomes static backdrop rather than evolving pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (collapse the dynasty by uncovering hidden truth) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening: the standing waves spelling out coordinates, signatures, and vault locations escalate the evidence from abstract goal to concrete indictment. Agency is present but passive: Kael turns the handle and copies symbols without facing a meaningful trade-off or live opposition. The winding-down spring introduces urgency but no on-page cost or tactic shift; Kael simply copies before it fades.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (truth as resonance, silence as eloquence, documentation as revolution) emerges through concrete particulars—the acoustic field, the gramophone's mechanics, the "eloquently silent turning of the handle." The final image reweights prior material: gardens growing from burial grounds, the dynasty ending "not with bloodshed, but with the quiet turning of a handle." One slip: "the weight of unveiled truth" in the final sentence borders on abstraction. No overt moralizing, and the ending offers a resonant answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—"bridge of intuition," "oscillating silence into comprehension without the interference of spoken language." Register drift is the primary issue: elevated diction ("eloquently silent grace of a dynasty ender," "the vanilla scent of aging deceit," "invisible geometry and vibrating potential") saturates nearly every sentence, often clashing with the physical immediacy required in peak beats. The voice reads as committee consensus rather than Kael's particular perception under pressure. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose occasionally ventriloquizes the world's mythology rather than filtering through Kael's present attention.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting penalty: figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching—"sepia reading room exhaled dust motes," "evening stretched its first yawn," "golden banners masking iron fists," "particles collaborating to expose what ink could not safely record"—creating density without proportionate pressure gain (−0.6). Mixed metaphor: "each step erasing centuries" while "legitimacy crumbled like dry parchment" stacks incompatible vehicles (−0.3). Template cadence in the middle third: "The mechanism groaned, then sang... The physics of resonance... The suspended particles... Each oscillating mote..." (−0.4). Paraphrase loop: "eloquently silent" appears three times across the text, twice in identical phrasing. Information density is high in the revelation beat, but momentum sags under ornamental layering elsewhere. Cumulative Q7 artifact penalty: −1.3, placing the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise (acoustic archaeology, standing-wave revelation) is fresh and conceptually integrated. Execution is specific—ivory crank, brass throat, dust forming letters—and the mechanics shape the climax. Deduction for proximity to familiar material: the "righteous archivist uncovering regime crimes" frame is widely used, and while the acoustic method is novel, the emotional arc and stakes follow a template path without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.7 per Derivative Premise Guardrail). The ending's synthesis (silent turning, documentary justice) feels earned but not surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes the final decision to copy the symbols, but the character's key action (inserting the crank, turning it, copying) is not contested or complicated by internal contradiction. The "dynasty ender" role is declared rather than tested; Kael's choice does not narrow live options with visible cost on the page. Two beats: recovery of the crank (backstory) and the transcription (present). Closure participation is summative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The gramophone crank handle is recovered (beat one, backstory), inserted and turned (beat two, mid-scene), and its winding down creates urgency (beat three, near closure). The object enables the revelation and its spiral grooves are mechanically specific. Deduction: the handle resolves a problem it did not help create; it arrives fully functional without prior struggle to obtain or operate it (−0.7 per resolves-problem cap). Strong closure linkage and causal pressure lift it into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A bridge of intuition" is named twice—once describing the phantom architect's encoding, once describing Kael's translation of oscillating silence. It appears as thematic echo rather than on-page constraint. The bridge metaphor does not alter Kael's tactics or choices; the revelation proceeds mechanically once the crank is turned. Swappable with "leap of understanding" or similar (−0.5). No middle development or closure participation beyond label.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" is mentioned three times: opening, midpoint, and near the end. It constrains one choice—Kael cannot speak without shattering the acoustic field—but that constraint is told rather than tested (no temptation to speak, no cost paid for silence). The attribute functions as a label for Kael's method rather than a lived tradeoff. Introduced early, present at closure, but ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Muse" appears once in backstory: "They mused upon the phantom architect who had encoded this message decades ago." The action is reflective summary rather than a dramatized choice. No causal link to a major turn; swappable with "reflect," "wonder," or "consider" without structural impact. Late appearance (past midpoint), no middle development, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Through standing waves" is signaled early ("Its brass throat gaping"), enacted at the climax ("sound arranged the dust into crystalline patterns"), and its mechanics constrain the ending (maintaining frequency, not speaking). Three beats: setup, revelation, and urgency as the spring winds down. The method is causally essential: without standing waves, no revelation; without maintaining the tone, the evidence disperses. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is anchored in the opening line and returns in the ending ("In the golden shadows"). The room's acoustics enable the standing-wave revelation, and its "walls lined with leather volumes that whispered lies" primes the contrast with the airborne truth. Deduction: the room does not evolve or constrain a middle choice; once the revelation begins, it becomes static backdrop. Lyric reprise (first line → final third) reweights the space as complicit-then-revelatory, qualifying for ~6.3 under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"In the first yawn of evening" appears in the opening and the winding-down spring introduces urgency near the end: "The standing waves wavered as the spring wound down, the dust letters trembling in the first yawn of evening's deeper darkness." The timeframe tightens the final beat, but elapsed time is vague and does not constrain middle choices. Two touches (setup and closure), mild pressure at the end, but no live clock that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To uncover a hidden truth" is the stated motivation in the opening paragraph and drives the entire sequence: Kael seeks evidence, operates the gramophone, and copies the revelation. The desire is dramatized through action (inserting the crank, turning it, copying symbols) but not conflicted—no friction between wants and costs, no temptation to abandon the task or competing loyalty. Three beats (setup, middle action, closure), strong causal role, but one-note in execution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in the opening line and the final paragraph ("In the golden shadows, Kael's eyes reflected the standing waves' glow"), modulating from passive description to active reflection of the revelation. The tone is consistent—somber, atmospheric, charged with historical weight—and supports the accumulative pressure. Deduction: the tone does not modulate with urgency or risk; it remains static across beats. Lyric reprise charges the final image, but the mood is one-note throughout.</comment>
