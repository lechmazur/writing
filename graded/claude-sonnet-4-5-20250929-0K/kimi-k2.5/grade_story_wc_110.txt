<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to expose complicity is clear and embodied through concrete choices (extending tickets, admitting the cover-up). Internal contradiction appears when loyalty calcifies into suspicion, but the final choice feels slightly muted—she decides to file the report off-page rather than in a dramatized peak moment. Julian's desperation is shown through the doodles and his whispered confession, yet his interiority remains thin. The piece stays within two characters and avoids head-hopping, but emotional progression leans toward therapeutic articulation ("thaw mistrust with transparency") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mara and Julian agree to confess tomorrow, and the cost is visible in the report she will file and the lens Julian pockets as self-surveillance. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered discovery (tickets, lens, confession) and the forecourt's acoustic imagery recurs with shifted weight. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara's honesty "opened the space between them," narrowing options and foreclosing silence. The ending image reweights the premise (transparency as willingness to examine shadows together) with felt cost, though the decision to act "tomorrow" defers the highest-stakes beat slightly off-page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain functions as both atmosphere and constraint: its acoustic resonance mirrors the theme of transparency, and the rain-soaked setting provides the cathedral of sound where "secrets had no mass." The projector lens is handled twice (examination, then pocketed by Julian), transforming from discovery tool to mirror. Spatial choreography is clean (desk, forecourt, east colonnade), and sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("quartzite pavers that hummed with acoustic memory"). The micro-setting (forecourt) charges the final image and constrains the emotional exchange, meeting the 9+ gate. Minor issue: "mahogany groove where thousands of tickets had been torn" is vivid but slightly ornamental, not revisited.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake (whether to expose the hidden surveillance and complicity) is signaled early and tightens once: Mara's discovery of the tickets forces a choice between continued silence and transparency. The confession in the forecourt narrows options and forecloses mutual suspicion with visible cost (Julian's shoulders drop, Mara will file the report). Agency is present in Mara's decision to extend the tickets "not as accusation, but as offering." The lens (Accumulative/Textural) supports the escalation—pressure builds through layered reveals rather than causal reversals. However, the highest-stakes action (filing the report, telling the board) is deferred to "tomorrow," muting the on-page cost slightly. No antagonist is required, and coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (transparency as willingness to examine shadows together, not absence of shadows) emerges organically from the forecourt imagery, the lens as projection-turned-reflection, and Mara's confession. The final image—"crystal singing to water, water answering with truth"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (Julian pockets the lens, Mara takes back one ticket) and the space "opened…like a door swinging wide." One slip: "freed by honesty rather than constrained by it" and "transparency became the medium" edge toward thematic echo, restating the premise in prompt-like language. The northwest-corner crack as structural metaphor is purposeful but borders on overt symbolism. Complexity is present: honesty does not erase betrayal but transforms it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to Mara with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices "mahogany groove," "graphite scratches," and acoustic details filtered through her registrar role. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Julian's "I wasn't trying to steal" pursues exoneration, and his lines carry subtext. Distance is controlled, though some diction ("thaw mistrust with transparency," "crystallizing with each breath") drifts into elevated register during peak emotional beats, slightly outside a night registrar's plausible lexicon under stress. Syntax varies purposefully, and free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: "Julian's shoulders dropped" is a gestural cliché; embodied emotion could be sharper.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several runs lean toward overwriting: "the resonant hush of ventilation and settling foundations," "the timeframe after words become unnecessary, when truth could be transmitted through presence alone," and "a cathedral of resonance where secrets had no mass" stack figurative language in adjacent lines without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in "She stepped…She placed…She spoke…She walked," a four-sentence stem run in the climax section. One paraphrase loop: "honesty opened the space" and "freed by honesty" restate the same concept within two paragraphs. Clarity remains high, and no loops obscure causality or closure, so deductions stay within the non-closure cap. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—surveillance-as-protection revealed through concert-hall lost-and-found doodles—is specific and non-obvious. The forecourt's acoustic resonance and the lens repurposed for reflection offer fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc (colleague betrayal → mutual confession → agreement to face consequences together) follows a template trajectory, and the thematic resolution ("transparency as willingness to examine shadows") is earnest but not startling. The northwest-corner crack as structural metaphor and the "crystal whispering" motif add textural interest but border on symbolic convenience. Transformation test: swapping the concert hall for another institutional setting and the lens for a different tool would leave the arc largely intact. Conceptual integrity is present; no retreat from the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (quiet night registrar) drives the inciting beat (unlocking lost-and-found, examining tickets), the middle turn (stepping outside, extending tickets to Julian), and the ending decision (agreeing to file the report and tell the board). Her observation becomes decision at each beat, and her final choice to "file the incident report she should have written weeks ago" alters tactics with visible cost. Present in setup (paragraph one), middle (forecourt confession), and ending (walking home, report pending). The role itself (registrar with access to lost-and-found and knowledge of the building) is causally necessary.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The projector lens appears in three beats: Mara borrows it to examine tickets (paragraph two), she places it in Julian's palm to show him his own betrayal (paragraph four), and Julian pockets it as "surveillance turned inward" (paragraph seven). Its specific property—transforming "chaotic lines into something ambiguously clear"—enables the discovery and reweights meaning at closure ("a tool for projection now repurposed for reflection"). Early signal (paragraph two), causal pressure (reveals the map), closure linkage (Julian keeps it as mirror). Swapping it for a magnifying glass would preserve function but lose the projection/reflection metaphor, so irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" shapes the dominant stake (whether to confess) and alters tactics: Mara's honesty "opened the space between them like a door swinging wide, freed by honesty rather than constrained by it." The concept appears in the ending turn and charges the final image ("water answering with truth"). However, it also functions as theme statement rather than on-page constraint—the mechanics of how honesty *changes options* are shown (Julian's posture shifts, they agree to confess), but the concept itself is articulated more than dramatized. Present in setup (Mara's motivation), middle (confession), and ending (final paragraph), meeting all three gates. Cost is visible (mutual exposure pending).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is illustrated once with cost: the lens transforms doodles "into something ambiguously clear," enabling Mara to see both the map and Julian's fear. The attribute constrains interpretation—clarity coexists with ambiguity, matching the theme. However, it functions primarily as descriptor rather than recurring constraint; no later choice hinges on navigating ambiguity versus clarity. Present in the inciting beat (paragraph two) and echoed thematically at closure ("transparency was not the absence of shadows"), but middle development is thin. A single strong beat lifts it to mid-band, but swappability (could be "mysteriously legible" or similar) and limited causal spread prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eavesdropping (Julian's surveillance of board meetings) is the story's inciting problem: Mara discovers evidence of it, and the entire conflict turns on whether to expose it. The action is signaled early (paragraph two: "Julian had been eavesdropping"), drives the middle confession ("I was trying to understand why they wanted to sell the building"), and shapes the ending decision (both will confess tomorrow). The mechanics matter: Julian used the building's blind spots, and Mara covered for him. However, the eavesdropping itself occurs off-page; we see only its aftermath. Present across all three gates with clear causal weight, but not indispensable—swapping for "unauthorized records access" would preserve the arc with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cryptic doodles on concert tickets are the method of discovery: Mara finds them (paragraph one), examines them through the lens (paragraph two), and extends them to Julian as evidence (paragraph four). The method is signaled early and its mechanics matter—"spirals and angular marks" that "vibrate with hidden intention" become "a map of the building's blind spots" under magnification. Present in setup, middle (Mara uses them to confront Julian), and ending (she keeps one ticket as reminder). However, the tickets themselves are passive evidence; any marked surface could serve. Specificity (vintage concert tickets in a concert hall) adds thematic fit but not irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt after rain supplies the setting for the confession and closure. Its acoustic properties ("dripped water onto quartzite pavers that hummed," "a cathedral of resonance") create the atmosphere where "secrets had no mass" and enable the emotional turn. The setting is signaled early (paragraph three), constrains the middle beat (Julian emerges "from the shadows near the east colonnade"), and charges the final image ("the forecourt continued its whispered song, crystal singing to water, water answering with truth"). Micro-setting (glass canopy, pavers, acoustics) alters the tone and stakes of the confession. Swapping it for a generic outdoor space would drain thematic resonance. Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" appears once as poetic timestamp: "The droplets created a language of percussion, speaking in the timeframe after words become unnecessary, when truth could be transmitted through presence alone" (paragraph three). It colors the tone but does not tighten decisions or shape tactics—the confession still uses words ("I wasn't trying to steal," Mara's admission). The phrase is ornamental rather than constraint. No setup, no middle pressure, and closure participation is thematic echo only. Present but non-functional; label-only mention trends low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to thaw mistrust with transparency" is dramatized through her choice to extend the tickets, confess her complicity, and file the report. The desire is shown in conflict: loyalty versus honesty, silence versus exposure. Friction between wants (protect Julian) and costs (mutual suspicion, complicity) drives the middle beats. Setup is clear (paragraph three: "her motivation crystallizing"), development in the forecourt confession, and payoff in the agreement to "tell them tomorrow." Cost is visible (she will expose herself). The phrasing itself ("thaw mistrust with transparency") appears as internal articulation, slightly therapeutic but grounded in concrete action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" recurs across the story: "the resonant hush of ventilation" (paragraph one), "his voice barely disturbing the resonant hush between the glass walls" (paragraph four), "in the resonant hush between rain and dawn" (final paragraph). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure—shifts from ambient emptiness to charged silence during confession to post-closure calm. It charges the final image ("the forecourt continued its whispered song") and integrates with the acoustic setting. However, it remains a consistent mood rather than a dynamic force that escalates pressure. Present across all three gates with thematic cohesion, but static application prevents top-band score.</comment>
