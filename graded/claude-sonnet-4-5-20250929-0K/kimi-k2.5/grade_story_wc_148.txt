<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority reads as performed rather than embodied—"thread a labyrinth with your own story" arrives as concept, not choice under pressure. The whispering campaign ("seven years whispering his narrative") is told rather than dramatized through on-page micro-choices. The murders in the cellar lack causal motivation visible in scene; we learn of them only as fait accompli, undercutting agency. Internal contradiction is gestured at (wolf's son learning silence) but never acts simultaneously in a beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric density and metaphor accumulation intended to reweight at closure). Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. The closure unit—Elias drifting to the boat as "rumor itself"—reads as Conceptual Repricing: he becomes the legend, reweighting the premise of inherited sentence. Cost is conceptual (he abandons return, accepts ghost status) but legible in the final image. However, causality between the whispered deception campaign and the actual escape mechanism (hovering, lattice-as-shield) remains opaque; the narrative physics conceit is asserted rather than earned through prior particulars.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse's vertical spiral, copper light, and reef shadow create spatial pressure and recur with shifted meaning at closure. The confessional lattice functions as tool and constraint (breaking wind into "manageable fictions"), charging the final descent. The cellar and lantern-room anchor the vertical stakes. Micro-setting (lattice, precipice platform) constrains the hover choice and charges the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but sensory hierarchy under stress is thin—perception remains lyric-catalog rather than urgency-filtered.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (escape before discovery) is signaled early and the timeframe tightens to dusk. However, escalation is conceptual rather than enacted: the hover and drift happen without on-page resistance, cost negotiation, or tactical adjustment. The murders are pre-scene; Elias's agency in the escape itself is assertion ("convincing the air") without visible struggle or trade-off. One deepening—realizing his father's mistake was requiring witnesses—but no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options under live pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (narrative as survival tool, the wolf's son learning silent deception) emerges from specifics and avoids overt thesis. The final image—"become the rumor itself"—offers a resonant answer to the inherited-sentence question without moralizing. Copperlight, lattice, and "sustaining impossibilities" recur with shifted weight. However, "thread a labyrinth with your own story" edges toward meta-commentary, and the epiphany about his father's mistake is told rather than enacted through a costly choice on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (narrative-physics conceit, copperlight repose) and voice is lyric-elevated throughout. However, register ("particular dust of abandoned sanctity," "narrative physics," "copperlight repose") drifts above Elias's prisoner context without dramatic anchoring—diction reads authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance stays close but the lens feels imposed rather than earned by a protagonist who has spent seven years in a granite cell.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Heavy metaphor density without pattern-teaching or payoff: "copperlight repose," "scuffs on a narrow door," "lattice...breaking wind into manageable fictions," "rope of lies strong enough to climb," "chasing hush," "thread a labyrinth with your own story"—most appear once, ornamentally. Template cadence in paragraph 3: "that the cellar held wine...that he was simple...that the boy who cried wolf's son..." (three parallel "that" clauses). "Sustains impossibilities" repeats twice without functional shift. Propulsion is steady but information density is diluted by figurative surplus. Peak beat (hovering, descent) remains clear but the metaphor stack in earlier paragraphs drags momentum without accumulating pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Core synthesis—narrative as literal escape mechanism from a metaphor-prison—is fresh and the wolf's-boy lineage inverts expectation (silence over crying). However, the "impossible prison" premise is stock fantasy/fable and the hover-via-belief mechanism arrives without groundwork, reading convenient. The murders and seven-year deception campaign are told rather than shown, reducing specificity. One strong inflection: the lattice-as-wind-shield repurposes the confessional object with physicality. Risk-taking in lyric register is present but the core escape feels unearned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's status as the wolf's son frames backstory and the final image ("learned to cry wolf in silence"), but his on-page choices are minimal—he retrieves a lattice, steps onto a platform, and drifts. The hover and descent are passive execution of an off-page plan. Two beats (lattice retrieval, hover initiation) involve him, but neither is a decision under live pressure; both are pre-scripted moves. Setup clear, middle functional, closure participates via the silent-wolf reprise, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lattice appears in two beats: retrieval from confessional (with sensory detail: myrrh, dust) and use as shield during descent ("breaking wind into manageable fictions"). Setup present, development minimal (it enables the hover but mechanics are metaphor, not physics), closure links via the final descent. Specificity (confessional grid, myrrh scent) is high, but the lattice's function—breaking wind into fictions—is asserted rather than demonstrated with cost or tradeoff. Swappable with any symbolic object that "breaks" or "filters."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" appears once in paragraph 5 as label for the goal (silence after escape). It does not shape tactics, constrain choices, or recur. The concept is echoed thematically in "cry wolf in silence," but the hush itself is outcome, not driver. Setup absent (first named mid-story), middle ornamental, closure tangential. Present but not integrated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the lighthouse twice (paragraphs 1 and 3) and enables the hover ("by convincing the air...a trick of narrative physics"), but the trait is told as world flavor rather than demonstrated with cost. Elias's hover exploits this trait, but we do not see him test, fail, or pay a price to align with it. Setup present, development asserted, closure tied (the lighthouse "exhales" in acknowledgment). Swappable with any magic-logic label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hover is the climactic escape mechanism (paragraph 4) and defines the final image (drifting to the boat). It drives one major beat and shapes closure. However, it is introduced only at the precipice without prior groundwork—no failed attempts, no visible cost or struggle. Setup absent (appears in final third), middle functional (one beat), closure essential. Late arrival and lack of earned progression cap the score, but it is irreplaceable for the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" appears in paragraph 2 as the route to the confessional. The scuffs "had shown him the way" (paragraph 6), but this is summary—no on-page choice shaped by the door's history. Setup present, development absent (path-of-least-resistance, not constraint), closure absent. Replaceable with any physical access.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison structures all action: vertical geography (cellar to lantern room) creates the hover stakes, the reef's calm shelters the boat, and the copperlight frames mood and time. The confessional, precipice platform, and cellar with bodies are all setting-as-resource. Setup immediate, development strong (vertical climb, precipice choice, sustaining-impossibilities trait), closure charged (lighthouse exhales, reef watches). The setting is indispensable—removal would collapse the escape logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" and "before the shift change at dusk" appear in paragraphs 5 and 1, framing urgency. Copperlight deepening to bronze and "true evening" tracks time toward closure. Setup present, development nominal (time is mentioned but does not force a mid-scene tactical shift), closure present (dusk arrives as he escapes). The clock is referenced but does not visibly tighten a choice or alter a move on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Thread a labyrinth with your own story" is stated as Elias's understanding (paragraph 3) and echoed in the final image (silent wolf). It is concept-motivation rather than embodied want tested under friction. Setup present as thesis, development thin (the seven-year whisper campaign is told, not dramatized), closure tied (he becomes rumor). Dramatized friction between this want and a competing desire or cost is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" anchors the opening and modulates to "bronze" and "starless dark" at closure, supporting the narrative arc from stasis to motion. Tone is lyric-contemplative throughout, consistent with the "sustaining impossibilities" conceit, and charges the final image. Setup immediate, development consistent (tone does not shift with pressure, remaining uniformly elevated), closure charged. The repose-to-motion shift is subtle but legible. However, tone remains static rather than modulating beat-to-beat, trending mid-high rather than high-band.</comment>
