<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her final choice to create the promise structure flows from established traits (cataloguer of extinct languages). However, interiority remains largely abstract: "cautious exuberance that fluttered in her chest like caged birds" labels rather than embodies. The reconciliation feels inevitable from paragraph one without meaningful internal contradiction—no moment where silence tempts her to retreat. Julian's acceptance arrives too easily; we see his widened eyes but no struggle between caution and hope that would make the choice costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The dominant stake—restoring trust before Julian's departure—is signaled early and the deadline tightens pressure. The closure lands on the page: Julian steps into the heptagon and touches the ink well, the promise structure activates, and "two living voices finally began to speak again" (Decisive Change). Cost is felt but faint—Elara's vulnerability is named ("letting it show fully") but the price of failure or the weight of years-long silence doesn't fully charge the final image. The lens reads Causal with light Accumulative texture (seven languages as pattern); it holds through closure without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The extinct language archive is vividly rendered: "air here tasted of ochre and forgotten grammar, each scroll a coffin for meaning." The heptagon arrangement and semantic binding ("writing into the air itself") constrain Elara's method and charge the final image when Julian steps into the geometric structure. Spatial choreography is clear: Elara moves through stacks, arranges tablets, Julian appears in the doorway, then enters the heptagon. The glass ink well functions as micro-setting, handled twice (Elara places it, Julian touches it) and its transformation—liquid to chiming semantic medium—alters what's possible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (reconciliation before dawn departure) is signaled early and time pressure is explicit. One meaningful tightening occurs: Elara's choice to inscribe seven interconnected promises rather than a single apology escalates from confession to binding vow. However, the cost of failure remains abstract—"paths diverge" is stated but never dramatized as a visceral loss. Julian's acceptance feels frictionless; no moment tests his caution against her exuberance. The final beat shows mutual touch and voices beginning to speak, but the price paid (vulnerability, years of silence) is asserted more than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—reconciliation requiring structural complexity, not simple apology—emerges from the seven extinct languages and their deaths by mutual silence, avoiding direct statement. The "symphony of truth" integrates Julian's caution and Elara's impetuosity as necessary chords rather than flaws to fix. The final image (seven dead languages singing, two living voices speaking) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "To unsnarl the grief between her and Julian, she could not simply speak; she must weave a structure robust enough to hold complexity" edges toward thesis statement, though it's nested in action preparation. The interconnected promises structure charges the closure without explaining the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent: "semantic binding," "ochre and forgotten grammar," "calcified into a wall." However, under peak pressure the register remains unchanged—no compression or shift when Elara inscribes the promises or when Julian arrives. Dialogue at the end feels slightly formal ("I couldn't let the paths diverge without trying") given months of silence and high emotion. Elara's perceptual signature (linguist's attention to grammar, meaning, dead tongues) is clear and character-specific. Filter verbs ("feeling the hum," "aware that one misstep") are sparse and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is high; no grammatical errors or ambiguous references. However, multiple sentences loop conceptually: "silence fell between them" / "mutual quiet had been no accident" / "let silence metastasize" restates the problem across three beats without adding pressure. Template cadence in the middle: "She moved… She selected… She arranged… She began" stacks identical stems without purposeful effect. Figurative density is high but occasionally mixed: ink "chimed like struck crystal" (auditory) then "dried in the air, solidifying into a bridge of light" (visual/tactile)—the metaphor vehicle shifts mid-image. Opening and closing lines are strong, but scaffold phrasing ("cautious exuberance," "carefully reckless") recurs without reweighting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—extinct languages as instructive artifacts for reconciliation—offers a fresh angle on the reconciliation plot. The "interconnected promises" method and the heptagon arrangement are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (estranged partners reconcile via symbolic gesture) follows a familiar template, and the final acceptance arrives without surprise or friction. The seven languages function as thematic texture but don't transform the underlying estrangement-to-reunion structure. Specificity in the archive setting and linguist's craft elevates the piece above generic, but the closure feels inevitable from the opening rather than earned through risky choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's identity as arcane linguist drives the key turn: selecting seven tablets, distilling her unspoken fears into the ink, and inscribing semantic bindings into the air. The entire reconciliation method depends on her occupational skill. Present in setup (vault access, three years cataloguing), middle (tablet selection, semantic binding), and closure (the promise structure activates when Julian enters). Causal pressure is clear; swapping her for a non-linguist would break the logic. Minor friction: her linguist expertise is asserted more than demonstrated—no moment where grammar or syntax shapes a micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in three beats: pocket weight in opening, placement at the heptagon's heart, and Julian's touch at closure. Its transformation (loneliness distilled into binding medium) is signaled and its final use (the touch that completes the promise structure) participates in closure. However, the ink well is more catalyst than constraint—Elara could theoretically use any vessel. Its specificity (glass, shared with Julian before the silence) charges the final image but doesn't narrow options in the middle beats. Strong lyric reprise but not indispensable to the mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is named explicitly twice and governs the climactic beat: "The symphony of truth: Julian's caution and her impetuosity… all playing simultaneously without discord." It shapes the reconciliation tactic—multiple voices rather than univocal apology. Present in setup (Elara's realization that "one misstep could trigger the defensive wards yet driven by a cautious exuberance"), middle (weaving seven promises as harmony), and closure (seven languages singing, voices speaking again). However, the concept is described more than dramatized; no moment where a single truth fails and forces the symphonic approach. Thematic resonance is strong but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" appears twice as a label: "her steps careful yet reckless" and "carefully reckless with her hope." The trait is visible in Elara's choice to work in the archive despite defensive wards and to inscribe promises before Julian's departure despite risk of rejection. However, the attribute feels more like authorial description than embodied contradiction—no beat where caution and recklessness pull her in opposite directions with visible cost. The final line ("carefully reckless with her hope") repeats the phrase without reweighting it. Functional but not indispensable; "determined" or "bold" would serve nearly as well.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears four times and governs the central action: "To unsnarl the grief… she must weave a structure," "unsnarling into chords," "we unsnarl this silence together." The verb is specific to Elara's linguist frame and the knot metaphor introduced in paragraph two ("snarled knot of unspoken accusations"). Present in setup (problem stated as snarled knot), middle (the method is weaving/unsnarling), and closure (Julian's choice to "unsnarl this silence together"). However, the action is metaphorical throughout; no literal snarl or hands-on untangling that alters tactics. Strong thematic coherence but swappable with "resolve" or "untangle" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Interconnected promises" is signaled early ("the method of interconnected promises: not one vow, but seven, each contingent upon the others"), executed in the middle beat (Elara inscribes seven glowing vows), and present at closure (Julian steps into the heptagon to accept them). The method is specific and irreplaceable—a single apology or vow would not trigger the symphonic effect. The mechanics matter: the heptagon structure, the seven extinct languages, and the contingency create the "web stronger than any single thread." Strong causal pressure; removing this exact method would break the reconciliation logic. Minor friction: the contingency mechanism is asserted but not demonstrated—we don't see one promise depend on another.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The extinct language archive provides resources (seven tablets, defensive wards, semantic binding as occupational method) and setting texture ("air tasted of ochre and forgotten grammar"). Present in setup (Elara presses her palm against the vault door), middle (spiraling stacks, tablets arranged on the dais), and closure (Julian in the doorway, stepping into the heptagon). The archive's defensive wards add mild risk ("one misstep could trigger") but don't constrain Elara's choices—she moves freely. The setting charges the thematic work (extinct languages mirror the relationship's silence) but could be replaced with another repository without breaking the plot. Strong atmosphere, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" frames the story: "by dawn, Julian's transfer to the southern observatory would render their separation geographical as well as emotional" and Elara's closing line, "I couldn't let the paths diverge without trying." Time tightens the decision—if Elara waits until morning, Julian leaves. The deadline is live in setup and closure, and the promises "dissolve at sunrise" if rejected. However, the clock is not tracked in the middle beats; no moment where time pressure forces a choice between thoroughness and speed. Strong setup and payoff, moderate middle development. The timeframe shapes the attempt but doesn't alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Restoring trust after silence is the dominant stake from paragraph two ("she sought not knowledge, but absolution") through closure ("two living voices finally began to speak again"). The motivation is dramatized in Elara's choice to distill her "dreams, errors, and unspoken fears" into the ink and inscribe seven promises despite vulnerability. Internal friction is present but light: "letting it show fully for the first time in months" signals cost but doesn't dramatize a moment where fear of rejection nearly stops her. The final beat lands the reconciliation with Julian's acceptance, making the motivation causal and essential. Strong integration across all three gates with felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" appears explicitly twice: "driven by a cautious exuberance that fluttered in her chest like caged birds" and "carefully reckless with her hope" (which echoes the tone). The tone is coherent through the arc—Elara is hopeful but guarded—and modulates slightly at closure when she "let[s] it show fully." However, the tone remains static in description rather than shifting under pressure; no beat where exuberance overwhelms caution or vice versa. The final image carries hope but not exuberance—Julian's acceptance is tentative ("his finger brushing hers through the transparent barrier"). The tone is present but doesn't charge the ending distinctly; "hopeful determination" would fit nearly as well.</comment>
