<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marian's motivation is clear and embodied through her thirty-year practice and her refusal to accept temporary death. The weary undertaker's "inadvertently stubborn nature" drives her crossing into impossible space without hesitation. Her final choice to become librarian earns closure through exhaustion lifting into silence, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth—the cost of abandoning her coastal parlor and earthbound practice could press harder on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase and symbolic accretion (crate arrival → lens pulse → ocean wound → library ascent → lens placement → transformation). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marian becomes part of the architecture she sought to create, the weariness lifts, and she finally sleeps. The cost is legible—she abandons her terrestrial undertaking practice and becomes permanent keeper of the impossible. Orientation is clear early; the because/therefore chain is softer than pure causal but the accumulative pattern holds and pays off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The underwater library's marble columns "without a hint of barnacle or rot" and books floating "like schools of silver fish" create vivid impossible-space texture. The broken lens heats in her hands, the spiral staircase corkscrews "through liquid stone," and the dome that "should not fit" all constrain and charge Marian's ascent. The lens fixture "that had waited centuries for exactly this breakage" makes the setting an active participant in closure. Micro-setting (the lens, her boots on impossible steps) drives the ending's transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: giving the dead "coordinates that do not shift." Pressure tightens from three-day resistance → widow's walk decision → underwater descent → library recognition → apex climb → lens alignment. The distress signals escalate from throbbing behind eyes to "broadcast across frequencies of forgetting." Agency is clear: Marian's choice to align the shard "that had waited centuries" drives the transformation. The cost—her weariness exchanged for permanent librarian duty—is felt in "finally slept," though the coincidence of the exactly-right breakage lands conveniently.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: burial permanence versus migrating earth, the lighthouse-as-harbor inversion, "impossible logic" occupied rather than fought. "The library was a lighthouse, and the dead were ships seeking harbor" reframes without stating a moral. The lens crumbling to sand after purpose is served offers non-literal closure—utility exhausted, rest achieved. "Inadvertently stubborn" becomes "necessary architecture," and the final sleeping-among-stacks image answers the central question of permanent address without sermonic overlay.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "burial meant nothing when the earth itself migrated," "pressure and memory," "dignity of soil-bound death." Distance is stable third-limited; diction remains elevated but character-consistent ("distress signals," "coordinates," "broadcast across frequencies"). Rhythm modulates—longer sentences during descent, shorter at apex action. Minor register drift: "inadvertently stubborn" and "necessary architecture" read slightly meta in peak beats, and "revitalize not light, but location" feels abstractly philosophical rather than lived-in-crisis thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong propulsion and imagery: "ocean had opened like a wound," "geography that occupied the breath between moments," "folding the impossible space into something denser." Information density is high. Minor figurative clutter: "jagged glass cradled in her arms" + "broken lens" + "largest shard" cycles synonyms; "fractured prism" adds a fourth. "Clicking it into a fixture" underplays the climax's mechanical action when the metaphysical stakes are so high. No loops or scaffold, but the elevated register is unrelenting—one plain-syntax breath would sharpen contrast.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse-library inversion (beacon becomes archive, light folds inward) is fresh and structurally committed. Undertaker-as-librarian for the dead who drift rather than rest transforms funerary logic through oceanic metaphor. The "broken lens focusing scattered essence into singularity" synthesizes repair-through-breakage in a non-obvious way. Risk: the impossible-space premise is executed without hedging, and the final sleeping image trusts restraint. The piece earns its strangeness through consistent internal rules and specific costs.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Weary undertaker appears immediately, her weariness embodied in sleeplessness and throbbing eyes. Her thirty-year practice motivates resistance, her stubborn nature drives the crossing, and her climb-and-alignment choice transforms the library. The final decision to sit and sleep closes the arc. Setup, development (descent, recognition, climb), and payoff (alignment, transformation, rest) all present. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability high—only an undertaker carries this exact stake in permanence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Broken lighthouse lens appears in the opening crate, pulses throughout three days, is cradled on the widow's walk, heats during descent, reveals truth at the apex, is aligned "clicking it into a fixture," erupts inward light, then crumbles to sand. Setup, development (multiple beats: crate, walk, climb, truth-seeing), and payoff (alignment, transformation, dissolution) all clear. Drives the ending's mechanical and metaphysical transformation. The exact breakage matters: "exactly this breakage" makes it irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distress signals appear as the inciting summons (vibrating through sternum), intensify across three days, are revealed as "broadcast across frequencies of forgetting," and are resolved when "the drifting dead settled" and signals cease. Shapes stakes (give coordinates) and frames the problem Marian must solve. Present in setup (three-day resistance), development (whispers in library), and payoff (signals resolved by lens). Causal pressure clear; without signals, no motivation to descend.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Inadvertently stubborn trait is named early, drives her three-day resistance to the summons, and is reframed at apex as "necessary architecture" that refuses temporary graves. The trait enables her descent "without hesitation" and her refusal to accept migrating earth. Setup and development present; payoff is thematic reframing rather than a discrete action. Visible cost: her stubbornness delays resolution and prolongs distress, but also ensures she completes the task. Moderately high integration, though the "inadvertently" qualifier softens agency slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Revitalize is the lens's purpose: "meant to revitalize not light, but location—to focus the scattered essence." The action occurs at climax when she aligns the shard, and "Light erupted—not outward, but inward, folding the impossible space into something denser, more permanent." The dead settle, books close, stillness is achieved. Setup (lens meant to revitalize), development (carrying and heating), payoff (alignment and transformation) all clear. The entire closure turns on this action; removing it collapses the ending. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Occupying impossible spaces is signaled early: "impossible space, a geography that occupied the breath between moments." Marian "stepped into it," walked corridors where physics broke, climbed stairs through "liquid stone," and ascended "into a dome where no dome should fit." At closure she declares success "by occupying its impossible logic." The method shapes her tactics throughout descent and climb. Setup, development (multiple impossible-space beats), and payoff (declaration and embodiment) all present. High specificity and causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Forgotten underwater city library is the locus of all action post-descent. Its vaulted corridors hold floating books inscribed with names; its central spiral staircase enables the climb; its apex dome contains the fixture. The library supplies the resources (fixture, architecture) and the need (drifting dead). Marian's final choice to become librarian makes the setting her permanent role. Setup (ocean wound reveals it), development (walk, climb, recognition), payoff (transformation, she sits among stacks) all strong. Irreplaceable; no other setting could host this exact closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the mysterious package arrives" anchors the story. Three days of sleeplessness and resistance are referenced, tightening urgency. "She stood now" marks the decision point. The timeframe shapes Marian's weariness and the pressure to act, but once she descends, the pacing becomes fluid and time stops pressing visibly. Setup clear (three days, now), development (descent), but payoff does not return to time as a constraint. Moderate causal role; swappable with "after she receives the summons" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Motivation "to give rest a permanent address" is stated explicitly and dramatized through her thirty-year burial practice, her refusal of migrating earth, and her recognition that "burial meant nothing when the earth itself migrated." The distress signals crystallize the need; her climb and lens-alignment enact the desire. The ending's stillness—"they had found their stillness"—fulfills the motivation, and her sleep confirms rest achieved. Setup, development (resistance, recognition, climb), and payoff (permanent address created, she rests) all clear. High irreplaceability and cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Chased stillness operates as tone throughout: weariness, throbbing, vibrating distress, the hunt "through miles of ocean and centuries of neglect," culminating in "a silence so complete it rang" and "finally slept." The oxymoron (stillness that must be pursued) coheres and modulates—tense during resistance, propulsive during descent, resolved at apex. The final image charges the tone: motion arrested, weariness lifted, quiet achieved. Setup (throbbing, chased), development (descent, hunt imagery), payoff (silence, sleep) all present. Strong coherence and closure participation.</comment>
