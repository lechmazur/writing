<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear—seventeen years documenting emotional residue in objects—but her interiority remains generic and label-driven ("the shifted hush moved from the forest into her chest"). The mystic's actions align with her goal, yet no internal contradiction or embodied struggle surfaces; she moves through the scene with near-perfect competence. The widow's hands appear via prism refraction, a clever device, but Elara's own emotional stakes never press against her certainty. Backstory exceeds the ~20% guideline without anchoring present micro-choices that tilt her stance, flattening pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the first 120 words: Elara, quartz arbor, "today." The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: frost patterns map emotional residue, the prism refracts stored grief, and the final sublimation releases the car's burden—a Resonant Reconfiguration (the car "freed from the weight of absorbed mourning"). Cost is conceptual and legible in the final image: doubt lifts, the car is lighter. One meaningful deepening occurs when the frost sublimates and the prism grows hot, reweighting her theory. No causality breaks, but the closure feels inevitably arrived at rather than earned by a narrowing choice, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quartz arbor, mist, and frost patterns are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elara's mystic lens. The sedan's frost-bloomed windows and the prism's refraction constrain her method: she reads the fractal language to commune with the car's history. However, spatial choreography remains light—no body or tool detail that pressures a micro-choice. The setting charges the final image (quartz arbor sings, mist thickens) but does not materially narrow Elara's options mid-scene, keeping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the frost sublimates and the prism heats, validating her theory. Yet Elara never faces a trade-off or live cost on the page; the revelation unfolds without resistance or failure that would test her commitment. The widow's grief is stored and released, but no reversal narrows Elara's tactics. Accumulative pressure builds atmosphere without forcing a choice that forecloses a path, capping escalation credit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—objects remember, everything that witnesses pain can heal—emerges from concrete frost patterns and the prism's refraction rather than direct statement. The final image (bare glass, car freed) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the closing lines tip toward thematic summary: "honest magic of a universe where everything that witnesses pain remembers, and everything that remembers can, eventually, heal" articulates the premise rather than letting the image stand. The phrase "truthful lies of scientific skepticism" also flirts with prompt-echo, subtracting thematic subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, Elara's perceptual signature clear (seventeen years documenting stones' weeping, metal's memory). No head-hopping. Yet elevated diction pervades high-pressure beats: "spectral ghosts," "fractal language," "reliquary of love and loss." Under stress, the prose remains ornate rather than compressing to Elara's urgency. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful. The single line of dialogue ("Objects remember") feels understated, but the surrounding narration over-explains her proof, dulling immediacy. Distance control is consistent, but register does not modulate with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "mist coiled around the translucent trunks like breath held too long," "frost ferns," "spectral ghosts," "neural pathway," "silicon structure resonating." Mixed metaphors appear: the prism forms a "bridge between her retina and the frost patterns," then frost "skips liquid entirely as if the emotion it carried was too volatile for water." Paraphrase loops surface: "the shifted hush that fell" recurs three times with minor synonym variation. Template cadence: "She did not touch... she learned to commune... she angled the prism." Sentence openings vary little in the middle third. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (prism refracts light *and* reads residue), but figurative overload in peak beats (sublimation, lavender scent, "burning confirmation") obscures propulsion. No clarity break at closure, but pervasive ornament and minor loops reduce momentum, triggering −0.8 for density + coherence issues and −0.4 for template stems, total ~−1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—mystic reads frost patterns to prove objects absorb emotions—offers a fresh angle on psychometry. The quartz arbor and prism mechanics are specific, not generic. Yet the core arc (scientist proves paranormal hypothesis, finds validation) follows a template without transformation: Elara encounters no failure, no surprising cost, no resistant detail that forces improvisation. The widow's grief is stored and released cleanly, with lavender scent and "truthful lies" as token flavor. The final image (bare glass, car freed, "honest magic") lands predictably. Risk is minimal; the story chooses the safe middle, avoiding bold structural or moral calculus that would lift originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara ("attentive mystic") is present throughout, her choice to use the prism and read the frost drives the key turn (frost sublimates, theory validated). She appears in the first line and the closure. However, her decisions are observational and methodical; no on-page conflict forces a trade-off or improvisation. The mystic role enables the method but does not constrain her tactics—she succeeds on first attempt. Two gates met (setup, closure participation), but middle development lacks friction. Causal work is moderate; removing "mystic" and replacing with "researcher" would require minor edits. Score: setup +0.5, closure link +0.9, one beat +0.4, specificity +0.3, total baseline ~5.8 before caps. No cap applies; final 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass prism appears early ("from her coat, Elara withdrew the glass prism"), is handled and rotated mid-scene to refract light and bridge "her retina and the frost patterns," then grows hot at closure with "burning confirmation." Three beats, setup met, closure met. However, the prism's unique properties (facets, refraction) are described but not irreplaceable—another tool (crystal, lens) could substitute with minor edits. Cost is tied to validation, not the prism itself. Score: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure link +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.6, total ~6.7 before rounding. Final 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shifted hush" appears three times: opening ("the shifted hush that fell when the wind ceased"), mid-scene ("the shifted hush moved from the forest into her chest"), and near closure ("The shifted hush lifted"). Setup met, closure met. However, the phrase functions as atmospheric label rather than shaping tactics or narrowing options. Elara does not respond to the hush; it does not constrain her prism use or alter her method. Two gates (setup, closure mention), ornamental use. Score: setup +0.5, closure cameo (non-causal) +0.3, ornamental −0.8, total ~4.1 before caps. Cap for missing middle development: 3.4. Final 3.4—but the closure cameo lifts it slightly above pure ornament; adjust to 4.1 acknowledging lyric reprise without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears in the opening line ("Elara stood firmly grounded among the quartz arbor") and returns at closure ("the attentive mystic still firmly grounded even as her understanding... had permanently shifted"). Setup and closure met. The trait is described but never constrains or enables a choice—Elara's groundedness does not prevent doubt, force a physical action, or trade off against another need. Label-only use. Score: setup +0.5, closure reprise +0.7, label-only −0.5, ornamental −0.5, total ~5.3 before caps. No cap exceeds this; final 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Commune" is the method Elara uses: "she learned to commune with the vehicle's history through the patterns in frost." The action is signaled early, executed mid-scene (prism angles, frost sublimates), and the communion succeeds at closure (car freed). Three beats, setup met, middle met, closure met. However, "commune" could swap with "read," "interpret," or "perceive" with minor edits—the specificity lies in the prism and frost, not the verb. Causal work is solid. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure link +1.0, causal pressure +1.0, swappability −0.5, ornamental (no tactile handling of communion itself) −0.3, total ~7.2. Rounding: 6.9 acknowledging swappability and slight abstraction. Final 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method—"through the patterns in frost on a car window"—is signaled early ("frost ferns that had grown overnight"), used mid-scene ("reading the fractal language of frozen water"), and pays off at closure ("frost patterns faded completely, leaving bare glass"). Three beats, setup met, middle met, closure met. The frost patterns are irreplaceable: removing them breaks the proof mechanism. Specificity is high (dendrites, fractal language, sublimation). Causal pressure: the patterns map emotional residue and their sublimation validates the theory. Cost is tied to the patterns' disappearance. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure link +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, specificity +0.7, total ~7.1 before caps. No cap; final 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The quartz arbor appears in the opening line, mid-scene ("the quartz arbor seeming to lean closer"), and at closure ("The quartz arbor sang"). Three beats, setup met, closure met. The arbor provides atmosphere and context (crystal roots, silicon structure resonating) but does not constrain Elara's choices—she could perform the same proof in another setting. The arbor "sings" at closure, charging the final image with resonance. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure link (lyric, non-causal) +0.8, swappability −0.7, ornamental (postcard description) −0.6, total ~5.9 before caps. No cap exceeds; final 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" appears mid-scene ("This was the timeframe she waited for: when assumptions shatter, those fragile moments between believing and knowing") and near closure ("In that instant, when assumptions shatter, the shifted hush moved"). The phrase is abstract and does not track a clock or tighten decisions. Time is vague ("today," "seventeen years," "three winters ago") with no live pressure. Two mentions, both thematic rather than tactical. Score: mid-scene signal +0.3, closure reprise +0.3, ornamental −0.8, vague time −0.5, total ~4.8 before caps. Cap for missing setup (appears mid-scene): 4.6, but lyric reprise lifts slightly; final 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to prove that objects absorb emotions"—is stated early ("Today she would finally prove that objects absorb emotions") and drives all her actions: withdrawing the prism, reading frost, validating the theory at closure. Setup, middle, closure all met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires. No friction between cost and want appears on the page; Elara succeeds without doubt or sacrifice. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure link +1.0, causal pressure +1.0, told-only −0.7, no friction −0.8, total ~6.2 before caps. No cap; final 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" appears twice: "Conventional wisdom called it superstition, a truthful lie told by grieving widows" and at closure "leaving behind the truthful lies of scientific skepticism for the honest magic." Setup and closure met. The tone attempts paradox (grief as superstition yet valid, skepticism as lie yet honest) but remains static—no modulation with pressure. The phrase is abstract and does not charge the final image with felt cost. Score: setup +0.5, closure reprise +0.7, static mood −0.6, abstraction −0.4, total ~5.1 before caps. No cap; final 5.1.</comment>
