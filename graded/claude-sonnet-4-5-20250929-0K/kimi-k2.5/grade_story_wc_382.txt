<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to learn building language is clear and her choices escalate logically, but the interiority relies heavily on elevated metaphorical description rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Elias functions more as exposition device than pressuring force—he teaches without resistance, and his spectral nature is noted ("Maya learned that Elias had died in 1987") but never complicates her choices with visible cost. The ending gesture (pressing seals together) reads as symbolic completion rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path. Internal conflict is stated thematically ("interrogate the silence") but not dramatized through competing wants that force visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors slowly: building and rooftop are clear by paragraph three, but Maya's specific goal and the narrative present remain vague until Elias appears. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens—weekly sessions layer understanding—but closure depends on a single symbolic act (dual seal-pressing) whose cost is asserted through metaphor ("finally understood") rather than demonstrated through forfeited options or visible consequence. The drive holds across the arc, but the cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Maya gives up or loses by completing this sentence with Elias. Micro turn when she finds her own seal is allowed, but the final image reconfigures meaning through declaration rather than enacted pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Art Deco crown molding, rooftop garden with lavender and jasmine, and the copper flashing are vivid and purposeful. The desk seal (brass handle, carnelian stone, house symbol) is specific and materially present across beats, constraining Maya's interpretive method and enabling the final gesture. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the building's architecture functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image when seals meet copper flashing. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maya's interpretive lens, though the meteor showers feel ornamental—mentioned three times but never pressuring a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the building's language—is signaled early and tightens once when Maya acquires her own seal and can "complete a sentence." However, escalation operates through accumulation (weekly sessions, growing vocabulary) rather than narrowing options or raising cost. The final act (pressing both seals) is Maya's agency, but it resolves smoothly without visible trade-off: no alternative path is foreclosed, no price paid. Under the accumulative lens, the closure reweights her relationship to the structure, but the lack of visible friction or cost limits the band. Elias as spectral tutor introduces no resistance; his "agreed upon lies" frame is thematic rather than a complicating pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" emerges through specific instances—facade pretending stability, sugar-borrowing pretense, Elias's spectral state—and the final image (completing the building's sentence) reweights prior material without stating a moral. The desk seal's evolution from translator to co-author is purposeful. However, the theme leans on overt articulation: "agreed upon lies that felt more honest than any living speech" comes close to thematic echo in the final paragraph. The piece invites reflection on language, architecture, and presence/absence, with the meteor showers functioning as lyric accent rather than thematic driver. Emotional truth is present in Maya's desire for connection, though sentimentality threatens when the building "sighed" and included her name in mortar.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maya throughout; psychic distance is controlled and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("dialects she couldn't parse," "dead tongues," "palimpsest") that fits the architectural focus. Elias's dialogue ("We seal our letters to preserve intent; buildings seal their histories in stone") is exposition-forward but voice-plausible for a dead-language scholar. Register remains consistent, though some phrases ("mysterious familiarity," "patiently nimble") feel more authorial than character-specific. The narrative stance holds across emotional beats, and filter verbs ("feeling the grooves," "hoping the cosmic rhythm") are purpose-driven rather than dulling.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and high information density in most beats. However, phrase recurrence becomes visible: "patiently nimble" appears three times in identical or near-identical form, and "agreed upon lies" recurs four times, twice in the final paragraph alone. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions: "interrogate the walls... interrogate the doorframes" and "she brought... she pressed... she remained." Figurative language is dense throughout—"teeth in a key," "architectural static," "grammar hidden in lintels"—without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, risking overwriting in peak beats. The final line ("agreed upon lies that felt more honest than any living speech") delivers thematic summary rather than image-driven closure. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: phrase loops −0.5, elevated diction density in closure beat −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—spectral tutor teaching building language through seals—offers a fresh angle on haunting and literacy. The desk seal as interpretive tool and the "agreed upon lies" frame are non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (lonely newcomer finds mentor, gains understanding, achieves belonging) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction. The rooftop meteor showers and weekly tea sessions feel like assembled motifs rather than inevitable particulars. Elias's 1987 death and his never eating are specific details, but they ornament rather than complicate Maya's choices. The ending gesture (dual seal-pressing to complete the building's sentence) is conceptually clever but emotionally predictable, lacking the resistance or cost that would make the synthesis feel earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias appears early (first third), teaches Maya across multiple beats, and is present at closure when she uses his method. His choices are limited: he accepts the sugar pretense, explains the seal's use, traces blueprints with a trowel, and presses his seal at the end. However, his function is primarily expository—he enables Maya's learning but does not create key turns through his own agency or resistance. His spectral state is acknowledged but never pressures a choice. He shapes two distinct beats (rooftop meeting, weekly sessions) and contributes to closure, earning mid-band placement, but his swappability (any knowledgeable mentor could serve) and lack of decision-driven reversals prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears in paragraph five (within first third), is described with specific detail (brass handle, carnelian stone, house symbol), and is used in three distinct beats: Elias demonstrates pressing it against surfaces to reveal dates/names, it becomes "their translator" during weekly sessions, and Maya presses her own seal beside his at closure to complete the building's sentence. The seal's meaning evolves from tool to co-authorship instrument. Its irreplaceability is high—the house symbol matching the facade and the act of sealing/unsealing histories is central to the story's logic. However, the closure participation is more symbolic than causal: the dual pressing completes a metaphorical sentence but does not narrow prior options or create visible cost, limiting the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is named explicitly in paragraph six, repeated four times total, and frames the building's architecture, the sugar-borrowing pretense, and Elias's spectral state. It shapes Maya's interpretive method—approaching walls by "pretending you are merely repairing plaster while actually reading the cracks"—which is a tactic. However, the concept functions more as thematic label than stake-shaping constraint. It does not narrow options or create a choice between competing goods; instead, it describes the established dynamic. Closure linkage is present (final paragraph mentions it twice), but the concept's causal work is thin: Maya could learn the building's language through other metaphors without structural loss. The swappability and ornamental use keep the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" appears three times: describing Elias's fingers labeling seed packets, his hands tracing blueprints, and Maya in the final paragraph. The trait is presented as observable behavior (looping extinct alphabets, mapping roots) but does not constrain or enable on-page action with cost. It functions as character texture—suggesting careful, deliberate movement—but is easily swappable with synonyms like "deftly careful" or "methodically precise." No choice hinges on patience versus speed, and no visible trade-off (e.g., missing an opportunity due to slowness) materializes. The repetition creates thematic resonance but not causal pressure, placing the score in low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interrogate" appears in Elias's dialogue ("waiting for someone to interrogate the silence properly"), recurs when Maya says she doesn't know "how to interrogate the walls," and again when "She interrogated the doorframes now with her fingertips." The action frames Maya's method and recurs across beats, but it is not the decisive mechanism of closure—seal-pressing is. The word choice is purposeful and thematically charged, but swapping "interrogate" for "question" or "read" would not break the story's logic. The action shapes two beats (stated method, applied method) and contributes to the ending's texture, earning mid-band placement, but it does not redefine options or create the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled in paragraph seven: Maya knocks to borrow sugar (pantry full, he never eats), Elias accepts "the pretense," and "What started as borrowing sugar transformed into weekly tea sessions." The tea sessions become the vehicle for learning: Elias teaches her to read the facade, explains cornice brackets, uses the desk seal as translator. The method shapes multiple beats (initial pretense establishes "agreed upon lies," sessions provide iterative learning) and is referenced at closure ("the sugar bowl that never emptied"). However, the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized—we never see a full tea session in scene—and the method could be replaced with "weekly rooftop meetings" without structural loss. Present across the arc with causal relevance but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rooftop garden is introduced in paragraph three, anchors the first encounter with Elias, and returns for the final seal-pressing on copper flashing. Specific details (potted lavender, trellised jasmine, iron bench, concrete warm from day's heat) create vivid micro-setting. The meteor showers recur three times but function as atmospheric accent rather than constraint—they do not alter tactics or pressure choices. The rooftop provides proximity for the relationship and a spatial anchor for closure, but the choice to press seals could occur anywhere on the building. The setting charges the final image through the copper flashing (a material tied to architecture) and the elevated vantage, earning solid mid-band placement, but does not force the central decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maya's desire "to learn the language of old buildings" is stated in paragraph two, motivates her rooftop climb, drives her questions to Elias, and is fulfilled at closure when "the building sighed around them, its bricks rearranging their syntax to include her name." The motivation is dramatized through action: running fingers along molding, asking Elias for help, acquiring her own seal, pressing it at the end. Friction exists between want (understanding) and method (must approach through "agreed upon lies," must accept Elias's spectral presence), though the cost of achieving understanding is conceptual rather than visceral—no alternate goal is sacrificed. The motivation is specific, consistent, and shapes three beats (initial exploration, learning sessions, final completion), earning high mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is not named but operates through the building's "grooves that seemed almost alphabetical," the radiators "humming through... in dead tongues," Elias continuing "a conversation they'd started decades ago," and the building's "weathered facade like a palimpsest written by every tenant simultaneously." The tone blends strangeness (spectral tutor, animate architecture) with intimacy (weekly tea, learning together) and holds coherently across beats. However, the tone is relatively static—mysterious-familiar throughout—without modulation under pressure. The final image (building including her name, speaking back in shared grammar) charges the tone with belonging, but the lack of tonal escalation or shift limits upper-band eligibility. Coherent execution with modest closure enhancement.</comment>
