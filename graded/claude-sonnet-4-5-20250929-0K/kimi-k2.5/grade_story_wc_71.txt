<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and specific ("creeping normality noticer," tracking displaced objects), and her embodied interactions with the orris root and cottage siding ground her in the moment. The character demonstrates agency through her systematic method of cataloging wrongness, and the final act of placing the orris root beside the crystalline silence feels earned by prior choices. However, internal contradiction is absent—Maya moves through her investigation without struggle or competing impulses, and the moment of understanding arrives smoothly rather than through dramatized conflict. The shift from observer to consecrator lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through cataloged details (displaced fence posts, tide clocks, collected sound) toward a pattern-coalescence moment where Maya finds the crystallized silence shard. Orientation anchors promptly (Maya at the bay, spring evening, streetlights). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya's gesture of placing the orris root "consecrate[s] the boundary where architecture becomes entity," and the cottage responds with recognition, reweighting her role from witness to catalyst. The cost is conceptual—her attention has made the houses "more so" alive—but felt in the final image of the cottage's "hushed blaze" and her knowledge that "tomorrow the fence posts would have moved again." One meaningful deepening (from cataloging to understanding to consecration) satisfies length requirements under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bay setting provides concrete sensory anchors (copper light, seawall, driftwood fence posts, lilacs "too thickly for April") filtered through Maya's professional attention. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting: it grows warm, resonates with the structure's bones, and bridges "organic and mineral," constraining Maya's method and charging the final gesture. The displaced objects (spoon in garden, boot on roof) serve as environmental pressure that guides her investigation. Spatial choreography is clean (seawall → blue cottage → foundation), and the streetlights' daydreaming cycle modulates atmosphere across the sequence, settling into steady glow at the moment of recognition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why houses feel alive) is signaled in the opening and drives Maya's method throughout. The tightening occurs when cataloged wrongnesses "coalesce like salt forming on glass" into the realization that houses are listening, then deepens when she finds the crystallized silence shard beneath the foundation. Her final gesture—placing the orris root beside the shard—is agency-driven and forecloses the path of passive observation: "through her attention, consecrated the boundary where architecture becomes entity." The cost is visible in the cottage's shiver of recognition and the knowledge that her witness has made them "more so" alive, altering the relationship permanently. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening with felt consequences satisfies escalation requirements.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the progression from wrongness-cataloging to pattern-recognition to consecration: attention itself as transformative act. The orris root (given by grandmother "who claimed it could smell the silence in walls") and the crystallized silence shard anchor theme in concrete particulars rather than abstraction. The final image—"neither fully lamp nor fully bioluminescence, but something newly awakened and watching"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing: houses become alive through accumulated attention, and witnessing completes them. The closing line ("profound truths often arrive disguised as creeping adjustments to the normal world") edges toward thematic summary but remains grounded in Maya's specific method. Subtext operates in the houses' gentle migration versus poltergeist violence, and in the grandmother's legacy passing to Maya's practice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in tight third with Maya's perceptual signature evident throughout: "creeping normality noticer," attention to "doorknobs turned a fraction slower," "grammar of rearrangement." Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("hush between heartbeats," "daydreaming cycle," "hushed blaze"). However, register occasionally elevates beyond Maya's immediate perception into lyric abstraction: "the pause between waves," "decades of quiet moments pressed into timber and stone until the structure itself began to dream." These moments read more as authorial voice than character filter. Psychic distance shifts purposefully at the climax (closer during the orris root placement, pulling back for the reflective final paragraph), and narrative stance remains consistent. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high, with most sentences advancing Maya's method, the setting's wrongness, or thematic weight. Rhythm varies appropriately (longer contemplative sentences in exposition, shorter beats at moments of discovery). However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "The houses weren't haunted; they were listening" / "The aliveness wasn't intrusion but accumulation" / "The houses weren't shells but sponges"—a pattern of negation-then-correction that becomes mechanical across three uses. Figurative density occasionally overloads: "hushed blaze of interior light, neither fully lamp nor fully bioluminescence" stacks metaphoric vehicles without full coherence. The phrase "she had come to understand" appears twice, creating minor loop. Opening and closing lines are strong, but mid-passage artifacts prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise (houses gaining consciousness through accumulated listening via displaced objects) offers a fresh angle on haunted-house material, grounded in specific method (tracking displaced objects, using orris root as detection tool, finding crystallized silence shards). The synthesis of perfumer's tool + architectural sentience + observer-as-consecrator feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven. The transformation of "creeping normality" into a professional practice and the houses' gentle migration (versus poltergeist violence) provide non-obvious inflections. However, the core insight—attention makes things real—while executed with specific detail, echoes familiar philosophical territory. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications without retreat, earning solid originality through particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya as "creeping normality noticer" is seeded early, shapes multiple beats (trailing fingers on fence posts, pressing orris root to siding, kneeling at foundation), and her observation method drives escalation from cataloging to understanding to consecration. Her final decision to place the orris root beside the crystalline silence—"to acknowledge the communion between her noticing and the house's being"—alters the relationship with visible cost (the cottage's recognition, the knowledge she has made them "more so"). The character's professional method is specific and irreplaceable, though the transition from observation to consecration lacks on-page friction or competing impulse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orris root appears in at least three distinct beats: carried in pocket with backstory (grandmother's gift), pressed against cottage siding where "the wood exhaled," grows warm at foundation while resonating with wooden bones, and placed beside the crystallized silence to bridge "organic and mineral." Its violet scent bookends the piece (opening mention, final paragraph "scenting her pocket"). The object enables Maya's method (can "smell the silence in walls") and its final placement is causally active in the consecration moment. Strong integration, though removing it would require only moderate structural changes to the detection method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" as crystallized absence of sound is the story's central discovery and pivot. Maya finds it beneath the foundation ("no bigger than her thumbnail"), identifies it as "the seed around which the house had grown its consciousness," and her gesture of placing the orris root beside it triggers the cottage's recognition and the closure effect. The concept shapes stakes (understanding how stillness accumulates into sentience) and provides the physical object that makes the houses' aliveness legible. The phrase recurs with variation ("fragment of primordial stillness," "crystalline silence") and charges the final image. Removing this element would collapse the story's explanatory logic and closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears once in the narrator's reflection: "She did not mean to sanctify the moment; she only wanted to mark it...Yet her gesture, small and inadvertent, rang profound in the gathering dark." The attribute colors the consecration beat—Maya's unintended transformation of the houses—but functions more as thematic commentary than action constraint. It does not enable or foreclose choices elsewhere, and the inadvertence itself is told rather than dramatically shown through miscalculation or surprise. Present and consistent with closure, but swappable with "unintentional" or "accidental" without major revision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sanctify" appears explicitly in the closure beat: "She did not mean to sanctify the moment; she only wanted to mark it...Yet her gesture, small and inadvertent, rang profound." The act of placing the orris root beside the crystallized silence consecrates "the boundary where architecture becomes entity," triggering the cottage's recognition and the final transformation. The action is causally necessary to the ending and irreplaceable in its spiritual/ceremonial weight. However, the verb appears only once, late (final third), and the gesture itself (placing one object beside another) could be described with less charged language if the thematic weight were removed. Strong closure linkage but introduced too late for highest integration scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method "through displaced objects" is signaled early ("tracking through displaced objects, reading the grammar of rearrangement") and shapes Maya's investigation across multiple beats: trailing fingers on fence posts "displaced three inches left," cataloging the spoon in the garden and boot on the roof as ears collecting vibrations, and culminates in her realization that displaced objects serve the houses' listening. The method is profession-specific, constrains her tactics (she must find and interpret rearrangements), and the ending confirms its validity ("tomorrow the fence posts would have moved again, continuing their slow conversation"). Mechanics are taught and matter; removing this method would require complete reimagining of Maya's investigative practice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" provides spatial anchors (seawall, cottages, blue cottage at the bend) and temporal mood (copper light, lilacs "too thickly for April," first true stars). The bay's acoustic properties implicitly support the houses' listening ("collecting vibrations from the water, the wind"), and Maya walks along its seawall at opening and closing, framing the investigation. However, the bay itself does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics—Maya could conduct this investigation in any residential area with sentient structures. Setting is coherent and purposeful but not mechanically essential; trends toward atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" appears in the opening line and recurs twice: the lights "flickered through their daydreaming cycle between amber and white" at the pattern-coalescence moment, then "settled into their steady glow, waking fully from their daydream" when Maya places the orris root. The timeframe brackets the investigation and modulates with pressure (flickering during discovery, steady at consecration), charging the closure image. However, it does not create urgency or tighten decisions—Maya's investigation proceeds at contemplative pace without a ticking clock. The daydreaming cycle is more tonal motif than constraint, and the specific duration (one evening) is loose rather than tracked. Lyric reprise that reweights but does not pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why some houses feel alive" is stated explicitly in the opening ("Tonight she had come to understand") and closing ("She had come to understand why some houses feel alive"), framing the investigation. Maya's desire drives her systematic cataloging, the search for pattern, and the moment of realization at the foundation. The want is dramatized through her actions (trailing fingers, pressing orris root, kneeling to search) and satisfied on the page when she finds the crystallized silence shard and understands accumulation-as-sentience. However, the motivation lacks internal friction—no competing want or cost to understanding—and the satisfaction arrives cleanly without sacrifice. Present across beats and resolved, but unopposed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" appears explicitly in the closure image: the cottage glows with "a hushed blaze of interior light, neither fully lamp nor fully bioluminescence." The oxymoronic pairing (quiet intensity) governs tone throughout—Maya's investigation is contemplative yet charged, the houses' aliveness is gentle yet profound, the ending is quiet yet transformative. Tone modulates with pressure: calm cataloging in exposition, intensifying wonder at pattern-coalescence, reverent stillness at consecration, satisfied knowledge in the final walk. The phrase crystallizes the story's tonal paradox and charges the final image with undeniable intensity. Coherent, purposeful, and irreplaceable in its specific diction.</comment>
