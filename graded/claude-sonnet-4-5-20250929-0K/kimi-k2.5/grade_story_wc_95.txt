<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aldric's mechanical arm and philosophical stakes are established, but his interiority remains abstract—motivations are told through metaphor ("questions into destinations") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The fencing itself reads as choreography without embodied emotion; when Silas attacks "diplomatically fierce," the phrase labels rather than shows physical urgency. The final truce feels unmotivated by prior causality: no on-page struggle between competing desires forces the choice to collaborate. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("dignity in disguise," "certainty that some overtures must be fought for") flattens the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the opening paragraph. The dominant stake—decode the sundial to find the library—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, the closure operates as a Resonant Reconfiguration (truce and departure) whose cost is stated rather than felt: no visible forfeiture or foreclosed path appears on the page. The needle-alignment moment delivers information but not a choice under pressure. The inferred lens is Causal with a late Accumulative accent, but the final image asserts "certainty" without showing what was risked or lost to reach it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass atrium, Victorian ironwork, and brook are vivid and anchored early. The sundial's half-painted face provides a concrete visual puzzle. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—the duel and the decoding could occur in any room with a sundial. Micro-setting strength (the needle card, the bronze face) remains decorative until the alignment beat, which describes rather than pressures. The final departure leaves the atrium behind without recharging its imagery at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (find the hidden coordinates) is clear and pursued. The fencing provides movement but does not escalate pressure—Silas's attack is parried without cost, and Aldric's mechanical torque advantage solves the problem immediately. One meaningful tightening occurs when the needles align with the shadows, but this is a reveal rather than a choice that narrows options. The truce and departure conclude without visible trade-off: no live option is foreclosed, no tactic forced by a persistent constraint. The final line asserts "certainty" but no on-page price is paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—questions as maps, incomplete art as invitation—is stated repeatedly ("questions can become maps," "dignity in disguise") rather than emerging from action. The sundial's dual nature (chaos/dignity) is told in Aldric's reflection, not demonstrated through conflicting interpretations that force a choice. The needle-as-key metaphor in the final beat gestures toward resonance but arrives as ornament, not as a reweighted particular. The closing line ("some overtures must be fought for before they can be heard") reads as a thematic summary rather than a non-literal answer earned by the scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third on Aldric; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, with some voice-specific texture ("fractured prism," "pneumatic precision"). However, perceptual signature is thin—Aldric's way of noticing does not feel philosopher-specific, and the mechanical arm is described externally ("whirred," "clicking") without interior sensation. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Silas's single exchange carries subtext. The peak duel beat uses filter constructs ("suggesting he intended," "knew to look") that dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains stable but does not modulate with pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear. However, persistent overwriting clutters high-pressure beats: "diplomatically fierce composure," "calculating warmth," "pneumatic precision," "indifferent commentary" stack modifiers without adding clarity. The alignment beat—"the hidden overture to their expedition lay encoded in the angles"—buries the mechanics in abstraction. Two paraphrase loops appear: "questions can become maps" / "turn questions into destinations" and "dignified chaos" / "chaos…was actually dignity in disguise." Template cadence runs in the duel sequence ("Silas lunged… Aldric blocked… then used"). No outright artifacts obscure causality, but density sags under figurative weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dueling-philosopher frame and the sundial-as-cipher offer a steampunk-philosophical synthesis that feels constructed rather than inevitable. The mechanical arm and the Danish needle card are vivid particulars, but their combination reads as checklist rather than organic necessity—swap the needle card for any small marked object and the logic holds. The "fencing as collaborative argument" turn is philosophically tidy but not freshly rendered; the final handshake and departure follow a familiar truce template. No bold structural risk elevates the premise, and the emotional truth (two men realizing they want the same thing) resolves without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Aldric is present throughout and makes two decisions: to wait for dawn, and to align the needles. The mechanical arm enables the torque move that creates space but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The "philosopher" identity is label-only; no on-page syllogism or argument shapes his tactics. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, but the character's choices are reactive and the arm's function is convenience rather than necessity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Danish tin sewing needle card appears in three beats: Aldric holds it in the opening, uses it to decode the sundial at midpoint, and hands one needle to Silas at the end. The alignment beat is the story's hinge, and the final exchange reweights the needles as "key." However, the card's specific properties (seven needles, stork image) do not matter—any marked tool would serve. Closure linkage is strong but swappability and ornamental description in the opening lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "hidden overture" is named twice but never dramatized as a stake that changes options. The Cartographer's Guild message is exposition without on-page discovery friction. The concept appears in setup (paragraph 10) and is resolved in the alignment beat, but it does not constrain Aldric's tactics or force a trade-off. It functions as a thematic label rather than a pressure that narrows choices. Swappable with "hidden map" or "secret coordinates."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is applied to Silas once in description and once in the duel, but it remains label-only. The trait does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost—Silas lunges and Aldric parries without the attribute altering tactics. The diction is vivid but does not generate friction or trade-off on the page. Appears in setup and development but not at closure; no causal pressure tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The fencing occupies three beats: Silas's entry and épée draw, the circling exchange, and Aldric's parry-and-torque resolution. The action provides movement and spatial staging but does not create a turn—Aldric's mechanical advantage solves the problem without cost. Removing "fence" and substituting "argue while decoding" would require only minor edits. The action is present across setup, development, and a glancing closure mention, but it does not redefine options or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial is introduced early, its mechanics explained in one paragraph, and used at the story's hinge when Aldric aligns the needles. The method shapes the central attempt and is signaled clearly. However, the decoding itself is told—"formed a constellation of vectors pointing southeast"—rather than shown through trial or friction. The sundial does not reappear in the final image. Strong middle involvement but thin closure linkage and minimal struggle lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The glass atrium and brook are anchored in the opening and provide spatial coherence. The sundial is mounted on the atrium's wall, and the glass ceiling admits the necessary sunlight. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the duel and decoding could occur in any lit room with a sundial. The brook's "indifferent commentary" is ornamental. Setup and development presence are clear, but closure participation is absent and the setting remains postcard description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "while waiting" is signaled in the opening and governs Aldric's preparation: he waits for dawn to read the sundial's shadows. The wait creates mild anticipation but does not tighten decisions—Silas arrives, the sun clears the ridge, and the plan proceeds without friction. The clock is present in setup and development but does not alter tactics or create a turn. The ending asserts "no longer waiting" without showing what was risked by the delay.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The desire "to turn questions into destinations" is Aldric's stated goal and appears in his dialogue and the closing line. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or embodied cost. No on-page moment shows Aldric choosing this aim over an alternative or paying a price to pursue it. The motivation frames the plot but does not generate friction or a trade-off. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" is named once in the resolution paragraph and alluded to in the sundial's description ("chaos…was actually dignity in disguise"). The tone remains elevated and measured throughout; no modulation with pressure is evident—the duel and the discovery read with the same register and tempo. The phrase charges the theme but does not shape the final image or reconfigure prior material with visible cost. Closure participation is thin and the tone remains static rather than dynamic.</comment>
