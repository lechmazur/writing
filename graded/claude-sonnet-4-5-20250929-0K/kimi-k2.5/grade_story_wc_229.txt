<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and his motivation (proving whispers travel farther than shouts) shapes his final action. The metaphysical mechanics—jasmine cork purifying intentions—strain plausibility and blur motivation at the closure beat: does he save the ship through scent-vapors or symbolic gesture? Internal contradiction remains underexplored; his five years of submission pivot too cleanly into decisive action without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The weeping finale edges toward performed emotion rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors (assistant keeper, lighthouse, post-heat dawn) arrive early. The closure reconfigures the gentleness-versus-force premise, but causal linkage is weak: the cork's mechanism (jasmine oils vaporizing to "seduce air into carrying meaning" and "purify intentions") remains unexplained, and the Maria Celeste's correction feels coincidental rather than earned by Elias's prior choices. The cost (weeping "with the violence of his own quiet") reads as emotional catharsis, not a decisive forfeiture or Charged Poise that narrows future options. Orientation Test penalty waived (anchors land early); lens holds, but closure cost lacks on-page legibility beyond sentiment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, slate-gray dawn, iron-tasting air, and the Fresnel lens are vivid and selective. The jasmine garden and vial cork function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, lamp room, Atlantic below) remains clear. The heat wave's aftermath subtly pressures Elias's timing, and the experimental brass receiver modification integrates setting into choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (sweating walls, salt-crusted lens) without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving that gentleness succeeds where force fails. Pressure accumulates through Voss's exhausted batteries and the Maria Celeste's distress, tightening Elias's window. Agency is present (he constructs the modification, places the cork), but the ship's course correction feels coincidental—no on-page resistance or tactical adjustment by Elias tests his theory under fire. The felt cost (weeping, knowing his method works) remains emotional rather than a visible trade-off or forfeiture that narrows options. One meaningful tightening occurs (dawn + distressed vessel), but escalation lacks causal friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—whispers versus shouts, tenderness as absolute strength—emerges from imagery (jasmine, cobalt light, beckoning versus commanding) and Elias's contrast with Voss. The final image (jasmine-scented light "asking instead of demanding") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Elias's silent years and the cork's symbolic weight. Minor slip: "screaming tenderness" and "violence of his own quiet" edge toward oxymoron-as-theme-statement rather than embodied paradox, and the captain's panic-to-clarity shift is told, not dramatized, reducing thematic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds throughout; psychic distance remains stable. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices jasmine, condensation, lamp mechanics). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("screaming tenderness of withheld breath," "frequencies too subtle for human ears") that sits uneasily with the assistant keeper's voice under stress. No dialogue on the page to assess. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts at the climax, longer syntactic arcs in reflection), but the final paragraph's stacked metaphors ("violence of his own quiet," "tenderness, when absolute and unafraid, screams louder") feel authorial rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>High figurative density in peak beats: "screaming tenderness," "fever dream," "violence of his own quiet," "lullaby sung through clenched teeth"—mixed metaphors that blur rather than sharpen (screaming tenderness contradicts itself; violence of quiet is abstraction). Paraphrase loops: "vibrations of intent" and "purifying intentions" reappear without added pressure. Template cadence in the opening (comma-stacked descriptors) and final paragraph (stacked that-clauses). Stock phrases: "the world could breathe again," "drowning in noise." Deductions: figurative muddle −0.6, loops −0.4, stock phrasing −0.3, register drift −0.2 = cumulative −1.5 in Q7. Information density is high, but clarity suffers at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse keeper uses scent to guide ships—offers a fresh angle on beacon-rescue tales. The jasmine-cork mechanism is specific but borders on magical realism without establishing world rules (how do "vibrations of intent" work?). Emotional specificity in Elias's five-year wait and Voss's drunk isolation elevates the frame. The gentleness-over-force theme is earnest but resolved tidily; the Maria Celeste's correction lacks friction or ambiguity. Risk is present in the metaphysical leap, but swappability remains: replace jasmine with another symbolic object and the arc holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias drives setup (wiping glass, rescuing cork, constructing receiver), middle choice (placing cork at dawn), and closure (watching the ship correct, weeping). His assistant role frames the Voss contrast and stakes. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost (emotional) is felt but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cork appears in three beats: rescue from Voss (night three ago), Elias pressing it to lips in bunk (understanding its truth), placement in brass receiver at dawn (closure). Early signal, causal enabling (vaporizes to send signals), and closure participation. Specificity (carved from jasmine root) matters. Visible cost linkage is thin (emotional realization rather than forfeiture), capping score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vibrations of intent shape the mechanism: cork "remembers" vibrations, oils send "invisible signals," purifying the captain's panic into clarity. Present in setup (Elias's understanding), development (placement in receiver), and closure (beam reaches ship). Causal pressure is moderate—mechanics remain abstract, reducing irreplaceability. Lyric resonance (whisper-vs-shout frame) elevates but cannot fully overcome vagueness.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Purifies intentions appears as the cork's attributed function: strips desperation, transforms panic into clarity. Mentioned in setup (night flowers "purify intentions") and invoked at closure (vibrations "purifying intentions as they went"). No middle beat where Elias tests or struggles with purification; the trait is told, not dramatized. Missing middle development caps at 3.4; lyric reprise lifts to 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Beckon is the climactic action: the light "beckoned" the Maria Celeste, contrasting with Voss's commanding shouts. Present in closure image ("called home the lost with a voice that asked instead of demanded") and thematically framed throughout (whispers vs. shouts). Early signal via setup contrast, decisive closure participation. Swappability is moderate (invite, draw, summon could substitute with minor edits), capping score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Scent of garden at night is the method: jasmine oils embedded in cork vaporize in lamp heat, sending signals. Setup (night-blooming jasmine survived heat, opens after dark), development (Elias constructs brass receiver for cork), closure (oils vaporize, beam beckons ship). All three gates, causal mechanics, closure linkage. Specificity (nocturnal bloom, scent-as-signal) is high. Cost connection is implied but not dramatized, capping below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Cobalt lighthouse at dawn anchors all action: cobalt walls heat the lamp, dawn timing forces Elias's move before Voss wakes, spiral stairs and lamp room provide spatial constraint. Setup (opening line), development (climbing stairs, placing cork), closure (beam sweeps water, cobalt melting into gold). Early signal, beat involvement, closure charge. Irreplaceability is high (cobalt color returns in final image, dawn light triggers vaporization). Visible cost (timing pressure) elevates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>After the heat wave breaks is the timeframe: opening line ("heat broke at midnight"), post-storm Atlantic, Elias's window before Voss wakes. Setup and closure participation clear; middle development weaker (three-week backstory compresses the temporal constraint). Time tightens Elias's decision (dawn + sleeping Voss) but does not track minute-to-minute pressure. Two gates plus moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prove that whispers travel farther than shouts is Elias's explicit motivation: stated near closure, dramatized through his choice to use cork (whisper) instead of foghorn (shout) and framed by five years as assistant. Setup (silent years, rescuing garden), development (constructing receiver), closure (ship responds to beckoning). Friction between want (prove tenderness works) and cost (weeping "violence of his own quiet") is present but told rather than enacted under pressure. All three gates, causal role, closure linkage; told motivation and thin on-page struggle cap below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Screaming tenderness appears throughout: opening ("screaming tenderness of withheld breath"), Elias's silent intensity, closure ("tenderness, when absolute and unafraid, screams louder than any storm"). Coherent paradox modulates with pressure (compressed in crisis, expanded at resolution). Setup and closure participation strong; middle beats rely on implication. The phrase itself is overwritten (oxymoron stacks metaphors), reducing tonal control. Two gates plus thematic charge, but line-level execution wobbles.</comment>
