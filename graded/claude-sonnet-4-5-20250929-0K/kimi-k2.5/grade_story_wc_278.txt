<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (guilt-driven time travel to save her daughter) is established and pursued. However, the resolution feels too assured: "the dissonance of old guilt finally resolving into a harmony" and the younger self turning back lack on-page friction or contradiction. The interiority remains at high metaphoric altitude throughout ("dissonant chord that had screamed beneath her ribs") without sufficient embodied specificity under pressure. The final choice—touching her own shoulder and transmitting understanding—bypasses genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who, where, when by line 2). Drive lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: cabinet arrival triggers temporal breach, amber anchors the fold, daughter's cries provide forgiveness, Elara touches her past self. Closure is a Decisive Change (younger Elara turns back) but the cost feels asserted rather than legible—no visible forfeiture or altered future state dramatized on the page. The phrase "collapsing the wave function of regret into a single, bearable truth" declares resolution without showing what Elara loses or what contradictions remain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass-dome laboratory, quantum equipment, amber scanning bed, and temporal breach mechanics are vividly rendered and internally consistent. The amber constrains her tether choice (micro-setting function). However, spatial choreography weakens during the climax: "walls became translucent, revealing overlapping timelines" and "etched a new constellation…across the surface of the folding air itself" sacrifice coherence for spectacle. The setting charges the final image but at the cost of legible physics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair the abandonment) is clear. Escalation proceeds causally: letters provide coordinates, amber provides material anchor, guilt provides energy, firmware wails, baby cries translate to forgiveness, tether holds. The reversal—her daughter's cries contain forgiveness rather than accusation—narrows options and tightens pressure. Cost is partly visible (the haunted firmware "hushed into peaceful sleep," the insect completes its flight) but the outcome—younger Elara turns back—feels like a gift rather than a trade-off with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of time, memory, guilt, and self-forgiveness emerges through constellation tattoos, lost sounds, and temporal fold. The amber-insect metaphor (forty-million-year prison completing its flight) is purposeful. However, the closure answers the thematic question too neatly: "dissonance…resolving into a harmony" and "collapsing the wave function of regret" are direct thematic statements rather than resonant images. The piece inches toward sermonizing when the "transmission of understanding" bypasses dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable. Diction is consistent and metaphorically dense ("frequency lost to the world," "temporal signature," "spectral tendrils"). However, register drifts into exposition at key moments: "those designed to interpret humanity's most primal language before syntax existed" and "the geological slowness of the fossil to the fleeting instant of birth and betrayal" read like authorial gloss rather than Elara's embodied thought under crisis pressure. The voice is coherent but not distinctive under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and ambitious but overwritten in peak beats. "Dissonant chord that had screamed beneath her ribs for two decades without finding resolution," "temporal breach," "spectral tendrils," "collapsing the wave function of regret" stack metaphoric and scientific diction without breathing room. Template cadence appears: "The amber provided the material anchor; her guilt provided the desperate energy." Paraphrase loop: "The meteor hush deepened, time pressing…" shortly after "that terrible meteor hush where sound seemed vacuumed…" Figurative density obscures rather than sharpens the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—tattooist of extinct sounds uses temporal fold to undo her abandonment—is fresh and specific. The amber-as-anchor, firmware-as-memory-archive, and constellation-as-frequency synthesis feel integrated. However, the core turn (time-travel self-intervention) is familiar SF territory, and the ending's mechanism ("transmission of understanding" via shoulder-touch) resolves without cost or surprise. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform the self-forgiveness template into an unexpected or riskier conclusion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as constellation tattooist frames her skill set (translating frequency into geometry, using haunted firmware). She activates translation protocols, places amber on the scanning bed, and etches a constellation across folding air—three distinct beats. Her profession enables the tether and shapes the closure image (star-maps on her arm). Removing "tattooist" would break the logic of how she accesses and archives lost sounds.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Amber appears in the cabinet's secret compartment, is placed on the scanning bed as material anchor, grows warm during the tether, and the insect completes its flight at closure—four functional beats. It provides the "geological slowness" needed to anchor consciousness across time. The specific property (forty-million-year preservation) is irreplaceable for the tether logic and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Haunted firmware drives escalation: it retains ghost-echoes, wails with temporal signature, extends spectral tendrils, and is finally "hushed into peaceful sleep." It enables the baby-cry translation and temporal breach. The firmware's archive function is essential to Elara's access to her daughter's first wails. Removing it would require a different mechanism for sound retrieval and temporal connection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Baby-cry translation occurs in one beat: "she translated baby cries into precise meaning, the raw phonemes resolving unexpectedly into forgiveness." This provides the emotional turn (forgiveness vs. accusation) but the attribute is introduced late (paragraph 4) and used only once. The translation could plausibly have been performed by the firmware alone; Elara's specific skill adds flavor but not irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Tether" recurs across the story: "tether herself to that specific moment," "tethering now," "The tether held long enough." The action structures the climax—using amber, letters, and guilt to anchor across time—and defines the story's central mechanism. It drives at least three beats and is present in the resolution. Swapping "tether" for "connect" or "link" would weaken specificity but the tethering action itself is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cabinet arrives in paragraph 1, contains the letters that provide temporal coordinates and the amber in a secret compartment. The handwritten letters are read, their confession noted, and their function (coordinates) is explicit. The cabinet frames the entire plot trigger. However, "antique furniture" as a category is generic; the story could function with letters and amber arriving via another vessel with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Laboratory of Lost Sounds supplies the quantum equipment, scanning bed, retinal displays, and archives that enable the temporal fold. The laboratory's "ghost-echoes" and sound-archiving mission justify Elara's tools and the firmware. The glass dome frames the meteor-hush pressure ("pressing against the laboratory windows"). The setting provides resources and constraints across multiple beats and charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The meteor hush triggers the temporal fold ("time folded in on itself"), deepens during the tether attempt, and creates the window for Elara's intervention. It is introduced early, recurs in paragraph 3 and 5, and the ending hinges on "When time unfolded." The timeframe is not a ticking clock but a cosmic opening that tightens options—Elara must act within the hush or lose the chance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Guilt is named in paragraph 2 ("guilt remained vibrant, a dissonant chord"), fuels the temporal breach ("her guilt provided the desperate energy"), and resolves in the ending ("dissonance of old guilt finally resolving into a harmony"). The motivation drives her twenty-year penance (cataloguing lost sounds) and the tether attempt. However, the internal conflict between guilt and hope is asserted more than dramatized; we see no moment where she doubts or resists the tether.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced in paragraph 2 as "that terrible meteor hush where sound seemed vacuumed from the universe," recurs in paragraph 5 ("The meteor hush deepened"), and frames the silence of the final confrontation ("In the meteor hush, no words passed"). The tone is eerie, vacuum-quiet, and elegiac. It modulates with pressure and charges the wordless ending. However, the tone label itself is more ornamental than functional—removing the phrase would not break the quiet atmosphere.</comment>
