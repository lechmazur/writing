<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eira's motivation is established and her interiority ("lovingly venomous," healing through pain) shows contradictory impulses, but her emotions trend toward poetic label ("mournful elation") rather than embodied action under pressure. Julian's sudden understanding ("terrible understanding," "gasped") accelerates too smoothly without genuine struggle or misbelief persisting long enough to cost him tactically. The final weeping-and-laughing simultaneity reads as a stock emotional endpoint rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (greenhouse, Julian's entry with lantern) arrive by ~10% and the closure unit—Julian burying the bead, Eira dissolving—occurs on the page with visible action. However, the causal link from "take it to the fields" to immediate ground-shuddering and star-cracking feels convenience-driven rather than earned by prior struggle or a decision that narrows options. The "resonant awakenings" flood Julian's mind with ancestral memories but those memories do not constrain his next move; he simply obeys Eira's command without visible friction or trade-off, weakening the felt cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse with mercury-rich soils, phosphorescent fruits, and iron ribs supplies vivid, specific anchors that distinguish this setting from generic gothic backdrops. The carved stone bead and the winter-cracked fields function as micro-settings that constrain Julian's final action (he must bury it "where the frost splits the earth"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor orientation slip: "endless night" and "starless void" are described early but the mechanism (is this supernatural stasis or a natural polar winter?) remains vague, reducing the sense of lived-in constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repaying a three-century debt by returning the bead to the earth—is signaled early and drives the ending action. However, escalation is thin: Eira reveals herself, explains the debt, hands Julian the bead, he buries it, and the curse lifts without a second reversal or a moment where Julian must choose between competing goods. The "sudden terrible understanding" accelerates him past genuine resistance, and the resolution (ground shudders, stars appear, greenhouse withers) occurs off his agency rather than through a decision that trades one value for another.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—debt, interrupted love, and the cost of release—emerges from concrete images (burial soil feeding the orchard, the carved bead as bride-price, the ashen veil dissolving) rather than assertion. The final image of Julian "weeping and laughing simultaneously" and the greenhouse "holding nothing but morning light" reweights the opening's "endless night" and "starless void," offering a resonant answer to the question of karmic convergence. Minor slip: "mournful elation" is named twice rather than solely embodied, and "gratitude mixed with goodbye, sorrow inseparable from release" in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds to Julian's experience in the second half; Eira's interiority in the opening and closing bookends creates a dual-focalization structure with clean section breaks, qualifying under Track C. Diction is elevated and consistent ("lovingly venomous," "resonant awakenings," "mournful elation") but borders on ornamental lyricism that prioritizes texture over the character's plausible lexicon under stress. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("You cultivated these trees…," "The debt…," "Take it to the fields") but lacks subtext or resistance that would reveal character hierarchy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "lovingly venomous, honey wrapped around broken glass," "the ecstasy of recognition and the agony of ancestral guilt flooding his nervous system like alchemical quicksilver," and "mournful elation of the repaid echoing in his chest like a second heart learning to beat" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen the moment. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph: "gratitude mixed with goodbye, sorrow inseparable from release" and "beautiful and deadly and brief" deploy parallel construction mechanically. Paraphrase loop: "resonant awakenings" is named three times across the text without distinct meaning shifts, and "ephemeral cameo appearances" is repeated verbatim in beats that restate rather than advance. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—a ghost bound by unpaid bride-price, sustained by alchemical soil, releasing her claim through a descendant—synthesizes gothic haunting with karmic debt and botanical alchemy in a non-obvious combination. However, the emotional arc (ancestral guilt → burial → mutual release) follows a familiar template, and key images (ashen veil, winter-cracked fields, carved stone bead) lean on gothic stock without transformation through lived detail or a moral calculus that resists easy resolution. The "endless night" cracking to reveal stars at the moment of debt repayment is visually striking but the mechanism remains unexplained, reducing the sense of world logic earned through action.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Eira (ashen-veil ghost bride) appears by paragraph one, drives the middle revelation ("You cultivated these trees with my burial soil"), commands Julian to plant the bead, and dissolves at closure when the debt is repaid. Her decision to "ghost through ephemeral cameo appearances" and later to press the bead into Julian's palm are active choices that shape his understanding and final action. She is present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and her dissolution is causally tied to the bead's burial, meeting the necessity test. Minor friction: her agency in the middle is declarative (she explains and commands) rather than forcing a choice where Julian must weigh competing costs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The carved stone bead is introduced early ("clutched in her translucent fingers"), returns with reweighted meaning when Eira presses it into Julian's palm ("flooding his blood with the weight of what his lineage had stolen"), and drives the closure action (Julian buries it "where the frost splits the earth"). It appears in at least three distinct beats (Eira's first manifestation, the transfer, the burial) and the ground's response to its burial demonstrates causal pressure. The bead's properties (carved from the heart-stone where Eira died, pulsing with "resonant awakenings") are specific and irreplaceable, though the "resonant awakenings" mechanism remains slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Resonant awakenings" is named three times but functions primarily as a label for Julian's sudden memory-flood rather than a constraint or tactic that shapes his choices. The phrase appears in beat two ("triggered in Julian's mind memories that were not his own") and again in the final paragraph ("the resonant awakening that was actually an ending"), but the mechanism—how the bead triggers these memories, why they compel rather than inform—is not dramatized. It reads as thematic dressing rather than a rule or stake that alters his options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Lovingly venomous" is attributed to Eira's voice and nature ("her voice lovingly venomous, honey wrapped around broken glass"; "the lovingly venomous nature of her existence") and informs her approach: she heals Julian through the painful revelation of ancestral guilt. This trait enables one key beat—the transfer of the bead and the memory-flood—but the cost is felt by Julian rather than chosen by Eira, and the attribute itself does not constrain her later actions. It is present in setup and middle but does not return with reweighted meaning at closure, capping it near mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The action "ghost" (verb) is signaled early ("She had haunted this place," "she chose to ghost through ephemeral cameo appearances") and recurs in the middle ("She was ghosting now in truth") and at closure ("through ephemeral cameo appearances in the snowflakes"). The method shapes Eira's tactics (flickering manifestations rather than full revelation) and the final image of her "outline becoming the outline of winter itself" ties the ghosting to her dissolution. The verb is specific to her supernatural state and would be difficult to swap, though the causal link between ghosting and debt-repayment is left implicit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" is introduced early as Eira's method ("flickering between the mandrake rows," "appeared first as a reflection in a dewdrop, then as a shadow cast by no light") and returns in the final paragraph ("through ephemeral cameo appearances in the snowflakes"). The phrase describes her manifestation style but does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; Julian does not struggle to perceive her or act differently because of the cameo nature. It functions as setup and closure reprise without middle development, capping it in the mid-6s per the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night" anchors the opening and provides specific resources (phosphorescent fruits, mercury-rich soils, iron ribs, glass panes) that Eira explains were "cultivated with my burial soil." The greenhouse's withering at closure ("no longer needing to sustain her between worlds") demonstrates causal pressure: its existence was tied to the debt, and its dissolution marks resolution. The setting appears in setup, middle (Eira's revelation), and payoff (the greenhouse "stood empty… holding nothing but morning light"), and its clearing is a visible cost that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Over the hush of winter-cracked fields" appears in the opening and final paragraphs, framing the three-century wait and the morning resolution. The timeframe (three centuries of haunting, one night of resolution) is declared but does not tighten Julian's tactics or create a live clock; he acts immediately upon understanding without a countdown or competing deadline. The winter-cracked fields supply spatial anchors and mood but do not pressure choices, and the "endless night" / dawn shift is metaphorical rather than a tracked duration that alters his moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to repay a debt across lifetimes" drives Eira's three-century wait and her decision to reveal herself to Julian, the "final descendant." The debt is dramatized through the bead (her unpaid bride-price) and the soil (her burial earth feeding the orchard), and Eira's command ("Take it to the fields") and dissolution show the cost of release. The motivation appears in setup (her sworn wait), middle (her explanation to Julian), and payoff (her dissolution). Minor friction: the debt is explained rather than discovered through Julian's resistance, and his compliance is immediate rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Mournful elation" is named twice (Julian's reaction, the final paragraph's "mournful elation of the repaid") and the tone is consistent through both characters' experience: Eira's "strange, mournful elation" at truth spoken, Julian's "weeping and laughing simultaneously." The tone modulates with pressure (venomous revelation → painful understanding → bittersweet release) and charges the final image ("gratitude mixed with goodbye, sorrow inseparable from release"). However, the tone is declared more often than embodied through contradictory action, and the label itself ("mournful elation") is repeated rather than discovered through gesture.</comment>
