<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is densely present but often operates in therapy-speak register ("seeking the silence that could teach her how to be still," "discover purpose in the pauses"). The arc from suicidal despair to renewal is traced, but the pivot hinges on discovered journals rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion appears intermittently (frost melting, breath clouding) but peak moments lean toward summary and label rather than contradiction under pressure. The final choice to return and rebuild reads as decided off-page, announced rather than enacted with visible cost at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors who and where by the second sentence; when is signaled ("three weeks prior," "Morning came"). The closure offers a repricing of the ledger from debt to devotion, but the cost is conceptual and retrospective rather than a felt forfeiture on the page. The cave discovery and journal reveal are convenient arrivals; the frost-pattern method functions as decoration rather than a constraint that narrows options. One meaningful deepening occurs (ledger reinterpreted), satisfying minimum escalation, but the protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception of new information rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Canyon setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frost silvering sandstone, red rock like frozen flame) and filtered through Mara's glass-artist lens. The frost patterns and charcoal crates anchor the plot, and the cave mouth's concealment by "fall of red rock" ties directly to the discovery beat. Spatial choreography is clean (rim → floor → cave), and the environment subtly mirrors the internal arc (burned studio → frozen morning → hidden preservation). The setting constrains the search and charges the final image of canyon falling away, meeting the 9+ test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding her father's hidden route and her own survival. Pressure accumulates through the search, but escalation is passive—frost reveals, journals explain—rather than protagonist agency narrowing options. The cave discovery is coincidental, and the journals resolve a problem (unknown debt) they did not help create on the page. One tightening occurs (reinterpretation of the ledger), but the cost is retrospective understanding rather than a trade-off or visible sacrifice at closure. No antagonist or reversal; the "attempt" backstory provides context but does not generate on-page opposition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of devotion-beneath-despair emerges through the ledger and charcoal images, not overt statement. The final reweighting—debt to map of devotion—is earned by prior material and resists a tidy moral. However, phrases like "scorched testament," "drifting resonance," and "purpose in the pauses" function as prompt-echo labels rather than particulars, and the ending summary ("The scorched testament had taught her…") borders on moralizing. Subtext operates in image (frost patterns, frozen flame), but the protagonist's epiphany is articulated rather than dramatized, and the return to the city is announced as conclusion rather than enacted with on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (glass-artist lens: "silica and flame," "cooling slowly in its mold") and consistent. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during discovery, wider during transit summary). However, diction often drifts into elevated register ("luminous," "drifting resonance," "scorched testament") that reads as imposed rather than character-particular, especially under the stated despair. Free indirect style is clean, but several passages (e.g., "The scorched testament had taught her…") slip into helpful-narrator exposition. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean, with strong imagery (frost outlining wagon ruts, red rock like frozen flame). Information density is high in setting passages. However, pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "steadily adaptive" recurs three times in similar constructions; "scorched testament" appears four times with minimal variation; "purpose in the pauses" is both stated and restated. Multiple sentences open with "She + [verb]" or "The + [noun]" across adjacent lines. Stock metaphors (stars without judgment, struck bell) and therapy-speak labels ("desperate luminosity," "drifting resonance") cluster in peak beats. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: baseline −0.8 for loops and cadence, −0.3 for register drift. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("The scorched testament had taught her…"), triggering the disallow-9+ flag globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass-artist protagonist and charcoal-ledger inheritance offer a specific synthesis, and the frost-pattern detail is fresh. However, the core arc—protagonist discovers parent's hidden sacrifice, reframes past despair—closely matches a widely used template (parental-devotion reveal as healing pivot). The suicide-attempt framing and "purpose in the pauses" phrasing read as prompt-derived rather than lived detail. Emotional truth is present in the survival and search, but the resolution via convenient journals and the lack of on-page friction at the ending limit transformation. The piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks; the single-scene search and discovery follow a predictable causal path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her glass-artist identity colors perception (silica, flame, cooling glass metaphors). However, her key "decision" at closure—to return and rebuild—is announced as future intention rather than enacted on the page. The search and discovery are reactive (frost reveals, journals explain) rather than choices that narrow options. She appears in setup, middle, and ending, satisfying gate presence, but her occupation functions more as perceptual filter than causal driver. She does not make a choice at closure that forecloses a path with visible cost; instead, she receives information and declares a plan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ledger strip is introduced in the opening line, handled physically ("crinkled in her palm"), and returns at closure as "no longer a burden of debt but a map of devotion." It appears in at least three beats (opening, frost-matching, final drive). However, its reweighting occurs through received information (journals) rather than protagonist action or evolving use. The strip's partial coordinates guide the search, satisfying setup and middle development, and it closes the piece with reweighted meaning, meeting all three gates. Specificity is moderate (charcoal smuggler's ledger, scorched, names half-burned), but it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; the protagonist simply carries it and reinterprets it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" is named four times and functions as both object (the burned ledger strip) and thematic tag (testament to father's sacrifice). It shapes stakes by representing unknown debts and guiding the search via partial coordinates. However, the concept is more echo than constraint; it does not force a tactical trade-off or limit options. The piece uses "scorched testament" as recurring label in setup, middle reflection, and closure summary, satisfying gate presence but remaining largely ornamental. The final-paragraph invocation ("The scorched testament had taught her…") is thematic claim rather than causal lever. Visible cost tied to the concept is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is claimed three times: once at the canyon (adjusting methods to terrain), once at the cave (planning to create something new), and once in the final summary (working with steady adaptability). Each mention is label-only assertion rather than enacted constraint or trade-off. The trait does not narrow options or impose visible cost; it describes her approach without showing a moment where adaptability limits another impulse or enables a specific risky move. No beat demonstrates the cost of adapting versus forcing her will. Present in setup and ending but purely decorative.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Retrace" is the action motor: Mara retraces her father's smuggling route via the ledger and frost patterns, leading to the cave discovery and journals. The verb appears explicitly ("She needed to retrace," "She would retrace her way back") and structures the search sequence. Two beats depend on it: the frost-pattern walk and the return drive. However, the retracing is passive following (frost reveals, journals inform) rather than a choice with cost. The action is essential to the plot's movement and appears in setup, middle, and ending, but it could be swapped for "follow" or "track" with minor edits. Closure hinges on retracing, but the final beat is announcement rather than enacted cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The frost patterns appear in one extended passage (morning frost outlining wagon ruts, matching partial coordinates on the ledger). Mara "studied the patterns" and "walked the canyon floor, following these crystalline maps." The method is signaled and used once to enable discovery of the cave. However, the mechanics are convenient rather than constraining; the frost simply reveals what daylight hid, and no trade-off or failed attempt is shown. The method does not recur or shape tactics beyond this single beat. Closure does not return to it; the frost has "melted into memory" by the ending. Present in middle development but absent from setup and ending, capping at ~4.6 per the gate model. Specificity is moderate (ice crystals, depressions), but the method is ornamental to the plot's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The canyon is anchored early ("canyon rim," "quiet canyon under stars") and constrains the search spatially (rim → floor → concealed cave). Sensory details (frost, sandstone, red rock) are vivid and purposeful. The cave's concealment behind rock "like frozen flame" directly shapes the discovery, and the canyon's silence becomes part of Mara's internal shift ("its silence now part of her voice"). The setting appears in setup, middle, and ending, charges the final image ("canyon falling away behind her"), and supplies the resource (hidden cave) that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is clean. The micro-setting test is met: canyon setting constrains movement and charges closure. Additive signals: early anchor +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8. Baseline 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0, slight friction for shared credit with frost/cave (−0.1) = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt—her own, three weeks prior" anchors the timeframe in the opening and frames Mara's emotional state. The three-week gap functions as backstory context rather than a live constraint. No clock tightens present decisions; the search unfolds across morning without urgency. The ending references the attempt as past context ("had survived the fire") but does not use elapsed time to pressure tactics. Present in setup and thematically in ending reflection, but absent from middle development as a constraint. Time is told rather than tracked, and the protagonist's choices are not shaped by temporal scarcity or deadline. Ornamental to stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Discover purpose in the pauses" is stated directly in the opening third ("to discover purpose in the pauses, those gaps between breaths") and reprised in the ending ("finding in each pause the purpose she'd sought"). The motivation shapes her slower approach (walking, studying frost, sitting with knowledge) and contrasts with prior "frantic intensity." However, the desire is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. No beat shows her tempted to rush or forced to choose patience over urgency with visible cost. The motivation appears in setup and ending, satisfying two gates, but remains label-driven. Friction between wants and costs is claimed but not enacted. Present and thematically coherent, but swappable with "find meaning" or "seek understanding."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" is named once mid-story ("drifting resonance of connection across time") and evoked in final images (stars lingering, silence as voice, vibration like a struck bell). Tone is lyric, contemplative, and elegiac throughout, modulating slightly from despair-tinged opening to quiet resolve at closure. However, the tone is static rather than dynamically charged by pressure; peak discovery beats (cave, journals) do not shift cadence or intensify rhythm. The final image maintains the drifting register without tightening or breaking the established mood. Coherent and purposeful, but does not escalate or charge the closure image with tonal contrast or surprise. Present across the piece and consistent, but ornamental to pressure.</comment>
