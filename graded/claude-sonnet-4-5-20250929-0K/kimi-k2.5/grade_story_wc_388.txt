<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation as debunker is clear and her final choice to repair rather than destroy is earned by the letters. However, her interiority reads as explanatory rather than contradictory—she observes, deduces, explains, but never wrestles with competing impulses in scene. The settlers' fear is told rather than dramatized through individual reactions, and their accusation arrives without prior friction to charge it. Embodied emotion is sparse; most beats summarize her mental work rather than showing her under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal: letters → comprehension → repair, with cost visible in the settlers' need to learn maintenance and Mara's departure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines. The closure—Mara walking away after transferring knowledge—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (she leaves, they must now maintain what they inherited). One deduction: the settlers' accusation and her defense feel inserted rather than causally prepared; their presence in the cellar and the timing of confrontation lack setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard, dust storms, and diamond constraint shape the central problem and recur across beats. Sensory detail is selective: amber dust, bioluminescent lantern, radiation burns on her fingers. The resonator and root cellar ground the climax spatially. The storms pausing and the buffer zone expanding at the end charge the final image with environmental consequence. Minor slip: "iron-skinned apple trees" and "trees bore fruit without seeds" are vivid but their tactile handling is not dramatized; they remain observed rather than touched or used.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the orchard by repairing the stillpoint—signals early and tightens when Mara discovers the field is failing. The breakthrough (reassembled letters) and the peak action (calibrating the resonator) are protagonist-driven. Visible cost: the settlers must now learn the science, and Mara leaves her sanctuary to continue her work. One micro turn when the diamond's crack "seemed to close slightly" raises stakes without a full reversal. No antagonist beyond ignorance, which fits the debunker frame.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth vs. myth, comprehension over wonder—emerges organically from Mara's work and the settlers' fear without overt statement. The flawed diamond shifts from curse to "salvageable science," and the final image of Mara walking toward the storm line offers a non-literal answer: dismantling lies is iterative, not final. The closing line "ready to find the next lie that needed dismantling" avoids moralizing while reweighting her role. Minor: "her role was not to destroy wonder but to replace it with something more durable: comprehension" edges toward thesis statement but stays character-voiced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; distance is controlled. Diction is consistent and professional without register drift. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated. Voice has texture: "offended her need to excavate truth from comfortable lies," "broken physics," "salvageable science." One slip: "sharply observant" is asserted three times as a label rather than demonstrated through her noticing choices. Filter verbs ("began to intuit," "understanding now") appear in peak beats and dull immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high; no spatial confusion or timeline breaks. Information density is strong in the middle third (letters, stillpoint mechanics, calibration). Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] was [state]" constructions across the explanation beats. Paraphrase loop: "The stillpoint was not a place but a frequency" followed immediately by "creating the invisible dome that repelled the dust" restates mechanism without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "storms circled like hungry wolves" and "cracks in ice" are functional but unearned. No loops touch the closure beat, so cap non-closure deductions at −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of post-apocalyptic orchard, debunker protagonist, and failed science reads as a competent synthesis but not a fresh premise; the "curse was actually science" trope is familiar. Specificity in the stillpoint mechanics (frequency, lattice flaws, calibration) and the shredded-letter method add texture. The protagonist's occupation as conspiracy debunker is underused—she reconstructs a puzzle but does not confront or dismantle a living conspiracy. Transformation test: swapping names and the specific "liquidation" frame would not fundamentally alter the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara appears in every beat and her choices drive the plot: she finds the letters, reassembles them, builds the resonator, and confronts the settlers. Her decision to repair rather than leave creates the closure turn. Early signal (first line), development (letter reconstruction), and payoff (resonator activation) are all present. Causal pressure is strong. One friction: her debunker role is asserted but not tested by a live conspiracy or challenger on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The diamond is present in beat one (rumor), beat two (root cellar discovery), beat three (its flaws explained), and beat four (placed in the resonator where its crack aligns). It shifts from curse to containment vessel to tool, reweighting across the arc. Causal: its molecular imperfections are the mechanism for the stillpoint. Closure: its alignment in the resonator is the final action that expands the field. High irreplaceability; no near-synonym object could replace it. One slip: it is not handled or observed tactilely until the final beat, reducing embodied specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stillpoint concept anchors the problem (failing field), the discovery (letters reveal it), and the solution (calibration). It shapes tactics: Mara must understand frequency mechanics to repair it. Closure: the field expansion is the stillpoint's on-page consequence. Early signal ("biological stillpoint—a zone of absolute genetic stability") and development (diagnosis of failure) and payoff (repair and expansion) all present. Specificity: "frequency," "genetic stability," "lattice flaws" give it mechanical weight. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is asserted three times but demonstrates limited on-page cost or constraint. She notices the dust storms' perfect circle and the settlers' avoidance of the diamond's core, which frame the mystery but do not force a tradeoff. Setup and development present; payoff weak. The trait enables discovery but does not create friction or force a choice she would not otherwise make. Swappable: "perceptive" or "analytical" would function identically with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears once in the middle: "Mara began to intuit the deeper architecture as she matched the final scraps." It signals her breakthrough but is summary rather than dramatized perception. Development and payoff present (she builds the resonator based on the intuited architecture). One beat involvement. Causal pressure moderate: the intuition enables the repair, but the text does not show what she noticed or inferred in the moment. Swappability: "deduced" or "understood" would fit with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method (reassembling letters) is signaled early ("shredded letters scattered beneath the compost bins") and occupies three nights of on-page effort. It drives the breakthrough: the letters reveal the stillpoint mechanics and calibration frequencies. Development strong: tweezers, adhesive, bioluminescent lantern, radiation burns. Payoff: "By reassembling the shredded letters, she had recovered the calibration frequencies needed to stabilize the diamond." Two beats, causal pressure, closure participation. Minor: the actual content of the letters is summarized rather than quoted or shown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The orchard frames the story, supplies the mystery (iron-skinned trees, seedless fruit, storm circle), and is the object Mara saves. The root cellar is the site of discovery and confrontation. The wasteland and dust storms pressure survival and charge the ending when the field expands. Setup, development (orchard as sanctuary, the trees' anomalies), and payoff (buffer zone expansion, new trees) all present. The orchard's survival is the dominant stake. Strong causal and closure linkage. Minor: micro-setting (tools, tree handling) is noted but not tactilely dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" anchors the timeframe in the opening and recurs as context (pre-liquidation letters, post-liquidation survivors). It supplies backstory pressure (governments erased, scientists destroyed) but does not create a live ticking clock. The "failing within months" diagnosis adds urgency but is not tracked on the page. Setup present, development weak (time does not narrow her choices in scene), payoff absent (no deadline confronted). Functional but replaceable; "after the collapse" would serve identically.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—excavate truth from comfortable lies—is stated early and drives her investigation. It shapes her confrontation with the settlers: "the curse was a lie told by those who benefited from ignorance." Closure: she leaves after transferring knowledge, consistent with her role. Two beats (initial framing, settler confrontation). Friction moderate: the settlers' fear opposes her but is not dramatized as a live obstacle until late. Cost present but conceptual (she leaves her sanctuary). One slip: "offended her need" tells the emotion rather than showing a prior moment where myth frustrated her.</comment>
