<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interior is controlled and her motivation (community survival through anonymous aid) remains consistent. The child's late arrival and Maya's decision to ring the bell show agency under pressure, but the transition from solitary anonymity to public declaration feels swift—the internal conflict between secrecy and visibility is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Embodied emotion is present (breath misting, fingertips on cold metal) but the climactic shift lacks visible struggle; Maya "understood then" signals an epiphany rather than showing competing desires acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern of midnight runs accumulates through vivid particulars (insulin in ceramic pot, lentils for mothers) and the bell's charged return at closure reweights the community's understanding with conceptual cost—they discover their interdependence was always present. Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing: "We are the donors and the distributed" reconfigures the premise with social cost (loss of anonymity, gain of collective identity). The tightening is meaningful but the escalation relies on summary more than on-page pressure; the sixty-first night and the gathering are recounted rather than dramatically compressed, softening the closure's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor anchors early and returns at closure, the ridge's scrub pines and needle-strewn path guide Maya's movements, and the ceramic pot placement ("where the terra-cotta met the crumbling mortar") constrains her tactic. Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent and deliveries. The arbor's tactile detail (cool bell surface, clay beams) and the amplified quiet of the ridge modulate with pressure, charging the final bell-strike image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—is signaled early and tightens through Maya's midnight runs. The child's challenge ("I want to help") forces Maya to weigh anonymity against visibility, a meaningful turn that narrows options and leads to the public declaration. However, the escalation from solitary runs to collective gathering is recounted rather than dramatized; the gathering itself happens off-page in summary ("faces turned upward"), which softens the on-page cost and pressure at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the antique bell as silent tradition, the redistributed parcels as community self-sufficiency, and the arbor as both compass and gathering site. Maya's final speech—"We are the donors and the distributed"—articulates the premise without moralizing, reframing prior action through a fresh lens. The resolution resists tidy binaries; the sanctions remain, yet the community "recognized itself as home" through enacted interdependence, not rescue. The bell's "voice, stored in its metal like potential energy" is a purposeful image that charges the ending without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maya; psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (starlight navigation, hearing Tiber's breathing). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("gently persistent rhythm," "amplified quiet"). Dialogue at closure is goal-driven and carries subtext: Maya's declaration reframes rather than sermonizes. Minor slip: "her breath misting in the moonlit air" and "her boots soft on the needle-strewn path" are clean, but some phrases ("the weight of the moment settle between them") lean toward stock introspection without fresh perceptual signature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the descent and delivery beats. Sentence openings are varied and propulsion is consistent. However, several lines loop or scaffold: "The midnight food runs had become ritual" is immediately paraphrased by "these midnight runs" and "the midnight runs" across adjacent paragraphs, creating synonym churn. "Amplified quiet" appears three times without pattern-teaching. The closure paragraph compresses well, but earlier beats carry minor redundancy (−0.4 for paraphrase loops, −0.2 for repeated anchor "midnight runs").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—anonymous aid during sanctions—transforms a familiar mutual-aid narrative through the specific detail of the bell as compass and the twist that recipients were also donors. The bell-strike and public reframing offer a fresh inflection earned by prior particulars. However, the sanctions-blockade-community-resilience frame is a widely used template, and while Maya's midnight runs and the bell's symbolic role add specificity, the emotional arc (solitary giver → public collective) follows a predictable trajectory without bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's choices drive all major beats: conducting midnight runs (early), leaving insulin for Tiber (middle), deciding to ring the bell and declare the collective model (closure). Her agency is causal and visible across the arc, with the final declaration redefining the community's self-understanding.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bell is handled early (Maya touches it under the arbor), serves as navigational anchor across the midnight runs ("compass point"), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure when she strikes it to call the gathering. Its voice as "potential energy" charges the final image, and its mechanical use (the strike) precipitates the climactic assembly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Anonymous donations shape the dominant stake and tactics: Maya hides her identity to "ensure gratitude flowed toward the collective," and the revelation that "each family had unknowingly contributed to the anonymous pool" reframes the entire operation at closure. The concept drives both the middle deliveries and the ending's conceptual repricing, though its mechanics are partly told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is named early ("gently persistent rhythm") and embodied in Maya's steady pace through danger and her voice quality at closure ("her voice carrying the same gently persistent quality"). However, the trait is more atmospheric descriptor than visible constraint; no on-page action shows her persistence costing her a safer alternative or forcing a specific trade-off under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Declare" appears at closure when Maya calls the community together and states "We are not recipients of charity" and explains the redistributed model. This speech redefines the community's self-concept and precipitates their ascent to the arbor, making the action indispensable to the ending's Conceptual Repricing. Removing it would collapse the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are signaled early, their mechanics detailed across multiple beats (navigating by starlight, leaving parcels in doorways, the ceramic pot for insulin), and their cumulative effect shapes the closure revelation. The method is irreplaceable: the secrecy and routine are what enable the anonymous redistribution model that Maya later reveals.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arbor is introduced in the opening line, serves as Maya's nightly return point ("compass point"), and becomes the gathering site at closure where the community "take[s] its place beneath the terra-cotta arches." Its elevation on the ridge and the bell it houses constrain Maya's ritual and supply the physical locus for the final assembly, charging the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sanctions are named early ("three harsh months," "economic siege") and establish scarcity that motivates the midnight runs. The sixty-first night marks escalation, and "the sanctions remained" at closure underscores ongoing pressure. However, the timeframe is more backdrop than active clock; no scene shows the sanctions tightening tactics or forcing a time-sensitive choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Building intergenerational support is dramatized through Maya's delivery to Old Man Tiber (whose granddaughter will check the pot) and the child's request to help, culminating in "a chain of ascent that linked generations in the morning light." The motivation shapes key choices and the closure image. However, the intergenerational aspect is more thematic outcome than conflicted driver; Maya's internal friction is between anonymity and visibility, not between age cohorts.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is named three times and modulates with pressure: the ridge's silence makes "every snapped twig sound like gunfire," the quiet after the bell-strike is "not empty but full," and the tone charges Maya's final call without shouting. The tone is coherent across the arc and integral to the bell's resonance at closure, though repetition of the exact phrase creates minor artificiality.</comment>
