<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elian's interiority is consistently rendered through embodied gestures—winding the thread, summoning the Duchess—but his motivation remains largely contemplative rather than choice-driven. The "projecting presence" method shows internal contradiction (grief versus artistic craft), yet the protagonist never confronts a fork that would test competing values with visible cost. The final decision to travel inland feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle. Emotional progression is coherent but lacks the friction of a character resisting his own insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: density builds through repeated motifs (thread, projected presence, cartography metaphor) and culminates in a stance crystallization—Elian ties the thread as a bracelet and commits to the inland journey. Closure reads as Charged Poise: the final image (thread pulsing on his wrist, garden holding its breath) reconfigures his relationship to absence with felt cost (he must leave the palace, carry the elegies like seeds). One meaningful deepening is present, and the lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is established early with vivid, purpose-driven detail (bleeding ochres, skeletal arbor, pomegranate leaves) filtered through Elian's elegiac lens. The purple thread functions as micro-setting, constraining his ritual and charging the closure when it becomes a bracelet. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, arbor, boxwood hedges), and the salt-rot harbor smell reweights the garden's isolation. The setting shapes the elegiac tone and the final departure, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing through writing—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates via the thread ritual, the projected presence flickering, and the ink drying, but no on-page reversal forces Elian to choose between competing goods or alter tactics mid-scene. The inland journey and the thread-bracelet represent a tightening of commitment, yet the cost (leaving the palace) feels more symbolic than visceral. One meaningful deepening is present under the Accumulative lens, but protagonist agency at the turn is contemplative rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—mourning as cartography, absence as presence—emerges organically from the thread ritual, projected presence, and the final image of the garden "holding its breath." The piece resists tidy moralizing; Elian's insight ("lonesome splendor of survival") arises from lived ritual rather than assertion. The ending image (thread pulsing on his wrist, empty harbor echoing sails) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates cleanly in the Duchess's flickering projection and the "negative space of doorframes."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, with a literary register that fits the elegiac subject and Elian's role as obituary-writer. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices sensory detail through metaphor (iron-gray horizon, bleeding ochres) and ritual (thread around finger, blood-return rush). Diction remains controlled, though some constructions edge toward overwriting ("lonesome splendor," "explained absences"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("seemed to thicken," "as if hearing") are voice-motivated and support the conjuring method. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the projection sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is dense and rhythmically varied, with strong figurative language (thread as compass needle, geography of healing). However, several sentences approach overwriting: "the lonesome splendor of survival—the way a single thread could suggest an entire tapestry, the way an empty harbor could still hold the echo of sails" stacks metaphors without adding new pressure. The phrase "vividly descriptive" appears twice, creating a minor paraphrase loop tied to the required attribute. Sentence openings vary, and no severe scaffolding or loops appear, but figurative density in the final third dulls immediacy slightly. Information density is high, and momentum is maintained through most beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—obituaries for the living, healing as cartography—offers a fresh angle on loss and ritual. The thread ritual and projected-presence method are specific to Elian's craft, avoiding stock mourning tropes. However, the emotional arc (solitary mourner achieving acceptance through reflection) follows a familiar template, and the resolution (tying the thread, journeying inland) feels anticipated rather than surprising. The piece synthesizes existing ideas (absence as presence, ritual as coping) through vivid particulars, but the final turn does not offer a non-obvious reweighting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's role as obituary-writer frames the premise and his method (projecting presence, writing elegies). He appears in every beat and his writing ritual drives the middle sequence. However, his choices are largely contemplative—he observes, writes, and reflects rather than making a decision that narrows options with cost. The inland journey is announced but not enacted on the page. The character is essential to tone and lens but does not create a key turn through agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The thread is introduced early (plucked from beneath the dressing table), used in the central ritual (wound around his finger, blood-return rush), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (tied as a bracelet, pulsing against his wrist). It appears in at least three distinct beats and constrains his ritual method. The thread's transformation from evidence to tether charges the final image and shapes his commitment to carry the elegies inland. Removing it would collapse the tactile anchor of the healing geography.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Explained absences" is introduced as Elian's method and frames the writing ritual: "documenting precisely how she occupied space even in departure—the negative space of doorframes she no longer passed through." The concept shapes his tactics (projecting presence, describing twilight on her face) and resurfaces in the final image ("explained absences not just loss but the lonesome splendor of survival"). It is present across beats and contributes to closure, though it functions more as thematic frame than a constraint that alters options with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" appears twice as a label (the crimson blood-return rush, the proof of connection enduring) but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. The attribute colors Elian's prose style and links to his role as elegist, yet it remains decorative rather than causal. The label-only mentions and minor paraphrase loop lower the score. Swappable with "precise" or "poetic" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Intimate" appears in the phrase "intimate cartography" and frames Elian's method of tracing "coastlines of regret" and "inland waterways of forgiveness." The term recurs in "the most intimate of absences" at closure, charging the final image. However, the action itself (writing, projecting presence) is not uniquely intimate in a way that constrains tactics; the word functions more as tonal accent than causal force. Present in setup and closure with lyric reprise, but swappable with "personal" or "private."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—projecting presence—is introduced early ("To write properly... he had to project presence into the empty garden"), shapes the middle beat (conjuring the Duchess, her figure flickering, her turning head), and its dissolution marks the transition to closure ("the projected presence dissolved like mist"). The mechanics matter: without the projection, Elian cannot complete the elegy or understand the geography. The method is signaled, enacted, and its failure/completion drives the final stance. Removing it would break the ritual logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is established in the opening line and anchors every beat: the marble bench, skeletal arbor, boxwood hedges, pomegranate leaves. The garden's emptiness and isolation pressure Elian's ritual and amplify the "explained absences." The setting supplies the spatial frame for the projection and the final image ("the garden remained behind him, shadowed and vast, holding its breath"). It constrains the timeframe (after the last ship sails) and charges the ending with its stillness and coming winter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after the last ship sails"—is established in the opening line ("three hours ago") and frames the closure window: Elian must complete the elegy before nightfall, then prepare to leave the next morning. The timeframe tightens the ritual (he writes "faster, his hand trembling" as twilight falls) and the stars emerging signal the end of available time. The clock is tracked (three hours, twilight, stars) and shapes the urgency of the projection dissolving. Present in setup, middle, and closure, with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elian's desire—"to understand the geography of healing"—is stated early and dramatized through the thread ritual, the elegies, and the projected presence. The motivation is conflicted: he seeks healing yet clings to the ritual of mourning, and the cost (carrying the elegies inland, leaving the palace) is visible at closure. The friction between understanding and letting go is present but not sharply tested; Elian's choices align rather than contradict his stated want. The motivation shapes two beats and contributes to closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone—"lonesome splendor"—is coherent and modulated throughout: the isolated garden, the elegiac diction, the beauty of autumn decay. The phrase appears explicitly at closure ("the lonesome splendor of survival"), charging the final image with both melancholy and resilience. Tone intensifies during the projection sequence (shimmer, flicker, dissolution) and holds through the quiet ending (stars, empty harbor, thread pulsing). The tone is essential to the piece's emotional texture and supports the closure effect without static flatness.</comment>
