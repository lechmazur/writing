<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve temporal textures through gold-leaf work is established and sustained, with embodied interiority in moments like "fingertips that knew only the weight of vanished things." Internal contradiction appears when he invents histories to "preserve the capacity for what might yet be," but the final choice feels inevitable rather than earned through on-page pressure that forces a trade-off. The character remains consistent but lacks a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene to create visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images of gold, invented histories, and the hum-chart ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when "the refraction showed not just one time but all times simultaneously." Orientation anchors (mountaintop workshop, post-silence valley, fluorescent lamp) arrive early. The closure effect—capturing all times in gold—lands on the page with conceptual cost (he had to fabricate specifics to preserve gathering's texture), though the felt weight could be sharper. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lamp stutters and he works faster, tightening the pressure before the final adhesion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and gold leaf constrain Elias's ritual: the labyrinth's "corridors that led nowhere and everywhere" keeps him circling back, the lamp's 5:47 hum dictates his timing, and the gold's adherence properties shape his restraint. Micro-setting (the bench, the lamp, the battered notepad) functions as the operative environment. The final image charges these elements—dawn light through miniature pines strikes gilded pages, throwing prisms—making the setting indispensable to closure. Spatial choreography (workshop enclosed by bonsai, valley below in dusk) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the capacity for human gathering through invented histories—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lamp's hum dips ("the past was leaking out faster than he could gild it back"), forcing Elias to work faster while maintaining restraint. The final act shows visible cost: he must invent market days and lovers to anchor what never was, a renunciation of literal truth to preserve relational texture. Agency reads as endurance and fabrication rather than decision, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits the visceral charge of stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—preservation through invention, truth bent into survivable shapes—emerges from the gold-leaf ritual and invented histories without overt statement. The final image offers a resonant answer: capturing "the texture of when people had been together, even if he had to invent the specifics" reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost (he fabricates to preserve possibility). Recurring motifs (gold's refraction, the lamp's hum, the bonsai labyrinth) accumulate and charge the closure. The line "The gold did not lie, but it could bend" anchors the thematic question in concrete action, avoiding abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature evident in passages like "fingertips that knew only the weight of vanished things" and "emotional barometric pressures." Diction is elevated and consistent, matching the contemplative register. Some lines approach overwriting—"incandescent restraint," "blooming labyrinth," "frozen lightning"—but remain voice-motivated and legible. The final paragraph's rhythm accelerates slightly ("worked faster now, though still with that incandescent restraint") to reflect urgency without breaking the established cadence. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"roots gripping stone like frozen lightning," "prisms against the walls, each spectrum containing a ghost"—which risks overwriting but remains mostly coherent. Template cadence appears in the middle section with repeated "He [verb]" constructions and parallel "the [noun] of [year/day/laughter]" phrases. Information density is strong; most lines serve multiple functions (world, character, theme). The final beat's propulsion is clean, but earlier passages loop conceptually (invented histories restated across several paragraphs) without adding pressure, triggering modest line-level penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—gilding pages to capture temporal textures after societal silence—offers a non-obvious synthesis of craft, memory, and post-catastrophe endurance. Specific detail (twenty-three karat gold, 5:47 lamp hum, bonsai trained into topological puzzles) grounds the fantastical frame. The transformation test holds: plot and arc would collapse if stripped of the gold-leaf stationer's particular method. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and invented-histories conceit elevates originality, though the "lone artisan preserving humanity" template is familiar and not fully transformed beyond the gilding mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias (the gilded-leaf stationer) drives all on-page choices: charting the lamp's hum, pressing gold into pages, inventing market days and lovers, accelerating when the hum dips. Setup occurs in the opening line; development spans the charting and gilding ritual; payoff is the final adhesion that captures "all times simultaneously." His agency shapes every beat and the closure effect. Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability is high. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and visible cost (fabricating specifics to preserve texture) all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The battered notepad appears in multiple beats: recording lamp vibrations as jagged lines, holding invented histories (market day, lovers, weather patterns), touched at the spiral binding, closed at the end with gold edges catching dawn. Setup is early; middle use constrains his ritual (the chart guides where to apply extra leaf); closure participation is present but not causally decisive—it's closed and admired rather than transformed. Swappability is moderate; the "battered" quality and spiral binding add texture but any recording surface would serve similar function. Two-gate participation plus lyric reprise, but closure linkage is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Invented histories shape stakes and tactics on every page: Elias fabricates market days, lovers, and weather patterns to preserve "the capacity for what might yet be." The concept drives the middle ritual (writing composites in the notepad) and charges the closure ("he had captured the texture of when people had been together, even if he had to invent the specifics"). Setup, development, and payoff all present. Causal pressure is high; removing this exact concept would collapse the story's logic. Cost is visible: he must falsify to preserve truth's shape. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Earnestly studious" appears as a trait label ("He was earnestly studious in his vigil") and modulates the final beat ("an earnestness that bordered on devotion"). It constrains his method—he never rushes adhesion, charts the lamp meticulously—but the attribute itself is summarized rather than dramatized through specific contradictory choices. Setup is early; middle development shows the trait affecting ritual execution; closure participation is present in tone but not as a decisive factor. One-gate involvement (early + closure mention) with modest causal work trends mid-band. Swappability is moderate; "meticulous" or "devoted" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Refract" dominates the story's logic: gold refracts truth into survivable shapes, jagged lines refract into stories, the final sheet shows all times refracted simultaneously. The verb appears in early setup ("Each page he gilded became a lens through which invented histories could pass, bending light into narratives"), middle development (prisms thrown against walls), and closure ("the refraction showed not just one time but all times"). Removing "refract" and its optical logic would break the core mechanics. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all maximal. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and conceptual cost tied to bending truth.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Charting the lamp's hum is introduced early ("charting the faint hum in a fluorescent lamp at dawn to map the pressure of minutes"), shapes middle tactics (the chart shows where the present grows thin, guiding extra leaf application), and participates in closure (the lamp stutters, forcing acceleration). The method is specific and irreplaceable—the hum's register at 5:47 dictates his timing. Setup, development, and payoff present. Causal pressure is solid; the mechanics matter to the ritual. Cost connection is visible (the dipping hum signals leakage). Early signal and multi-beat involvement satisfy high-band criteria.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth is introduced in the opening sentence, provides spatial enclosure ("branches trained into corridors that led nowhere and everywhere"), and appears in closure ("The bonsai labyrinth seemed to lean closer... waiting to see if this history would hold"). It constrains Elias by keeping him circling back to the same bench, a topological puzzle that reinforces his isolation. Setup and closure participation are strong; middle constraint is present but subtle. The labyrinth charges the final image moderately. Swappability is low—the miniature-forest-as-maze concept is specific—but causal pressure on peak choices is indirect. Early signal, closure linkage, and modest development satisfy two gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" establishes the post-catastrophe timeframe early and recurs implicitly (valley in permanent dusk, no accumulation of minutes). It shapes stakes—Elias works to preserve what silence erased—but does not tighten decisions with a live clock. The lamp's 5:47 hum provides micro-timing, but the broader "after silence" frame remains static backdrop. Setup is clear; development and payoff are thematic rather than tactical. The timeframe enables the premise but does not escalate pressure or alter tactics on the page. Two-gate participation (early + thematic) with modest causal work trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to collect textures of different times drives every on-page action: pressing gold to hold "the grain of 1987, the humidity of last Tuesday, the precise temperature of his daughter's laughter." It's introduced early, sustained through the charting and gilding ritual, and pays off in closure when he captures "the texture of when people had been together." Friction appears in the cost: he must invent specifics (market days, lovers) to preserve the general capacity. Setup, development, and payoff all present. Causal pressure is high; the motivation is irreplaceable and shapes the final image with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Incandescent restraint" is introduced as his working method ("His hands moved with incandescent restraint, never pressing too hard") and recurs at the climax ("worked faster now, though still with that incandescent restraint"). The tone—controlled urgency, luminous discipline—is coherent across beats and modulates slightly when the lamp stutters, tightening without breaking. It charges the final image: the gold edges catch dawn with restrained brilliance. Setup and closure participation are strong; the tone shapes his execution under pressure. Specificity (incandescent = light-driven intensity) and irreplaceability elevate the score. Early signal, development under stress, and closure linkage all satisfied.</comment>
