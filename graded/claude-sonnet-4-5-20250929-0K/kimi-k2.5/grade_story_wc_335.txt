<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is textured and particular—"walked backwards when nervous" is embodied in scene and constrains her movement under pressure. The shadow's arc from trembling to "reaching not for escape but for readiness" is earned through three weeks of tea-leaf annotation. Minor slip: "combative tenderness of a mother bird" leans toward label-speak at a peak beat, though the immediate dramatization ("Fear is the first lesson") recovers quickly. The final choice to walk forward beside the child closes Elara's own arc with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with purposeful compression. Closure lands through Earned Stasis (Elara walking forward, no longer retreating) paired with the child's Decisive Change (stepping onto the floor), and the cost is legible: "never look back unless you need to remember how far you've come." The three-week ellipsis is motivated and tightens pressure. One cost-proof test: "two archives of resilience stepping into the world that had once exiled them both" makes the conceptual price undeniable without overstating it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library, brass table, samovar, and playground swing anchor space and recur with purpose. The swing's stillness at closure charges the final image and crystallizes the child's readiness. Micro-setting (shard on the table, hammer in hand) constrains the mentor's choices across multiple beats. Minor limit: the library's interior detail remains functional but does not deepen beyond initial anchors; no occupational depth is required at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether the shadow is ready for reversible exile's return—is signaled early and tightens through tea-leaf readings that chart growth. The hammer-lift beat crystallizes the test; Elara's refusal ("Not today... But soon") narrows options and forces waiting with visible cost. The three-week ellipsis deepens rather than repeats, and the final shattering is protagonist-driven with the shadow's hands-upward gesture as the enabling choice. Cost is unmistakable: "Walk forward... And never look back unless you need to remember how far you've come."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—resilience through confrontation, exile as sanctuary versus growth—emerges from the shard's geometry, the tea-leaves' "resilient spiral," and Elara's combative tenderness without thesis statement. The swing's recurrence reweights from abandonment marker to readiness signal. The final image ("two archives of resilience stepping into the world that had once exiled them both") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question with conceptual cost legible on the page. No moralizing; the lived particulars (backwards walking, tea geometry, hammer precision) anchor the universal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent perceptual signature: dust, brass, cold glass, geometry of tea leaves. Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext ("You don't want to face me? Good. Fear is the first lesson."). Minor rhythm issue: "walked backwards when nervous, and she did so now" feels scaffolded rather than immediate. Psychic distance narrows cleanly at peak beats. The phrase "combative tenderness of a mother bird pushing her young from the nest" leans toward explanatory register but recovers through subsequent dramatization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are strong; information density is high (shard-mirror archivist, reversible exile, tea-leaf geometry all introduced efficiently). Minor template cadence in the three-week summary: "She taught through opposition... then soothing... When the day came" reads slightly scaffolded. No paraphrase loops; figurative language (afternoon shadow, angles of abandonment, steep cliffs of loneliness) works without muddle. The final lines propel cleanly without overwriting. Sentence variety supports rhythm across the arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—shard-mirror archivist annotating trauma via tea-leaf geometry to determine readiness for reversible exile—is specific and non-obvious. The backwards-walking trait, combative mentorship, and the three-week annotation sequence feel particular to this voice and world. The ending transformation (both walk forward together) arises inevitably from prior particulars. Risk-taking (annotating via tea geometry, refusing the hammer-strike until readiness) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The synthesis of exile-as-sanctuary, geometry-as-diagnosis, and mentor-as-wounded-healer reads fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive all key turns: refusing to shatter the shard early, teaching through opposition, annotating growth via tea leaves, and finally walking forward beside the child. Present in setup, middle (three-week arc), and closure. Causal pressure is high; the story would collapse without her decisions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The shard appears in setup, is handled across multiple beats (Elara presses her palm, lifts the hammer, annotates via tea leaves), and its shattering is the climactic act. The shadow's progression within the glass is tracked and reweighted. Closure hinges on the precise moment "the hammer fell... shattering the reversible exile into glittering dust." Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Reversible exile frames the dominant stake (can the shadow survive transition?) and shapes tactics throughout: Elara's refusal to force the child out, the three-week annotation to determine readiness, and the final shattering. The concept is signaled early, drives pressure in the middle, and the closure act (stepping onto the library floor) literalizes it. Cost is visible: the child must face the swing herself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Walking backwards when nervous appears in setup and recurs in the middle ("she did so now... creating a strange dance of advance and retreat"). It embodies Elara's anxiety and constrains her movement under pressure. The final beat inverts it: "for the first time in years, walked forward beside her, no longer retreating." The cost—overcoming her own fear—is legible. Strong lyric reprise, though mid-scene use is briefer than ideal for top band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Annotation via tea-leaf geometry occurs in setup (ritual preparation), middle (charting "angles of abandonment... resilient spiral"), and across the three-week arc. It determines the shadow's readiness and gates the hammer-fall. The action is irreplaceable to the archivist's method. Slightly swappable with another diagnostic method, but the specificity (geometry of dried vegetation) and its recurrence across beats earn solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is signaled in the ritual beat, used in the middle to read "trauma patterns... angles of abandonment... resilient spiral," and referenced in the three-week summary. The method shapes Elara's assessment and gates the final shattering. Its mechanics (geometry as diagnosis) are taught and matter to the outcome. Not quite indispensable—another divination could substitute—but the specificity and consistent use earn solid credit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The forgotten library anchors all action; the brass table, samovar, and dust are tactile. The playground swing outside recurs and its final stillness charges closure. The setting supplies resources (shard on table, hammer) and constrains space (Elara circles the table, retreats). Solid integration across setup, middle, and ending. Not quite essential—the mentorship could occur elsewhere—but the library-as-archive metaphor and the swing's recurrence earn strong credit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts" anchors the opening mood and recurs at closure ("the playground swing finally stilled in the twilight"). The three-week ellipsis marks progression. Time does not tighten tactics beat-by-beat, but the swing's motion-to-stillness arc reweights readiness. Lyric reprise lifts the score despite minimal clock pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Elara's desire to mentor resilience is dramatized through her refusal to force the child out, her "combative tenderness," and the three-week annotation. The motivation is conflicted: "her fingers trembled against her apron" yet she lifts the hammer; she teaches through opposition yet soothes with "fierce affirmations." The final act—walking forward beside the child—literalizes the mentorship and closes Elara's own arc. Cost is visible: confronting her own fear of connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is established early ("the combative tenderness of a mother bird pushing her young from the nest. 'You don't want to face me? Good. Fear is the first lesson.'") and modulates through the arc: harsh questions paired with fierce affirmations, the hammer-lift as threat and test, the final "battle and benediction" touch. The tone charges the closure image ("'Walk forward,' she commanded") and coheres under pressure. Distinct and integral to voice.</comment>
