<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is characterized primarily through atmospheric description and stated interior rather than micro-choices under pressure. The goal to "teach dust to tell stories" is declared luminously but never tested by a dramatized obstacle that forces him to choose between competing goods. His "secretly luminous" quality and diligent copyist role remain label-level attributes; we never see him weighing a cost or making a decision that forecloses a path. The final paragraph asserts transformation ("ended the silence") without showing Elias enduring or renouncing anything on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elias is and what he seeks emerge slowly through lyric accumulation rather than early anchoring (−0.3). The piece lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost; the final paragraphs summarize distant outcomes ("years later") rather than dramatizing a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing in the present window. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake with visible cost at the ending beat. The summary-epilogue structure ("scholars studied," "children who touched") tells rather than enacts the closure moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist, shortwave radio, and dust are rendered with vivid, specific sensory detail and constrain Elias's nightly ritual. The alcove functions as micro-setting, anchoring his work and the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the environment charges the closure tableau even though the cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to reanimate narrative after the story famine—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice that narrows options. Elias's method succeeds without friction: dust swirls, musicians weep, the famine ends. No reversal, tightening, or visible price appears; the resolution is summarized as fait accompli ("scholars studied," "children touched") rather than earned through a protagonist decision with cost. Escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme of stories-as-survival emerges organically from the famine premise and dust-teaching conceit. The final image of dust-as-library and musicians playing "lyrics that had no words" offers resonance, but the ending's summary mode ("years later," "scholars noted") replaces scene pressure with meta-commentary, diluting the non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the radio broadcast fragments and the musicians' involuntary tears, lending thematic depth without overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyrically dense, with a distinct texture ("ink that smelled of rain and regret," "thistled calm"). POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Psychic distance is controlled, though the summary-epilogue mode in the final third shifts into distant omniscience ("scholars studied," "children found") without clear anchoring, weakening the perceptual signature under pressure. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated; no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and occasionally mixed: "spin silence into silver thread" and "dust… a library" work, but "thistled calm" and "heat shimmer above summer roads" feel ornamental rather than propulsive. The final two paragraphs loop thematic summary ("dust continued its storytelling," "narratives that bypassed language") without advancing causality or image (−0.6). Sentence openings vary and rhythm is controlled, but information density drops in the epilogue section. No fatal clarity breaks, but momentum sags under decorative phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dust-as-narrative-vessel conceit and pirate-broadcast-as-manual offer a fresh synthesis of the post-apocalyptic story-famine trope. The specific detail (copyist's annotations, shortwave Tuesday broadcasts, ember alcove ritual) personalizes the frame. However, the arc—lone artist restores lost art via patient craft—follows a familiar template, and the ending's summary mode retreats from risk into tidy restoration. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his copyist role anchors the work, but his choices do not create key turns. He transcribes, hums, sings, and prepares ink; none of these actions are dramatized as decisions under pressure with visible cost. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, but the involvement is observational and process-driven rather than causal. Mid-band functional integration without stakes-altering agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow appears in two beats (midnight broadcast interception, final phosphorescent pooling) and is mentioned in the scholars' symbol analysis. It enables the method and charges the alcove scene, but its use is atmospheric rather than causally decisive—it could be replaced by another light source with minor edits. Setup and payoff are clear; development involvement is weaker.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast shapes Elias's method and is signaled early; it recurs in the Tuesday-night ritual and goes silent at closure, marking a transition. It constrains his tactics (annotation between staves, embedding lyrics) and the ending acknowledges its mission as "complete." Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, and it drives at least two beats. Causal pressure is moderate; removing it would require a different narrative engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is stated twice but never constrains or enables an on-page action. It functions as metaphor for Elias's mental capacity, not a visible trait with dramatized cost. No development beat or closure participation; ornamental label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears as embedding lyrics within transcriptions and adjusting the dial glow "to its lowest setting." The embedding drives mid-story causality (musicians weeping), but the dial adjustment is incidental. Setup and development are present; closure linkage is weak. The action shapes one key turn but could be replaced by another concealment method without fundamental loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The elusive song lyrics are the core method: intercepted via broadcast, annotated into scores, embedded in tempo markings, sung aloud to animate dust. They appear in at least three beats and drive the transformation of music into narrative vessel. Setup, development, and payoff are all clear, and the method is irreplaceable—removing it would break the story's logic. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ember alcove anchors every scene, houses the shortwave radio and dust experiments, and frames the final image. It supplies resources (coals, mist) that charge the atmosphere and constrain Elias's nightly ritual. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong. The mist "grew thick enough to touch" at the key moment, altering the dust experiment. Essential micro-setting with solid causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The post-famine timeframe is signaled early and motivates the entire premise; Elias works "seven generations" after the famine. However, it does not tighten on-page decisions—no ticking clock or temporal pressure narrows his tactics. Setup is clear, development is atmospheric rather than causal, and closure summarizes "years later" rather than crystallizing present urgency. Mid-band context that shapes stakes without pressing tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The desire to teach dust to tell stories is stated explicitly and drives Elias's nightly experiments. It appears in setup, the dust-swirl development beat, and the closure tableau ("dust continued its storytelling"). The goal is not dramatized as conflicted choice—no friction between this want and a competing cost—but it organizes the arc and charges the final image. Functional integration with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" appears in the final line and labels the overall atmosphere; mist, coals, and quiet workbench scenes support a contemplative, subdued tone throughout. The tone is coherent but static—it does not modulate with rising pressure or reweight meaning at closure. The final phrase "thistled calm of stories finally set free" charges the image, but the tone itself remains unchanged. Mid-band lyric reprise without pressure shift.</comment>
