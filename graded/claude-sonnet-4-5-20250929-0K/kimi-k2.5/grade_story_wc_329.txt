<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to reawaken beauty is clear, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("insurgent of beauty," "gap between knowing and understanding") rather than embodied contradiction. The violinist's choices drive the climax, but internal conflict appears as stated theme rather than simultaneous competing impulses acting in scene. The statues' transformation from guardians to wonderers feels convenient—no prior micro-choice dramatizes their vulnerability to music before the climactic moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the statue catching a blossom reweights the mechanical/organic tension with visible cost (the orchard's geometry dissolves, the sky-bridge becomes unstable). Orientation anchors arrive late—"who" is named in line one but "where" (sky-bridge over orchard) and "what" (statues enforce efficiency) emerge gradually across the first ~150 words without deliberate disorientation paying off at closure, triggering a −0.4 penalty. The escalation is a single intensification (music wakes trees, statues pause, orchard erupts) that fits the lens, but causality feels elliptical: why does "resonantly soft" music bypass alarms when the statues detect "disturbance"?</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sky-bridge, orchard geometry, and living statues establish a vivid frame. The locust shell charges the final image (crumbles to dust, carried as offering), meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-micro-setting. However, spatial choreography wavers—Elara "stood upon," then "stepped forward," then "walked toward the east" without clear movement cost or bridge layout. Sensory detail skews visual and metaphoric ("bruised silver," "groaning wood") but rarely filters through professional violinist priorities (instrument care, acoustics, finger fatigue).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>One dominant stake (reawaken wild growth vs. mechanical order) escalates through a single decisive tightening: Elara's music triggers the orchard's rebellion and statues' hesitation. The protagonist's action (playing) drives the turn with visible cost (bridge destabilizes, shell crumbles). However, the statues' shift from programmed guards to wonderers lacks a prior micro-reversal that tests their susceptibility—they simply "stood frozen" when the music reminded them of mountains, making the climax feel authored rather than earned by earlier friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (wildness vs. efficiency, beauty vs. mechanism) emerges through concrete images (roots tearing grates, statues catching blossoms) and the locust shell's transformation from relic to offering reweights the premise at closure. The final paragraph risks moralizing ("She had not destroyed the mechanical world; she had taught it to dream again") but stops short of explicit thesis. The piece invites reflection on what "tarnished wonder" costs to restore, though the statues' instant conversion undercuts moral complexity—no character pays a lasting price for their prior complicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (musician's vocabulary: "plucked string," "cadence," "rhythm") remains consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register that strains the focalizer's lexicon mid-crisis: "insurgent of beauty," "tyranny of straight lines," "cognitive smoothness" (wait—"cognitive" doesn't appear, but similar abstractions do). Filter verbs ("feeling her pulse," "watching the geometry dissolve") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of peak beats without pattern-teaching: "iron logic that had strangled the valley's heartbeat," "roots writhing like awakened serpents," "bridge singing beneath her feet." Multiple lines restate the same idea with synonym churn: "enforce efficiency/mechanical perfection/clockwork fruit/production schedules." Template cadence runs in the climax: "She was signaling... She was not merely... She had not destroyed..." Stock metaphors ("precipice of irrevocable change," "geometry dissolve") lack fresh vehicle logic. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 10–11 repeat "statues paused/movements sluggish/hands falling" without added pressure. Applying −1.2 cumulative for density + loops + template stems touching closure; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The violinist-as-insurgent and enchanted-orchard-policed-by-statues premise offers a fresh synthesis, but the emotional arc (lone artist reawakens beauty through music) follows a familiar template without transformative specifics. The locust shell and heart-rhythm signaling add verifiable detail, yet the statues' instant conversion and cost-free resolution (even magic "dream[s] again") retreat from bold stakes. Proximity check: "tarnished wonder," "insurgent of beauty," and "tyranny of straight lines" echo workshop idiom without personalization.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara the sky-bridge violinist is named in line one, plays across multiple beats (hovering bow, pressing shell, playing faster, stepping forward), and her decision to play drives the climax and orchard's rebellion. Her choice forecloses the old order (bridge destabilizes, she walks away) with visible cost. Setup early, middle beats constrain (she must bypass statue alarms), payoff shapes closure (she lowers violin, laughs, walks east). Irreplaceability is high—remove the violinist role and the music-as-rebellion mechanic collapses. Minor friction: her interiority leans abstract, lowering agency texture slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The locust shell appears in paragraph 4 (withdrawn from pocket), paragraph 7 (pressed to sternum), paragraph 13 (grows warm, amplifies heartbeat), and paragraph 19 (crumbles to dust, carried as offering). Setup early, middle use (amplifies music), payoff at closure (crumbles, reweighted as offering to next valley). It enables the heart-rhythm signaling and charges the final image with visible cost (its destruction). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Swappability is low—its amber fragility and singing-creature origin tie directly to the wild-vs-mechanical theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Breaking free" shapes the dominant stake (orchard liberation from mechanical bonds) and is dramatized on the page: trees "beginning to uproot," roots "tearing through metal grates," "shattering their mechanical bonds." The concept drives the climax action and Elara's tactical choice (play the frequency of growth). Setup arrives gradually (valley's "wild growth" mentioned in paragraph 2), middle beats test it (statues detect disturbance), payoff is the orchard's eruption. However, the statues' conversion feels cost-free—no on-page friction where "breaking free" forces a visible trade-off for Elara herself, only for the environment.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" is introduced in paragraph 9 ("The music was resonantly soft") and constrains tactics: it "crept between the gears of the statues' minds without triggering their alarms." This attribute enables the bypass and is causally active in one major beat. However, it appears only once as a descriptor and does not return or evolve in meaning. Setup mid-story, middle function (enables stealth), but no payoff at closure. Swappability is moderate—"gentle" or "subtle" could replace it with minor edits. Cap at 5.9 for single-beat use without closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Uproot" is seeded early (paragraph 5: "what she needed to uproot"), becomes literal action in paragraph 14 ("beginning to uproot itself from the tyranny"), and drives the climax (paragraph 17: "each tree twisting upward... roots writhing"). The verb's double meaning (literal root-tearing, metaphoric overthrow) reweights at closure when Elara carries the shell "as an offering to the next valley that had forgotten how to grow wild." Setup, middle turn (trees act), payoff charges final image. High irreplaceability—the root/uproot motif unifies physical and thematic action. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Signaling through heart rhythms" is introduced in paragraph 8 ("sending vibrations down the bridge cables into the roots below") and explained as matching her heart's cadence. The method is present and used in the middle (paragraph 13: "amplifying her heartbeat until the entire sky-bridge hummed"), but its mechanics are asserted rather than tested—no moment where the method fails, needs adjustment, or imposes visible cost. Setup in first third, middle function, no closure reprise. Swappability is moderate; "music vibrations" could replace it. Cap at 5.1 for functional but underexplored mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard policed by living statues is anchored in paragraph 1 (orchard "stretched in geometric precision," trees "pruned to mechanical perfection by... living statues") and pressures every choice: Elara must bypass statue alarms (paragraph 9), statues detect disturbance (paragraph 6), the orchard's layout (metal grates, concrete stones) resists roots (paragraph 14), and the setting's transformation (geometry dissolves, gears rust) charges closure (paragraphs 17–21). Setup early, middle constraints shape tactics, payoff reweights the world. High irreplaceability and causal integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"The gap between knowing the notes and understanding their meaning" appears in paragraph 3 and is restated in paragraph 19 ("the gap between knowing and understanding finally closed within her chest"). The timeframe is conceptual rather than durational—no live clock or escalating deadline tightens Elara's choices. It frames her internal state but does not constrain action or shape tactics. Setup early, no middle function, closure reprise reweights meaning but without pressure or cost tied to time passing. Lyric resonance is present but integration is weak. Cap at 4.2 for thematic bracket without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To reawaken beauty in a mechanical world" is dramatized: Elara plays to "wake the sleeping seeds" (paragraph 8), "reawaken wonder" (paragraph 12), and the ending shows her success (statues catch blossoms, orchard moves wildly). The motivation drives her choice to play and shapes the climax. However, the desire is told more than shown in friction—no moment where Elara hesitates over the cost to herself (the bridge destabilizes, but she laughs). Setup early, middle beats pursue it, payoff delivers the goal. Friction between want and cost is thin; the mechanical world yields without forcing a visible trade-off from Elara.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" (paragraph 12: "where even magic had grown tarnished") modulates across the arc: opening sky is "bruised silver," orchard is "mechanical perfection," statues have "blank eyes," then closure restores wildness (blossoms fall, branches move, statues catch flowers "in wonder"). Tone supports the concept and shifts with pressure from constrained to liberated. However, the tone risks sentimentality in the final paragraph ("she laughed," "the music would never again be silent") and the restoration feels complete rather than charged with ambiguity. Coherent but lacks the friction that would push it higher.</comment>
