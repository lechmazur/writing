<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is characterized through his locksmith's precision and peripherally-focused observation method, but his interiority remains abstract—his motivation "to store wonder in the cellar of reason" is philosophically stated rather than shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The nine days of patient mapping establish competence but not struggle; no genuine obstacle or internal conflict forces a difficult trade-off. The final winding of the mainspring arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading more as task completion than earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative lens: Elias observes, maps, and reassembles across repeated dawn sessions that build technical density toward the mechanism's restoration. Closure arrives when the timer ticks forward and echoes gather, a Resonant Reconfiguration that restores the cavern's voice. However, cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page—no visible sacrifice, renunciation, or foreclosed option accompanies the success. The "wounded season" frame and the phrase "saved for later" imply future consequence but do not land a present price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vividly rendered through quartz veins, crystalline hollows, and reflection angles that guide Elias's method; the diagonal quake-slash and fractured acoustics anchor the problem spatially. The timer mechanism's brass gears and escapement wheel are handled across multiple beats (observing at dawn, filing a new tooth, winding the mainspring), constraining his approach through its frozen position and damaged geometry. The setting contributes materially to tactics and charges the final image when the marble "exhales" trapped frequencies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the Echo Garden's resonance—is clear and sustained across the nine-day span. Pressure accumulates through repeated observation and the technical challenge of reverse-engineering temporal physics, but escalation is gentle: no failed attempt, no moment when the mechanism resists or threatens permanent loss. The final reassembly succeeds on first try without visible cost or trade-off, undercutting the earned-stakes test for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of storing wonder in reason's framework emerges through Elias's cataloging of "impossible acoustics" and his reverse-engineering of the timer's temporal logic. The metaphor recurs but leans abstract—"the cellar of reason," "the harvest of echoes," "the lock now turned"—without fresh inflection at closure. The final image of echoes drifting toward the restored device offers visual resonance, yet the ending restates rather than reweights the premise, stopping short of a non-literal answer that would land conceptual surprise or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is ornate and controlled, with a consistent lyric register ("the lull of the wounded season," "sound did not fade but pooled in crystalline hollows"). Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited; Elias's perceptual signature—peripheral vision, reflection-angle mapping—is distinct and purposeful. The prose maintains coherence under pressure, though the elevated diction ("temporal resonance," "magnetic rhythm of brass and marble") risks distancing the reader from embodied experience. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Density is high, with nearly every sentence layering technical detail, metaphor, and backstory (thirty years coaxing tumblers, nine days of dawn mapping). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops: "the timer did not measure hours but harvested them" is immediately restated as "collecting temporal resonance in its mainspring"; "to store wonder in the cellar of reason" appears three times with minor variation. Template cadence in the middle third ("He studied…," "He sought…," "He filed…") flattens momentum. Mixed metaphor: "time itself had bled out and left only this copper corpse" (blood/corpse) clashes with "the harvest of echoes" (agricultural) and "the lock now turned" (mechanical). Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—locksmith repairs a timer mechanism to restore a cavern's acoustics—is fresh in its synthesis of craft, temporal physics, and sound. The "peripherally focused" observational method and the reverse-engineering via reflection angles offer specific, non-obvious tactics. Yet the emotional and thematic arc follows a familiar lone-craftsman-saves-magic template without transformation: no moral calculus, no surprise cost, no turn that redefines the stakes. The metaphor "store wonder in the cellar of reason" is elegant but not earned through conflict or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his locksmith expertise informs his method (peripherally focused observation, filing the escapement tooth). However, his choices do not create key turns—he observes, catalogs, and reassembles without obstacle or decision point that narrows options. The reflective nature is told ("seeking to store wonder") rather than dramatized through on-page friction. Functional but largely passive within the Accumulative frame.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken timer mechanism appears in multiple beats: introduced frozen at seventeen minutes, observed at dawn for hairline cracks, diagnosed as harvesting temporal resonance, filed with a new escapement tooth, and wound to restore the echo cycle. Its frozen state and gear ratios constrain Elias's reverse-engineering method and the final tick shapes closure. Specific properties (brass gears, bronze escapement wheel, stuck position) matter causally and charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" is named and described (echoes pool in hollows, drift toward the device, are regulated by the timer) but does not shape on-page tactics or force a choice. It functions as thematic backdrop and closure image rather than a stake with visible cost or trade-off. Present and logically consistent, but swappable with "restoration of song" or similar without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is signaled early ("working peripherally, never staring directly") and demonstrated through Elias's method of watching reflection angles from the corner of his vision. It constrains his observational technique across multiple beats (dawn mapping, glimpsing echoes "at the edge of sight") and is explicitly credited at closure ("the peripherally focused eye sees truth…by allowing the edge of knowing to catch the light"). However, no visible cost or trade-off accompanies this trait—it enables without limiting. One-way constraint trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering is introduced early, demonstrated through mapping reflection angles and calculating backward from the stuck position, and drives the reassembly logic. The action shapes two key beats (studying the mechanism's failure chain, placing gears "as the reverse-engineered logic dictated") and underpins closure when the device ticks forward. Essential to the plot's causal spine, though the execution succeeds without friction or failed attempt.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles at different times is introduced in the second paragraph ("each morning for nine days, he mapped the reflection angles as dawn struck the eastern fissure"), specified with the thirty-two-degree beam illuminating cracks, and returned in the middle section ("the shallow amber of morning, the perpendicular white of noon, the violet obliqueness of evening"). The method shapes his diagnostic approach and informs the final escapement-tooth filing ("matching the angle of reflection he had observed at dawn"). Present across setup, development, and payoff; causally relevant but not indispensable—could be replaced with generic "careful observation" without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern is established early with quartz veins, crystalline hollows, and the Echo Garden's fractured acoustics. Its wounded geometry (diagonal slash, displaced stone) constrains the timer's function and Elias's task. The cavern's properties—reflection angles, acoustic resonance, geological stress—drive multiple beats and the final image when it "exhales" trapped frequencies. The setting is integral to both problem and solution, shaping tactics and charging closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"The lull of the wounded season" frames the opening and closing, signaling autumn-to-healing passage and the nine-day span of observation. Time is tracked ("nine days," "each morning," "as the wounded season began its slow turn toward healing") but does not tighten decisions—no deadline, no race against decay, no moment when delay costs Elias an option. The timeframe is functional for accumulation but replaceable with "over several weeks" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is stated twice and appears as Elias's guiding desire. It is philosophically consistent with his cataloging and preservation work, but never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. The motivation remains abstract theme rather than on-page friction between competing wants. Told-only, not enacted.</comment>
