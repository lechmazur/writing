<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness is embodied through tactile perception ("constellations of texture," "architecture of bone beneath skin") that shapes how she paints. Her motivation burns urgently through the condemned timeline, driving concrete micro-choices: withdrawing the coin, climbing to the dome, applying fractally precise strokes. The final choice to walk away without watching carries visible cost—she carries the sky within but loses the physical space—though the renunciation feels slightly muted by the prophetic certainty she's already achieved her goal. Internal contradiction could be sharper; her hyper-competence in translating her condition into art leaves little room for genuine struggle or miscalculation under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Elara in the Great Oak Library, night before demolition). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered detail (coin indentations, pigment formulas, fractal strokes) and the closure crystallizes as Charged Poise—she walks away as the engines roar, the sky now "fractally precise, eternal in the limits of her art." Cost is felt in the loss of the physical library and the finality of her departure, though the prophetic framing ("the exact shades she had anticipated") slightly softens the stakes by guaranteeing success before the wrecking ball strikes. One meaningful deepening occurs as she discovers "how much detail her damaged visual cortex could process before the patterns dissolved into meaningless noise."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is vividly realized ("tiers of bookshelves spiraling upward like ribosomes inside a cell") and constrains multiple choices: the hidden book safe in the restricted shelf, the spiral staircase she must climb, the eastern window admitting first light. The demolition crew's presence is felt as "a vibration in the wood rather than seen," filtering setting through Elara's tactile POV. The dome ceiling becomes the canvas that charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through professional priorities (fractals, grain, texture) and the rotting tree trunk's condemned status drives the temporal pressure, making the setting indispensable to both conflict and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mirror the sunrise inside the walls before demolition—is signaled immediately and tightens through the ticking clock: "the hush before destruction," "waiting for the legal hour," "first gray light." Elara's agency is visible in withdrawing pigments, decoding the coin, climbing, and applying paint with "fractally precise strokes." The tightening occurs as she works "through the concept of limits" and reaches the edge of what her cortex can process. However, the prophetic success ("the exact shades she had anticipated") undercuts tension; the wrecking ball becomes backdrop rather than genuine threat since she completes the work and walks away satisfied. Cost is present—she loses the library, seals knowledge inside—but the triumph overshadows the sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the interplay of limits, preservation, and perception: Elara's visual disability becomes her artistic superpower, her work captures "souls rather than likenesses," and the story questions what endures when physical structures fall. The coin's tactile encoding and the fractal precision motif recur purposefully. The final image—"she carried the sky within her now, fractally precise, eternal in the limits of her art"—offers resonance but tips toward direct statement rather than letting particulars speak. The "limits" concept is invoked frequently enough to feel thematic rather than earned solely through specific struggle. The prophetic framing (painting tomorrow's sunrise) adds complexity but borders on abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters consistently through Elara's hyper-tactile perception: "seeing not wood but constellations of texture," "detectable only by her hyper-sensitive fingertips." Diction is controlled and voice-distinct ("the hush before destruction when even the wind holds its breath"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during high-pressure beats (climbing, painting under deadline). However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("prophetic mirror suspended in pigment," "fractally precise, eternal in the limits of her art") that feels more authorial than character-particular. The foreman's whistle and engines roar remain external, appropriately filtered through vibration and sound rather than direct sight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; most lines advance multiple dimensions. However, several minor loops and near-paraphrases appear: "she had built her reputation painting portraits that captured souls rather than likenesses" restates the prior claim about her condition; "not turning back to watch the tree fall, for she carried the sky within her now" slightly restates the prophetic completion already shown. Figurative language is dense ("ribosomes inside a cell," "prophetic mirror suspended in pigment," "fractally precise") and occasionally tips toward overwriting in non-peak beats. The final paragraph stacks elevated constructions without clear propulsion ("eternal in the limits of her art"). No major artifacts touch closure, but cumulative texture density in the middle third costs momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of face-blindness, tactile hyper-sensitivity, and fractal precision applied to portrait painting and sky replication is specific and non-obvious. The coin-encoded pigment formula is inventive. However, the "artist racing against demolition to preserve beauty" frame is familiar, and the piece does not fully transform it; Elara's prophetic success softens risk. The fractal motif recurs but borders on ornamental in places where it labels rather than constrains. Emotional specificity is present in her tactile relationship to the library, and the final image of carrying the sky within avoids overt moralizing, yet the prophetic certainty and the tidy completion (she finishes exactly as planned) pull toward a safety middle that sidesteps messier failure or genuine miscalculation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's face-blindness is signaled early and shapes her perceptual mode throughout: she traces grain, reads texture as constellations, decodes coin indentations by touch, and paints with fractal precision tuned to her condition. Her choices—withdrawing pigments, decoding the coin, climbing, applying strokes, walking away—create every major turn. The trait directly enables the closure: her hyper-sensitivity allows her to read the hidden formula and execute the mural with precision unavailable to others. Cost is visible in her final departure and the sealed knowledge. The character and trait are indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The secret book safe is introduced in paragraph two (she "pressed the hidden clasp to reveal the secret book safe where she stored her rarest pigments") and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("closed the secret book safe behind her, leaving the final volume of the guild's knowledge sealed within the condemned wood"). It appears in two distinct beats and the final closure links it to loss and preservation. However, its primary function is storage; the safe does not constrain a choice or apply pressure. The seal at the end adds thematic weight but does not alter Elara's options or tactics. Present and functional, but swappable with another concealment method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is the story's spine: Elara's condition defines her perceptual limits, she works "through the concept of limits" while painting, discovers "how much detail her damaged visual cortex could process before the patterns dissolved into meaningless noise," and the closure crystallizes as "fractally precise, eternal in the limits of her art." The concept shapes stakes (can she finish before the patterns dissolve?) and tactics (she tests the edge of her processing). The title stakes and final image both pivot on this exact concept. The conceptual cost—what remains and what is lost within limits—is undeniable. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is introduced early as Elara's perceptual signature, returns in her brush strokes ("fractally precise strokes that replicated the cloud formations at one-tenth scale, then one-hundredth"), and closes the story ("she carried the sky within her now, fractally precise"). The trait enables her mural's unique texture ("creating a texture that would shimmer like actual atmosphere") and constrains her method—she must work at nested scales her condition allows. The trade-off is visible: her precision creates beauty but also limits what she can sustain before "patterns dissolved into meaningless noise." The attribute is woven into causality and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Craft" drives every major turn: withdrawing pigments, decoding the coin, climbing the staircase, applying paint, and the final act of descending and sealing the safe. The mural-making occupies the story's central beat, where she discovers her processing limit and completes the prophetic sky. The closure hinges on having crafted the sky—she walks away satisfied because the work is done. Remove "craft" and the story collapses; no other action could serve. The specificity (fractal strokes, pigment formulas, one-tenth then one-hundredth scale replication) makes this irreplaceable. Cost is visible in the sealed knowledge and her departure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coin appears in paragraph two ("centuries-old coin minted by the guild's founders") and its method—faint indentations encoding pigment ratios, "detectable only by her hyper-sensitive fingertips"—is signaled and used. She withdraws it, decodes it (enabling the "dawn amber" formula), and tucks it back in her pocket at the end, "its indentations now mapped in her muscle memory." The method constrains her approach (only her tactile sensitivity can read it) and enables the mural. However, it appears in two beats and the final mention is reflective rather than causal. Purposeful and specific, but the mechanics are explained more than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is introduced in the opening and pressures every choice: its condemned status creates the temporal deadline, its rotting wood threatens collapse, its spiral structure forces her to climb, its restricted shelf hides the pigments, its dome ceiling becomes the canvas, its eastern window admits the dawn light that validates her work. The setting supplies the resources (book safe, ancient coin, shelves she memorizes by touch) and the demolition crew's vibration through wood filters through Elara's tactile POV. The final act of sealing knowledge inside and walking away makes the setting indispensable to closure. Remove this exact setting and the story's logic fails.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The timeframe—"the hush just before a condemned building is demolished"—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens every beat: "marked it for demolition at dawn," "the hush before destruction," "waiting for the legal hour," "first gray light seeped through," "foreman's whistle pierced the silence," "engines roared to life." The clock forces her to work through the night, shapes her urgency, and closes with the exact convergence of her completion and the demolition start. The "heightened stillness" is sustained until the whistle breaks it. The temporal constraint is indispensable; without it, she could paint at leisure. Cost is visible in the finality of her departure as the engines start.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To mirror the sky inside walls" is introduced in paragraph one and drives her actions: she is not painting a person but "the sky itself," aims to capture "the exact gradient of tomorrow's sunrise," and completes "a sky that did not exist outside—the specific convergence of cloud and light that would occur at the exact moment the wrecking ball struck." The motivation is dramatized through her concrete choices (formula search, climbing, painting) and conflicts with time pressure. However, friction between want and cost is muted—she succeeds as planned, and the prophetic framing guarantees the match. The desire is clear and shapes structure, but the lack of genuine doubt or miscalculation keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is established early ("the hush before destruction when even the wind holds its breath," "heightened stillness that had fallen over the district") and sustained through the night work: the crew stands "in silence," the foreman's whistle "pierced the silence," and Elara's final movements are slow and deliberate. Tone modulates purposefully: stillness dominates until the closure beat when "engines roared to life," breaking the hush. The contrast charges the final image—her internal stillness ("not turning back") against external violence. Tone is coherent through turns and integral to the story's atmosphere and closure effect. The tonal shift at the ending reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
