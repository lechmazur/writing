<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and consistent—her physical reaction to the boutonnière ("displacement of self that knocked the breath from her lungs") anchors the borrowed-memory device in embodied experience. The progression from solitude to communion through inherited duty creates a credible arc, and the final choice to pin the flower to her coat feels earned by the layered revelation. Minor deduction: the stranger's motivations arrive primarily through told memory rather than dramatized friction, and Maren's decision carries minimal visible cost or foreclosed alternative on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (keeper, beacon, opal dock, nautical twilight) by the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through sensory density, the boutonnière's reweighting, and the layered memories until the final pinning gesture reconfigures Maren's isolation into lineage. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts the watch with conceptual cost (永久 solitude now understood as inheritance). The felt cost is legible in "accompanied by the ghost of every watcher who had loved the light more than the shore," though the decision itself carries limited on-page friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight are vivid and purpose-driven, filtering Maren's perceptual priorities (the missing rust, unstained wood) and charging the final image. The "softly persistent fog" functions as micro-setting that constrains her investigation method and recurs to bracket the closure. Sensory detail modulates with urgency: crisis narrows to absences, the calmer ending admits the lighthouse beam and deeper night. The environment shapes both her method (observing gaps in the dock's surface) and the thematic weight of "witnessed isolation."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early and tightens through the investigation, borrowed memories, and final pinning. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren realizes the woman "stayed at her post while her husband's vessel foundered," reweighting duty as transmission rather than surrender. The final act (pinning the flower, mirroring the gesture) is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual and legible (永久 isolation accepted as inheritance) but lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative that would elevate the score into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: isolation as vessel, the boutonnière as baton, duty across generations. The final image—"accompanied by the ghost of every watcher who had loved the light more than the shore"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (what does solitude mean?) without moralizing. The Edelweiss accrues meaning through wedding day, transmission, and inheritance, reweighting prior material. Minor slip: "no longer foreign but foundational" edges toward thematic echo, though it remains anchored in the sensory particulars of the borrowed memories settling "into her bones."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance modulating purposefully (close during memory influx, pulling back for the investigation). Diction is controlled and character-particular: "calcifying into ritual," "tides ground stone into sand," "mist curled around the pylons in softly persistent waves." No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what Maren can plausibly infer from the borrowed memories. Minor deduction: some phrasing ("foundational," "circuit between past and present") leans toward elevated abstraction that sits at the edge of the established voice's lexicon, though it remains legible and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character knowledge, or thematic resonance. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("lichen on stone," "pearls, layer upon layer") is coherent and image-driven. However, template cadence appears in several lines: "She found... She clutched... She moved... She saw... She understood... She raised... She would remain." This syntactic pattern spans multiple beats and dulls immediacy during the investigation sequence, triggering a −0.6 deduction for template-cadence run. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; the closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of borrowed memories, lighthouse-keeper lineage, and investigation-by-absence offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The boutonnière as temporal baton and "witnessed isolation" as inheritance transform familiar solitude tropes through grounded world logic and Maren's perceptual method. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation and the unconventional investigation (observing gaps rather than evidence) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the core emotional arc (solitary keeper finds communion through inheritance) echoes established templates, and the piece does not fully transcend its premise despite strong execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her decisions (investigating the dock, mirroring the gesture, pinning the flower) create key turns. Setup is immediate; development occurs in the investigation; payoff is the final pinning and acceptance. Her eccentric solitude shapes her perceptual method (observing gaps) and the thematic weight of the ending. Causal pressure is moderate: her choices narrow options and reweight her isolation, but the final decision carries limited visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Scores at the 6.8 level for driving two beats (investigation, closure) and shaping the ending, but lacks the indispensability and felt trade-off required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The boutonnière appears in beat one (discovery), beat two (warming during investigation), beat three (revealing wedding-day origin), and the closure (pinning to her coat). Early signal is immediate; development constrains her investigation by pulsing warmer as she approaches truth; payoff is the final pinning that completes the transmission circuit. Specificity is high: silver petals, wedding day, salt and sorrow. The object's reweighted meaning (key → baton → inheritance) charges the final image. Cost connection is clear: accepting the flower means accepting 永久 isolation as duty. Indispensable; removing it would collapse the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Borrowed memories shape stakes and tactics: they trigger Maren's physical reaction, guide her investigation (pulsing warmer), reveal the stranger's final moments, and settle into her bones at closure. Setup is immediate (the flower "triggered something immediate and violent"); development alters her knowledge and method; payoff is the settling "no longer foreign but foundational." Causal pressure is strong: the memories narrow her interpretive options and enable the final gesture. Specificity: "a woman's laugh echoing up spiral stairs, the smell of diesel and lavender mixing with ozone." Cost connection: accepting the memories means inheriting the stranger's isolation. Essential across three beats and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" appears three times, applied to the mist. Setup is early (dock's edge, mist curling); development occurs when the fog "refusing to dissipate even as the tide changed, as if the vapor itself held memory"; payoff is "softly persistent fog pressed against her skin like a question." The trait enables one tactic (the mist as memory-vessel) and charges the final image with thematic weight. Causal constraint is moderate: the fog's persistence mirrors the inheritance but does not visibly alter Maren's choices or impose a cost. Scores for purposeful reprise and thematic linkage but lacks the irreplaceability required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Investigation drives the middle third: Maren examines the planks, searches for absences (missing rust, unstained wood), and reconstructs the final moments. Setup is clear ("Maren began to investigate"); development narrows her knowledge and enables the borrowed memories to sharpen; payoff is the realization that the stranger "stayed at her post" and the decision to mirror the gesture. Causal pressure is strong: the investigation changes her understanding and enables closure. However, the investigation itself is somewhat passive (observing rather than deciding under friction), and the method (observing gaps) is not tested or complicated. Scores for driving two beats and shaping closure but lacks the indispensability and on-page friction required for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By observing gaps" is signaled early ("not with the tools of a detective but with the intuition of a keeper who understood that truth often hid in negative space") and demonstrated in the investigation beat (missing rust, unstained wood, silence between gull cries). Development is moderate: the method enables her to reconstruct the final moments. Payoff is implicit in the closure (she will "decode the silence for the next keeper" by leaving gaps). Mechanics matter: the method is specific and character-particular. However, it is not tested or complicated; no friction arises from the method itself. Scores for early signal and one key beat but lacks closure participation that would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The opal dock appears in beat one (shimmering beneath her boots), the investigation (examining planks, terminus), and the final stance ("stood at her post"). Setup is immediate; development supplies the investigation surface and the stranger's footprint-absences; payoff is Maren standing at the dock as the lighthouse beam sweeps overhead. The dock's opal shimmer and the mist curling around pylons charge the atmosphere and the closure image. Spatial constraint is moderate: the dock's terminus focuses the investigation. Removing the dock would weaken the setting's specificity and the closure's grounding, though "opal" itself is ornamental. Scores for presence across three beats and closure participation but lacks the tactical constraint required for indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is defined early ("that sacred interval when the sun hid six to twelve degrees below the line dividing sea from sky") and brackets the story (opening in twilight, ending as "nautical twilight deepened into true night"). Setup is immediate; payoff is the temporal deepening that mirrors Maren's acceptance. However, the timeframe does not constrain decisions or impose a clock; it functions primarily as atmospheric framing. The time progression is legible but passive. Scores for purposeful early–final reprise and thematic resonance (light/duty/transition) but lacks the tactical pressure required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The motivation to decode the stranger's final gesture is dramatized through Maren's investigation, the borrowed memories' guidance, and the final mirroring act. Setup is immediate (the boutonnière triggers the need); development is the investigation and memory-sharpening; payoff is the pinning and acceptance of the watch. Desire faces moderate friction: the borrowed memories are "not her own," creating a displacement that she must integrate. Cost is conceptual (永久 isolation accepted) but lacks visible trade-off or competing want. Scores for driving the arc and shaping closure but lacks the on-page friction between wants and costs required for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent throughout: Maren's thirty-year solitude, the stranger's final gesture ensuring "someone would see," and the ending's redefinition of isolation as "accompanied by the ghost of every watcher." Tone modulates with pressure: early solitude reads cold and calcified, mid-story isolation sharpens through borrowed warmth, and the closure reweights isolation as lineage. The tone charges the final image ("no longer alone in her isolation") with undeniable thematic and emotional cost. The tone is indispensable; removing it would collapse the story's conceptual arc. Scores for coherence, modulation, and closure charge.</comment>
