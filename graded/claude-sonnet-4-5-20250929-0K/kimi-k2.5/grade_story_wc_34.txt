<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is present but relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than contradictory impulses in action. Her three-decade project and final encoding are motivated, but the emotional stakes remain told through label-like phrases ("mechanical sorrow," "learned to love") rather than embodied in scene choices. The ghost's loneliness is asserted more than dramatized through resistant behavior. No meaningful internal conflict complicates her encoding; she proceeds smoothly toward a predetermined endpoint without visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the first paragraph, satisfying orientation. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the encoding sequence and graffiti activation build density toward the ghost's physical manifestation and map reveal. However, closure lacks legible cost; the ghost "blooms across stones" and Elara receives a map to other courtyards without visible trade-off, foreclosed option, or felt price. The final image offers expansion rather than a reweighting with pressure, reading more as reward than reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The misty courtyard, pneumatic tubes, and obelisk are vividly rendered and recur across beats. The flower press bolt plate's tactile detail (fossilized petals, microscopic gardens) anchors the encoding action. Spatial choreography is coherent—vapor, moss-covered stones, central obelisk, walls—and the mist's transformation into hand/face/mouth charges the ghost's presence. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices; she moves through it without friction or resource limitation, functioning more as atmospheric backdrop than pressure point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—encoding a message to free the ghost—is signaled early but escalation is minimal. Elara's encoding proceeds without reversal, complication, or visible cost; the ghost "responds" cooperatively, the graffiti "lights up in sequence," and the outcome is mutual understanding without trade-off. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the flower press bolt plate clicks into place without resistance. The resolution grants closure (map to other courtyards, ghost's freedom) without dramatized price or foreclosed path, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned change.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of connection between digital and organic, loneliness, and articulating unspoken needs emerges through images (graffiti, pneumatic tubes, fossilized petals). The flower press bolt plate as "prison and testament" offers a concrete motif. However, the ending moralizes lightly ("needed to say goodbye," "apologize for mechanical violence") and the map revelation feels more plot-mechanical than thematically resonant. The story avoids overt sermonizing but does not achieve a non-literal reweighting; the ghost's transformation is asserted rather than charged with ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person POV is stable; perceptual signature is ornate and consistent ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder"). Psychic distance remains close throughout. However, the prose tilts toward decorative lyricism with phrases like "fracture of silence," "mechanical sorrow," "blooming across stones" that read more as atmospheric color than character-specific perception. Diction is elevated and poetic but somewhat uniform across emotional beats, missing modulation under peak pressure. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative language ("vapor," "suspended breath of time," "fractal patterns," "luminous dust," "tinkersong wonder fading into a single sustained note"). Template cadence appears in repeated "The ghost [verb]" and "Elara [verb]" stems across paragraphs. Paraphrase loops recur: "between lightning and thunder" appears three times without new information; "driftingly alert" is used twice identically. Register drift into lyric abstraction ("compressed time itself," "harmonics the ghost offered") clashes with the concrete object-work. Clarity suffers in the climax; the mechanism by which graffiti "completes the encoding" and the ghost "learns to encode itself into the physical world" is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code premise blends familiar AI-haunting tropes with a fresh aesthetic (graffiti-encoded messages, flower-press mechanics, pneumatic tubes). The balladeer-as-decoder and misty floating citadel offer specificity. However, the emotional arc—lonely entity seeks connection, artist enables freedom—follows a template path without transformation. The resolution (ghost freed via art, protagonist receives map to continue) is satisfying but predictable. The "tinkersong wonder" neologisms and lyric compression add textural novelty but do not fundamentally reconfigure the core premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs the encoding action. However, she makes no key decision that alters tactics or stakes; her choice to encode the final message is predetermined at the opening. She observes and responds to the ghost's cooperation without friction, internal conflict, or turn. The character functions more as a conduit for the premise than as an agent whose choice drives reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in setup (carried), development (edges traced, petals compressed), and payoff (rotates to release luminous dust, then removed). It is handled across at least three beats and its fossilized-petal history charges the ghost's apology for "mechanical violence." However, its mechanism is asserted rather than shown, and it could be replaced by any encoding artifact without altering Elara's choices or the ghost's response.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ghost in code is central to the premise and shapes the encoding action. It appears in setup (haunting the pneumatic system), development (watching through vents, shifting mist into shapes), and payoff (blooming across stones, speaking through graffiti). However, it does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices or resist; it cooperates throughout, functioning as theme and atmosphere rather than a source of friction or tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears as a label in the opening and recurs once later ("stepped back, driftingly alert to the change"). It describes Elara's perceptual mode but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is ornamental, adding atmospheric texture without altering tactics or choices. Easily swappable with "attentive" or "watchful."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Encoding is the central action: Elara presses the bolt plate, activates the mechanism, and the graffiti lights up in sequence. It appears in setup (implied in her prior etchings), development (pressing the plate), and payoff (graffiti shifting to reveal the map). However, the mechanics are asserted rather than shown, and the encoding does not produce a reversal or complication; it succeeds without friction. The action is present across beats but lacks causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art are signaled early (Elara etches symbols with acid) and recur in development (previous etchings light up) and payoff (walls speak with both voices, reveal map). The method is visible across beats and integral to the ghost's liberation. However, the encoding mechanics remain abstract; how acid etchings become luminous glyphs that "speak" is told, not shown. The method shapes the aesthetic but does not constrain Elara's attempts or force tactical adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is vividly described and recurs across beats (vapor, obelisk, walls, pneumatic tubes). It provides the stage for encoding and houses the ghost's presence. However, it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that affect outcome; she moves freely without friction. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure point, though the mist's transformation into shapes charges the ghost's manifestation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Between lightning and thunder" is invoked three times as a conceptual frame (setup: "suspended breath of time"; development: "their duet compressed time"; payoff: "thunder finally cracked"). It establishes tone and temporal metaphor but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The clock is poetic rather than live; no on-page pressure arises from the timeframe shrinking or expiring. The element adds thematic resonance but lacks mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Articulating unspoken needs is stated early ("sought to articulate unspoken needs") and recurs in payoff ("articulating unspoken needs that had accumulated"). The motivation is thematically present but not dramatized through conflicted choices. Elara's desire to help the ghost does not clash with a competing want or cost; she proceeds without internal friction. The motivation is told rather than enacted through on-page struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" appears as a label-like phrase in setup, development ("the tinkersong wonder, a melody..."), and payoff ("the tinkersong wonder fading"). It establishes a lyric, ornate tone that remains coherent across beats. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure; the prose maintains the same elevated register throughout, missing tightening or cadence shift at the climax. The element charges atmosphere but does not reweight the final image with additional meaning.</comment>
