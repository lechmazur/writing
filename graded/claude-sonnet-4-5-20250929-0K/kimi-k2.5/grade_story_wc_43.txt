<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivations are clear and professional; her decisively kind intervention shifts Maya's posture from weapon-bearing to witness. Maya's arc from hostile fragment-clutcher to someone who understands broken beauty is earned through Elena's hymning and the shared vinyl moment. The embodied emotion (knuckles white, shoulders dropping) grounds the abstraction. Minor: Mr. Hale remains somewhat passive, though his lucid moment and final breath carry weight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through Elena's hymning ritual and the scent arrival, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid) where Maya holds the broken record to her heart with new understanding. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (the father's death, the weight Maya carries down). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scent of hope transforms Maya's grip from violence to need, reweighting the reconciliation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cloudhaven's altitude, glass walls, and cloud-sea create a vivid suspended world. The IV pump click, monitor beeps, and curtain rustle anchor micro-setting details that support the hymning ritual. The "scent of hope"—ozone and meadow rising upward—defies physics purposefully and charges the emotional turn. The vinyl shard's tactile presence (jagged edge, gold lettering) recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, qualifying as object-as-setting that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: execute a flawless goodbye for estranged father and daughter within a three-to-four-hour window. Elena's hymning and vinyl fragment intervention tighten pressure by transforming Maya's stance from hostile to receptive. The arrival of the scent and Maya's shift from violence to need constitute one meaningful deepening. Mr. Hale's death forty minutes later delivers visible cost and foreclosed options. The accumulative lens supports this escalation pattern cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: broken things remain beautiful *because* they cannot be mended. Elena's hymning of the mundane (water glass, dust motes, coffee cups) and the vinyl fragment's recurrence build a non-literal answer to reconciliation without forgiveness. The final image—Maya holding the shard to her heart, carrying scent and weight as ballast—reweights prior material without moralizing. No thematic echo at closure; the resonance is earned through accumulated specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchored in Elena is mostly stable, with clear psychic distance. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("hymning the mundane," "pulsing stillness," "saturated with meaning") in ways that read slightly above ground-level hospice-worker interiority, though the lyric mode may justify it. Perceptual signature is present (Elena's focus on IV clicks, sheet creases). No dialogue to judge. The final paragraph's "She had executed" pulls back into summary rather than staying in the ending image's immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high, but overwriting clusters appear throughout: "the quality of decisively kind intervention," "pulsing stillness," "saturated with meaning," "ancient drifting." Mixed metaphor: "rain rising upward in defiance of gravity" is physically unclear as ozone scent mechanism. Template-cadence runs in the hymning catalog ("of the water glass…of the crease…of the dust motes"). The final two paragraphs loop the closure concept with synonym churn ("hymned into eternity," "hymning them into architecture," "hymned into the architecture"). Applying artifact penalties: −0.6 for density in peak beats, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for paraphrase loop at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hospice-music-therapist frame and "hymning the mundane" method offer a fresh angle on deathbed reconciliation. The vinyl fragment as shared-broken-beauty object feels specific and purposeful. The scent of hope arriving as storm-ozone is a vivid, non-obvious sensory trigger. Risk: the elevated register and patterned hymning could alienate, but they cohere with the concept. Transformation test passes—plot would not work unchanged with different setting or method. The piece commits fully to its lyric-ritual premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena removes the sharp vinyl from Maya's hand (beat one), begins hymning the mundane to alter room pressure (beat two), increases tempo to weave shared memories (beat three), and her tuning fork presence anchors the final passage (beat four). Her decisively kind choices drive all major turns. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, closure linkage. Swappability low—her specific hymning method is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The vinyl shard is introduced early, handled by Maya (weapon grip), placed on bedside table by Elena (witness), returned to Maya's hand (pressed against father's palm), and held to her own heart at closure. Appears in four distinct beats, each reweighting its meaning from violence to reunion to carried ballast. Specificity high: "A Love Supreme" label, jagged edge, fractured grooves. Irreplaceable—story logic hinges on this exact broken object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Scent of hope appears as ozone-meadow aroma arriving mid-scene, triggering Maya's shoulder drop and shift from violence to need—one causal beat. It lingers in curtains at closure and is named in the final paragraph as ballast Maya carries. Setup is late (past midpoint); middle development is strong (changes Maya's stance); closure participation is summary-mention rather than active. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but does not drive a second distinct beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is embodied when Elena takes the vinyl shard without asking permission, steadying her fingers to prevent harm while allowing witness. This single action demonstrates the trait with visible cost (Elena assumes authority, Maya yields). The phrase also appears in final-paragraph summary. One beat with clear constraint, early signal, closure echo. Swappability moderate—another trait could justify the intervention, but the combination of decision and kindness is specific to the hospice role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reunify" is the story's hinge: Maya places the vinyl shard into her father's palm, closing his fingers around broken music. This beat arrives late (final third) but transforms all prior material—Elena's hymning and the scent prepare it, and the act enables the thematic closure (beauty through brokenness). Drives the peak turn and shapes the ending image. Irreplaceable—no other action delivers this exact reconciliation without forgiveness. Late arrival caps higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hymning the mundane is signaled early ("she began hymning the mundane"), demonstrated through catalog of ordinary details (water glass, sheet crease, dust motes), escalated (tempo increase, shared memories), and named in the final paragraph as the method that created the goodbye's architecture. Appears in three beats, shapes Elena's tactics, and charges the closure concept. Specificity high—this exact ritual method is irreplaceable. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cloudhaven's altitude (seven thousand feet, thin oxygen, brutal sunlight) and glass walls frame the opening and closing images. The suspended haven and clouds anchor tone and provide the metaphorical backdrop for the scent's upward arrival. Does not constrain choice directly but charges the final image (Maya descending through clouds with ballast). Postcard-description risk mitigated by recurring presence and tonal coherence. Micro-setting (bedside, monitors, curtain) does more tactical work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the blood work came back" anchors the inciting moment; "three hours, perhaps four" sets the ticking clock. Mr. Hale's death "forty minutes later" delivers time-bound closure. The timeframe tightens Elena's urgency and shapes her hymning method. Setup early, mentioned at closure, but middle pressure is more about ritual accumulation than minute-by-minute escalation. Functional and purposeful but not driving beat-by-beat tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elena's goal—"execute a flawless goodbye"—is stated early and shapes every choice: removing the sharp vinyl, hymning the mundane, increasing tempo, weaving memories. Her success is confirmed in the final paragraph ("She had executed the flawless goodbye"). Drives multiple beats, tested by Maya's initial hostility and the narrow time window. Friction between perfection and human messiness (broken record, morphine haze) is present. Early signal, causal pressure, closure validation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is named twice (mid-story, near-closure) and enacted through the monitors' slow metronome, Elena's thrumming voice, and the suspended moment above the clouds. Tone modulates from static opening to ritual intensity to exhaled release ("holding its breath before releasing it"). Coherent through turns, charges the final image. Specificity moderate—the paradox of pulse within stillness fits the hospice threshold but borders on abstract label. Present in closure beat.</comment>
