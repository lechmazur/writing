<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's drive to quantify emotion is clear and consistent, but her internal experience remains abstract—we see her *operate* personalities rather than feel contradictory impulses act simultaneously. The cartographer arrives as a vehicle for her experiment, not as a person with autonomous pressure, flattening the crucible potential. The ending forecloses her path (he becomes "another font"), but the cost reads conceptual rather than embodied; no micro-choice under competing wants dramatizes the trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph and follows an Accumulative lens: density of metaphor and borrowed-personality imagery builds toward the final equation and the cartographer's consumption. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—Elara achieves her theorem but at the undeniable cost of hollowing another soul—and the halo's "cold, precise light" reweights her quest. However, the cartographer's transformation happens in summary ("became only another font") rather than a visible, felt moment, weakening cost legibility and capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, pneumatic tubes, Vandercook press, and halo fragment supply vivid, occupation-specific anchors that feel lived-in. The halo fragment constrains Elara's work (it powers the press, feeds on stolen pages) and charges the final image with its shift from warm glow to cold light. Spatial choreography is clean—amber walls, skylight, iron press, type drawers—and the vanishing stars function as both atmosphere and ticking clock, though their pressure remains more poetic than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—deriving the mathematics of emotion—is signaled early and drives Elara's experiment. The cartographer's disorientation provides one meaningful tightening (his rigid maps become meaningless, his sorrow turns liquid), but the escalation is enacted *on* him rather than *by* protagonist agency at the climax. The cost is conceptual (he becomes a font, stars vanish) and legible in the final image, yet the price feels more announced than paid in embodied consequence, limiting the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—the cost of quantifying the unquantifiable, empathy as theft—emerges organically from Elara's letterpress work and borrowed personalities. The halo's transformation from warm to cold light and the cartographer's reduction to "another font" offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, lines like "the mathematics of emotion" and "transposed empathy" risk thematic echo by naming the premise in near-prompt language, and the final paragraph edges toward summary ("theorem at last") rather than pure image, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-close on Elara; perceptual signature is strong (type as "tiny personalities," emotions as solvable equations). Diction is controlled and voice-specific—"lucid turbulence" coheres through metaphor density and syntactic rhythm. The cartographer's interiority ("gasped, utterly disoriented") briefly shifts psychic distance but stays filtered through Elara's observation. No head-hopping, and the elevated register ("viscous black ink," "longitude of grief") fits the established metaphysical tone without jarring slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but legible ("gaps...like missing teeth," "viscous black ink"). However, heavy metaphor concentration ("longitude of the heart," "latitude of grief," "liquid emotion," "coral," "fish") in the climax beats risks overwriting without sufficient pattern-teaching, per the Overwriting Check (−0.4 for density without payoff). Minor paraphrase loop: "borrowed personalities" recurs four times across adjacent paragraphs without functional shift. No scaffold or template cadence, and clarity holds at closure, limiting deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of letterpress craft, stolen personalities, and empathy quantification offers a fresh angle, avoiding template plots. Specific anchors (Garamond/Bodoni fonts as souls, pneumatic tubes for interception, halo fragment as power source) ground the premise in concrete detail. However, the "stars vanishing as cosmic backdrop" and "cartographer mapping absence" lean toward familiar metaphysical-fantasy tropes without sharp transformation. The core risk—Elara's ultimate theft—is bold but arrives late and in summary, reducing its charge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara operates the press throughout, sets type, feeds the halo fragment with the cartographer's journal page (a distinct choice that narrows his options), and completes her equation at closure. Her decisions—offering handleless tea, shifting personalities, feeding the stolen page—drive two beats and shape the ending. However, the final act (deriving the theorem) happens in summary rather than a visible on-page micro-choice with immediate cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in beat one (she found it, it glows), powers the press in beat two (feeds on the cartographer's page), and returns in the final image with reweighted meaning (warm glow → cold, precise light of understanding). It enables Elara's work and charges the closure image. Three distinct beats, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (no generic "magic item" could substitute without losing the "halo = stolen divinity" resonance). Cost is tied to its transformation, though the mechanism remains slightly ornamental rather than causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is named early, shapes Elara's goal (transfer heart-weight through ink), and is enacted in the climax ("transposed empathy flooded the workshop," the cartographer feels "himself and everyone else simultaneously"). It appears in three beats and drives the cartographer's disorientation. However, the concept is more asserted than shown—we see its *effect* (he gasps, drowns in emotion) but not the *mechanics* of how ink/type/press accomplish the transfer, leaving it abstract and somewhat swappable with "mind control" or "soul theft."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Habitually borrows personalities" is signaled early (intercepted fingerprints, type as souls) and enables two beats: Elara shifts between the cartographer's mother/rival/future self to disorient him, and the ending reveals he becomes "another font...never returned." The trait constrains her method (she needs others' selves to populate her type drawers) and the cost is visible (she consumes him). However, the *mechanics* of borrowing are told rather than dramatized in a micro-choice with immediate friction, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Disorient" drives the central beat: Elara offers handleless tea, contradictory proverbs, shifts east/west via halo shadow, and cycles personalities to fracture the cartographer's certainty. His disorientation ("sweating," "clutched theodolite," "struggled to find true north") is the hinge that lets her extract and measure his grief. The action is irreplaceable—without disorientation, his rigid maps wouldn't loosen into quantifiable emotion. It appears in setup, middle escalation, and shapes closure (his reduction to a font). Two beats plus closure linkage, strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Deliberate ambiguity" is seeded early (manifestos "never meant to be read," languages "only in mathematics") and enacted in the cartographer scene (handleless cups, self-contradicting proverbs, shifting directions, overlapping voices). It is the *how* of disorientation and shapes two beats. However, the method blends with "disorient" (9E) so tightly that their causal roles overlap; isolating ambiguity's unique contribution is difficult. It is signaled and functional but not quite indispensable from the action it enables.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is anchored early (amber glass walls, Vandercook press, type drawers, skylight) and pressures the cartographer's perception (walls "breathe and pulse," east becomes west). The halo fragment's shadow shifts spatial orientation, a micro-setting tactic. The workshop returns in the final image ("went dark and still except for the halo fragment"), charging closure. Three beats, environment-driven disorientation, and irreplaceable specificity (generic "magic room" would lose the letterpress/type/glass metaphor stack). Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the opening ("stars were vanishing one by one") and bookends closure ("the last star vanished"). Stars vanish during Elara's experiment, lending atmospheric urgency. However, the time pressure is more poetic than tactical—no on-page moment shows Elara racing a star-clock or adjusting tactics because time is running out. The cartographer's arrival timing is unexplained, and "tonight" is vague. Present in setup and closure but lacks middle development; capped at mid-band per missing gate and swappability (any cosmic countdown could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "derive the equation that made feeling quantifiable" is stated early and drives her experiment on the cartographer. Her goal shapes two beats (setting up the workshop trap, feeding his journal to the halo) and is fulfilled at closure ("the mathematics of emotion finally emerged"). However, the motivation is mostly told ("she believed," "she needed") rather than shown through competing wants or a micro-choice that dramatizes cost *before* the ending. Friction between empathy-as-science and empathy-as-theft is implicit but not foregrounded in her interiority, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Tone coheres as lucid yet metaphor-dense throughout: precise craft vocabulary ("Vandercook press," "Garamond," "theodolite") layered with surreal imagery ("viscous black ink," "fish through coral," "longitude of grief"). The tone modulates under pressure—calm setup, mounting strangeness during disorientation, cold precision at closure—and charges the final image (halo's shift to "cold, precise light"). However, occasional overwrought phrasing ("latitude of the heart") and the near-overwriting in the climax beat slightly muddle lucidity, preventing a higher score.</comment>
