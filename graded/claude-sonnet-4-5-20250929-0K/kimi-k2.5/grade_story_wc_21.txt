<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear—complete the circuit between past and present—but his interior experience flattens into heavy abstractions ("haunting possession," "erosion of temporal reality") rather than embodied contradiction. The final stance ("not a curse but a communion") reads as stated epiphany rather than enacted cost; we're told he accepts the weight but don't see a micro-choice that forecloses an option. The retrocognitive trap constrains him physically, yet his agency remains passive observation until the closing arrangement, which arrives too late to build choice-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (Causal setup → Accumulative/Textural closure via arranged debris as symbolic bridge). Orientation arrives promptly: archivist, zeppelin deck, obsidian lagoon beneath dunes. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias kneels, arranges debris, recites names, and the lagoon surfaces evidence—yet the cost remains abstract ("solemn weight...settled into his bones") rather than a legible forfeiture or altered option. The because/therefore chain (touch diary → retrocognitive trap → descend → arrange → parley begins) holds structurally, but the final image asserts communion without demonstrating what Elias has lost or what path he's foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating library and quartz dunes anchor early, and the obsidian lagoon returns at closure to "expose the evidence." The harness descent through "clouds that tasted of salt and static" offers vivid sensory texture, and the beach debris (vertebrae, obsidian shards) is handled on the page. However, the zeppelin and library remain postcard anchors—present but not constraining choice—and the setting's pressure is thematic rather than tactical; Elias's kneeling and arrangement could occur in any liminal space without altering his options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—complete the psychic circuit to release trapped souls and expose buried truth—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the retrocognitive trap releases when Elias arranges the final black stone, initiating the parley. Cost is declared ("knowing that the retrocognitive trap had not been a curse") but the price is emotional rhetoric rather than a visible forfeiture; we don't see what Elias gives up or what option he's lost. The lagoon's surfacing feels granted by the story rather than earned by Elias's agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—archiving as confrontation, not preservation; the past must be felt to be witnessed—emerges from concrete action (arranging debris, reciting names) and the retrocognitive communion. The encrypted diary functioning as both map and trap is a strong conceptual hinge. However, the ending states its thesis overtly: "archiving was not preservation but confrontation...to drown in it so that others might breathe the air of justice." This moralizing assertion replaces scene pressure in the final paragraph, reducing resonance to summary. The obsidian lagoon's return offers a charged image, but the conceptual repricing is diluted by the explanatory close.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout; psychic distance is consistent. Voice carries an elevated, incantatory register ("searing reverie," "benediction," "communion") that matches the otherworldly premise and maintains texture under pressure. However, diction drifts into abstraction at peak beats: "boundaries between archivist and casualty, between record and flesh" and "the lattice of arranged debris that now formed a bridge" layer metaphor on metaphor without grounding in immediate sensory anchor. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he understood," "watching") stack in the descent and kneeling sequence, dulling immediacy when the prose needs embodied urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language ("clouds that tasted of salt and static," "each stone a clause in the treaty with history") offers vivid moments. Clarity suffers from density without payoff: "retrocognitive trap," "encrypted diary," "acrostic verse," "maritime code," and "psychic tether" layer specialized terms in rapid succession, creating conceptual congestion. Paraphrase loops appear: "arranging beach debris as messages" → "each shell...a word in the negotiation, each stone a clause" restates the same idea across adjacent lines. The closing paragraph stacks abstractions—"communion," "sediment becoming stone," "secrets finally translated into the light"—that summarize rather than advance the final image. Template cadence: "Each time...," "Each shell...," "Each stone..." across three beats in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The fusion of civil-rights archiving with retrocognitive trap and floating library is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The encrypted diary as both document and psychic map, plus beach debris as cross-temporal semaphore, offers fresh genre inflection. However, the premise's boldness is undercut by execution that leans on stock metaphors ("bridge between eras," "circuit," "treaty with history") and the climax—lagoon surfaces to "expose the evidence"—resolves via convenient mysticism rather than earned causality. The risk-taking is conceptual but the follow-through defaults to abstract affirmation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his archival duty frames the stakes. He signals the winch, descends, arranges debris, and recites names—three beats. However, his choices are reactive to the retrocognitive compulsion rather than volitional trade-offs; he "must complete the circuit" without on-page friction between competing wants. The final kneeling and acceptance lack a visible cost that alters later options. Present across all three gates but swappable with any scholar-medium figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in the opening (hidden beneath dunes), is referenced at midpoint ("1963...marshals drown organizers in that obsidian lagoon"), and returns at closure ("bubbling upward through the sand to expose the evidence"). Its black, reflectionless waters carry symbolic charge and its surfacing is the story's physical revelation. However, the lagoon is not handled or used by Elias; it responds to his arrangement but remains scenery. All three gates met, causal pressure moderate, closure linkage strong, but interaction is passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is introduced early ("found three days prior"), constrains Elias via retrocognitive trap whenever he touches it, and at closure "he closed the encrypted diary, knowing..." Its acrostic verse conceals victim names, shaping the stakes. However, the diary's mechanics (why touch triggers trap, how it encrypts coordinates) remain vague, and its resolution is thematic summary rather than on-page decryption. Setup and middle constraint present, but closure participation is ornamental—Elias closes it after the work is done. Cap 4.6 for weak closure participation; score within that band for moderate middle use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trap appears early, forces Elias into 1963 whenever he touches the diary, and shapes his descent to the beach ("must complete the circuit"). At closure, "the retrocognitive trap released its hold...allowing Elias to speak across the decades." The trait constrains his perception and drives the parley. However, the cost is abstract ("tightened," "released") and the mechanism is invoked rather than demonstrated through sensory penalty. All three gates, moderate causal pressure, visible in closure, but swappable with any psychic burden. Band 5.0–6.9; score mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Parley is Elias's stated purpose ("initiate the parley between eras"), the action named at the black stone's placement ("the parley began"), and the means by which trapped souls are released and evidence surfaces. The air shimmers, Elias recites names, the lagoon responds. Parley drives the closure beat and is irreplaceable—no other negotiation form would fit the cross-temporal communion. All three gates, strong closure linkage, high specificity. Cost is present (Elias must speak and witness) but remains abstract. Band 7.0–8.4; score lower end for modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Arranging beach debris as messages is signaled early (dying hands "arranged shells and driftwood into desperate semaphore"), executed in the middle (Elias gathers vertebrae and obsidian shards, "placing them in spirals that spelled coordinates"), and completes at closure ("When the final black stone clicked into place, the parley began"). The method's specificity (maritime code, spirals) matters to the mystical mechanism. All three gates, drives two beats, shapes closure. Swappability moderate—other symbolic arrangement could substitute. Band 7.0–8.4; score mid-low for single-use mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The floating library on a zeppelin is introduced in the opening line and its recording equipment captures Elias's voice at closure. However, it functions as atmospheric backdrop; the harness and winch are tools, but the library's cargo of books "trembling with resonance" is metaphor, not causal agent. Setup present, middle absent (Elias descends away from it), closure mention is ornamental. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; scenic presence without choice constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the letters are found" anchors the frame (letters found three days prior), and "afternoon sun" marks the descent moment. However, the timeframe imposes no visible pressure; Elias's decision to descend and arrange debris is not shaped by urgency or deadline. Setup present, middle and closure do not leverage time as constraint. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; functional chronology without tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to uncover truth in tension" is embodied in his archival duty and the retrocognitive trap's demand. He descends to "complete the circuit" and recites names to release trapped souls—truth-seeking drives the plot. The friction between his professional detachment and the visceral drowning visions appears ("feel the history he had catalogued, to drown in it") but is told rather than enacted in micro-choices. All three gates, moderate causal pressure, but desire lacks on-page conflict between want and cost. Band 5.0–6.9; score low-mid for limited dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Searing reverie is present throughout: elevated diction ("obsidian lagoon," "quartz dunes," "benediction"), layered metaphor, and the retrocognitive communion create a consistent mystical-historical intensity. Tone modulates from detached observation (zeppelin deck) to urgent embodiment (kneeling, arranging) to transcendent summary (final paragraph). However, the register remains uniformly elevated without variation under pressure—crisis does not compress syntax or sharpen perception. Coherent and purposeful, charges the final image, but static mood rather than dynamic modulation. Band 7.0–8.4; score mid-low for limited pressure-driven shift.</comment>
