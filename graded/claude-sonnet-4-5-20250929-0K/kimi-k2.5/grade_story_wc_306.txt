<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's profession and stance are established early, but his motivations remain abstract—his need to "welcome nuance into certainty" is declared rather than dramatized through on-page friction. The cartographer's visit is summarized rather than enacted, leaving the protagonist's key choice (unhooking the cloak) somewhat disconnected from live pressure. Internal contradiction appears more as authorial assertion ("sincerely insincere") than as contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final decision to offer "ambiguity" instead of "absolution" reads more as thematic position than earned shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the cloak's weight builds, the mirror shard returns with shifted meaning, and the final image (cloak unraveling into mist) reconfigures the protagonist's stance. Orientation anchors (lighthouse, dawn, post-campfire) arrive by the second paragraph, meeting the test. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elias prepares to offer ambiguity rather than false certainty—but the cost remains oblique; the cartographer's return is projected ("would return at noon") rather than enacted, weakening the on-page consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (unhooking the cloak), yet the sequence lacks a decisive narrowing of options with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse catwalk, wind chimes, and northern rafter supply spatial choreography and recurring tactile anchors (coat snapping, hollow mirror shard between teeth). The cloak's weight and the chimes' pitch function as micro-setting that shapes the protagonist's choices. Dawn, Atlantic dampness, and maritime breeze are filtered through Elias's professional attention. Setting detail charges the final image (breeze takes the cloak) and constrains the unhooking action, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment affecting closure, though the integration is more atmospheric than decisively tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's need to shed the cloak's accumulated toxicity—is signaled by the end of the first third. One tightening occurs when he climbs and unhooks the cloak, but the cartographer's problem (absolute conviction vs. nuance) is summarized rather than tested in live conflict. The unhooking forecloses continued false absolution, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral; Elias will greet the client "with sincerely insincere warmth," suggesting continuity rather than transformation. No on-page reversal narrows options under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—embracing ambiguity over certainty—emerges from the cloak's symbolism and the cartographer's "stained" conviction. The final image (cloak unraveling into questions) offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the piece edges toward abstraction ("welcoming nuance," "vulnerability guarded by purpose") rather than grounding insight in a single dramatic particular. The mirror shard showing "layered, contradictory self" risks thematic echo, though it stops short of prompt-language sermon. The wind chimes' "approval" and "absolution" melody are close to allegorical convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (interpreting chimes as tea leaves, professional attention to "protected vulnerability") is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("transmuted into temporary truths," "crystallized final moment") that sits uneasily with the maritime setting. The hollow mirror shard "singing" and chimes "spelling" meanings verge on symbolic convenience rather than lived perception. Filter verbs ("saw how the cartographer's crime was") appear in a reflective beat without harming distance control. Internal voice is coherent, though the texture sometimes reads more as crafted allegory than embodied thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose carries strong figurative texture ("coat snapping like a flag of truce," "cloak of doubt unravel into mist") with purposeful rhythm shifts. However, density slips in the middle third: "His hands trembled with protected vulnerability—strong enough to hold others' fractures, yet acknowledging his own" is a paraphrase loop, restating the same idea without added pressure. The phrase "sincerely insincere" recurs three times as a label without fresh embodiment. Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats ("granite," "mist," "gold and gray horizon") without fresh vehicle work. Filter-verb stack ("saw through it," "saw how") in the descent paragraph lowers immediacy. No major artifact touches the final image, limiting penalty spread.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The "conscience for hire" profession and hollow mirror shard offer fresh particulars. The transformation test is borderline: swapping "lighthouse keeper" for another solitary profession would not collapse the arc, yet the maritime setting and wind chimes supply texture. The central metaphor (cloak of doubt as garment) is executed with specificity but leans on allegorical transparency. The cartographer's problem (mapping forbidden shores with bleeding ink) gestures toward originality but remains ornamental, never tested on the page. Risk-taking in the lyric, symbol-dense mode is present but does not heighten stakes decisively.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias as "conscience for hire" frames the opening and closing beats. His decision to unhook the cloak alters his future approach (offering ambiguity instead of absolution), meeting Development and Payoff gates. However, the cartographer consultation is summarized, not dramatized, limiting causal pressure. The profession shapes stakes but the on-page choice (unhooking) could belong to any reflective keeper; the "for hire" specificity does not decisively constrain the action. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hollow mirror shard appears in three beats: withdrawn from pocket, held between teeth during the climb, and warming in palm at the end. Its "empty center" property enables the cloak's translucence and shows Elias his "layered, contradictory self," linking to theme. Setup gate met (first third), Development gate weak (shard is carried but does not enable a middle choice), Payoff gate met (final image). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, causal pressure moderate +0.8, late first function −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "cloak of doubt" is handled in four beats: described as invisible yet heavy, climbed to, unhooked, and released into mist. Its accumulated "toxicity" from the cartographer's certainty drives the unhooking action. The cloak's translucence reveals the core insight (coastlines as suggestions). Setup gate met, Development gate met (weight compels the climb), Payoff gate strong (unhooking and release form the closure unit). Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure high +1.3, closure linkage decisive +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost visible +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sincerely insincere" is declared as Elias's "only authentic trait" and recurs twice more, but remains a label. It does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; Elias will continue with "sincerely insincere warmth" after the cloak is released, suggesting no functional change. Setup gate met (first paragraph), Development and Payoff gates absent (attribute does not enable or foreclose action). Early signal +0.4, ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unhook" is signaled early (chimes "sang of unhooking"), enacted at the midpoint (Elias grasps and lifts the cloak), and pays off in the release. The action is the story's pivot: it forecloses continued false absolution and enables the decision to offer ambiguity. Setup gate met, Development gate met (the climb and grasp), Payoff gate met (unhooking leads directly to the mist-release). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure high +1.4, closure linkage decisive +1.7, irreplaceability +0.7, cost tied +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Wind chime "selections" are interpreted in three beats: opening paragraph (three high notes, bronze toll), midpoint shift to minor key ("spelled release"), and closing approval cadence. The method frames Elias's professional skill and cues the unhooking, but the mechanics remain metaphorical—no specific pitch-to-meaning code is tested under pressure. Setup gate met, Development gate weak (chimes cue but do not constrain), Payoff gate met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, swappability moderate −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "breezy lighthouse at dawn" supplies spatial anchors (catwalk, interior ladder, northern rafter) and the wind that later takes the cloak. The breeze is functional in the final beat (unraveling the cloak into mist). Setup gate met (first sentence), Development gate weak (setting is stage more than constraint), Payoff gate met (breeze completes the action). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure moderate +0.8, swappability low −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the campfire's last spark dies" anchors the opening and recurs in the closing paragraph ("After the campfire's last spark dies, certainty always tried to reignite"). However, no live clock tightens decisions; the cartographer "would return at noon," projecting future rather than present urgency. Setup gate met, Development and Payoff gates absent (time does not constrain tactics). Early signal +0.5, two mentions +0.4, ornamental −0.7, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire "to welcome nuance into certainty" is declared in the first third and drives the unhooking decision. Elias's professional need (to shed the cloak's toxicity) and thematic aim (offer ambiguity) converge. Setup gate met, Development gate met (motivation compels the climb), Payoff gate met (final stance). However, the friction between want and cost is told more than shown; no on-page hesitation or competing impulse dramatizes the conflict. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure moderate +0.9, friction weak −0.8, summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is described twice ("hands trembled with protected vulnerability," "vulnerability guarded by purpose") and modulates through the piece: coat snapping, mirror shard biting into smile, hands trembling yet grasping. The tone charges the final image (courage to say "perhaps, maybe") and coheres across turns. Setup gate met, Development gate met (tone shapes the climb), Payoff gate met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.1, coherence +0.8, label-only moments −0.5.</comment>
