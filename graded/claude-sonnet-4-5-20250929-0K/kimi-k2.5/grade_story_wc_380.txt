<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior logic is consistent—she abandons her post for exploration, reads patterns, and exhumes with recognizable determination. Her motivation to find deleted memories is clear, but the recognition beats ("trembled from the recognition of approaching revelation") lean into label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The final moment with the wildflowers carries emotional weight, but the journey feels more like following breadcrumbs than making choices under pressure. The piece lacks a meaningful internal conflict or foreclosed path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story delivers on-page closure—Mara recovers the wildflowers and understands the whale's sacrifice—but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in a decisive action. The causal chain is thin: whale beaches → fissure opens → Mara follows coffee-ground divination → uncovers box. Each step is motivated by world logic but escalation is passive; Mara never faces a choice that narrows options. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image reweights prior material only lightly. Orientation is clear early, so no penalty applies there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered with specific, embodied detail: gravity pockets that pull at boots, formations "like frozen lightning," the whale's subsonic hum in the marrow. The tin cup and coffee grounds function as micro-setting tools that constrain Mara's divination method. The ribcage formation and the barnacle-etched tin box both charge the final image, linking setting to closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding deleted memories—is signaled early and drives Mara's descent, but pressure never tightens through her agency. The gravity pockets and chamber's subsonic hum create atmospheric complication, yet Mara encounters no meaningful obstacle or trade-off. The coffee-ground divination leads directly to the tin box without friction. The ending offers understanding but no on-page price that forecloses a path; "nothing about her lantern lighting would ever feel routine again" is declared rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece explores where lost things go with evocative particulars: salt crystallization as memory storage, the whale as sacrificial guide, the sister's wildflowers preserved by "strange physics." The final image—Mara holding pressed flowers—reweights the premise without explicit moralizing. However, the thematic claim "memories flowing like groundwater through fissures until they crystallized in places of power" edges into abstract statement rather than emerging purely from scene pressure. The concept of deletion-as-migration is fresh but not fully earned through conflicted action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's perceptual signature is distinct: she notices "minor alterations in the waterfront's geography," reads grounds as coordinates, and interprets the whale's hum as marrow-vibration. The prose texture is controlled, with purposeful compression ("gleaming silence," "sodium chloride formations that grew like frozen lightning"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Some filter verbs ("understood," "suspected") dull immediacy in peak beats, and the phrase "deletion had been not destruction but migration" leans expository, but voice remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically varied and carries high information density: "pockets of gravity that pulled at her boots with varying intensity" and "grounds swirling into configurations that her intuition read as coordinates" do double duty. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "the gravity fluctuated mysteriously, creating pockets of gravity" and "the patterns in coffee grounds resolved into a map, clustering toward a junction" restate without adding pressure. The final paragraph stacks summary ("understood at last," "She would return") where a sharp image would suffice. Minor template cadence in the opening ("massive humpback had beached… its death throes… triggering").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of whale as sacrificial messenger, salt crystals as memory vault, and coffee-ground divination feels specific and non-obvious. The piece avoids stock metaphors and commits fully to its lyric-realist premise. However, the emotional arc—isolated seeker finds lost sister's trace via mystical chamber—follows a recognizable template without a sharp moral calculus or character cost that transforms the frame. The wildflowers' sudden introduction as resolution reads convenient rather than inevitable in hindsight. The piece takes risks with gravity pockets and subsonic whale-song but lands safely in its closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as dock-side lantern lighter is signaled early ("she had abandoned her post extinguishing the harbor lamps"), informs her noticing of the fissure, and provides contrast for the final line ("nothing about her lantern lighting would ever feel routine again"). However, the trait does not constrain a key choice; her occupation could be swapped with "night-shift dock worker" without structural loss. She observes and exhumes but never faces a lantern-lighter-specific dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pressed wildflowers appear in setup as the sister's meadow vanishing, return as the tin box's contents, and charge the final image when Mara holds them to her chest. They reweight the premise: "deletion had been not destruction but migration." The flowers drive closure and are irreplaceable—only these exact blooms "had not grown on this coastline for forty years." Strong causal linkage and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity are described early ("gravity fluctuated mysteriously, creating pockets of gravity that pulled at her boots") and recur as Mara descends ("gravity pockets shifted around her, pressing down then releasing"). However, they function as atmospheric decoration rather than choice-shapers. Mara "adjusted her gait" but the pockets never block a path, force a detour, or impose cost. They could be removed without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" describes the gravity pockets but remains label-only. The fluctuation is told ("varying intensity," "nearly weightless") without demonstrating a visible trade-off—Mara never struggles, misjudges a step, or pays a price for miscalculating the pull. The trait could be swapped with "shifts unpredictably" or omitted entirely. No on-page action hinges on the mysterious quality.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Exhume" structures the final third: Mara scrapes away crystalline dust, her nails catch on organic matter, she uncovers the tin box. The action is dramatized on the page and delivers the story's closure. However, the exhumation is signaled late (after coffee-ground divination) and follows a straight line without complication. Removing "exhume" and replacing with "uncover" or "retrieve" would require only minor edits. Strong beat involvement but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Coffee grounds are introduced early (Mara pours cold coffee, watches grounds swirl), the method is signaled ("grounds swirling into configurations that her intuition read as coordinates"), and it directly shapes her tactics by pointing to the junction. However, the mechanics are vague—"rules older than physics" and "intuition read as coordinates" hand-wave rather than specify. The divination could swap for tea leaves or salt scatter without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The salt crystal growing chamber appears in the opening line, drives spatial choreography (ribcage formation, gravity-neutral hollow, junction of three spires), and provides the vault logic that explains memory storage. The setting is indispensable: "the chamber's function as a vault for forgotten things" and "repository of absence that ached to be exhumed" tie directly to closure. The chamber pressures Mara's descent and charges the final image. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The whale's beaching is signaled early ("three days prior") and its death opens the fissure, enabling the plot. The subsonic dirge guides Mara deeper, and the barnacle-etched tin box links the whale to the memory vault. However, the timeframe itself—post-beaching—does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. Mara descends at her own pace with no urgency tied to the whale's decomposition or tide return. The whale is causal but the "after" frame is passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire to find where deleted memories go is stated early ("years wondering where deleted memories went") and drives every beat: she explores the fissure, reads coffee grounds, exhumes the site, and recovers her sister's wildflowers. The motivation is woven through action rather than told-only. However, no friction or competing want complicates the search—Mara never doubts, hesitates, or sacrifices another goal. The desire shapes the plot but lacks internal conflict or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" recurs across the story: "navigated the gleaming silence of the crystalline cathedral," "willing to read patterns and dig through gleaming silence," and the final line. The tone is coherent, modulating from curiosity to urgency as Mara exhumes, and charges the closure image. The phrase integrates with the chamber's sensory logic (crystalline reflections, subsonic whale-hum below hearing). Strong lyric reprise that reweights the stake.</comment>
