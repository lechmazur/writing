<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is articulated clearly and her methodical approach shapes choices, but the piece delivers more portraiture than dramatic contradiction under pressure. Her fifteen-year expertise is told rather than tested by an on-page dilemma that forces competing impulses to clash. The final choice to leave the map torn is consistent but arrives without visible forfeiture; the prior beats demonstrate competence and care without forced tradeoff. Internal conflict remains conceptual rather than embodied in simultaneous competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors promptly (who, occupation, object by opening lines). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: density increases through archival investigation, film comparison, excavation, and chapel discovery, culminating in a decision to preserve silence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she leaves the map torn, foreclosing completeness to honor wonder—and the cost (choosing incompletion over mastery) is legible in the final image. Escalation reads as deepening understanding rather than narrowing options, which fits the lens, though the final renunciation could carry sharper tension if prior beats had established a professional or client pressure to complete the restoration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Settings are vivid and varied: studio magnification, rain-scoured vault with limestone and vellum scent, turf-covered henge at dawn, acoustic chapel. The fresco vault's moisture-worn plaster and the chapel's drip-echo acoustics ground pivotal discoveries. The torn map at specific coordinates and the limestone lintel constrain her path and charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional focus (fiber cuts under magnification, shadow shifts in footage). Minor: the henge itself remains slightly generic in visual texture compared to the vault and chapel.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interpret encoded secrecy with empathy—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through investigation (tear/notation, archival film, subsidence clue, excavation, chapel discovery) and tightens when she must choose how to document the space. The final choice (leave the map torn, preserve silence) forecloses professional completion with felt cost. However, no external antagonist or resource constraint tests her resolve; the escalation is intellectual discovery rather than forced tradeoff. One deepening suffices for this length and lens, but higher bands typically require a more visceral price or competing obligation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—boundaries between known and unknown, the integrity of silence, wonder as worthy incompletion—emerges organically from the torn map, the surveyor's encoding, and the chapel's acoustic design. The final image (map left torn, empty spaces validated) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through "damage as message," the surveyor's trust in future restorers, and acoustics carrying breath across distances. The penultimate line ("completion sometimes requires acknowledging the validity of empty spaces") edges close to thematic summary but the final sentence grounds it in the map's physical state, preserving ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("energized her senses") to wider observational framing. Diction fits a scholarly restorer: "errors of ink and errors of truth," "fibers had been cut rather than ripped," "subsidence." Syntax reflects her methodical mind with balanced, clause-rich constructions. Compression in late beats ("water dripped...shielded openness") shifts cadence effectively. Minor: a few constructions read slightly elevated for peak moments ("those who feared persecution," "complacent in their guardianship"), and "shielded openness" as descriptor feels abstract rather than sensory-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear, rhythmically varied, and information-dense. Sentence openings shift; figurative language ("jagged canyon," "perfume that energized") sharpens moments without overwhelming. No loops or scaffolding clutter. Minor deductions: "the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" (final phrase is conceptually redundant), and a few abstract nominalizations under pressure ("the validity of empty spaces," "integrity of wonder") slightly dull immediacy. The penultimate paragraph's stacked abstractions ("absence itself became prayer and quietude became communion") risk purple haze but remain legible. Overall momentum is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—encoded damage in a restored map revealing hidden coordinates, silent film comparison exposing subsidence, acoustic chapel designed for contemplative silence—synthesizes archival detective work with thematic resonance in a non-obvious way. The surveyor's trust that only restorers would notice the deliberate tear is a fresh angle. Elara's final choice to leave the map torn transforms the restoration-story template into a meditation on incompletion as integrity. Risk-taking (foregrounding process over confrontation, quiet closure) elevates the piece. Minor: the "whispered chapel" motif and medieval sanctuary erasure lean on familiar mystic-heritage tropes without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's choices (examine under magnification, research henge, locate film, compare footage, excavate, descend, document without disturbing, leave map torn) drive all major beats and the closure. Her perceptiveness enables each discovery. However, observation dominates over high-cost decision until the ending; earlier beats showcase skill rather than dilemma. The final renunciation (leaving the map torn) is causally earned but arrives late for higher integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The henge appears in map notation (tear at coordinates), archival film (two decades, shadow shift reveals subsidence), and on-page excavation/descent. It constrains her path (easternmost stone, depression, lintel) and enables the climactic discovery. The element evolves from abstract coordinates to physical site. Present in setup, middle investigation, and closure scene. Strong causal pressure and beat involvement; irreplaceability is high (coordinates, film evidence, physical access all hinge-specific).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispered chapel shapes stakes (her quest to interpret encoded secrecy), tactics (comparing footage to find subsidence, excavating the lintel, descending), and the closure image (documenting without disturbing its silence). Its acoustic design—carrying breath across distances, designed for contemplation—charges the thematic resolution. Present in title-embedded stakes, middle discovery, and final scene. The concept is indispensable; without it, the narrative lacks a payoff for the encoded coordinates and silence motif.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is told in the opening ("Methodically curious by nature") and demonstrated through her systematic investigation (magnification, research, archival search, frame-by-frame film comparison, careful excavation). It enables her success but does not visibly constrain or cost her; no moment shows curiosity forcing a tradeoff or error. Present early, functional across beats, but lacks on-page friction or price. Mid-range: enables action without dramatic cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Reopen" appears twice with high stakes: reopening the chamber (clearing depression, exposing lintel, descending) and the implicit choice to reopen investigation vs. seal knowledge. The action is the hinge between discovery and communion, transforming the quest from intellectual to experiential. Present in climactic beat and reflected in closure decision (she reopens but then preserves). Swapping for "enter" or "discover" would weaken the encoded-damage motif. Essential, late-positioned but transformative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Comparing silent footage from 1923 and 1958 is signaled mid-story, enacted on-page ("frame by frame on a vintage editor"), and delivers the key clue (shadow shift, subsidence). The method's mechanics matter: she notices what changes between recordings. It shapes her tactics (returns to henge at dawn with excavation intent) and is irreplaceable—no other investigative path is offered. Present in setup (locating canisters), middle (comparison), and implicitly in closure (the discovery it enabled). High causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault supplies archival resources (film canisters beneath ecclesiastical records) and atmosphere (limestone, decaying vellum scent energizes her). It enables the pivotal discovery but does not constrain later choice or return at closure. Present in one sustained beat; functional but not revisited. Micro-setting note: the vault's moisture exposing hidden documents enriches texture, yet the setting itself is swappable with any archive without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase "at the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" describes a spatial/conceptual threshold, not a temporal constraint. No live clock or deadline pressures Elara's investigation. The piece spans "weeks" of research and "an hour" of chapel stillness, but time does not tighten tactics. Present as metaphor and thematic echo, absent as escalation device. Ornamental use; does not shape on-page decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Her motivation—"to interpret silence with empathy, to hear what the muteness of the stones was trying to communicate"—is articulated mid-story, dramatized through her patient chapel vigil ("sat motionless for an hour, allowing the silence to teach"), and governs her final choice (document without disturbing, leave map torn). Desire conflicts subtly with professional norms (complete restoration vs. preserve mystery). Present across beats, shapes closure, though the friction could be sharper if a client or institutional expectation were on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is named once in the chapel scene ("echoing with a shielded openness that felt both vulnerable and fortified") and implicitly reflected in the ending (torn map as protected invitation). Tone modulates from scholarly precision to contemplative reverence. The phrase charges the chapel moment but does not recur or anchor earlier beats. Functional in closure vicinity, yet the tonal concept is under-integrated across the arc; earlier investigation reads neutral-professional rather than paradoxically open/shielded.</comment>
