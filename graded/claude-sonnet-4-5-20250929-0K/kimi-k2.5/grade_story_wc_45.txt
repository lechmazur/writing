<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's arc from "forgiving skeptic" to someone who "forgave us both for being wrong" shows clear trajectory, and her micro-choices (kneeling, bone-setting, giving the tooth) carry embodied weight. However, her motivation to "turn mistakes into constellations" feels asserted rather than dramatized through prior conflict—the metaphor arrives as a label. The changeling's "shrewdly innocent" trait is told more than shown in contradictory action, and Elena's expertise in both medicine and faerie lore reads convenient. Internal contradiction is present in her shift from rigid rationalism to magical midwife, but the transition lacks visible struggle or cost that would deepen the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when within the opening sentence, and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered imagery (tooth, effigy, garden, constellation) toward a final reconfiguration where both girls are restored and Elena becomes "something stitched together from old wounds." The closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration—Elena's stance crystallizes, and the final image of dawn transforming thorns into gold reweights the prior material. Cost is legible but oblique: Elena's former certainty is gone, her isolation ended, yet the girls' amnesia and the garden's orbital persistence suggest ongoing stakes. One causal hiccup: the real Miller girl's location is revealed by the changeling's whisper rather than earned discovery, and the "tooth knows" mechanism feels late-introduced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret garden, hedge maze constellation, and yew tree are vivid and purposeful, grounding the magical frame with iron-and-lilac scent and impossible rose geometries. The tooth pulses "like a star," and the birch bark/silver wire splinting integrate faerie materiality into the medical act. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (maze → garden → bench → fountain → roots), though the fountain's sudden appearance and the girl "beneath the roots" create minor spatial fog. The garden's "orbital" quality and constellation-shaped maze constrain the closure image, lifting this into the high-7 range.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mending the fracture between taken and remaining—is signaled early and shapes Elena's choices: she kneels, sets bone, offers the tooth as compass. The bone-setting scene provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options (the changeling must trust her, the real girl must be found), and the final act of "knitting the child back into the world" pays off with visible cost (the girls' memory loss, Elena's transformation). However, the changeling's instant cooperation and the convenient reveal of the real girl's location via the tooth reduce earned escalation. Agency is present but the path feels guided rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness, doubt-into-mercy, and mistakes-as-constellations emerges organically from Elena's arc and the garden's structure without overt moralizing. The tooth and constellation motifs recur with shifting weight: first as evidence, then compass, finally as part of a teaching moment for the changeling. The final image—dawn transforming thorns to gold, bone and tooth and garden forming "a constellation of mercy"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to integrate the monstrous and the lost. One slip: "monsters could become midwives" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward stated theme rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elena with a controlled, literary register ("cracked her rationalism like a dropped porcelain doll," "nostalgic innovation of scents"). Perceptual signature is present—Elena filters the garden through her scientific and now-magical lens—and the prose modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during the bone-setting). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the changeling's "Will it hurt?" and Elena's "Only if you fight it" carry subtext and advance plot. Two weaknesses: the phrase "shrewdly innocent" is repeated verbatim, and some diction ("cleft in certainty," "stitched together from old wounds") leans toward lyric ornament that slightly dulls immediacy. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs—and the prose avoids loops or scaffolding. However, figurative language crowds several high-pressure beats: "cracked her rationalism like a dropped porcelain doll," "impossible geometries," "nostalgic innovation," "mistakes into constellations," "stitched together from old wounds" cluster densely without breathing room, triggering the overwriting check (−0.4). Additionally, "shrewdly innocent" appears three times with identical phrasing, a paraphrase-loop artifact (−0.2). The bone-setting beat is concrete and clear, lifting the score back into the high-6 range, but the final paragraph's stacked metaphors (tooth, bone, garden, constellation, thorns-into-gold) blur rather than sharpen the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise—a doctor mending both a changeling and the human child, using a baby tooth as compass and bone-setting as bridge between worlds—offers a fresh synthesis of fairy-tale tropes and medical realism. The garden as "orbital" space and the hedge maze shaped like a constellation are specific, non-obvious details that feel inevitable in hindsight. Elena's arc from skeptic to "forgiving skeptic" who forgives "us both for being wrong" avoids the tidy redemption arc. The changeling-as-learner and the girls' shared amnesia add complexity. One limitation: the "mistakes into constellations" metaphor, while striking, trends toward abstraction and could benefit from more grounded embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena as "forgiving skeptic" is established in the opening sentence, drives her choice to mend rather than destroy the changeling, and culminates in her declaration "I forgive us both for being wrong" before handing over the tooth. Her skepticism-into-mercy arc shapes the middle bone-setting beat and the final restoration of the real girl. The character is present across all three gates (setup, middle choice, closure participation) and her specific trait—forgiveness paired with doubt—constrains her tactics (she kneels, uses silver and birch, speaks gently). Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.4. Minor friction: her expertise in both medicine and faerie lore reads slightly convenient, reducing irreplaceability (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The baby tooth is introduced in the third sentence ("clutched the changeling's baby tooth in her pocket"), pulses "like a star" during the bone-setting, is handed to the changeling with the instruction "this will guide you like Polaris," and the changeling whispers "the tooth knows" before leading to the real girl. It reappears in the penultimate paragraph ("holding her own tooth") and the final line as part of the constellation-of-mercy motif. The object constrains Elena's tactics (she must trust its guidance) and charges the closure image. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.6. One friction: the "tooth knows" mechanism is asserted late rather than taught (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is named in the second sentence ("creating a cleft in certainty that allowed strange new lights to seep through"), explicitly revisited in the antepenultimate paragraph ("The cleft in certainty had become a door"), and underlies Elena's entire arc from rigid rationalism to openness. It shapes her tactics—she approaches the changeling without hostility, uses both science and faerie tools—and charges the final transformation. However, the concept is more thematic echo than stake-driver; it does not narrow options on the page or create a visible trade-off. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, thematic resonance at closure +0.7. Frictions: late mid-story development (−0.3), ornamental second mention (−0.4), swappable with "doubt" or "openness" (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is applied to the changeling's face three times verbatim ("her eyes shrewdly innocent—too knowing for a child's face, yet pleading," "her shrewdly innocent face crumpling") and describes her dual nature. The trait is present in setup and at the emotional turn when she reveals the real girl's location, but it is told rather than shown through contradictory action—no on-page moment where cunning and vulnerability clash in a choice. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, thematic link +0.3. Frictions: label-only without dramatized cost (−0.7), paraphrase loop (−0.3), late middle development (−0.2). Cap at 6.9 for missing dramatized tradeoff; final score reflects integration as descriptor rather than driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Yearn" is introduced early ("She had yearned for this moment since finding the hollow girl") and tied to Elena's desire to mend rather than destroy. It motivates her journey into the garden and her gentle approach to the changeling, and the final line's "constellation of mercy that would guide other skeptical hearts" echoes that yearning transformed into legacy. The action shapes one key turn (the choice to heal rather than expel) and colors the closure. Early signal +0.6, one key beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, cost connection +0.3. Frictions: past-tense summary ("had yearned") rather than live present pressure (−0.4), swappable with "hoped" or "desired" (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Bone setting" is signaled early ("opening her leather kit of bone setting tools"), executed in the central beat where Elena works "the radius back into place, feeling the unnatural give of faerie cartilage," and reprised at closure when she "set to work again...knitting the child back into the world." The method constrains Elena's approach (she must use silver wire and birch bark, adapt to faerie biology), provides tactile specificity ("unnatural give"), and the final metaphor "bone would remember" charges the ending. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7. One friction: the mechanics of setting the real girl's bone are summarized rather than shown (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "secret garden hidden behind the hedge maze" is reached in the fourth sentence, provides the spatial anchor for all action (bench, yew, fountain, roots), and its constellation-shaped maze and "orbital" nature charge the closure image ("the garden...forming a constellation of mercy"). The setting constrains choice—Elena must navigate the maze, the changeling waits at the bench, the real girl is hidden beneath roots—and the impossible rose geometries and iron-and-lilac scent create atmospheric pressure. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.6. Minor friction: the fountain's sudden appearance mid-scene (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the substitute body was found beneath the floorboards" anchors the temporal frame in the opening sentence, and the story unfolds in one continuous moonlit scene ending at "dawn broke over the hedge maze." The timeframe shapes urgency (the girls are lost now, action is immediate) and the moon-to-dawn arc subtly underscores transformation. However, elapsed time within the scene is not tracked, and no on-page clock tightens decisions. Early signal +0.8, closure participation (dawn image) +0.8, thematic resonance +0.4. Frictions: vague internal duration (−0.4), time does not narrow options (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is named mid-story ("Elena understood that her motivation to turn mistakes into constellations was not about erasing error but mapping it") and echoed in the final paragraph ("forming a constellation of mercy"). It drives Elena's choice to mend the changeling rather than destroy her and to use the tooth as guide. The motivation is told as abstract insight rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page moment where Elena weighs a competing desire or pays a price for this choice. Setup (mid-story) +0.3, one key beat +0.4, closure linkage +1.0. Frictions: late first appearance (−0.4), label-only without friction (−0.7), swappable with "redemption" (−0.5). Cap at 6.9 for missing dramatized conflict; final reflects thematic participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" appears once as "a nostalgic innovation of scents that transported her to her grandmother's greenhouse while remaining terrifyingly alien," perfectly capturing the story's fusion of familiar (grandmother, greenhouse) and uncanny (faerie garden). The tone is coherent across beats—Elena's reflective-yet-practical voice, the lyric diction balanced with concrete action, the bittersweet ending where memory is lost but mercy endures—and modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during bone-setting). The dawn-into-gold final image charges the nostalgic-innovation frame. Early signal +0.6, tonal coherence across beats +1.2, closure charge +1.4, irreplaceability +0.5. Friction: single explicit mention risks ornamental use (−0.3); however, the tone permeates implicitly, mitigating the penalty.</comment>
