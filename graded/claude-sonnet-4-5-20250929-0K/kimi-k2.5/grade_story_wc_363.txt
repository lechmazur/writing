<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear and intensifies toward the ending (weaving herself into the message), but her interior life reads as abstracted rather than embodied—grief operates at arm's length through metaphor rather than contradictory impulse. The final sacrifice (becoming transparent, dissolving into the tapestry) arrives without visible micro-choices that narrow options; the shift from "hardening into something translucent" to full dissolution lacks dramatized hesitation or trade-off. Interiority leans heavily on poetic declaration ("wistful nature hardening into something translucent and terrible") rather than specific, character-particular thought under pressure. The daughter's disappearance thirty winters ago functions as backstory primer but does not tilt a present choice on the page until the very end.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered imagery (amber beads, puzzle edges, blood, tears) toward a final reconfiguration where Maya dissolves into the weave. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she sacrifices herself to send the message), and the cost is legible in the transparency/dissolution image. However, causality between beats is often elided—how the puzzle edges function as shuttles, why blood and tears supply "adhesion" and "salt to fix the dye," and what "raveling silence" mechanically does are asserted rather than demonstrated. The orientation anchor (who, where, when) arrives piecemeal across the first third; by ~120 words we know "Maya," "orchard," and "seven decades," but the inciting puzzle-box discovery occurs later, delaying narrative traction. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the final unraveling of self), satisfying minimum scope, but the elided mechanics and diffuse opening reduce confidence that every prior image earns the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposeful: bamboo forest with "silver needles" of light, skeletal apple trees, dead leaves stirred into a cyclone. The loom, amber beads, and puzzle edges function as micro-setting objects that constrain Maya's work (she must recommence seven times; her blood provides adhesion). The orchard's decay mirrors the unraveling silence and charges the final image when Maya becomes transparent within it. However, spatial choreography inside the cottage is vague—where the loom sits relative to the puzzle box, how the beads are stored and selected—and the rummage sale intrusion (a village sale in a "forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest") jars plausibility without explanation. The body as micro-setting (bleeding fingers, trembling grasp) does constrain her weaving and supports the 9+ gate, but the unexplained village sale and thin interior geography prevent full integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sending a message to her lost daughter—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through repeated failures (recommencing seven times), bodily cost (bleeding fingers, tears), and the escalating demand to unravel herself. The final tightening (she must become the thread) forecloses the option of survival and delivers visible cost in the transparency/dissolution image. However, the escalation reads as declarative rather than dramatized: "she realized the latent sacrifice" tells us the price without showing Maya's hesitation or a micro-choice that accepts it. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present, but the lack of a dramatized decision point—Maya never weighs staying alive against sending the message—reduces the felt friction. The puzzle edges "refusing to bind" until blood is offered asserts mechanical resistance rather than protagonist agency driving the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete imagery—amber beads holding frozen sound, puzzle edges forming a labyrinth, weaving as sacrificial act—without overt moralizing. The final image (bead suspended in air, carrying the message) reweights prior material, offering a non-literal answer to "Can love bridge impossible distance?" The motif of raveling/unraveling silence recurs with shifting meaning, and the mother's sacrifice to reach her daughter lands with emotional weight. However, phrases like "the cosmos" in the penultimate paragraph and "love's delayed reply" in the final line edge toward thematic echo rather than pure implication. The piece resists tidy resolution (we do not see the daughter receive the message), honoring ambiguity, but the language occasionally elevates into abstraction ("the universe's hem," "dimensions touched and bled") that dilutes specificity. The core question is legible and the ending resonant, but the final lines risk stating theme rather than embodying it solely through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: elevated, lyrical diction ("wistful," "stoically sparkling," "raveling silence") with purposeful archaism ("dwelt alone," "thirty winters past") that suits a fable-like register. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, anchored to Maya's perception throughout; no head-hopping. Rhythmic variety supports emotional peaks: the final paragraph's short declaratives ("She smiled as her body grew transparent") accelerate after long, layered sentences earlier. However, the prose leans heavily on stock poetic constructions—"the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" recurs verbatim, "stoically sparkling" becomes a refrain, and phrases like "beautiful as glass under pressure" echo familiar lyric templates. Compression is purposeful (we skip years in a single sentence: "Days blurred into years"), but some elisions (how the message reaches the daughter) rely on atmosphere rather than earned inference. The voice is consistent and legible, with no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats, but the reliance on elevated stock imagery prevents full originality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across the piece: long, hypotactic sentences in the setup give way to shorter, more decisive lines at closure. Information density is high—most sentences layer image, action, and thematic weight—but clarity occasionally suffers from metaphoric overloading: "raveling silence that had begun to knit itself closed around her, sealing her within the pattern" stacks three simultaneous metaphors (raveling, knitting, sealing) without clear physical referent. The phrase "stoically sparkling" recurs four times, and "the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" appears twice verbatim, creating minor scaffold loops. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence runs appear, and syntax is varied. Grammar and tense are clean. However, elevated diction ("terrifyingly full of threads coming loose, unraveling from the universe's hem") occasionally drifts into abstraction that dulls concreteness, and the final paragraph's "her sacrifice complete yet invisible to any eye but the cosmos" edges toward telling. The prose propels without major stumbles, but the metaphoric density and stock lyric phrasing in peak beats (the ending) prevent entry to the high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of loom-weaving, amber beads, jigsaw-puzzle edges, and maternal grief is specific enough to avoid outright template plotting, and the image of weaving oneself into a message offers a fresh angle on the "message to the dead" trope. The bamboo-forest orchard, the puzzle-box at a rummage sale, and the mechanics of blood-and-tears binding show inventive particulars. However, the core emotional arc—mother sacrifices self to reach lost child—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through lived occupational detail (the loom-work is atmospheric rather than procedurally grounded) or non-obvious moral calculus (Maya's choice is noble and complete; no friction complicates it). The "raveling silence" concept and the puzzle-edge method are introduced but not mechanically explored, leaving them as evocative labels rather than rules with consequences. The ending's transparency/dissolution echoes countless lyric fade-outs. The voice and imagery are memorable, but the premise does not surprise in hindsight, and the sacrifice plays out as expected once the price is named. Within-band: no bold structural risk elevates stakes beyond the lyric mode's conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's choices drive key turns: she purchases the puzzle box (inciting), selects the amber bead, begins weaving, recommences seven times, and ultimately decides to unravel herself into the final weft. The final dissolution is a decisive act that alters outcome (the message can now travel). She is present in every beat and her motivation shapes all tactics. However, the pivotal realization—"she realized the latent sacrifice"—is told rather than shown as a choice under pressure; we do not see her weigh staying alive against sending the message. The character is essential and active, but the lack of dramatized hesitation at the crucial turn (accepting self-erasure) keeps the score below 7.0. She is indispensable to the plot, but her agency at closure reads as inevitable declaration rather than contested decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The amber bead appears in setup (selected from seven decades of collection), development (refusing to weep, holding the daughter's laughter, absorbing blood and tears), and closure (suspended in air, carrying the message). It is handled concretely (she selects it, weaves it into the cloth, watches it lift) and its meaning evolves: from passive vessel of trapped sound to active carrier requiring sacrifice. The bead's "stoically sparkling" refusal to weep directly pressures Maya's tactics (she must add her own blood and tears). Its suspension in the final image charges closure. Removing it would collapse the story's mechanism. The element passes all three gates with strong causal and closure linkage, justifying high-7 to low-8 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "raveling silence" is named repeatedly and thematically central: it swallowed Maya's daughter, surrounds her work, and finally closes around her. It shapes the dominant stake (bridging the gap her daughter vanished into) and appears in the ending ("dissolved into the raveling silence"). However, its mechanics remain abstract—what it is, how it operates, why puzzle edges can navigate it—are asserted, not dramatized. It does not constrain a specific on-page choice (Maya's tactics are driven by the loom and bead, not by testing or learning the silence's rules). The concept frames atmosphere and motivation but does not alter tactics beat-to-beat; it functions more as thematic backdrop than active pressure. Present across all three gates but underdeveloped as a causal agent, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Stoically sparkling" is applied to the amber bead four times as a descriptor. The bead's refusal to weep (stoic quality) is mentioned once as pressure—Maya must supply her own tears—but this link is thin and told rather than shown affecting a choice. The sparkling is purely visual atmosphere; it does not enable or constrain action. The attribute is present and consistent, but it operates as recurring label rather than trait with mechanical consequence. It does not drive a turn or shape the ending image beyond decoration. Functional but replaceable; swapping "stoically sparkling" for another evocative adjective would not alter plot or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Recommence" is specified as happening seven times, anchoring Maya's perseverance and the physical cost (bleeding, trembling). The repeated failures and restarts establish escalating pressure and bodily sacrifice, directly supporting the final turn (she must give herself entirely). The action is named in mid-story and its repetition drives the middle development, leading to the realization that blood and self-unraveling are required. It shapes at least two beats (the failed attempts and the final success) and contributes causally to closure. However, the exact moment of each recommencement is summarized rather than dramatized, and the action could be replaced with "retry" or "attempt again" without major structural loss. Strong involvement, but not fully indispensable in its exact form.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The jigsaw-puzzle edges are introduced in the inciting beat (autumn morning discovery), used as shuttles in the weaving (clicking against warp threads), and locked into place in the ending ("last jigsaw puzzle edge locked into place, forming a complete border around the amber bead"). They are signaled early, constrain Maya's method (she must use these specific edges, not ordinary thread), and their completion triggers the final lift/flight. However, the mechanics—how edges without center pieces form a "labyrinthine channel" for sound to travel sideways through time—are poetic assertion rather than rule-based logic. The method is present across all three gates and causally active, but its exact properties are vague enough that another esoteric puzzle-like object could substitute with minor rewording. Solid integration with some swappability; mid-to-upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest" is named in the opening, provides the loom's location ("beneath the skeletal apple trees"), and supplies sensory detail (rotting fruit, dead leaves, silver-needle sunlight, bamboo swaying). The orchard's decay mirrors the unraveling theme and the final cyclone of leaves charges the closure image. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice—Maya could weave anywhere—and the puzzle-box discovery at a village rummage sale contradicts the "forgotten" isolation without explanation. The setting is atmospheric and thematically resonant, but it does not alter tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome. Present in setup and ending, minimal middle development, thematic charge but low causal pressure. Upper-5 to mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" recurs as a framing phrase and "days blurred into years" compresses elapsed time, but no live clock or deadline pressures Maya's choices. She works for an unspecified duration without time-driven urgency; the timeframe is atmospheric rather than a constraint that narrows options. The phrase appears in setup and development, contributing to tone, but it does not tighten decisions or shape the ending's timing. Functional thematic accent, not a causal driver. Present but ornamental, mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation—to carry a message to her vanished daughter—is stated early, drives every action (collecting beads, purchasing the box, weaving, sacrificing herself), and the ending delivers on it (the bead carries the message toward "a distant, listening heart"). The desire is dramatized through her sustained effort, bodily cost, and final self-unraveling. However, the motivation is never conflicted; Maya never hesitates or weighs competing wants. The friction between wanting to send the message and the cost of doing so is told ("she realized the latent sacrifice") rather than shown as a contested choice. The motivation is indispensable and present across all beats, but the lack of on-page internal friction keeps it from the highest band. Strong integration with one gap in dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Latent sacrifice" as tone is coherent throughout: the opening's solitary collecting, the wistful descriptor, the incremental physical cost (bleeding, tears), the progressive self-erasure, and the final transparency all build toward and embody sacrifice. The tone modulates appropriately—quiet accumulation in the first half, intensifying cost in the weaving section, serene acceptance at closure. The final image (smiling as she becomes transparent) charges the sacrificial tone without melodrama. However, "latent" implies hidden or not-yet-revealed, and the sacrifice is increasingly overt from the midpoint onward; the label fits early beats better than late ones. The tone is unified and purposeful, supporting closure, but the "latent" qualifier becomes less apt as the piece proceeds. Solid integration with minor conceptual drift in the label's exact fit.</comment>
