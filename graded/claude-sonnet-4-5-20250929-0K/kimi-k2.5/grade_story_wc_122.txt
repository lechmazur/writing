<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is richly layered—her numbness as "wearing gloves made of stone against her own soul" embodies emotional state without therapy-speak. The climactic moment where she touches the needle and "her heart began to keep time" shows contradictory impulses (terror and longing) acting simultaneously. However, the transformation from three months of silence to tears feels compressed; the micro-choices that shift her stance (placing hands on drum, touching needle) read more as passive receptivity than agency-driven decisions. The final realization is earned by the scene's causality but borders on epiphany convenience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image reweights her prior refusal to feel with the recognition that "she had carried [sound] within her all along." Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening sentence. The backward-song mechanism deepens pressure in one meaningful turn when she feels "the filament of hush...as tension between what had sounded and what would sound." Cost is legible: she must abandon her protective numbness to teach again. The lens holds without contradiction, though the single-scene accumulation offers minimal causal tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cavern's acoustic properties—"thick rock and hanging tapestries that swallowed every sharp sound"—directly enable the closure by creating the mirrored, backward-folding sound. The drum skin and phonograph are handled tactilely across multiple beats, constraining Elara's perception. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, back chamber, horn positioned above drum). The autumn wind signal and "faint rustle of turning seasons" recur to frame the moment but remain decorative. The broken needle's physical state (broken tip "should have rendered it useless") charges the final touch without invoking symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Can Elara find a way to teach/feel music again? The stake is signaled early and tightens when the backward songs "reveal an architecture of anticipation" that she can perceive through touch. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes her numbness was "a refusal to feel vibrations...below the threshold of panic and pain." The final image shows her learning "the courage to let the world's quietest frequencies enthrall her shattered heart," foreclosing her prior withdrawal with felt cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens is adequate but not urgent; pressure accumulates more through revelation than protagonist-driven tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: silence as texture, the backward ballad teaching that "endings could precede beginnings," and the cavern's mirrored acoustics revealing "fullness of sound she had carried within." The broken needle recurs with shifted meaning at closure. No overt moralizing; the final image ("waiting to be touched, waiting to be released") answers the central question without stating a thesis. The "filament of hush" risks symbolic convenience but ties to the drum maker's concrete demonstration. Minor slip: "where silence itself became a frequency that could be felt rather than heard" borders on prompt-echo phrasing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong—Elara reads lips "with the precision of someone who had known her since childhood," and tactile focus dominates. Mathew's single line of dialogue feels voice-appropriate. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak pressure: "audibly muted chamber exploded against her palms in waves she could finally perceive as distinct syllables of pressure" uses abstractions ("syllables of pressure") that dilute immediacy. Free indirect style is clean, but syntactic patterns repeat: multiple sentences open with "She" + past-tense verb across the second half.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high, and figurative language is purposeful in most beats. However, the piece exhibits template cadence in the final third: "She felt...She understood...She reached...Elara reached" creates stem-repetition. Mixed metaphor: "drum skin...beneath the phonograph's horn" and "needle dropped into the groove" imply the needle contacts the cylinder record, not the drum, creating spatial confusion at the closure mechanism. "Filament of hush" is invoked multiple times without evolving pressure. The phrase "audibly muted" is repeated as both an attribute and a descriptor without variation, edging toward synonym loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The backward-recorded-song mechanism offers a fresh angle on tactile perception of music, and the drum maker's modified phonograph grounds the premise in craft. The emotional truth—that numbness is "a kind of deafness too"—avoids generic grief templates. However, the core premise (teacher loses sense, finds new way to teach) follows a familiar arc. The "filament of hush" concept risks abstract symbolic convenience; its properties are asserted more than discovered through scene work. Transformation test: the plot and arc would function with substituted sensory loss and medium, suggesting the synthesis is not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in setup, drives the middle choice (placing hands on drum), and her final touch of the needle reweights the ending. Her deafness shapes perception throughout and forecloses auditory teaching with visible cost. However, her key decisions (moving deeper, placing hands, touching needle) read more as receptive compliance than active turns that narrow options. The transformation is earned by Mathew's demonstration rather than her own tactical shifts, capping score below 7.0 despite strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The broken phonograph needle appears early on the workbench ("gleaming like a sliver of captured starlight"), returns in the mechanism ("despite its broken tip that should have rendered it useless"), and Elara touches it at closure, feeling "microscopic vibrations travel up her arm." Three distinct beats; the broken state matters (it "should have" failed but doesn't, mirroring Elara's transformation). The needle's physical contact at the ending charges the final image. Scores solidly in the 7.0–8.4 band for beat involvement and closure linkage, though it does not drive causal pressure as forcefully as required for ≥8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "filament of hush" is signaled in setup via Mathew's note, reappears when Elara feels it "as the tension between what had sounded and what would sound," and the cavern's "mirrored hush" recurs at closure. The concept shapes her realization that silence has texture, altering her stance from numbness to feeling. Two gates (setup, payoff) plus thematic reweighting allow ~6.0 range. However, the filament's mechanics remain abstract; it is described and felt but does not constrain a concrete choice or enable a tactical shift, limiting score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" describes the cavern's acoustics in setup ("audibly muted by the thick rock and hanging tapestries") and returns at the climax ("audibly muted chamber exploded against her palms"). The trait enables the backward-mirroring effect essential to closure. Two beats, closure linkage, and causal enablement. However, "audibly muted" functions more as environmental description than a character attribute with visible tradeoff; the cost is Mathew's design choice, not Elara's constrained action. Scores in the 6.1–6.9 range for functional involvement without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears at the major turn ("rhythms enthrall her, capturing her attention so completely that tears began") and recurs at closure ("courage to let the world's quietest frequencies enthrall her shattered heart back into feeling"). The action drives her shift from numbness to emotional release and redefines her teaching path. Two beats, closure participation, and causal pressure. The verb's specificity (capturing attention completely) ties to the dominant stake. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for essential involvement across beats and ending, though swappable with "captivate" or "absorb" without major structural impact, preventing ≥8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are signaled in setup ("I've been recording the village choir backward"), enacted when Mathew engages the mechanism, and their effect ("reveal an architecture of anticipation...each note pulling back into its source") drives Elara's realization. The method shapes her middle choice (placing hands on drum) and the closure recognition that "endings could precede beginnings." Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. The reversal mechanic is specific and irreplaceable—forward songs would not create the "tension between what had sounded and what would sound." Scores in upper 7.0–8.4 band for strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is anchored in setup, its "peculiar acoustics, designed to mangle and mirror sound until it folded back upon itself" enable the closure effect, and the space recurs in the final image. The cavern's physical properties (thick rock, hanging tapestries, back chamber) supply the mirrored-hush environment essential to the backward-song demonstration. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. The setting is irreplaceable—another location could not produce this acoustic effect. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for essential involvement; slightly below 8.5 because the cavern enables rather than constrains Elara's choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"During the faint rustle of turning seasons" appears in the opening sentence and recurs in the penultimate sentence. The timeframe signals transition but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elara's three-month silence is backstory, and the on-page action unfolds in one continuous scene without time pressure. Two-gate lyric reprise (setup and closure) allows ~5.5–6.3 range, but the element lacks causal pressure or cost connection, capping it lower. The autumn wind is ornamental description rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is signaled early ("trapped in an emotional numbness that felt like wearing gloves made of stone"), drives her middle choice to engage with the drum and needle, and the closure shows her learning "the courage to let...frequencies enthrall her shattered heart back into feeling." The motivation is dramatized through her tears and physical responses, not merely told. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost (abandoning protective ice). Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for essential involvement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears in setup via Mathew's note about "a filament of hush," intensifies when the "audibly muted chamber" reveals silence's texture, and the final image explicitly invokes "the mirrored hush of the cavern." Tone is coherent through turns, modulating from initial numbness to cautious engagement to tearful release. The tone charges the final image by reweighting silence as fullness. Two-gate reprise plus closure participation allow ~6.0 range; the tone's modulation under pressure and thematic resonance lift it into the 6.1–6.9 band, though it does not constrain a concrete choice.</comment>
