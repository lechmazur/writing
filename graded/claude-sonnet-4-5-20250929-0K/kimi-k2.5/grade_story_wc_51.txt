<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara remains abstract throughout; we see no micro-choices under pressure, only allegorical labor described in ornate language. Her "boundary-lessly trapped" state is told but never dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final sequence (collecting weights, sitting with them) reads as ritual completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority consists almost entirely of metaphoric summary rather than embodied perception or goal-driven thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure unit is legible. The piece describes an annual cycle—snowmelt triggers collection, she completes her work at dawn—but no decisive change, earned stasis with foreclosed path, or conceptual repricing occurs. The ending ("dreamed in whalebone, skeletal songs") decorates the premise rather than reweighting it with visible cost. Orientation is delayed past 120 words (bronze grotto and starlight establish location, but who Elara is and what immediate problem she faces remain vague until paragraph four), triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, starlight aperture, and kerosene lamp establish vivid sensory anchors and the text maintains spatial coherence (loom, walls, northern aperture, floor). However, the setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging the closure image—Elara could perform this ritual anywhere with minor edits. The orientation penalty from Q2 applies here as the cap at 7.0, but the setting's passivity keeps the score lower within that band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to collect the weights of different burdens") is declared but never tested; no reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The text describes a ritual that proceeds without obstacle, friction, or cost—she lights the lamp, weaves, calcifies, collects, completes. The whalebone reverie and boundary-less recursion are thematic decorations, not pressures that force agency. No escalation under any lens; the final line restates the opening condition without alteration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A coherent theme (the artist as vessel for sorrow, form as escape from infinite recursion) emerges through imagery, but the piece repeatedly states rather than earns it: "she was both architect and prisoner," "the medium through which formlessness gained form." The final image (holding weights "like a rosary of human sorrow") is illustrative rather than resonant, echoing the premise without reweighting prior material. The whalebone reverie and shingled hush are evocative phrases but remain ornamental motifs rather than thematic crucibles.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The voice maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register and avoids head-hopping (single third-person limited throughout). However, the diction often drifts into abstract poeticism that obscures rather than sharpens perception: "skeletal and profound as a beached leviathan singing its death song," "the braille of accumulated human experience." Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; any lyric narrator could perceive this way. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she knew") stack without voice-motivated purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Severe density and loop issues pervade. Multiple paraphrase cycles: paragraphs 7 and 21 both declare Elara "boundary-lessly trapped"; paragraphs 13 and 19 rehearse the same collection-and-measurement action. Template cadence dominates with "She [verb]" openers across a dozen paragraphs. Metaphors pile without coherence: "shingled hush" (fish scales of silence), "whalebone reverie" (skeletal dreaming), "golden spirals" (galaxies of dust)—each vivid in isolation but stacked to the point of muddle. The Non-closure Accumulation Cap and artifact penalties apply: baseline −1.4 for pervasive loops and template stems, escalated to −1.7 because artifacts touch the closure beat ("dreamed in whalebone").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (a fractal weaver who literalizes metaphors by calcifying sorrows into measurable weights) offers initial freshness, but the execution leans on familiar "artist alone in a mystical workspace" templates. The ritual unfolds without surprise or friction; all moves are predictable from the setup. The ornate diction ("bronze grotto," "whalebone reverie") substitutes lyric surface for genuine synthesis of character, world, and stakes. No turn or inflection transforms the premise; the ending restates the opening condition in slightly varied language.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara performs ritualized tasks (lighting lamp, adjusting loom, weaving, collecting) but makes no on-page choices that alter tactics or foreclose paths. She is present throughout but functions as an observer of her own allegorical labor rather than an agent under pressure. Her decisions are procedural completions of an annual cycle, not reversals or renunciations with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner appears in three beats: lighting (paragraph 5), its steady flame anchoring her (paragraph 15), and extinguishing at dawn (paragraph 23). However, its function is atmospheric—providing light and shadow—rather than causal. It could be replaced by any light source with no structural impact. No evolving use or reweighted meaning at closure; it is simply turned off when the ritual completes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" appears in paragraphs 6 and 17 as evocative description of layered silence pressing against the grotto. It establishes tone but does not shape stakes, constrain choice, or alter tactics. The concept is present and memorable but remains ornamental; removing it would not break the story's logic or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is declared in paragraphs 1, 7, and 21 but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. It describes Elara's existential condition in abstract terms without dramatizing how infinite recursion limits her choices or forces tradeoffs. The attribute is thematic backdrop, not an active constraint that shapes the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Calcify" appears across multiple beats (paragraphs 8, 16, 18, 22) as the method by which Elara transforms abstract fractals into tangible weights. It defines her central action and is inseparable from the ritual she performs. However, the act proceeds without obstacle or cost; she simply completes the process as described. Major turns do not trace to this action because there are no turns—only procedural completion.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is specified in paragraphs 10 and 18: aligning the loom with the northern aperture and Polaris, marking cardinal points on the floor. The method is present and its mechanics detailed, but it does not shape prior attempts or test her skill under pressure. It is a step in the ritual rather than a contested means that alters options or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto under starlight is established early (paragraphs 2, 11) and provides a consistent physical frame: walls, roof fissures, northern aperture, floor markings. Starlight supplies the literal resource (illumination for weaving) and the grotto's isolation supports the annual ritual. However, the setting does not pressure choices or constrain tactics; it is a vivid stage rather than an active crucible. Modest participation in closure (the grotto exhales at dawn) reweights the space slightly but without decisive cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" frames the annual cycle (paragraph 3) and dawn marks completion (paragraph 23), but time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The ritual unfolds at the pace Elara chooses without external deadline or urgency. The timeframe is present and logically consistent but replaceable; the story could occur at any seasonal transition with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To collect the weights of different burdens" is declared as Elara's singular motivation (paragraph 4) and dramatized through weaving and gathering (paragraphs 12–13, 19–20, 24). However, the desire is never conflicted; no friction between want and cost appears on the page. She completes the task without obstacle, renunciation, or visible tradeoff. The motivation is told and illustrated but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" is named in paragraph 14 ("skeletal and profound as a beached leviathan singing its death song") and reprised in the final line ("Elara dreamed in whalebone"). The phrase establishes a distinct lyric tone—meditative, elegiac, dense with metaphor—that remains coherent across the text. However, tone does not modulate with pressure (there is no pressure arc) and the final reprise decorates rather than charges the closure image with new cost. The tone is stable and evocative but static.</comment>
