<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior motivation ("to cradle empathy in arms of steel") is established but tends toward stated values rather than embodied contradiction. The retrocognitive trap provides strong perceptual specificity and the augmented limbs create physical contradiction, yet the renaming decision feels more philosophical than pressured by competing impulses. Micro-choices (kneeling, tracing cracks, placing the tessera) demonstrate care but the final stance arrives without visible internal friction or foreclosed alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: retrocognitive fragments cohere into pattern, culminating in the renaming as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within 120 words. The closure reweights the plaza's meaning and Kael's relationship to trauma with conceptual cost (refusing sanitization, holding pain visible), though the price remains somewhat abstract rather than a visible forfeiture of options or relationships on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vitrified sand, shattered sky, dry fountain, and mosaic stepping stone are vividly rendered with sensory economy. The chipped mosaic constrains Kael's method and charges the final image when the tessera completes an unintended geometry. Spatial choreography (plaza, fountain, stepping stone, minaret site) remains legible and the retrocognitive layering creates temporal depth without confusion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: preventing sanitization by renaming with "aberrant mercy." Pressure accumulates through retrocognitive fragmentation toward the single meaningful tightening—the placement of the tessera and utterance of "Cradle." The council opposition is declared but not dramatized on the page, so the escalation relies on internal deepening rather than external contest. Cost is conceptual (Kael's solitary burden, refusing comfort) but the story does not show a visible trade-off or foreclosed relationship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of holding pain without crushing or erasing it emerges organically from Kael's actions and the mosaic repair metaphor. "Aberrant mercy" avoids thesis statement and is enacted through the renaming ritual. The final image—"wound and womb," "unbreakable arms without crushing"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, tracing) and the warm-coldness tone that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (retrocognitive layering, augmented-limb awareness, poetic register). Psychic distance stays controlled and voice modulates appropriately under emotional pressure. The elevated diction ("aberrant mercy," "tessera," "vitrified") is consistent and character-motivated, though some phrases trend abstract ("negative space," "catastrophe's mathematics") where concrete imagery would sharpen immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language (blue birds, wound/womb) charges key images without clutter. Minor scaffold appears in near-paraphrase adjacencies ("The shattered sky seemed to listen" follows conceptually from prior lines). Template cadence is avoided and information density is high. A few abstract constructions ("catastrophe's mathematics," "context of survival") dilute propulsion in mid-beats, though the closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of retrocognitive trap, augmented body, and mosaic repair as renaming ritual feels specific and non-obvious. "Aberrant mercy" as refusal to sanitize or monumentalize trauma offers a fresh moral calculus. The warm-coldness tone and the "Cradle" name transform familiar post-catastrophe material through particularity. Risk-taking in the non-confrontational structure and lyric pacing heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's choices (kneeling, tracing, placing tessera, speaking the name) drive all key turns. Setup anchors Kael immediately; development shows decision-making under retrocognitive pressure; payoff is the renaming itself. The gentle-radical stance shapes tactics (delicacy with augmented strength) and the closure image. High causal pressure and closure linkage with visible cost (solitary burden, refusal of council plan).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tessera appears in setup (carried in palm), development (alignment with stepping-stone gap), and payoff (completion of unintended geometry). It constrains method (must fit chipped pattern) and charges the final image by making the renaming "inevitable." Two distinct beats (carrying, placing) with closure linkage and specificity (blue lapis, chipped corner). Swapping for generic object would collapse the mosaic logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is stated early and frames Kael's motivation. It shapes the renaming decision (holding pain visible, draining poison) and constrains tactics (no concrete paving, no tourism memorial). Development shows the concept in action (kneeling, refusing sanitization) and payoff articulates it ("hold, not heal"). Causal pressure present but the concept trends more thematic than tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trap appears in setup and pressures Kael throughout (visions of artisan, screams, minaret falling in reverse). It constrains perception (forced layering of past/present) and enables the method (seeing the name in negative space). Development shows the trap tightening, payoff shows it loosening after the renaming. Visible cost (disorientation, sensory overload) alters choices and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Renaming is the story's spine: setup establishes need, development builds the method, payoff is the utterance of "Cradle." The act redefines the plaza's meaning and Kael's stance with undeniable cost (solitary declaration, rejection of council, acceptance of burden). Two beats (studying patterns, speaking name) plus closure. Removing this action collapses all narrative logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chipped mosaic patterns appear in setup (cracks as constellations), development (tracing fractures, seeing tessera gap), and payoff (alignment completes design). The method constrains how renaming occurs (not arbitrary, earned through geometry) and charges the final image. Mechanics matter: cracks intersect to create new meaning. Early signal and closure linkage with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Ancient plaza with vitrified sand, shattered sky, dry fountain, and mosaic stepping stone pressures choices (kneeling site, tessera placement) and supplies resources (chipped patterns as method). Micro-setting (stepping stone) constrains the renaming ritual and charges the closure image. Setup anchors space early, development uses geography tactically, payoff transforms the plaza's identity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the great fire" anchors context in setup and motivates the renaming need (council wants sanitization, Kael wants aberrant mercy). The timeframe shapes stakes (post-catastrophe recovery window) but does not tighten decisions on the page with a live clock. Development and payoff reference the fire's aftermath thematically but time does not alter tactics beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated early, dramatized in micro-choices (delicate kneeling despite augmented strength), and articulated at closure ("unbreakable arms without crushing"). The motivation drives the renaming decision and constrains method (gentle touch, no crushing). Two beats (kneeling, final stance) with friction between strength and tenderness visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is signaled early ("tone of warm coldness that made the air seem to pause") and charges the final image ("tenderness that did not comfort so much as endure"). Tone modulates with pressure (severity at renaming, gentleness at tessera placement) and remains coherent across turns. The paradoxical register supports the aberrant-mercy theme and reweights the closure without static mood.</comment>
