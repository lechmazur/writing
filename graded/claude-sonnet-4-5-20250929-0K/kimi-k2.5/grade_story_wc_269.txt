<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and her practice of tapping—an embodied habit that modulates with pressure—grounds her consistently. Her singular motivation (discovering why paths disappear) drives her assembly of data cores and final choice to transmit the atlas page. The revelation that "paths disappeared not when the coral died, but when the last navigator who remembered the living reef retired" is earned by her on-page cross-referencing and carries visible cost (releasing the witness artifact). Minimal direct internal conflict; her stance deepens rather than contradicts itself, which limits the band ceiling slightly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elena, station, post-ban Pacific) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory memory (2043 bleaching), the atlas page fragment, data assembly, and tapping rhythm build density toward the insight that navigation requires living memory. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the atlas page shifts from personal keepsake to "record of witness"—and the transmission forecloses her private holding of it with felt cost. One meaningful deepening (data gaps crystallize the social-forgetting thesis) tightens options and charges the final image. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The converted oil rig / monitoring station, titanium console, crystalline drives, and Pacific setting are vivid and selective. The station "creaked," "moored yet drifting," and the tide's "periodically eternal motion" all constrain Elena's solitary watch and pressure her final transmission choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects her observer's lens (chemical signatures, acidity readings, the gray dawn). The atlas page's "edges soft with salt and age" functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Spatial choreography and prop-state tracking are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and sustains pressure throughout. The data-core assembly and cross-referencing narrow options: the delayed revelation crystallizes "not in the data, but in the gaps between the data." The transmission of the atlas page to Manila is Elena's agency at closure, foreclosing her private witness role with visible cost (she stops tapping, folds the page, releases it). One meaningful tightening via the bleaching-as-beginning insight reweights prior material. No explicit antagonist, but the "indifferent rhythm" of the tide and institutional forgetting supply coherent external pressure under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—living memory as navigation, witness as record—emerges from the coral bleaching, the atlas fragment, and the timing of social forgetting without overt statement. The final image (folding the page, addressing it to Manila, resuming slower tapping) offers a non-literal answer to "why some paths disappear" with undeniable conceptual cost: Elena relinquishes private mourning for collective archive. The recurring tapping rhythm and "periodically eternal tide" motifs reweight across beats and charge the closure. Reflection passages anchor concretely (torn atlas page, data cores) and tilt present stance; no thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: Elena notices chemical signatures, tide rhythm, console vibration—an observer's lens. Diction ("zooxanthellae," "fossil economy," "institutional knowledge") fits her scientific background without academic bloat. No dialogue; interior voice is consistent and purposeful. The prose modulates with pressure: fast staccato tapping during cross-reference, stillness at revelation, slower cadence at closure. Purposeful compression ("turning from rainbow to bone in the span of a month") and reflection interleaved with present micro-choices (slotting drives, folding the page) maintain voice control under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance setting, memory, or revelation. Minor paraphrase loop: "periodically eternal" appears in two adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.2). The "fossil fuel ban" framing and "delayed revelation" phrasing echo prompt language but remain dramatized rather than summarized. No figurative muddle; metaphors (coral cathedrals, silent collective gasp) are coherent. Proofreading is clean; pronoun references unambiguous. One scaffold phrase ("the atlas page had come from...") slightly dulls momentum mid-paragraph but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The post-ban monitoring station, atlas fragment as witness record, and social-forgetting thesis combine familiar climate-crisis and memory-loss tropes into a specific synthesis. The delayed-revelation frame (gaps in data rather than data itself) and the conversion from extraction rig to monitoring post offer fresh angles. Emotional specificity (Elena's decade-long inability to discard the page) grounds the premise. The transformation test holds: swapping names or locale would require rewriting core stakes. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines. Some risk in the reflective density and lyric pacing, but the closure effect remains legible under the Accumulative lens without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena (coral bleaching witness) drives the data assembly, cross-referencing, and transmission choice. Setup: first paragraph establishes her 2043 observation. Development: memory of the bleaching informs her search through archive gaps. Payoff: the revelation that bleaching was a beginning, not endpoint, shapes her decision to send the atlas page to Manila. Causal pressure across three beats; irreplaceable (her witness status anchors the stakes). Cost: releasing private artifact. Two positives (causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2) from mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Atlas page torn out appears in setup (beside instruments, edges soft with salt), development (recalled origin from grandfather's maritime service), and payoff (folded, placed in transmission chute). Reweighted meaning: from personal keepsake to "record of witness." Handles across three beats; charged reprise at closure. Causal pressure: her inability to discard it for fifteen years frames the stakes. Cost: transmission forecloses private holding. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, cost +0.4 from mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Delayed revelation (core concept) shapes stakes throughout: Elena seeks "why some paths disappear"; the answer crystallizes "not in the data, but in the gaps." Setup: "motivation remained singular" signals the question early. Development: cross-referencing dates and shipping logs dramatizes the search. Payoff: "delayed revelation crystallized" and "the disappearance of the path was gradual, a social forgetting" redefine options and charge the transmission choice. Causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7, cost +0.5 from mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Periodically eternal (attribute of the tide) appears in setup ("the beat echoed the periodic pulse of the tide, that periodically eternal motion") and payoff ("periodically eternal tide would continue its indifferent rhythm"; "eternal and periodic, carrying the memory"). Label-only in first use; minor causal work (tide as indifferent backdrop pressures Elena's solitary witness stance). Closure participation: final image invokes it. Two gates (setup, payoff); lyric reprise reweights slightly. Early signal +0.4, closure linkage +0.6, minus ornamental first use −0.5 and swappability −0.4 from mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Assemble (action: "began to assemble the data cores") drives the middle beat: slotting crystalline drives, cross-referencing dates. Setup: signaled early as her method. Development: the assembly action enables the revelation (gaps between data). Payoff: assembly leads to transmission choice. Causal pressure: without data-core work, no insight. Two beats involved; irreplaceable mechanics. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9 from mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms on surfaces (method) appears in setup ("practice of tapping rhythms...developed during long watches"), development ("tapping grew faster, a staccato...cross-referenced"), and payoff ("Elena stopped tapping...resumed her tapping, slower now, matching the cadence of the rising tide"). Early signal; modulates with pressure (faster during search, stops at revelation, slower at closure). Embodied habit that tracks emotional state. Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, but limited causal pressure (−0.6: tapping does not enable or constrain the core choice) from mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sea level monitoring station (setting) pressures choices throughout: solitary environment (no interruption), archive access (data cores), transmission chute (enables final act). Setup: first paragraph anchors the converted rig. Development: "station creaked around her, anchored to the seafloor but drifting" mirrors her stance. Payoff: "transmission chute, addressed to...Manila" is the tool of closure. Causal pressure +1.3, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, irreplaceability +0.6, early signal +0.6 from mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>After the fossil fuel ban (timeframe): "twenty years after the global fossil fuel ban" anchors setting and frames the delayed-grief thesis ("The fossil fuel ban had stopped the burning, but the revelation...arrived on its own schedule"). Setup: early signal. Payoff: final paragraph invokes it to close thematic frame. Two gates; limited development (time does not tighten mid-scene decisions). Lyric reprise reweights slightly. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, minus no middle constraint (−0.4) and swappability (another post-crisis marker could substitute, −0.5) from mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To discover why some paths disappear (motivation) is stated early ("Her motivation remained singular") and dramatized throughout: data assembly, cross-referencing, the revelation, and transmission choice all pursue this question. Setup: explicit signal. Development: cross-referencing shipping lanes and bleaching events enacts the search. Payoff: the answer (social forgetting) and the transmission act fulfill and foreclose the quest. Causal pressure +1.4, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, cost (releasing artifact) +0.5, early signal +0.6 from mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Drifting moored (tone) appears as explicit phrase ("moored yet drifting") and governs rhythm: the station is anchored but temporally suspended; Elena is fixed in place but shifting in understanding. Setup: implied early through station description. Development: "moored yet drifting, a witness suspended between the old world and the new silence" crystallizes midpoint. Payoff: "slower now, matching the cadence of the rising tide" embodies the tone at closure. Coherent modulation (faster tapping → stillness → slower cadence). Two beats; charges final image. Early signal +0.4, closure linkage +1.0, coherent modulation +0.8, two beats +0.9 from mid-band.</comment>
