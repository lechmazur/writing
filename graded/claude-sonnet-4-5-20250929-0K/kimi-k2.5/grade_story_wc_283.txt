<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present but her interiority reads as abstract label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The prophetic crisis never forces a genuine internal conflict—she moves smoothly from fear to action without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her final transformation ("no longer merely a keeper of time, but a seamstress of what might yet be") is declared rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal cost. The therapeutic self-awareness ("quietly inspired by the knowledge") flattens what should be a moment of lived tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past the 120-word mark: "amber warehouse beneath cliffs" and "hourglass turner" are provided, but the spatial and temporal frame stays atmospheric rather than anchored. The closure unit—shattered jar, dissolved prophecy, upward-falling sand—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is asserted ("shimmering motes of raw possibility") rather than felt as a foreclosed path or visible price. Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates images (buttons, echo, amber dust) but their causal linkage to the prophetic reversal is stated, not dramatized through narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, canyon echo jar, and button collection supply vivid sensory anchors and constrain Elara's method (cataloging by resonance). The final image—cliffs shifting geometry, warehouse glowing—charges the closure by reweighting the physical space from threat to threshold. However, spatial choreography remains impressionistic (where exactly are the drawers, workbench, floor spiral?) and the micro-setting (buttons, jar) does more work than the macro-setting (cliffs, warehouse), which stays mostly atmospheric.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prevent cliff collapse/transform prophecy) is signaled early but never tested by a credible complication or reversal. Elara's tactic—cataloging buttons to unscramble the prophecy—proceeds without friction; no attempt fails, no cost is paid mid-stream, no choice forecloses an option. The climax (jar shatters, prophecy dissolves) reads as given rather than earned by protagonist agency. Accumulative lens allows for density and cadence shift, but here the intensification is declared ("truth unravels," "final hourglass") rather than dramatized through narrowing moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (prophecy as knot, endings as unfastened buttons) emerges through image and action rather than overt statement, and the canyon echo's role as "last harmonic" supports the conceptual throughline. Yet the final articulation ("endings are merely buttons that have not yet found their corresponding holes") edges toward platitude, and the thematic question (can fate be reshaped?) resolves too tidily without counter-pressure or cost. The "seamstress of what might yet be" metaphor adds a fresh inflection but arrives as summary rather than earned synthesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara, but psychic distance wobbles: "truth unravels" and "shared wisdom flowed" oscillate between her perceptual register and an elevated narratorial voice. Diction is lyric and consistent, yet the prose converges on a single elevated cadence ("harmonic of the canyon's original song," "unearthed silence of potential") that reads more like atmospheric assertion than character-specific perception. Elara's internal voice lacks idiosyncrasy—her way of noticing is poetic but generic, not shaped by seventeen years among resin vaults.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>High figurative density pervades every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff: "fossilized time pooled in golden strata," "hourglass turner," "canyon echo," "narrative threads encoded in ivory, brass, and wood" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Template-cadence runs appear ("She worked…," "She was quietly inspired…," "She had succeeded…") and paraphrase loops recur ("shared wisdom of the buttons" appears three times with minor variation). The Text Artifact Screen triggers penalties: synonym churn (truth unravels × 2, shared wisdom × 3), elevated register drift (unearthed silence, raw possibility), and stock metaphor strings (amber dust, shimmering motes) reduce propulsion and clarity. Final third artifacts disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The amber-warehouse setting, canyon-echo object, and button-cataloging method offer a fresh synthesis, and the premise (hourglass turner reshapes prophecy through lost-object resonance) avoids obvious templates. Yet the emotional arc and thematic resolution (transform fate into possibility) follow a familiar path without non-obvious complication or moral calculus. The piece commits to its lyric premise but retreats from risk by delivering a tidy liberation rather than an ambiguous cost. Specificity in world-building (resin vaults, amber strata) elevates the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elara, the hourglass turner, is present throughout and performs the key action (cataloging buttons, placing the echo, turning the final hourglass). However, her choices are not tested by on-page friction or reversal; she decides to act and succeeds without dramatized cost. Setup and closure gates met; middle development is assertion rather than choice under pressure. Swappable with another "wise custodian" archetype with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The canyon echo in the jar appears early (setup gate), is handled at the climax (Elara places it in the button mandala, jar shatters), and its frequency (last harmonic, reshape reality) matters causally. Closure gate met: the echo's release dissolves the prophecy. Yet the mechanism—how the echo's vibration interacts with button resonance—is told rather than shown, and the cost of releasing it (what is lost when the last harmonic expands?) is not legible. Two beats (workbench, mandala center) with closure linkage, but causal pressure is middling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Shared wisdom is introduced via the buttons ("accumulated experience of weavers, warriors, and midwives") and recurs in the final beat ("shared wisdom of the buttons had taught her"). Setup and closure gates met. However, the concept shapes the tactic (cataloging by resonance) in summary rather than altering a live choice on the page. The wisdom's content—what specific insight shifts Elara's approach—is never dramatized. Functional but replaceable with "collective memory" or "ancestral knowledge."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" appears twice as a descriptive label ("was quietly inspired by the way the buttons seemed to yearn," "quietly inspired by the knowledge") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Setup gate met (early mention); middle and closure gates are label-only without dramatized friction. Swappable with "calmly resolute" or "gently certain."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unscramble" appears as both verb (unscramble the prophecy) and gerund (working to unscramble the fixed pattern). Setup gate met (early signal: "needed to unscramble the prophecy"). The action drives the middle beat (she arranges buttons) and the closure (prophecy dissolves into "raw possibility"). However, the mechanics of unscrambling—how button arrangement alters the amber-dust spiral—are told in metaphor rather than shown through a turn that narrows options. Two beats with closure linkage, but causal specificity is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method—cataloging lost buttons—is signaled early ("by cataloging lost buttons according to their resonance") and used in the middle beat (she sorts them). Setup and development gates met. The method's mechanics (how resonance sorting accesses wisdom) are asserted rather than shown, and the cataloging itself is summarized ("she worked as the truth unravels"). Closure gate marginal: the button mandala is present but the act of cataloging does not reappear. One clear beat with setup signal; swappable with "arranging" or "reading" buttons.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is present throughout, frames expectation (cliffs threaten collapse), and reappears transformed at closure (becomes a lantern, cliffs shift geometry). Setup, development, and closure gates met. The setting pressures the dominant stake (burial of stored memory) and supplies the resource (amber dust prophecy on the floor). Spatial choreography is impressionistic but the setting's symbolic weight—threat to threshold—charges the final image with clear cost (the prophesied collapse is averted by reshaping the cliffs' geometry).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" appears twice as a timeframe marker but does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions. Setup gate met (early phrase). The prophecy's deadline (winter solstice) is mentioned but never shown approaching; no on-page ticking countdown alters tactics. Closure gate marginal: the phrase recurs but the ending's temporal pressure is asserted ("final hourglass") rather than dramatized. Swappable with "while she works" or "in the moment."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to spin a prophecy into raw possibility—is stated explicitly in the penultimate beat ("She had succeeded in her motivation") and echoed in the opening ("truth unravels… prophecies she'd feared were immutable"). Setup and closure gates met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted on-page choices; Elara's fear of the prophecy and her hope for transformation are asserted but not shown in friction (no moment where she hesitates, doubts the method, or pays a visible price for attempting the transformation). One beat with closure linkage, but causal pressure and cost legibility are weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tone—unearthed silence—is seeded early ("half-light," "canyon echo vibrated") and returns at the climax ("the jar shattered—not with sound, but with the unearthed silence that follows when a held breath is finally released"). Setup and closure gates met. The tone modulates with pressure (quiet accumulation → shatter-without-sound → glowing lantern) and charges the final image by reweighting silence from suppression to potential. Coherence is strong, but the tonal shift is stated ("unearthed silence of potential") rather than embodied in changed rhythm or diction at the line level.</comment>
