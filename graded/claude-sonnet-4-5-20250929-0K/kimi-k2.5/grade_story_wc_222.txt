<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is declared ("chivalrous thief," "apprentice of wonder") but never tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The exchange with the guardian proceeds without internal friction or cost-laden micro-choices; he simply executes a plan we never see him doubt. Interiority relies on stock fantasy register ("sacred playfulness," "cautious abandon") rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final "no longer a thief but a keeper of renewed wonder" is an unearned epiphany that replaces character struggle with authorial assertion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when are signaled early enough. Drive lens reads as causal-symbolic hybrid, but the exchange lacks true escalation—each chess piece simply unlocks the next with no tightening. The closure claims amendment and sky-healing, yet no on-page cost is visible: Kael descends triumphant, the guardian dissolves "freed," and the world below waits "open-armed." The ending asserts transformation without showing what Kael forfeited or risked losing. Cost-proof test fails; apply −0.6 in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The icebound spire, violet glaciers, and bleeding aurora are vivid and establish strong atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent (crampons, parapet, altar). The pocket sundial lid and chess pieces function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual exchange. However, the setting does not pressure a meaningful choice—the spire is backdrop to an uncontested exchange. For 9+, environment must constrain a choice or charge the final image; here it illustrates rather than pressures, capping the band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (amend the broken treaty), but the guardian immediately cooperates, eliminating opposition. The chess-piece exchange is a sequence without reversal or tightening; each piece corrects a lie without cost or friction. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. The resolution is delivered by ritual completion rather than protagonist agency under pressure. Escalation and visible cost are absent; the story declares stakes but never tests them on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of "sacred playfulness" and "approaching magic with reverence that dances" is stated repeatedly in authorial voice rather than emerging from scene particulars. The final image asserts restored sky and amended hearts but offers no resonant non-literal answer—it explains the moral rather than embodying it. Chess pieces as vessels of truth are functional but not transformed by the action. Thematic echo in the final paragraph ("sacred playfulness of one who had restored the sky") triggers −0.6 in Q5 for explicit thesis statement replacing scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Kael. Diction is consistent but elevated to a fantasy register that borders on ornamental ("apprentice of wonder," "reverence that danced"). Dialogue is minimal; the guardian's single exchange is functional. Perceptual signature is weak—Kael's noticing is generic epic-quest observation rather than character-specific bias. Register drift into stock fantasy phrases ("student of awe," "cosmic game") appears in peak beats, applying −0.4 in Q6. No head-hopping, but voice lacks distinct texture beyond genre default.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "bleeding aurora when the sky is wrong," "constellations had shifted into impossible geometries," "sacredly playful...reverence that danced rather than genuflected." Mixed metaphors (sky "cracked like porcelain" then "bled away") and template cadence runs ("He withdrew...This lid was...it marked him") accumulate. Paraphrase loops: "not merely stealing back history, but using the sacred method to amend it" restates the prior beat without added pressure. Scaffold density in final third ("no longer a thief but a keeper," "vast and unknown and open-armed") dulls closure. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for density, coherence, and loop issues; artifacts touch closure, disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The core premise—correcting history via ritual chess exchange with a crystal guardian—synthesizes familiar tropes (chosen-one quest, magical artifact, broken treaty) without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The chivalrous-thief framing and "apprentice of wonder" label feel template-derived. Emotional arc (thief → keeper) is declared rather than earned through specific contradiction. The story commits to its premise but does not inflect it with fresh particulars; removal of proper nouns would leave a generic restoration quest. Derivative Premise Guardrail: apply −0.8 in Q8 for template reliance without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes decisions (ascends, reveals chess pieces, places them), but his choices do not create key turns—the guardian cooperates, and the ritual proceeds without friction. Observation and execution dominate; no on-page choice alters tactics or narrows options under pressure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The pocket sundial lid appears in three beats: withdrawal (setup), warming and alignment during the exchange (middle), and ticking forward at closure (payoff). All three gates are met. However, its function is largely symbolic—it marks Kael as an apprentice and aligns with the sun, but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress. It charges the closure image by ticking forward toward hope, earning lyric-resonance credit. Causal pressure is minimal; it validates rather than complicates. Score ~5.2 for purposeful reprise without decisive constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" is stated twice as a label but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. Kael's approach is cooperative ritual, not a test of wonder-apprenticeship. The concept is ornamental, a thematic claim without causal work. Present but does not alter options or choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" and "cautious abandon" are invoked as labels and restated in the final paragraph, but no on-page action demonstrates a trade-off between reverence and play or caution and risk. The exchange is reverent but not playful in execution; the descent is described as "cautious abandon" without showing how caution constrained or enabled the leap. Label-only mention without visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Amend" is signaled early (setup), drives the middle exchange (development), and the closure declares amendment complete (payoff). All three gates met. The action shapes two beats: revealing the chess pieces and executing the exchange. However, it is swappable—"restore," "heal," "reconcile" could replace it with minor edits. Causal pressure is moderate; it defines the ritual's purpose but does not uniquely constrain tactics. Score ~6.1 for solid three-gate integration with modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (reveals thirty-two hand-carved chess pieces), executed across multiple beats (white king, black queen, rook, bishop, pawns, black king), and shapes the closure (final piece triggers sky-healing). All three gates met. The method is specific and matters—each piece's secret corrects a lie. However, the exchange proceeds without friction; the mechanics do not create escalation or narrow options. Causal pressure is moderate; the method is purposeful but not stress-tested. Score ~6.8 for strong beat involvement and closure linkage with modest constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The icebound spire is introduced early (setup), supplies the altar and parapet for the exchange (development), and melts/changes at closure (payoff). All three gates met. It provides vivid atmosphere and spatial grounding but does not constrain a choice—the exchange could occur in any ritual space. The melting at closure reweights the environment symbolically. Score ~5.9 for strong presence across beats with minimal tactical constraint, lifted by closure transformation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" is invoked in the opening and resolved at closure (wrong sky cracks, proper blue revealed), meeting setup and payoff gates. However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics in the middle—the timeframe is atmospheric rather than a live clock. The sky's wrongness is backdrop, not pressure. Functional lyric reprise but replaceable; no urgency shaped by temporal constraint. Missing middle-development gate caps at 3.4, but lyric reprise lifts slightly to ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To embrace the unknown with open arms" is stated once in dialogue and echoed in the final paragraph ("the world waited...open-armed"). The desire is declared but never dramatized through conflicted choice or friction. Kael executes a known ritual without on-page struggle between want and cost. Functional lyric bookend but told-only, no middle friction. Score ~3.6 for ornamental presence with minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" is invoked twice (approach to guardian, descent) and modulates slightly with context, but the tone remains uniformly elevated-fantasy throughout. No coherent tension between caution and abandon charges the final image—the descent is described as trusting but reads declarative. Tone is present and consistent but does not deepen under pressure or reweight the stake. Functional but static; score ~4.3 for label-level presence without tonal escalation.</comment>
