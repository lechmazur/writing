<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her goal-directed actions (singing to invert harmonics, adjusting pitch based on ice cracks) show purposeful agency under pressure. However, interiority relies heavily on exposition about what she "knew" and "understood" rather than embodied contradiction or flawed micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final renunciation—remaining to tend the silence—reads as earned endurance with cost (useless maps, permanent vigil), but the journey lacks visceral struggle or mistakes that would elevate the characterization into high bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens where density builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Mara must remain to sustain the silence, her maps now obsolete). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—she is bound to this vigil, her former tools rendered useless—and the lens holds. One tightening occurs when she realizes she must conjure the bloom herself rather than wait for it, narrowing options and raising stakes. The cost is legible in "her ripple-mark maps now useless" and "knowing that the quiet would hold as long as she remained to tend it," a foreclosed path with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The harmonic caves constrain Mara's choices throughout: stalactites hum in D-minor, the Cathedral Chamber's acoustics enable the bloom, and the frozen pool's crack patterns serve as a living meter for pressure feedback. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (bioluminescent algae glow, trapped-bees vibration in the stone), and the echo chamber stone's calcium layers and porous surface directly enable the climactic act. The micro-setting (echo chamber stone, frozen pool) charges the final image where the ice cracks seal in new patterns, recording the victory. Environment, body/tool (stone as catalyst), and recurring object (ice cracks) all constrain on-page action and shape the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conjuring silence to counter the energy beings' chaos—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes passive waiting won't work; she must actively conjure the bloom, narrowing her options. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (matching cave resonance, dampening harmonics, adjusting pitch via ice-crack feedback) under the Accumulative lens, building density toward a decisive moment. The cost is legible: she is now bound to tend the silence indefinitely, her prior mapkeeping tools obsolete, a visible forfeiture that alters her future. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the price charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particulars of sound/silence opposition and the "hammered repose" concept—peace as crafted artifact rather than absence. The bloom of hush as "not empty...a hammered repose, forged through Mara's will" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "the precise geometry of silence" and "null-song" lean toward abstraction, and the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("promised the storm could be weathered through patience") rather than trusting the image alone. The ice cracks sealing in new patterns provide a strong non-literal closure image, but the piece occasionally tells its theme rather than fully embodying it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature filtering the world through acoustic and geological metaphors ("trapped bees," "ink in water," "beaten copper"). Psychic distance remains controlled, and the narrative certainty matches Mara's expertise. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("psychic shrieking," "null-song," "hammered repose") that reads more authorial than character-specific under peak stress, and some figurative phrasing feels ornamental rather than voice-urgent. The prose reflects Mara's specialist lens but could tighten the syntactic texture to better embody her mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance character or atmosphere, but several paraphrase loops appear: "energy beings" described three times in the opening, "gently luminous" repeated for the stone, and "examining crack patterns in ice" stated twice in adjacent beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle section with parallel "She [verb]" constructions across multiple sentences. Figurative language is dense (trapped bees, ink in water, beaten copper, hammered repose) but mostly coherent; "bloom of hush" as spreading sphere works, though "null-song" and "hammered repose" edge toward mixed metaphor. Baseline scaffold penalty (−0.6) for paraphrase and template runs; no additional line-level opacity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic mapkeeping, geological resonance chambers, and silence-as-forged-artifact offers a fresh angle on "magic user restores balance" templates. The ripple-mark maps and ice-crack feedback provide specific, non-obvious methods grounded in the world's acoustic logic. However, the core dramatic arc—specialist finds solution in specialized location using specialized knowledge—follows a familiar expert-competence template without meaningful friction or cost that emerges from character limits. The "hammered repose" concept and the reversal (waiting → active conjuring) are inventive, but the execution doesn't fully transform the underlying structure into something that feels inevitable only in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara as ripple-mark mapkeeper appears in the opening, her occupation frames her goal and methods (tracing ripple-marks, reading interference patterns), she makes the key turn when realizing she must conjure rather than wait, and her final state (maps now useless, bound to tend the silence) ties directly to her specialist identity. The character drives two major beats (the realization turn, the conjuring climax) and the closure's cost is inextricable from her role. Early signal, middle choice constraint, closure participation all present with causal pressure and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears early ("Cathedral Chamber: a massive echo chamber stone"), is handled and examined (Mara places palms against it, feels vibrations, uses it as catalyst), drives the climactic conjuring beat where it "absorbed her intent, its glow intensifying," and remains present in the final image where "its light now steady and calm, a beacon in the dark." The stone's specific properties (calcium layers storing whispers, porous surface, bioluminescent algae) enable the bloom and constrain Mara's method. Three gates met, high irreplaceability, closure linkage strong, visible cost tied to its use (she must remain near it to sustain the effect).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The bloom of hush is the central goal signaled early ("searching for the convergence point where the harmonics might conjure the legendary bloom of hush"), drives Mara's realization that she must actively conjure it, defines the climactic action ("the bloom of hush began to manifest"), and shapes the ending where the silence expands and must be tended. The concept constrains tactics (requiring precise inverse frequencies, dampening specific harmonics) and the final cost (Mara bound to maintain it). Three gates met, causal pressure across multiple beats, closure participation direct, visible cost linked to the concept's demands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" appears twice describing the echo chamber stone's bioluminescent algae glow, provides atmospheric detail that reinforces the stone's aliveness, and the final image notes "its light now steady and calm." The trait enables visibility in the dark cave and marks the stone's state change (intensifying during conjuring, steady at closure), but the luminosity itself doesn't constrain a choice or impose cost—Mara would perform the same actions regardless of whether the stone glowed. Present in setup and closure with atmospheric purpose but lacks mechanical necessity; lyric reprise with modest causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Conjure" is signaled early as the method Mara seeks, becomes explicit when she realizes "she would have to conjure it herself," drives the entire climactic sequence where she matches the cave's resonance to generate inverse frequencies, and defines the closure where the conjured silence must be actively sustained. The action is irreplaceable—passive waiting or discovery would fundamentally alter the story's logic and Mara's agency. Three gates met, high causal pressure, closure participation direct, visible cost (ongoing effort required), and the action redefines the bloom from natural phenomenon to willed artifact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is introduced early as diagnostic skill, used twice in key beats (Mara reads fractures "like runes" to understand acoustic shifts, then adjusts pitch "whenever the fractures...shifted"), and the final image notes ice cracks sealing in new patterns that record the victory. The method constrains her approach (she needs the ice feedback to calibrate pressure) and shapes her tactics during conjuring. Three gates met, beats involvement across setup/middle/closure, causal function clear, though the mechanics could be more granular to reach highest bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The harmonic caves frame the entire story from the opening line, provide essential resources (stalactites humming in D-minor, underground rivers as percussion, Cathedral Chamber's acoustics), constrain Mara's choices (she must descend, seek the convergence point, use the cave's natural resonance), and enable the climactic conjuring through their specific acoustic properties. The setting's "natural symphony" and shifting frequencies drive the problem and the solution. Three gates met, multiple beats of causal involvement, closure directly enabled by the cave environment, high irreplaceability (the story's logic would collapse without this exact setting).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrived" establishes the inciting situation and motivates Mara's quest, appears in the opening beat to frame urgency, and the ending notes "for the first time in months, the surface world knew a moment of stillness." However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions during the cave sequence—there's no live clock pressuring Mara's actions, no sense that delay costs anything specific. Present in setup and mentioned at closure, provides context, but doesn't function as active constraint on tactics. Two gates (setup, closure mention) but lacks middle development as pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the quiet in the storm" is signaled immediately ("seeking the quiet in the storm"), drives every choice Mara makes (descending into caves, searching for convergence point, conjuring the bloom), and the closure crystallizes around achieving and sustaining that quiet. The desire faces friction in the realization that waiting won't suffice—she must actively create what she seeks—and the cost is her permanent commitment to maintain it. Three gates met, causal pressure across all major beats, closure participation direct, visible cost (foreclosed freedom) tied to the motivation's fulfillment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The phrase "hammered repose" appears once in the climactic beat to define the silence as "forged through Mara's will...a crafted peace that had weight and texture like beaten copper," then the ending sustains the tone with "steady and calm" light and Mara finally resting. The tone integrates craft/forge imagery throughout (the silence as artifact, the convergence as work) and modulates from urgency to earned stillness. The concept charges the final image and coheres across beats, though the explicit naming of the tone mid-story reads slightly prescriptive. Strong setup and closure participation with purposeful tonal arc, minor explanatory intrusion keeps it from highest bands.</comment>
