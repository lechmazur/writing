<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is given clear motivation (guilt, helplessness transformed through shadow integration) and the arc moves from suppressed violence to acceptance. Internal contradiction appears—pacifism hiding rage—and the embodied lightness motif tracks his emotional state. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract psychological concepts ("shadow work," "integration," "emotional density") rather than concrete micro-choices under pressure. The final act of stitching feels more symbolic ritual than a decision with visible tradeoff; we see the method but not genuine hesitation or cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. The piece teaches its method early (photographs, tears, crystal) and the closure—Elias passing through the seam—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes his integration and the release of humanity's shadow). Cost is conceptual and felt (he becomes weightless, the ship emptied), meeting CR standards. However, orientation debt applies: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words is present, but causality between beats is often elided or summarized ("decades of meditation," "he felt himself drifting") rather than shown in linked pressure moves. The stitching sequence at the end compresses multiple actions without clear escalation or reversal within the final beat itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The recycled hull, memory vault, photographs, and Kwan Yin's tear all constrain the action and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is strong: cold breath, weak starlight, shimmer of salt crystals, bioluminescent glow. The spaceship's artificial gravity responding to emotional density is a purposeful rule that enables the climax. Spatial choreography (floating toward vault, rising toward apex, membrane at the scar) remains legible throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension to integrate humanity's shadow—is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates pressure through Elias's reflection and the assembly of photographs, but on-page escalation is thin: no meaningful reversal or choice that narrows options in the stitching sequence itself. The final act (piercing the barrier) happens without resistance or visible tradeoff in the moment; agency reads more as enactment of a pre-determined ritual than a live decision under duress. Cost is present (he passes through, the ship empties) but is summarized rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—reconciling violence within pacifism, integrating shadow rather than banishing it—emerges concretely through the photographs, the crystal, and the stitching metaphor. The final image (passing through the seam, empty ship) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Some abstraction ("shadow work," "integration") edges toward therapy-speak, but the photographs' tear-stains and the needle-piercing action ground the concept in particulars. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the ending trusts image over statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable. Voice carries a lyric, meditative register with purposeful compression ("recycled cathedral of rust and regret," "ghostly resolve"). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated, matching the solitary, reflective narrator. However, perceptual signature is generic-philosophic rather than character-particular; Elias's way of noticing doesn't feel distinct from an omniscient essayist. Filter verbs ("He felt," "He understood") appear frequently and dull immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without teaching a pattern or varying cadence: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("recycled cathedral," "stitched together from corpses," "sapphire-bright crystal," "spectral patterns," "filament that mended the rift"). In peak beats (the stitching sequence), this becomes overwriting that slows momentum rather than propelling it. Paraphrase loops are present: "shadow work was not about banishing darkness, but stitching it to the light" is restated across multiple sentences. Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems. No major grammar or clarity breaks, but information density suffers from ornamental layering. Line-level artifacts in the closure sequence and elevated diction throughout disallow 9+ globally and trigger Q7 penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—lone survivor performing ritual shadow-work to unlock a dimension—feels derivative of familiar SF-mysticism templates (Solaris, contemplative posthuman tales) without a sharp transformative angle. Kwan Yin's tear and the tear-shimmer method add texture, but the emotional arc (isolation → acceptance → transcendence) follows a well-worn path. The "gravitationally lighter when happy" rule is a fresh inflection, but its on-page use is thin. The synthesis of pacifism, grief, and spacetime stitching is coherent but not surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his pacifism frames his motivation, but his steadfastness is told (decades of meditation, refusal of war) rather than tested on the page. No key turn results from a choice between pacifist principle and expedient violence; his shadow-work arc is internal and summarized. The stitching act is consistent with his character but does not create a reversal or decision with visible cost tied specifically to his pacifism.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear is introduced early, handled (warm in his palm), and used as the needle in the climactic stitching sequence. It appears in at least two distinct beats (carried toward the vault; used to pierce the barrier) and its compassion-imbued property shapes the method. The glow brightening with each piercing charges the final image. Specificity and closure linkage are strong, lifting it past functional into essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Shadow work is explicitly named and described: confronting violence within, integrating repressed trauma, weaving darkness into light. It shapes Elias's decades-long process and the stitching metaphor at closure. However, the concept is more thematic claim than on-page constraint; we see the result (acceptance, lightness) but not a dramatized choice where integrating shadow costs him something he wants in the moment. It reweights the premise but does not narrow options or create visible friction in a key beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Gravitationally lighter when happy" (more precisely, when at peace) is signaled midway and enacted twice: Elias drifts upward as guilt releases, then rises toward the apex. The trait enables his approach to the sealed dimension and is causally active in the climax. However, the mechanics are told ("ship's artificial gravity responding to emotional density") rather than discovered through action, and no on-page cost or tradeoff—e.g., loss of anchor, inability to manipulate objects—complicates his use of it. It reaches the "shapes one key turn" band but lacks the friction or visible price that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stitching is the core action of the climax: Elias uses Kwan Yin's tear as a needle, threads spectral light, pierces the barrier, and binds shadow to possibility. The action appears in setup (understanding shadow-work as stitching), development (positioning photographs), and payoff (the stitching sequence itself). It drives the closure and is irreplaceable; no other verb would carry the same thematic and mechanical weight. Two beats minimum, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shimmer of dried tears on photographs is introduced early as "a language of sorrow" and "the map," then returns as the spectral light Elias threads through the needle at closure. The method is signaled and its mechanics matter: the bioluminescent glow creates the code that reveals the seam. However, the how—why tears create a prismatic code visible only to integrated observers—is asserted rather than discovered or tested. It shapes two beats (observation, use) and charges the final image, placing it in the essential range without reaching indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The recycled spaceship is present throughout, supplies the memory vault and photographs, and its artificial gravity responds to Elias's emotional state, enabling his rise to the apex. The hull's "stitched together from corpses" detail echoes the stitching action thematically. Setting constrains movement and provides resources across beats, but the ship itself is more atmospheric container than active pressure; Elias's choices would play out similarly in any isolating posthuman habitat. It reaches the "shapes one key turn" lower bound via the gravity mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—seventy years after the last infant's death, with Elias as the lone survivor—anchors the story's elegiac tone and stakes (no future generations). However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page; the narrative is untimed, with "decades of meditation" summarized and the stitching sequence unfolding at lyric rather than urgent pace. The timeframe is functional context but does not shape a beat or escalate pressure. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elias's desire to open the locked dimension frames the plot and drives his movement through the ship. The motivation is explicitly tied to his need to integrate humanity's shadow and offer release rather than repetition. However, the desire is more thesis than lived friction; we do not see him tempted to abandon the attempt or forced to choose between opening the dimension and another want. The motivation is present in setup and payoff, shapes the arc, but lacks on-page conflict or cost that tests it. It sits at the purposeful reprise / single-turn boundary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Ghostly resolve" is introduced explicitly ("With ghostly resolve—that haunting determination of the last living thing—he began to stitch") and sustained through the ending: the meditative, inevitable quality of Elias's final act and the empty ship "now empty but for starlight." Tone modulates subtly from cold solitude to warm compassion to quiet release, coherent through turns. The label is slightly on-the-nose, but the mood charges the final image and remains consistent under pressure, lifting it past functional into the "essential across beats" lower range.</comment>
