<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is sustained and character-particular—her perceptual signature (fractured light at 6:47, sandbag tones) grounds her withdrawal from violence in concrete sensory detail. Internal contradiction is present (father's legacy vs. pacifist stance) but mostly told rather than dramatized in simultaneous conflict. The ceremonial blade ritual offers one micro-choice that forecloses violence with visible cost, but the renunciation feels predetermined rather than tested under live pressure. Embodied emotion is solid; no therapy-speak intrudes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when); the lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a pattern of refusal crystallizing across Maya's rituals. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the final image reweights the sandbags and her father's pistol through recursive pruning and the promise to persist tomorrow, forecloses the path of violence with visible cost (isolation, ongoing threat), and the lens holds without contradiction. One tightening occurs when the dome shudders and she does not flinch, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is legible in the line "proving peace could grow even in shadows" paired with the recurring exterior threat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass dome and sandbag scraps constrain Maya's choices throughout: they anchor life in sterile sand, filter her etched words to roots, and the dome's fractured glass sings pressure changes she tracks. Spatial choreography is clean (eastern quadrant, wall-mounted pistol). The micro-setting qualifies—body, blade, and recurring sandbags charge the final image when the sunset illuminates her engravings. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Maya's perceptual bias (twin suns, spiderweb cracks, half-tone shift). The setting is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: cultivate pacifist continuity amid collapse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dome shudders—Maya's refusal to flinch narrows options to sustained endurance rather than flight or violence. The sheathe-withdraw-prune ritual forecloses the father's legacy with visible cost (isolation, ongoing external threat). Agency is renunciation and attention; coincidence does not resolve. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens, and the cost—proved peace in shadows—lands on the page in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from sandbags repurposed from war-balloons to hydroponic beds, the father's unused pistol, and the blade retired from violence to pruning. No moralizing; the final image—"proving peace could grow even in shadows"—offers a resonant answer to continuity through chaos without stating a thesis. The engravings and the ceremonial ritual embody transformation of wreckage into witness. Subtext operates in silence, gesture (sheathe, prune, release), and the contrast between interior enclosure and exterior scavenger screams. Wisdom arises from concrete experience (surgeons in the tower's final days, ballast minerals) without platitudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices fractured light timing, sandbag notes, barometric shifts. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze"). No head-hopping. The prose registers climb occasionally into elevated metaphor ("continuity through chaos, thread by thread"), but the effect remains legible and anchored in Maya's sensory attention. Brief compression under the dome-shudder beat is acceptable. One minor slip: "engraved quiet" feels prompt-adjacent and slightly external to Maya's natural lexicon, but it does not break distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; no algorithmic patterning. Sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high (ballast origin, tower collapse, father's profession, surgical memory) without padding. Two minor frictions: "senselessly perceptive" and "tranquil blaze" appear multiple times in slightly decorative iterations, trending toward label loops. The phrase "engraved quiet" recurs without evolving mechanically, costing momentum. Otherwise clarity is strong, metaphors cohere (shed skin, spiderweb cracks, folded hands), and the final image propels without scaffolding. No grammar slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—airship war-ballast repurposed into pacifist hydroponic sustenance—is non-obvious and charged with visible irony (death from above now anchors life). The ceremonial blade ritual transforms the father's violence into surgical pruning with earned specificity. Maya's perceptual signature (6:47 light, half-tone glass) personalizes the post-collapse setting beyond generic wasteland. One friction: "engraved quiet" and "inculcating plants with values" read slightly prompt-templated, reducing full irreplaceability. The ending's commitment to proving peace in shadows takes a risk that heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her pacifist stance shapes every beat: she does not flinch at the impact, sheathes rather than wields the blade, and her final vow to weave chaos into compost drives closure. Her choices (prune, etch, persist) constrain options—she forecloses her father's legacy of pursuit. Two beats involve decision: the non-flinch and the ceremonial pruning. Closure participation is strong (final paragraph commitment). Cost is legible (isolation, external threat). Early signal, beat involvement ×2, causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost elevate the score. Minor friction: her observation dominates over dramatized conflict within scenes, slightly limiting peak pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap is handled across multiple beats: it lines the hydroponic beds, holds minerals from a hundred altitudes, Maya etches words into it, and the sunset illuminates the engravings in the final image. It is indispensable—removing it breaks the story's logic (water filtration, ballast origin, transformation from war to life). Early signal (first paragraph), beat involvement ×3+, causal pressure (enables plant growth), closure linkage (engravings visible at sunset), irreplaceability (specific war-balloon origin), and cost connection (father's legacy transformed) all present. No swappability; the exact history and material properties matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" appears in the opening third and returns at closure, reweighting the sandbag engravings and Maya's manifesto of refusal. It shapes stakes—her goal is to cultivate silence and inscribe truths into fabric—and the final image ("engraved quiet deepened," "manifesto of quiet") charges closure. Two beats involve the concept: carving truths and the final illuminated engravings. Early signal, closure linkage, and lyric reprise present. Frictions: mid-scene development is thin; the concept is more thematic echo than tactical constraint. It does not narrow options so much as color them. Still, the return reweights prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is introduced early as Maya's trait and constrains on-page action: she notices light at 6:47, sandbag notes, barometric shifts, and half-tone glass changes. It enables her refusal to flinch (she perceives the distant impact immediately) and her surgical pruning precision. Two beats: the non-flinch and the glass-touch perception. Early signal, beat involvement ×2, causal pressure (enables pruning, grounds endurance), and closure linkage (she is "senselessly perceptive because only absolute attention could detect fragile order"). Cost is oblique but present (hyper-vigilance as isolation). Minor friction: the phrase reads slightly label-heavy and recurs without evolving much.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Sheathe" drives the central ritual: Maya sheathes the blade into the leather scabbard, withdraws it to prune, then releases—each action an offering that forecloses violence. The ritual is dramatized on the page and redefines options (blade retired from flesh to gardening). Two beats: the described ritual and the thematic statement "tools could be retired from their original violence." Early signal (mid-story), beat involvement ×2, causal pressure (constrains her to pruning over combat), closure linkage (the ritual embodies her transformation), irreplaceability (the exact verb matters; "holster" would not carry the same resonance), and cost connection (she renounces her father's pistol). Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is signaled early ("speaking to the roots through the medium of repurposed ballast") and its mechanics appear: Maya etches truths into sandbag fabric, water filters through the words to roots, roses absorb her pacifist creed. Two beats: the etching and the absorption statement. Early signal, beat involvement ×2, and causal pressure (the method enables her goal). Frictions: the mechanics are asserted more than dramatized—we do not see a plant choice change on the page due to this method. It shapes attempts but does not visibly constrain or enable a peak turn. Swappability is moderate (other teaching methods could fit with edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in the glass-domed enclosure is indispensable. It provides the hydroponic beds (sandbag-lined), the fractured dome that sings pressure changes, the spiderweb cracks that fracture morning light, and the enclosure boundary between Maya's interior quiet and the exterior scavenger screams. The dome shudders (complicates), the glass tempers twin suns (enables survival), and the eastern quadrant structures her pruning ritual. Four+ beats involve the setting: opening anchor, dome shudder, glass touch, final sunset through dome. Early signal, beat involvement ×4, causal pressure (the dome constrains and enables survival), closure linkage (sunset filters through glass and thorn), and irreplaceability (no other setting fits this logic). Cost: isolation within fragile glass.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" anchors the timeframe early and establishes post-collapse context: the skyways are claimed by desert, war-balloons drifted down, the capital is old, surgeons are a memory. The timeframe enables Maya's renunciation (her father's calculus is obsolete) and justifies the scavenger/warlord exterior threat. Early signal and causal pressure present. Frictions: the timeframe does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat—no live clock narrows Maya's moves. The "today" impact and "tomorrow" vow gesture at ongoing time, but pressure is static rather than escalating. The timeframe is more backdrop than tactical constraint. Swappability is moderate (other post-collapse eras could fit).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To weave continuity through chaos" is Maya's stated motivation, dramatized through her rituals: she cultivates silence, etches truths, prunes, and vows to persist tomorrow. The desire is signaled early and conflicted—her father's legacy pulls against her pacifist creed, and the exterior threat tests her endurance. Two beats: the opening statement and the final vow to weave chaos into compost. Early signal, beat involvement ×2, causal pressure (drives her pruning and etching), closure linkage (the final image fulfills the motivation), and cost connection (isolation, ongoing danger). Minor friction: the motivation is more asserted than tested in live choice—she never wavers or faces a fork that risks abandoning continuity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is signaled early and modulates across the piece: the engraved quiet settles "heavy and silver," the dome shudder does not break her calm, and the sunset paints the dome in a "tranquil blaze" that illuminates her manifesto. The tone is coherent through turns (external threat vs. interior stillness) and charges the final image. Two beats: opening atmosphere and closing sunset. Early signal, closure linkage, and tonal consistency present. The phrase is specific and voice-motivated. Minor friction: the exact phrase "tranquil blaze" appears twice, trending slightly decorative. Still, the tone is essential—removing it flattens the contrast between interior peace and exterior violence that drives closure.</comment>
