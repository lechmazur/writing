<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is richly textured and specific to her philosophy ("esoteric realist"), but the character remains observational rather than tested by internal contradiction. Her motivation to honor overlooked histories is consistent throughout, yet no competing impulse or genuine doubt challenges her dedication—she proceeds through ritual without friction. The final smile at paradox reads as contemplative insight rather than a choice earned through struggle. Embodiment is strong (moss pressing into knees, give of chitin), but the lack of dramatic tension between want and cost or fear keeps this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who, where, when established in the opening lines). The piece uses an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the thinning monarch count, the construction and dismantling cycle, and the final departure threshold. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the grotto will keep its stillness without her—with conceptual cost visible in the transience she honors. One meaningful deepening occurs (building, witnessing, releasing), and the cost is legible in her departure and the acknowledgment that preservation is impossible. Minor deduction: the closure moment is quieter than the accumulation warrants; the final image restates rather than reweights prior material with undeniable new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The verdant grotto above clouds is vividly anchored with sensory specificity (moss thicker than memory, blushing stillness, rose-gold dawn, emerald stone) and filtered through Elara's priorities (coordinates of grottos, milkweed, migration data). The environment constrains her work (thin oxygen, humid air affecting wing flutter, grotto's mouth as threshold) and charges the closure: her transient rootedness is spatial and conceptual. Micro-setting qualifies: the towers, grasses, spider silk, and hollow reeds are handled and their placement matters. Minor gap: occupational detail (esoteric realist methods) remains abstract; the mechanics of her signal-building lack the granular texture that would elevate spatial choreography further.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories before the final migration ends—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the population counts drive toward nightfall, and her dismantling of the oldest tower enacts the build-signal-release cycle. Cost is visible (she cannot preserve the species, only the dignity of ending) and forecloses the path of preservation. Agency is present but muted: Elara's choices are ritualistic rather than forced by reversals or escalating pressure. The monarchs' dwindling and the approaching threshold create urgency, but no on-page complication tests her method or commitment; escalation reads as atmospheric countdown rather than decision-driven tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—the grammar of remembrance from impermanence, the physics of attention—emerges organically from Elara's construction and dismantling. The moth wing and towers function as concrete anchors for memory, and the final paradox (accepting impermanence makes history last) lands without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the interrupted cadence of wings, the blushing stillness, and the grotto absorbing the story. Minor slip: "esoteric realist" and "magic was merely the physics of attention" flirt with thematic echo, verbalizing the premise rather than trusting the enacted ritual. The ending reweights prior material but does so through restatement of the established method rather than a non-literal answer that surprises.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's philosophical lens. Perceptual signature is consistent (academic precision, cold accuracy, metaphysical weight) and diction matches her training. Psychic distance is controlled, with close access to her ritual focus. However, register drifts toward elevated abstraction in peak beats ("interrupted cadence," "blushing stillness," "esoteric realist") where embodied immediacy would sharpen pressure. Some filter verbs ("believed," "recognized") appear in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated. Rhythmic control is present, yet syntactic patterns repeat (long, clause-heavy sentences with participial structures) without modulation under emotional intensity. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated imagery (blushing stillness, interrupted cadence, verdant grotto, rose-gold dawn)—which creates a static lyric texture rather than momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "transiently rooted" recurs without reweighting, and the build-signal-release cycle is restated multiple times. Template cadence: runs of similar participial openers and "the [noun] [verb]" constructions flatten rhythm. Information density is moderate; many lines perform atmospheric work but do not advance situation or narrow options. Clarity remains high—no opacity—but the steady decorative register and repetitive phrasing ("interrupted cadence" used for wings, towers, and journey) trigger artifact deductions. Strong specificity in some images (chitin's give, proboscis tasting nectar) partially offsets.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of extinction witnessing, ephemeral monument-building, and esoteric realism offers a thoughtful angle, and the grotto-above-clouds setting is visually distinct. However, the premise—artist/witness creating temporary art to honor a vanishing species—follows a recognizable template (elegiac environmental testimony). Transformation is partial: the "esoteric realist" lens and the specific method (spider silk, moth wing, hollow reeds) add texture, but the emotional arc and thematic resolution remain predictable. The story commits fully to its lyric mode, yet no turn or inflection surprises; the ending fulfills the opening's promise without complication. Proximity check passes (no famous echoes), and voice is singular, but the narrative does not take the bold risk that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (esoteric realist) frames the story and her philosophical stance shapes her method (refusing romanticism, documenting metaphysical weight). She appears in every beat and her choices—constructing towers, knotting filaments, dismantling the oldest structure—drive the action. However, her choices are iterative rather than causally turning: she enacts a pre-established ritual without adaptation or complication. The final smile and decision to leave are prepared by the countdown, not by a pivot her philosophy forced. Present in setup, development, and closure, but agency is observational and procedural. Score: setup +0.5, all three beats +1.4, causal pressure weak +0.2, closure linkage +0.7, swappability moderate −0.5, no visible tradeoff on-page −0.5. Band ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moth wing is introduced early (male found at grotto's entrance), handled in the knotting beat (base bound to reeds, chitin's give felt), and appears in the closure paragraph (catches light, blushing pink, small flag). Three distinct beats: discovery, construction, final image. It accumulates meaning: iridescent against emerald stone, painted with nectar, signal to the future. Causal role is moderate—it enables the tower but does not narrow options or create tradeoff. Closure linkage is strong: the wing charges the final image as witness-signal. Score: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.7, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, swappability −0.4 (any wing could serve), ornamental in middle −0.3. Band ~7.2, capped by replaceability and lack of plot constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is named early (monarchs' arrhythmic flutter vs. synchronized rhythm of millions) and recurs: flight paths creating interrupted cadences, the butterfly's journey, her towers as signals. It shapes the dominant stake (witnessing the broken pattern of extinction) and charges atmosphere. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page—it functions as thematic motif and tonal descriptor rather than a mechanism that changes options. Present in closure (the irregular rhythm continues as she builds), but its role is textural. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure linkage (thematic) +0.8, specificity +0.4, swappability −0.6 (similar metaphors could work), ornamental use −0.5. Band ~6.9, held by lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" appears early (anchored only until the last butterfly crosses) and recurs in the penultimate paragraph (between the moment passed and silence to follow). It defines Elara's relationship to the grotto and her philosophy (impermanence as honesty). The trait enables her method (temporary structures) and shapes her final departure, but does not create an on-page tradeoff or visible cost—she never struggles with the desire to stay or preserve permanently. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure; thematic constraint rather than tactical. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure weak +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4, label-only in middle −0.3, no visible cost −0.8. Band ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The knot appears in the construction beat (knotting filament around wing's base, binding to reeds, pulling tight, feeling chitin's give) and in the final paragraph (weight of knots she had tied, preparing the next knot). It is the physical anchor of her signal-building and tied to the theme (histories live in physical anchors). The action drives two beats and shapes closure, but is part of a repeated ritual rather than a single turning moment. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure moderate +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6, cost connection (resistance yielded to persistence) +0.4, swappability −0.5 (weaving or binding could substitute), summary in final paragraph −0.2. Band ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Building temporary structures as signals" is introduced early (fragile towers from braided grasses and spider silk, monuments to forgotten years) and enacted across multiple beats: constructing, pulling the knot tight, monarch landing on completed tower, dismantling the oldest tower, continuing to build. The method defines her agency and the story's through-line (build, signal, release). It shapes every major choice and appears in closure (she continued to build). Score: setup +0.7, three or more beats +1.4, causal pressure high +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, cost connection (dignity of ending) +0.5, minor swappability −0.3 (other ephemeral art could work), mechanics slightly abstract −0.4. Band ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The verdant grotto above the clouds is anchored in the opening and present throughout: moss, thin oxygen, ferns touching underside of clouds, grotto's entrance and mouth as threshold. It provides resources (spider silk, hollow reeds, rare orchids) and constrains (thin air, humidity affecting wings). The grotto's threshold triggers closure (when the final butterfly crosses). Micro-setting qualifies. Score: setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7, postcard description in places −0.5, spatial choreography serviceable but not intricate −0.5. Band ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timeframe—during the migration of the last monarch butterfly—is signaled early (last corridor of sky, final few hundred) and tracked: cold snap killed hundreds, three monarchs tracing spirals, migration would end by nightfall, when the final butterfly crossed the threshold she would leave. The countdown shapes urgency and Elara's tactics (work while migration lasts). Time pressure is live and legible. Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure strong +1.4, closure linkage (departure tied to final crossing) +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost connection (realism about final number) +0.5, slightly abstract tracking −0.2. Band ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation to honor overlooked histories is stated early (witness, remember, build monuments to forgotten years, names of farmers, coordinates of grottos) and drives every action: constructing towers, weaving moth wings, dismantling. It shapes the closure (preserve the dignity of ending, refuse to look away). However, the motivation is told and enacted without friction—no competing desire or doubt tests it. Dramatization is present (the physical work), but the want itself is never in conflict with cost or fear. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.8, closure linkage +1.3, friction weak −0.7, told motivation −0.4, specificity +0.5, cost connection (cannot preserve species) +0.5. Band ~6.7, held by lack of internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" is introduced early (air held a blushing stillness, as if atmosphere embarrassed by grandeur) and recurs: rose-gold dawn, blushing light, preserving the blushing stillness, wing blushing pink, grotto would keep its blushing stillness. The tone is lyric, restrained, and charged with quiet mourning. It modulates subtly (embarrassment, watching stillness, future stillness without her) and supports the accumulative structure. Present in closure and coherent throughout. Score: setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, coherence +0.9, closure charge +1.1, modulation +0.5, static mood in middle −0.5, overuse of "blushing" −0.4, specificity +0.7, tone integral +0.6. Band ~7.0.</comment>
