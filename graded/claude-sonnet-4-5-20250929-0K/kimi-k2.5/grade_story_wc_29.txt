<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's competence is well-established through her three years of prior work, and her trembling hands during the sequence show embodied fear. However, her motivation remains largely declarative—we're told she understood their game but never see the on-page moment of realization that changes her stance. The cosmic tricksters' withdrawal feels convenient rather than earned through her prior choices, and the final "cautiously hopeful" framing lacks the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The causal lens is clear: Elena decodes signals → discovers entities → designs counter-broadcast → executes sequence → tricksters withdraw. The seventeen-minute countdown and ninety-second hold provide temporal pressure, and the subsonic disruption creates a meaningful reversal. However, the tricksters' withdrawal ("already withdrawing to find easier prey") reads as their choice rather than a forced outcome of Elena's action, which undercuts the closure's earned quality. The cost—community fracture and trust broken—is visible but arrives mostly as summary rather than dramatized consequence that forecloses a path for Elena personally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The radio station is vividly rendered with dust motes, sodium light, ancient equipment, and the mixing console covered in charts. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (boots, desk, window sightlines). The subsonic thrum vibrating through her boots and rattling coffee cups creates sensory specificity that constrains and enables her action. The equipment's grittier-era mechanics become essential to the counter-broadcast, charging the final image of flickering lights. The university campus exterior provides necessary witness-pressure but remains slightly generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stop the cosmic entities before the pulsar alignment peaks—is signaled early and tightened by the seventeen-minute window. The subsonic broadcast creates a meaningful reversal: mob pauses, armbands come off. The visible cost is clear: equipment sparks, transmitter pushed beyond capacity, community left fractured. However, the tricksters' attention turning toward Elena ("pressure like thumbs pressed against her temples") promises escalation that never materializes into a concrete tactical problem she must solve, leaving the climactic ninety seconds feeling more like endurance than a decision that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of human ingenuity versus cosmic malice emerges through particulars: subsonic frequencies below twenty hertz, discord introduced into perfect mathematics, earthly mechanics sharper than anticipated. The final image of lights flickering then steadying offers a resonant answer. However, the piece telegraphs its thesis heavily: "to outwit them, she had to introduce discord into their perfect mathematics" and "human resilience could outlast cosmic malice" veer close to thematic echo. The astronomical charts return with shifted meaning (from discovery tool to tactical guide) but the recurrence feels more functional than charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third throughout, with consistent perceptual signature: Elena traces charts, checks calculations, watches through the window. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("ethereal architecture," "metastatic spread," "quantum wavelengths") with technical vocabulary fitting her role. The prose modulates under pressure: short clauses during the climactic sequence, longer contemplative rhythms at the end. However, "entities that fed on discord" and "cosmic tricksters" toggle between registers slightly, and "shame" attributed to dispersing neighbors edges toward unwarranted certainty about collective internal states.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or character. However, template cadence appears in repetitive paragraph openings: "The astronomical charts..." appears three times as a stem. Synonym churn is visible with "charts" (astronomical charts, charts, the charts) and "subsonic" (subsonic generator, subsonic frequencies, subsonic hum, subsonic thrum) across adjacent beats without functional variation. "Cautiously hopeful" appears twice identically as a phrase, the second occurrence adding no new pressure. The climactic beat is clear and propulsive, protecting the score from deeper penalties, but these artifacts accumulate to −0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—scientist uses overlooked earthly tech to disrupt cosmic entities—offers a fresh angle on the cosmic-horror template. The subsonic frequency solution is specific and grounded. However, the core conflict (ancient entities manipulating humanity through broadcasts) closely matches well-worn SFF templates, and the transformation is limited: the tricksters withdraw easily, the community's suffering is summarized, and Elena's personal cost remains abstract. The "gritty reality of copper wiring versus shimmering void" juxtaposition is vivid but doesn't fully escape the expected "human scrappiness wins" arc. Derivative premise friction applies: −0.6 in Q8 for template adherence without deep transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena (celestial signal interpreter) appears in the opening, drives all major beats: decoding signals, discovering the entities' nature, designing the counter-broadcast, executing the sequence, and holding through the final ninety seconds. Her decision to interfere creates the central turn. The role's technical specificity (decoding, calculating pulsar alignment, modulating frequency) is irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though her survival feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in beat one (traced on the console), beat two (checking the seventeen-minute window), beat three (watching alignment shift), and beat four (charts settle, alignment passed). They enable her tactical choices and return at closure to signal resolution. However, their function remains largely informational—they tell her when to act rather than constraining how she acts. The charts don't evolve in meaning or carry visible cost; they're tools used competently. Present across beats and at closure, but replaceable with any timing mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Power plays (the core concept) is present thematically: entities orchestrate whispers, make humans destroy each other, gamble with civilizations. However, the concept shapes stakes more through summary ("power plays orchestrated by entities") than through on-page tactical choices. Elena doesn't engage in a power play herself; she disrupts one. The concept appears once in exposition and once in reflection but doesn't constrain her decision-making or alter her tactics under pressure. Functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" appears twice identically: once after initiating the sequence and once in the penultimate paragraph. The attribute constrains her action slightly—she increases amplitude despite fear—but the phrase itself is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses. Hope and caution don't collide in a visible choice with cost; they coexist as labels. The trait frames her stance but doesn't enable or foreclose a path. Lyric reprise without mid-scene development or visible tradeoff caps it near the 5–6 range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the story's spine: Elena interferes with cosmic entities, the action is signaled early ("She had interfered with forces beyond human scale"), and the subsonic broadcast is interference made concrete. The verb choice is specific (not "stop" or "fight") and shapes her tactics: she introduces discord rather than confronting directly. The action drives two major beats (initiation and amplitude increase) and the resolution hinges on interference succeeding. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; removing this exact framing would require structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are seeded early (patching the subsonic generator), explained as the method (vibrations below twenty hertz to disrupt ethereal architecture), and executed across the climax (subsonic thrum, deepening hum, frequencies peaked). The method's mechanics matter: it evades the entities' sensors and disrupts harmonic resonance. The specificity (below twenty hertz) and the university's ancient equipment make it irreplaceable. Present in setup, development, and payoff with clear causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The university radio station provides the essential resource (transmitter, subsonic generator, ancient equipment) and spatial pressure (Elena isolated, mob visible through the window). The station's "grittier era of broadcasting" equipment becomes the solution's enabler. The transmission room anchors every beat; its soundproofed walls, cooling fans, and console are handled on the page. Removing this exact setting would collapse the plot. Strong setup, development, and closure participation with visible causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the community divides" is present throughout: neighbors with clenched fists in the opening, mob mid-stride during the sequence, armbands coming off, individuals wandering home. The division provides witness-pressure and stakes (if she fails, the rage turns on her building). However, the division itself doesn't tighten Elena's tactical choices—the seventeen-minute pulsar countdown does that work. The timeframe is signaled, dramatized, and resolved, but the community's state functions more as backdrop than as a clock that alters her moves. Two beats plus thematic closure, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to outwit cosmic tricksters" is stated explicitly ("to outwit them, she had to introduce discord") and shapes her subsonic strategy. However, it's told more than dramatized—we don't see her choosing to outwit rather than, say, hide or flee. The desire is present in setup (three years decoding signals) and payoff (she survives by being smarter), but the friction between wanting to outwit and the cost of trying is summarized rather than shown in a conflicted choice. Functional across beats but lacks visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ethereal grit is established in the opening (dust motes like galaxies, sodium light, stale air) and sustained through the climax (sparks, ozone, copper wiring versus shimmering void, two places at once). The tone modulates appropriately: contemplative at the start, tense during the sequence, quiet at the end. The juxtaposition of concrete tech (boots, console, coffee cups) and cosmic abstraction (quantum wavelengths, entities vast and laughing) charges the final image. Coherent through pressure and present at closure, though the phrase "ethereal grit" itself never appears, so the integration is interpretive rather than anchored to a specific line.</comment>
