<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "find the sound of trust breaking" is clear and consistent, anchored in a specific past betrayal (the child patient). The synesthesia and cell-division metaphors provide embodied interiority. However, the final choice—fitting the device into her own ear—feels more like a logical endpoint than a high-stakes decision forged under contradictory impulses; she observes and accepts rather than wrestling with competing desires in the moment. The cost (her death) is legible but occurs passively alongside the discovery rather than being forced by an active renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered absences, the aurora's shifting pitch, and the forge-imprinting ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Mara sits "among the withered roots" and accepts the "perfect clarity" of her regrets. Orientation anchors arrive within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The closure unit is on the page with felt cost—her death and the final understanding of trust's acoustic shape. One minor causality slip: the device's mechanics are abstract ("compressed silence gathered from empty rooms") and the leap from collecting absences to producing a functional hearing aid is asserted rather than traced.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vivid and purposeful: the "bell jar holding twelve dead trees," the "rusted crown" of wrecks, and the ashen forge all constrain Mara's work and charge the final image. The aurora's shifting pitch (G-sharp to "blue-gray chord that tasted of copper") filters through her synesthesia, grounding sensory detail in POV. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The forge's transition from "memory of heat" to instrument of imprinting to final cooling tracks causally and shapes the closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the acoustic signature of broken trust—is signaled early and tightens once: Mara moves from collecting external absences to imprinting her own betrayal, then experiences the device's output. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening is sufficient. The cost (her imminent death, the final isolation in the greenhouse) is legible on the page. However, the escalation is largely internal and observational; Mara's agency is methodical rather than forced into a trade-off that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: trust as "holding your breath," breaking as "finally exhaling," and the shipwrecks as "a library of silences." The final image—Mara fitted with the device, hearing the "deeper truth" of every wreck—resonates without stating a moral. The ashen forge, dead trees, and aurora recur with reweighted meaning. However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward articulation ("memories did not fade; they simply changed frequency") that borders on thematic echo, though it stops short of sermonic summary. The ending's quiet power is earned by prior accumulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with perceptual signature (synesthesia, the aurora "sang a high G-sharp that made her teeth ache") anchoring voice. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "bell jar," "mechanical ear," "spectral frequencies." No head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose texture is distinct, with vocabulary ("oscilloscope," "marrow," "crucible") fitting Mara's technical background. Under peak stress, compression remains voice-coherent ("the cells in her blood continued their mindless division"). One minor slip: "Not the dramatic shatter of glass, but the precise acoustic signature of faith departing a human heart" reads slightly over-articulated for the POV's working mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. However, several lines carry elevated diction that drifts from the working scientist's idiom: "the ghosts of apples that never fell," "darker acoustics," "spectral frequencies," "sympathetic frequencies." These accumulate in the opening and middle thirds without clear pattern-teaching. Two paraphrase loops: "cells divided in her deteriorating marrow—a clock she felt rather than saw" is restated as "the cells in her blood continued their mindless division, marking time she no longer had." "The greenhouse was not a tomb but a library of silences" recaps prior material without added pressure. The closure beat is clean. Deductions: −0.6 for register drift, −0.4 for paraphrase loops = baseline ~7.9, adjusted to 6.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of synesthesia, hearing-aid design, and acoustic archaeology of trust is specific and non-obvious. The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks as "library of silences" feels fresh. The core emotional insight—trust as breath-holding, breaking as exhalation—is earned in hindsight. However, the "collecting absences" method and the forge-imprinting mechanism remain abstract and somewhat convenient; the transformation from metaphor to literal function is asserted rather than grounded in verifiable detail. The ending avoids easy resolution and commits to its premise. Risk-taking (synesthesia as functional tool, not ornament) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: Mara is introduced as "hearing aid designer by trade" in the first paragraph. Development: her profession informs the method (engineering devices, mechanical ear) but does not constrain a middle choice; she works methodically rather than facing a professional dilemma. Closure: the final device is a hearing aid she fits into her own ear, but the occupation itself is replaceable—an acoustic engineer or sound artist could perform the same beats. The designer role is functional but not causally indispensable. Two-gate presence (setup, closure cameo); no middle constraint. Cap at ~6.0 per gate guidance; swappability and ornamental middle use lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: the forge is introduced early ("ashen forge in the greenhouse's center, its coals long dead but still radiating the memory of heat"). Development: Mara activates it ("she activated the forge. Though cold, it served as her anvil of memory") and places collected absences into the crucible, pressing the mechanism against it to create the imprint. Closure: "The ashen forge cooled completely, its work finished" as the aurora sings her into stillness. Three gates met. The forge enables the imprint action and reappears with reweighted meaning (memory → instrument → finished work). However, the mechanics are abstract and a similar metaphorical surface could substitute. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappability and lack of physical specificity limit irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "the impact of memories on the physical world, how the intangible could scar tissue" is stated early as Mara's belief. Development: she works to "imprint the final frequency" and realizes "memories did not fade; they simply changed frequency." Closure: the device transmits "the sound of her own regrets in perfect clarity" and she understands that trust and its breaking have acoustic shape. The concept shapes the dominant stake and is explored throughout. However, it operates more as theme than as a constraint on tactics; Mara's methods are not altered by the concept's pressure. Three gates, thematic presence, but largely told rather than dramatized as a choice-altering force. Lyric reprise with cost at closure qualifies for mid-5s to low-6s range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: synesthesia ("she heard colors faintly—the aurora borealis pulsing overhead sang a high G-sharp that made her teeth ache") is introduced early. Development: the aurora shifts pitch ("G-sharp to a blue-gray chord that tasted of copper") as she works, and "the colors of the aurora exploded into a symphony" when she fits the device. Closure: the trait filters perception throughout but does not constrain a single on-page action with visible cost; it enriches texture without forcing a trade-off. Two gates (setup, closure); no middle constraint. Functional but replaceable; a sound-sensitive character without synesthesia could perform the same beats. Cap at ~6.0 per gate guidance; swappability and lack of choice-pressure lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "to imprint the final frequency" is stated early as Mara's goal. Development: "Tonight, under the green curtains of light, she activated the forge" and "pressed the mechanism against the forge. The ashen surface accepted the vibration, turning the intangible into the physical." Closure: "As the imprint took hold, she finally heard it—the exact pitch of a promise breaking" and the device is complete. The imprint action drives two beats and culminates in the closure's discovery. However, the mechanics remain abstract and the action could be reframed as "recording," "capturing," or "crystallizing" with minor edits. Three gates, strong causal role, but moderate swappability limits irreplaceability to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "Her method was collecting absences. She wandered the ring of shipwrecks, recording the silence where engines should have roared" is stated in the second paragraph. Development: "She placed the collected absences into the crucible—not metal, but compressed silence gathered from empty rooms." Closure: the method's product (the device) enables the final hearing. Three gates met. The method is signaled early and its output shapes the ending. However, the mechanics are metaphorical and the method's specificity (why absences rather than presences) is asserted rather than demonstrated through constraint. Strong setup and closure linkage, but abstract execution and swappability (a similar metaphor could serve) limit to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "The sunken orchard had been her refuge since the continental shelf collapsed, its glass dome now a bell jar holding twelve dead trees" anchors the setting in the first paragraph. Development: "Shipwrecks encircled the structure like a rusted crown, their hulls bleeding iron into the soil" and "the water pressure held the greenhouse intact" constrain Mara's space and isolation. Closure: "She sat among the withered roots" and "In the ring of shipwrecks, the water pressure held the greenhouse intact, preserving her final imprint." The setting pressures choices (isolation, the forge as fixed location) and charges the final image (preservation, library of silences). Three gates, strong causal and closure involvement, vivid specificity. The greenhouse and shipwrecks are indispensable to the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: "While cells divided in her deteriorating marrow—a clock she felt rather than saw" is introduced early. Development: repeated mentions ("the cells in her blood continued their mindless division, marking time she no longer had," "Mara sat among the withered roots while her cells divided their last") track the time pressure. Closure: the final line ties the clock to her death. Three gates met. However, the timeframe does not tighten a single decision or alter tactics; it is ambient doom rather than a live countdown. The cost (death) is legible but not causally forced by the clock itself. Lyric presence with closure cost qualifies for mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "Her motivation was singular: to find the sound of trust breaking" is stated early, anchored in "her own betrayal of a patient, a child who had trusted her to build the perfect aid." Development: she works methodically toward this goal, and "That moment of breaking trust had a color—sepia brown—and a frequency she had been chasing for years." Closure: "she finally heard it—the exact pitch of a promise breaking" and fits the device to hear "the sound of her own regrets in perfect clarity." Three gates met. The motivation drives all action and is dramatized at closure. However, the internal conflict is muted; Mara pursues the goal without wavering or competing desires. Strong causal role and closure linkage, but lack of friction between wants and costs limits to mid-6s to low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "battered marvel" is not explicitly named but emerges through "the greenhouse's stale oxygen," "twelve dead trees," "rusted crown" of shipwrecks, and the "ashen forge." Development: tone modulates with the aurora's shifting pitch and Mara's methodical work, balancing decay with wonder. Closure: "She fitted the device into her own ear, the battered marvel complete" names the tone explicitly and charges the final image with both damage and achievement. The tone is coherent and modulates under pressure. However, the explicit naming in the closure beat feels slightly forced. Three gates, strong coherence, purposeful modulation, but the late label and minor on-the-nose quality limit to low-6s.</comment>
