<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is verbose but diagnostically labeled ("mnemonically gifted, a curse," "inescapable calling") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to abandon the surface is told as realization ("Elara understood then") instead of dramatized through conflicting wants that force visible cost. Emotions are frequently asserted ("auroral sorrow," "feverish precision") rather than shown through specific bodily sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's agency at closure reads as epiphany delivery, not earned friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early. The closure unit—Elara stepping through the tunnel to become "pioneer"—lacks visible cost on the page; she abandons a life described as miserable with no dramatized loss or trade-off, reading as convenient escape rather than Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. The watermark reveal and lock-repair sequence depend on late rule introduction (numbers as repair instructions) that solves a problem without prior setup, breaking causal linkage. Drive lens is ambiguous: the opening suggests Accumulative/Textural but the middle relies on Causal problem-solving, and closure reads like wished-for transformation without the cost anchoring Charged Poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave supplies vivid sensory detail ("prismatic crystals catching stray photons," "violet crystals at this hour") that establishes tone. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the sudden appearance of "the back wall" and the safe behind a canvas feels under-anchored in initial spatial setup. The singing crystals in the hidden gallery function as discovery rather than constraint on prior choice, limiting score elevation. Micro-setting (canvas, safe, hairpins as tools) is present but the underground environment does not meaningfully pressure Elara's tactics until the very end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape from creative suppression—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page tightening narrows options with visible cost until the tunnel magically appears. The broken lock is framed as obstacle, but repair happens through late-introduced knowledge (watermark instructions) rather than protagonist struggle or sacrifice. Elara's final step through the opening is unopposed and cost-free: she leaves behind nothing she values, undermining escalation. Agency is passive discovery (finding tunnel, finding instructions) rather than decision that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of suppressed creativity versus authentic vision emerges through concrete particulars (caricatures vs. true art, the broken lock as barrier). The child's question ("why she looked so sad") briefly anchors theme in scene moment. However, the ending moralizes through narration ("prisoner to pioneer," "authentic vision") rather than letting image resonate, and "auroral sorrow transforming into dawn" is on-the-nose metaphor that tells rather than reweights. The piece gestures toward depth-versus-height reversal but delivers it as concept statement, not lived cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register incongruent with an artist under pressure ("mnemonically gifted," "mathematical poetry of the sequence," "chronicler, its witness") that reads as authorial rather than character-specific perception. Narrative distance wavers between tight interiority and explanatory summarizing ("her talent reduced to a parlor trick," "the weight of unfulfilled purpose"). Filter verbs and abstract phrasing ("the inescapable calling pulsed through her") dull immediacy at peak beats. No dialogue; not applicable for that bullet.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "creativity corked tight" / "uncork her suppressed creativity," "auroral sorrow" repeated three times, "inescapable calling" appears twice in similar framing. Template cadence runs: "She could perfectly recall… yet she could not remember…" mirrors itself unnecessarily. Metaphors are strained and mixed ("creativity corked," "welding fractured confidence," "cathedral waiting for its chronicler"). Figurative density in most sentences of the climax beat (hairpins, mathematical poetry, sculpture metaphor, welding metaphor) without pattern-teaching. Stock phrasing: "glittering tomb," "first true sculpture," "dawn of authentic vision." Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and metaphor muddle touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The underground-artist-in-tourist-trap premise is functional but well-trodden (artist trapped by commerce, literal and figurative escape). The broken-lock-as-creative-barrier metaphor is transparent and mechanically resolved. The watermark twist and singing-crystal gallery feel ornamental rather than inevitable synthesis from prior particulars. Emotional template of creative suppression → epiphany → freedom arc runs without fresh inflection or risky choices that complicate the trajectory. Elara's final step reads as wish-fulfillment rather than transformation earned through specific, non-obvious causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation frames the setup. However, her choices are passive (noticing watermark, following instructions) rather than creating key turns. The decision to step through the tunnel is presented as realization, not a choice under conflicting pressure. Present by first third, absent from middle development as active decision-maker, participates in closure by moving through the opening—meets two gates but causal pressure is weak. Cap at ~6.0 for two-gate model; swappability (any trapped artist) and passivity lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The broken lock is introduced early (months of defeat mentioned), actively handled in the repair sequence (middle beat), and its final state (repaired and open) functions as symbolic marker at closure—three gates present. However, it is resolved by late-introduced instructions rather than protagonist ingenuity or cost, reducing causal irreplaceability. The lock does not constrain a choice so much as delay until the deus-ex-watermark solves it. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but swappability (any barrier) and late-solve friction −0.8 and summary-like repair −0.4 land it near 6.0; round to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The concept "inescapable calling" is named three times and functions as theme label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. It does not constrain Elara's choices; the plot mechanics (lock, watermark, tunnel) drive action, while "calling" is invoked to explain motivation after the fact. Present by first third as label, absent from middle as causal force, mentioned at closure—minimal development gate. Ornamental and swappable with "passion" or "purpose." Cap at ~4.6 for missing middle; label-only use −0.3, swappability −0.5 = 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Mnemonically gifted" is introduced early and claimed to enable lock study and watermark recognition. However, the trait is told rather than shown constraining action: we never see her perfect recall tested, fail, or impose cost (e.g., unwanted memories interfering). It enables a convenience (she memorized the lock) without on-page demonstration or trade-off. Setup +0.5, beat involvement (lock repair) +0.4, but label-only execution −0.5, no visible cost −0.4, summary-only use −0.4 = ~4.2; round to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Rectify" is named explicitly and drives the lock-repair beat, shaping middle action. However, the repair itself is passive execution of found instructions rather than creative problem-solving that defines Elara's arc. The action appears in middle and is metaphorically reprised at closure ("act of rectification… first true sculpture"), meeting two gates, but the metaphoric overreach and swappability (she could have "overcome" or "solved") limit irreplaceability. Setup via mention of prior broken attempt +0.3, beat involvement +0.4, closure metaphor +0.7, but swappability −0.6, late solution friction −0.3 = ~5.2; round to 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The painting with watermark behind it is present early (first month canvas, crookedly hung), is used mid-scene to reveal the safe and then the watermark, and the watermark directly enables the climax repair—three gates met. Specificity is high: violet-light watermark readable only at this hour ties setting to method. However, the method is discovered rather than pursued, and the late introduction of its repair-instruction function feels like planted solution. Setup +0.8, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6, but late-solve friction −0.9, resolves problem it didn't create −1.0 = ~6.4; cap at 6.1 for introduced-past-40% (watermark's function revealed late) and swappability of mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave is anchored early, supplies the violet-light condition that reveals the watermark (middle causal beat), and the hidden singing-crystal gallery forms the closure destination—three gates. The cave's prismatic properties are specific and irreplaceable for the watermark beat. However, it functions more as backdrop and discovery reward than as constraint that alters Elara's tactics under pressure. Setup +0.8, two beats (watermark reveal, final gallery) +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, but ornamental-reward use −0.8, postcard description in opening −0.3 = ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last echo of laughter fades" is named once in the opening and establishes isolation but does not return or tighten decisions. No narrative clock tracks elapsed time or imposes urgency; Elara's repair and discovery proceed at leisure. Setup present, middle and closure absent—one gate. Ornamental −0.5, no time pressure −0.6, summary-only −0.3 = cap at ~3.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to uncork suppressed creativity" is declared early and reprised at closure ("uncork her suppressed creativity… abandon the surface"). However, it is told through exposition and metaphor rather than dramatized through conflicting choices with cost. Elara's want faces no on-page obstacle once the tunnel appears; escape is convenient rather than hard-won. Setup +0.5, closure reprise +0.7, but told-only friction −0.8, no visible trade-off −0.5, metaphor-label overuse −0.3, summary of struggle −0.4 = ~5.2; swappability (generic creative yearning) −0.2 = 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is named three times, establishing a static mood rather than modulating with pressure. The phrase functions as decorative label; tone does not shift meaningfully between despair, repair, and discovery beats. At closure, "auroral sorrow transforming into dawn" is asserted metaphorically but not felt through image or rhythm change. Setup +0.3, closure label +0.4, but static mood −0.6, label-only execution −0.5, no modulation under pressure −0.5, synonym churn (auroral repeated) −0.3 = ~4.8; cap at 4.6 for missing middle modulation and ornamental use.</comment>
