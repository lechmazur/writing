<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to record the betrayal is clear, but her internal experience remains surface-level—she "knows" and "feels" without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The disguised phonograph mechanism is clever, yet her choices during the stakeout (feigned drunkenness, calculated positioning) read more as competent procedure than decisions born from embodied fear or competing loyalties. The ending forecloses the lieutenant's path, but the cost to Mara herself—what she risks or sacrifices beyond completing the task—remains abstract. Interiority leans on stock phrasing: "comforting unease settle into her bones" and "sound of trust breaking crystalline and sharp."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (pier market), and goal (record betrayal) early. The drive lens reads Causal: Mara positions herself, winds the fob, captures the coordinates—a because/therefore chain. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (evidence secured before sunrise) with visible cost (she must reach her father before the lieutenant realizes). However, the escalation is thin: she circles, feigns drunkenness, retreats—beats that repeat the same tactic without meaningful tightening until the lieutenant simply delivers his lines. The Cost proof test is marginal: the final image mentions urgency and the fob's weight, but the felt price on Mara—what she personally forfeits or endures—is told more than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vivid: barnacles like rusted coins, lanterns swaying with tide, the smell of rain on ancient wood. Spatial choreography is clear—stalls, support beams, dripping infrastructure. The micro-setting (the fob as tool and the pier's tidal clock) constrains Mara's movements and charges the ending when she tucks it away as the waves rise. This lifts the score into the mid-6s. However, much of the description ("salt-rotted underworld," "curiously steadfast heartbeat") reads atmospheric rather than action-integrated, and the market's pressure on choice remains more backdrop than active constraint in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture the betrayal before dawn—is signaled early and governs all moves. One meaningful tightening occurs when the agent's paranoia forces Mara to retreat and approach from a better angle, narrowing her window. The final coordinates scene delivers the evidence, foreclosing the lieutenant's treachery. Yet the escalation reads procedural: she circles, waits, positions—steps that repeat rather than compound. The Cost proof is present but light: Mara must race to her father, but the price she pays in fear, stamina, or social exposure is asserted ("heavy with evidence") rather than dramatized through embodied struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: silence as ammunition, trust breaking captured in grooves, the market as exporter of secrets. The phonograph-as-evidence and the tidal clock lend the piece a mechanical-poetic charge. The ending reweights prior material—Mara's patience and the fob's dual nature converge—without moralizing. However, the thematic question (loyalty, surveillance, the cost of proof) is more illustrated than complicated; Mara's stance is consistent from start to finish, so the closure reconfigures the situation but not her understanding. The final image is resonant but stops short of non-literal surprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Mara notices the lieutenant's "velvet and treacherous" voice, the market's "curiously steadfast heartbeat"—but the filtering leans toward stock poetic phrases rather than character-specific idiom. The brief dialogue is functional and carries subtext ("Pretty" as threat-test), though the agent and lieutenant remain under-voiced. Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrative certainty fits what Mara can know. Diction control is adequate but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("comforting unease," "crystalline and sharp") that feels authorial rather than rooted in a moonshine runner's daughter's voice under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries strong images (barnacles as rusted coins, the pier counting down), but template cadence and phrase recycling appear throughout: "false starts" repeats five times, "comforting unease" three times, "curiously steadfast" twice, "the sound of trust breaking" twice. Several beats paraphrase adjacent content without added pressure—paragraph 5 restates the truce and hours-feeling-like-minutes already established. Filter verbs and abstract nominalizations ("the comforting unease deepens," "the truce of hush creates a vacuum") dull immediacy in peak moments. Sentence openings vary little; many paragraphs begin with "She" or "The." Information density is moderate; some lines advance action, others restate mood. No loops obscure causality at closure, but accumulated artifacts lower momentum and cap high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The phonograph-cylinder-as-watch-fob is a specific, memorable synthesis that drives the espionage mechanic. The pirate market setting and the tidal truce add texture. However, the moonshiner's-daughter-versus-corrupt-customs plot is a familiar frame, and Mara's arc—competent operative completing her mission—does not transform the template through moral ambiguity or fresh emotional calculus. The "false starts" mechanic (decoy-nest tactics) is signaled early and governs her approach, lending procedural freshness, but the emotional stakes remain generic (daughter's devotion, father's vindication). The piece commits to its premise without bold risk that heightens complexity or upends reader expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and drives all choices: she navigates the market, winds the fob, feigns drunkenness, captures the coordinates, and exits with evidence. Her role is causal—without her, no recording occurs. However, her choices are tactical rather than internally conflicted; she executes a plan without visible cost or dilemma that would elevate integration. She appears in the closure (tucking the fob, feeling unease), but the ending beat centers on the object and the ticking clock more than on her transformation. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is present but not indispensable to the final image's charge. Swappability is low—she is the only agent—but her arc is procedural.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The antique watch fob is introduced in paragraph one, handled across multiple beats (clutched, wound, dangled as lure, pressed to record, tucked away), and reweighted at closure when its "heavy with evidence" state alters Mara's final move. It is not merely heirloom but phonograph cylinder—a dual nature that drives the espionage mechanic. The object constrains her approach (she must position within earshot, wind the mechanism, avoid detection) and charges the ending (she must reach her father before the recording is discovered). Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. The fob is irreplaceable; no near-synonym object could perform its function. Closure linkage is strong: the final paragraph hinges on its weight and her need to deliver it. Causal pressure is evident; without it, the betrayal cannot be proven.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The truce of hush is mentioned in paragraph one and recurs ("the truce of hush holds only until first light," "creates a vacuum where sound becomes currency," "dissolves into chaos"). It shapes stakes—Mara has until sunrise—and provides atmospheric pressure. However, it functions more as time constraint than as a mechanic that alters tactics on the page. The truce does not force a visible choice or trade-off; it sets a deadline but does not complicate her actions in the peak beat. It is present in the closure paragraph ("until sunrise when the truce of hush dissolves"), but the ending hinges on the fob and the tidal threat, not on the truce itself. Setup and closure gates are met; development involvement is thin. It could be replaced by any timed cease-fire without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" appears twice: once describing the market's heartbeat and once describing Mara's patience rewarded at the end. Neither instance constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The phrase is ornamental—a tonal label rather than a trait that shapes choice. It does not appear early as a character attribute; when it does arrive, it summarizes an outcome rather than driving a beat. The attribute is replaceable; "patient," "persistent," or "resolute" would serve identically. No development or causal pressure is evident. Closure mention is present but decorative. The element reads as prompt-fulfillment rather than integral design.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Thwart" governs Mara's goal from paragraph three onward: she must thwart the exchange, thwart the violence, thwart the betrayal before the lieutenant realizes. The action is present in setup, drives her tactical choices (false starts, positioning, feigned drunkenness), and succeeds at closure when she secures the recording and exits. It is not easily swappable—her mission is to prevent the exchange from succeeding unrecorded. However, the word "thwart" itself appears three times but the on-page action is mostly observation and recording; the true thwarting (playing the evidence to authorities or her father) lies off-page. The element shapes the dominant stake and redefines options, but the climactic prevention is anticipated rather than dramatized. All three gates are met; causal pressure is present but diluted by the fact that the lieutenant completes his exchange—she records it rather than stopping it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"False starts" is signaled in paragraph two ("She navigates through false starts, pausing at stalls before doubling back, creating patterns like a bird building a decoy nest") and recurs across beats: paragraph five, six, and ten. The method shapes her approach—she circles, retreats, begins again—and this evasive tactic matters because the agent is paranoid. However, the mechanics are repetitive without escalation; each false start reads the same, and the method does not impose a cost or complicate her final success. It is present in the closure paragraph ("She retreats through false starts one last time") but as summary rather than dramatized choice. Setup and development gates are met; payoff is weak. The element could be replaced with "cautious approach" or "circling" with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is introduced in paragraph one and remains the sole setting throughout. It provides vivid sensory detail (barnacles, lanterns, tide), social context (illicit trade, enforcers), and spatial anchors (support beams, dripping infrastructure, lower stalls threatened by rising waves). The market constrains Mara's movements—she must navigate stalls, use the crowd for cover, position near beams—and the tidal threat tightens the closure ("waves lap higher now, threatening the lower stalls"). The setting is indispensable; the story could not occur in a generic location. However, the market does not alter her tactics at the peak beat; it provides atmosphere and obstacle but the climactic recording depends on the fob and proximity, not on a setting-specific resource or constraint. All three gates are met; causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is present via the rising tide but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is signaled in paragraph one ("until sunrise, when old debts come due") and tracked throughout: "she has hours yet, but they feel like minutes," "Dawn creeps closer," "until sunrise when the truce dissolves," "She has until sunrise to reach her father." The timeframe tightens Mara's decisions—she must position, record, and exit before dawn—and the closure paragraph explicitly marks the sky bruising purple as she emerges. The clock is live and coherent. However, the time pressure does not force a visible trade-off or alter her tactics at the peak beat; she completes the recording and exits with time to spare. All three gates are met; causal pressure is present but moderate; the element could be replaced with any multi-hour window without structural loss. The deadline shapes urgency but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation—to capture the sound of trust breaking—is introduced in paragraph two ("she is here to capture the sound of trust breaking") and governs Mara's goal throughout. She winds the fob, positions herself, and captures the lieutenant's betrayal ("the sound of trust breaking crystalline and sharp"). The phrase recurs in the closure paragraph, tying the mission to the final image. However, the desire is stated rather than dramatized through internal conflict; Mara never wavers, doubts, or faces friction between this goal and a competing want. Her emotional investment (father's vindication) is asserted but not embodied in contradictory impulses. Setup and closure gates are met; development involves procedural execution without tension. The motivation shapes the plot but is replaceable with "gather evidence" or "prove betrayal" without altering the emotional arc. Causal pressure is present; cost is told rather than felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" appears in paragraphs three, five, and ten, describing the market's atmosphere and Mara's final state. The phrase is evocative and coherent with the setting's illicit-but-regulated nature. However, the tone remains static across turns; the unease does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image in a way that reweights prior material. It functions as atmospheric label rather than tonal progression that shapes the reader's experience of escalation. The phrase is present in the closure beat ("comforting unease settle into her bones") but ornamentally—it could be omitted without altering the ending's stakes or cost. Setup and closure gates are met; development is minimal. The tone is consistent but replaceable with "tense calm" or "wary stillness." No visible constraint or payoff beyond mood.</comment>
