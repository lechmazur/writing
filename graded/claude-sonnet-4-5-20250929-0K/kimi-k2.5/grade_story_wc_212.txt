<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority leans heavily on abstract language ("furiously tranquil determination," "storm raging in her chest") that tells emotional state rather than embodying it through contradiction or micro-choice. Her motivation—to reopen the atrium and fulfill vortex inheritance—is declared but not tested by competing wants or internal friction; she moves through ritualized actions without visible hesitation or cost. The piece offers vivid perceptual detail (fractal breath, golden pollen vortex) but no moment where she must choose between conflicting goods or pay a legible price that forecloses another path. The final kneeling and smile feel asserted rather than earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where within the first paragraph, though "after the egg hatches" as inciting event arrives abruptly without prior setup. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (vortex, acorn cap, lowering songs, entropy reversal) rather than because/therefore causality. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Elara commits to stay and decrease entropy), but the final image lacks visible cost—no choice is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship altered on the page. The ending asserts continuity ("would stay here") without dramatizing what she sacrifices or what competing path she refuses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound atrium is vividly anchored with concrete sensory detail (frozen constellations, glass panes, terracotta pots, starlight filtering through clearing glass). Spatial choreography remains clear across Elara's movements from standing to placing the acorn cap to stepping onto the spiral staircase to kneeling. The setting directly constrains her action: the acorn cap fits a depression in the fountain's rim, the ice must be reversed, and the atrium's glass ceiling frames the final image. Environment charges the closure image when "starlight filtered through clearing glass, illuminating the first green shoot," making the space integral to the ending's visual weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reopening the atrium to reverse the Great Frost and restore the sanctuary—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through layered acts (placing acorn cap, singing lowering songs, reversing entropy) under an Accumulative lens, but no on-page reversal or competing option tests Elara's commitment. The piece offers one meaningful deepening when the vortex merges with the acorn cap and creates the spiral staircase, narrowing her path to descent. Cost remains abstract: no resource is spent, no alternate goal refused, no relationship altered; the ending declares future action ("would stay here") without demonstrating what she forfeits now.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—inheritance as responsibility to reverse decay and restore possibility—emerges through concrete images (seed vault, extinct varieties, genetic memory in fountain droplets) rather than direct statement. The oak acorn cap and vortex function as thematic vessels, shifting meaning from heirloom object to genetic key to temporal reversal tool. Subtext operates in the phrase "both the borrower and the lender," hinting at reciprocal cost without stating a moral. The ending attempts a resonant image ("infinite like the spiral of the galaxy above her glass sanctuary") but edges toward overt philosophizing ("She had reopened the covenant between human and seed") that spells out the theme rather than trusting the dramatized moment to carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—botanical and temporal focus ("chlorophyll and memory," "lignin out of lignified silence")—is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains credibility for a character mid-action ("decreasing entropy," "quantum probabilities," "lignified silence"), though these terms align with the piece's speculative-scientific idiom. Psychic distance fluctuates: some lines occupy tight embodied perception ("bark under fingernails") while others assert omniscient certainty about vortex mechanics without anchoring in Elara's subjective experience. Filter verbs ("understanding that," "she understood now") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy at key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacked in nearly every sentence ("breath crystallizing in fractal patterns," "time itself seemed to exhale, stretching like taffy," "fierce quiet of growing things"). Several vehicles contradict or strain logic: "furiously tranquil" asserts emotional opposition without dramatizing simultaneous impulses; "decreasing entropy" by "pulling heat from the cold" reverses thermodynamic language in ways that feel decorative rather than rigorous. Paraphrase loops appear: the phrase "furiously tranquil" recurs three times without variation, and "borrowed time" is repeated across paragraphs with only synonym shifts ("texture of borrowed time," "touched the borrowed time directly"). Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("it felt like bark... like the slow pressure... like patience") that cycle through sensory comparisons without advancing knowledge. Information density suffers when lines restate the same content (e.g., "decreasing entropy" is explained, then re-explained, then summarized again in the kneeling beat).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of botanical inheritance, thermodynamic reversal, and temporal reconstitution offers a non-obvious frame, though "heirloom seed keeper reverses environmental collapse" echoes familiar cli-fi templates. Specificity in extinct-variety seeds (tomatoes that taste of pre-dimming sunlight, Bronze Age wheat) and the acorn cap as genetic key elevate the premise beyond generic post-apocalypse restoration. Risk-taking in the lyric-scientific idiom ("lowering songs," "quantum probabilities woven back into seeds") intensifies thematic charge but occasionally tips into ornamental abstraction. The ending image—stars sprouting leaves—commits fully to its metaphorical logic without retreat, though the piece does not transform the inherited template through unpredictable character choice or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat and her choices drive all major turns: waiting thirty winters, placing the acorn cap, singing the lowering songs, stepping onto the spiral staircase, kneeling to press forehead to ground, committing to stay. Setup is immediate (first sentence). Development spans multiple beats (acorn placement, song, descent). Closure participation is direct (kneeling, commitment to stay). Causal pressure is moderate—her actions enable the atrium's reopening, but no competing choice tests her commitment. Cost is asserted ("would stay here") rather than paid on the page. Swappability is low; removing her agency would collapse the sequence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The oak acorn cap appears in the opening paragraph (cradled in palm), is placed onto the fountain's frozen rim in a middle beat where it fits a depression "as if the stone had been waiting decades for this specific genetic key," and dissolves into fountain water in the final third, its absence enabling the upward flow. Setup, development (constrains the fountain unlock), and closure participation (its dissolution releases genetic memory) are all present. Causal pressure is strong—the cap is the physical key that triggers the vortex merge. Cost is conceptual: the cap's dissolution is irreversible. Specificity is high; a generic seed would not carry the "genetic key" function. Two distinct beats with reweighted meaning (object → key → dissolved catalyst) justify upper 7-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vortex inheritance is introduced in the second paragraph ("what her grandmother had whispered about vortex inheritance: it was not land or gold that passed between generations, but the responsibility to reopen what time had sealed") and revisited near the end ("understanding that vortex inheritance meant she was both the borrower and the lender"). Setup is present. Development is thematic—it frames Elara's motivation but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics on the page. Closure participation is weak; the phrase reappears as summary rather than shaping the final image or action. The concept functions primarily as thematic scaffolding rather than a mechanical or relational pressure that changes options. Swappability is moderate; "ancestral duty" or "lineage responsibility" could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is applied to Elara three times: once as "furiously tranquil determination" (paragraph 6), again as "She moved furiously tranquil still" (paragraph 15), and finally as "She would stay here, furiously tranquil" (paragraph 21). Setup is delayed until paragraph 6 (~25% mark). The attribute is label-only—no on-page action demonstrates simultaneous fury and tranquility through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Development and closure participation are ornamental; the phrase recurs without altering tactics or constraining a choice. Swappability is high; "calm resolve" or "steady intensity" could replace it without structural loss. The repetition reads as thematic echo rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Reopen" is signaled early as the core action (grandmother's whisper about responsibility "to reopen what time had sealed") and recurs across major beats: Elara reopens the atrium by placing the acorn cap, by singing the lowering songs, by stepping forward as ice becomes mist, and by touching borrowed time. Setup, development, and closure ("She had reopened the covenant between human and seed") are all present. Causal pressure is strong—reopening structures every tactic and the final stance. The action is conceptually irreplaceable; "restore" or "awaken" would shift the emphasis from unsealing to creation. Cost is implied (she commits to stay) but not dramatized as a foreclosed path. The action's centrality and multi-beat presence support mid-7 placement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By decreasing entropy" is introduced in paragraph 9 ("Elara began to sing the lowering songs, the ones that reversed decay by decreasing entropy") and recurs in paragraphs 17 ("The atrium was reopening itself to the sky, the ice withdrawing by decreasing entropy") and 19 ("by refusing to let heat scatter into the void"). Setup occurs at ~40% mark. Development shows the method in action (frost retreats, ice becomes mist, soil warms) and closure ("decreasing entropy with every breath") summarizes it. Causal pressure is moderate—the method enables the reopening but its mechanics are declared rather than tested through failed attempts or trade-offs. Specificity is high; thermodynamic reversal is distinct. The method shapes the central beat but does not constrain a competing choice or reveal cost through use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is anchored immediately (first sentence) and remains the sole location. Setup is instant. Development is strong: the atrium's frozen state constrains Elara's actions (she must place the acorn cap, sing to reverse ice, step through transforming terrain), and its glass ceiling and central fountain supply the physical anchors for each beat. Closure participation is direct—starlight filters through clearing glass to illuminate the first green shoot, and the final image places Elara kneeling on warming ground under the glass sanctuary with stars overhead. Causal pressure is high; the setting's ice, fountain, and glass structure are irreplaceable. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves. The setting charges the final image and constrains tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the egg hatches" is the stated timeframe, mentioned in the third paragraph ("The egg had finally hatched") and recalled in the closure zone ("In this suspended moment after the egg hatched"). Setup is present but abrupt—no prior egg is established, so "after the egg hatches" reads as a label rather than a live temporal constraint. Development is weak; the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Elara moves through her ritual without a clock or competing deadline. Closure participation is nominal; the phrase reappears as summary. The timeframe functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure that alters tactics. Swappability is high; "after the frost broke" or "at the moment of thaw" could replace it with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of borrowed time" is introduced in paragraph 11 ("She was here to discover the texture of borrowed time, to feel how her ancestors had experienced moments not meant for her biological clock") and fulfilled in paragraph 16 ("In this suspended moment after the egg hatched, she touched the borrowed time directly—it felt like bark under fingernails, like the slow pressure of roots against stone, like patience so intense it burned"). Setup occurs at midpoint. Development is sensory—the desire is satisfied through metaphor but does not create friction or force a choice between competing wants. Closure participation is moderate; the final paragraph echoes "tasting the texture of borrowed time at last" as summary. The motivation is told and then illustrated rather than dramatized through conflicting pressures. Swappability is moderate; "to experience ancestral time" could replace it with some loss of specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Wild serenity" is not named on the page but inferred from tonal markers: "furiously tranquil," "fierce quiet of growing things," "the wild serenity of the place intensified as predators of chaos retreated." Setup is distributed. Development shows coherent tone through paradoxical calm-amid-intensity language. Closure modulates tone—the final image ("furiously tranquil, decreasing entropy with every breath, until the atrium overflowed with green inheritances and the stars themselves seemed to sprout leaves") sustains the wild-serenity register and charges the ending with intensified lyricism. The tone does not shift under pressure; it remains static across rising action and resolution. Specificity is moderate; the paradoxical pairing is consistent but not irreplaceable. The tone supports the ending image without altering tactics or constraining choice.</comment>
