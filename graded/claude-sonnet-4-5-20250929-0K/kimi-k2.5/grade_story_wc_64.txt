<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is consistent—discovering her ancestor's choices—but her journey lacks genuine internal contradiction or embodied struggle. The "understanding" arrives cleanly through puzzle-solving rather than forcing a difficult choice that forecloses a path. The final recognition feels more like intellectual completion than a decision with visible cost; she returns to her work "blithe as ever," which undercuts transformation. Interiority relies on elevated diction ("mapping the geometry of sacrifice") that reads more like theme assertion than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a single-POV accumulative design: Mara climbs the silo, decodes the tapestry, and gains understanding of her ancestor's blueprint. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the cemetery is reframed as an acoustic instrument—but the cost is oblique; Mara "will listen differently" without forfeiting a live option or paying a felt price on the page. Orientation anchors (cemetery gardener, silo, evening) arrive promptly. The lens holds through the ending, but the final image reconfigures meaning more than it crystallizes a choice with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo, rusted ladder, bullet holes, and milking stool provide vivid, specific anchors. The silo's midnight-blue paint "swallowed starlight" and the tapestry's frayed selvage constrain Mara's method of discovery. The setting charges the final image—"velveteen gloom preserved secrets"—and the cemetery's acoustic design becomes integral to closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's priorities (knowing thorns by name, mathematical flower arrangement). Minor: the farmland/graveyard boundary and the silo's interior scale could be more spatially precise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why her ancestor abandoned wealth to garden graves—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's decoding narrows options (she eliminates the sovereign case as misdirection), but no live alternative is foreclosed with on-page cost. The discovery reweights her daily work without altering her external tactics or imposing a visible price. The "quickening heart" and decision to "listen differently" function more as recognition than a tightening that forces a trade-off. Under an accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, yet the resolution feels intellectually complete rather than earned through pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—sacrifice, the geometry of loss, and inheritance as coded instruction—emerges organically from the tapestry, cemetery acoustics, and Mara's realization. The final image (cemetery as grief-instrument) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece avoids stating its thesis directly; the blueprint and coordinate code function as concrete particulars. Minor slip: "mapping the geometry of sacrifice" and "shape of intentions" edge toward abstract philosophizing in Mara's interiority, though the tapestry's physical decoding anchors the theme in action. The circular return to humming and tending carries quiet power.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, though elevated diction—"velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes," "filament of intention"—reads more literary than character-particular for a gardener, creating mild register drift. Perceptual signature is present (knowing thorns by name, mathematical precision), but under peak discovery the prose does not compress or shift rhythm to reflect urgency. Internal voice is coherent but tilts toward authorial lyricism rather than Mara's embodied idiom. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity is high; causality and spatial choreography track cleanly. However, figurative density is unrelenting—"velveteen gloom," "sentinel forgotten by time," "waking ghost," "geometry of sacrifice," "filament of intention," "plush shadows"—appearing in nearly every beat without escalation or payoff tied to pressure. Rhythm is uniform; sentence openings favor participial and prepositional phrases in a static pattern. Minor paraphrase loop: "uncharted echoes" repeats across paragraphs without evolving meaning. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the prose prioritizes texture over propulsion. The final paragraph succeeds in cadence and image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—gardener decodes ancestor's textile message in a silo—combines familiar elements (family mystery, cemetery setting, hidden code) without a sharp inflection. The acoustic-instrument cemetery offers a fresh angle, yet it arrives late and functions more as thematic payoff than a constraint shaping earlier choices. Emotional specificity is present in Mara's humming and tending, but the discovery arc follows a predictable trajectory: find artifact, decode, understand, return transformed. The tapestry-as-blueprint twist is clever but does not fundamentally alter the template. Voice is distinctive but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over lived particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her role (cemetery gardener) frames the story, but her choices are reactive rather than generative. She climbs, decodes, and understands without facing a decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The "blithe" attribute appears in the opening and closing but does not constrain or enable on-page action with cost. Present in setup and closure, but swappable with another curious inheritor without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in three beats: Mara approaches it in the silo, lifts the tapestry from it, and reflects on its purpose as "misdirection." Its function—container meant to distract—shapes the mystery's solution and participates in closure ("empty now, its purpose served"). Early signal, middle use, and closure presence satisfy three gates. However, its role is primarily passive; it could be replaced by another container (box, envelope) with minor edits. Causal pressure is moderate; it reweights meaning but does not constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" appears as thematic texture—voices in the silo, acoustics designed to "amplify uncharted echoes of grief"—but does not shape Mara's on-page choices or narrow her options. Mentioned in setup and closure as a descriptive element, yet the concept remains abstract and does not drive action. Present in final image, but ornamental rather than causal. It could be removed or swapped for "residual sorrow" without altering Mara's decoding or the cemetery's blueprint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" describes Mara's rose arrangement in the opening and the cemetery paths in the revelation, establishing a throughline. The trait connects to her "mathematical precision" and primes the discovery that her ancestor designed the grounds with acoustic geometry. Present in setup and closure, but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The attribute enriches characterization yet remains label-adjacent; it could be replaced by "carefully arranged" with minimal impact on plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Untangle" drives two key beats: Mara physically untangles the tapestry's fused threads to decode the message, and metaphorically untangles her family mystery. The action shapes her method, appears in both the middle decoding scene and the moment she "understood," and is irreplaceable—the frayed selvage and knot structure depend on untangling as the literal mechanism. Present in setup, middle, and closure. The action is causally central but could score higher if it imposed a visible cost or narrowed options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method—decoding frayed threads, reading knots and skipped stitches—is signaled when Mara lifts the tapestry and executed across two beats as she separates fibers and traces the warp/weft code. It shapes her discovery and participates in closure ("read the threads"). The mechanics matter: the selvage, knots, and weave are specific and irreplaceable. Present in all three gates. Scores in the solid range because the method is causally active, though it does not constrain earlier choices or impose a felt cost—it succeeds on first attempt without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt silo provides spatial anchor and houses the discovery; its "impossible shade" and bullet holes add texture. It frames the opening climb, the decoding interior, and the final reflection "under stars." Present in setup, middle, and closure. However, the silo is largely a static container; it does not pressure Mara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. A barn loft or cellar could substitute with minor edits. The setting enriches atmosphere but does not constrain tactics or charge the closure image with unique properties.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After the chess clock runs down" appears twice: framing the opening ("after the chess clock ran down on another day") and in reflection about the ancestor's life. The metaphor establishes tone but does not create urgency or tighten Mara's decisions. Time is vague—evening into night—without a live deadline that alters tactics. The chess-clock image is decorative rather than structural; it could be replaced by "as dusk settled" without changing plot mechanics. Present in setup and thematic reflection, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to discover the shape of intentions"—is stated and guides her decoding, but it is not dramatized through conflicted choices. She wants understanding and achieves it cleanly without friction between desire and cost. The phrase appears in the middle reflection and connects to closure, satisfying setup and payoff. However, the motivation is told more than shown; Mara does not face a trade-off where pursuing this knowledge forecloses another path or imposes visible cost. Functional but could be replaced by generic curiosity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" appears in the opening line, the silo interior, and the final reflection ("velveteen gloom preserved secrets"). The tone is coherent—soft darkness, muted mystery—and modulates subtly as Mara moves from humming outdoors to focused decoding to quiet resolve. It charges the final image by linking the tactile "velveteen" texture to secrecy and inheritance. Present in all three gates with thematic reprise. The tone is distinctive and irreplaceable, though it remains stable rather than escalating with pressure; a slightly sharper shift at peak discovery would elevate integration.</comment>
