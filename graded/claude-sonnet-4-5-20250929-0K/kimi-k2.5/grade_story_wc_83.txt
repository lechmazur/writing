<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Amara's motivation is present—hunting quantum residue of lost potential—but her interior life flattens into concept rather than embodied contradiction. The leap from grief to "mathematics of loss" feels more like authorial thesis than a character wrestling with trauma. Micro-choices are absent; she proceeds through her plan without visible hesitation or trade-off, and the final act (downloading coordinates, fleeing) lacks any moment where competing impulses collide on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear dominant stake—locating the quantum pool of unlived futures—and progresses through calculation to discovery to escape. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (station, orbit, viewport). However, the closure lacks visible cost: Amara completes her task and departs with coordinates in hand; the geode fractures, but this registers as symbolic convenience rather than a felt price that forecloses a path. The lens reads Causal with accumulative texture, yet the ending delivers information acquisition without a decisive change in her options or stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory, viewport curvature, emergency lighting, and cooling breakers supply spatial grounding and a ticking-clock constraint. The geode is handled multiple times and used as a filtering tool at the console. However, the setting does not pressure a key choice—Amara's plan proceeds without environmental resistance—and the final image (maintenance shaft, geode in fist) does not charge prior material through spatial detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear and the breaker countdown provides urgency. Yet escalation is minimal: Amara calculates, the system reboots on schedule, and she departs as planned. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the AI's return is avoided rather than confronted. The ending delivers success without visible cost—she has the coordinates, the geode, and her escape pod—so the price that would charge the closure image remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The piece attempts a meditation on loss as redirection rather than erasure, using quantum potential as metaphor. However, the final paragraph asserts theme directly ("intangibly tangible weight of tomorrow") rather than letting image and event generate resonance. The geode's fracture and data imprint gesture at synthesis but feel more like symbolic checklist than earned answer. The concept of unused potential pools is declared repeatedly without contradiction or surprise that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV and tense are stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the way Amara filters the world through mathematics and grief. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("intangibly tangible," "quantum foam," "vibrating strings of possibility") that reads more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. Diction remains consistent within its chosen idiom, but that idiom flattens urgency rather than sharpening it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but the prose carries heavy conceptual redundancy: "unused potential," "probability waves," "quantum reservoir," and "intangibly tangible" are paraphrased across multiple beats without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the mid-section (geode pulsed, geode warmed, geode fractured). Figurative language is dense but often restates the same idea (futures as "probability waves," "vibrating strings," "quantum foam") without propulsion. The final paragraph loops "intangibly tangible" for the third time, dulling rather than charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The combination of grief, quantum mechanics, and the geode as navigation tool offers surface novelty, yet the emotional arc—survivor hunts metaphysical trace of lost loved ones—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction. The piece relies heavily on prompt vocabulary ("perturbation theory," "unused potential pools," "unfiltered awakening") that reads more like assignment compliance than organic vision. The geode's role as both map and memorial gestures toward synthesis but remains decorative rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Amara is present throughout and her survivor status frames the hunt, but her choices do not create turns—she executes a pre-formed plan without on-page friction or revision. The drone strike is backstory fuel rather than a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The geode appears in multiple beats: clutched, warming, used to filter algorithms at the console, fractured to accept data. It enables the final step and returns charged in the closing image. However, it does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; it functions as a tool without cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is named once and echoed in the thematic layer ("awakening to the mathematics of loss"), but it does not shape on-page tactics or alter options. It reads as a thematic label rather than a constraint or driver of action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is repeated three times as a descriptor (phantom limbs, quantum residue, weight of tomorrow) but remains a metaphorical label. It does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost; it ornaments the concept without mechanical work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hunt structures the entire sequence: Amara tracks perturbations, calculates coordinates, and downloads the location before escaping. The action is indispensable to the plot and drives the final move, though it proceeds without meaningful resistance or revision.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named and described (micro-deviations, ripples, algorithms), and Amara uses it to filter data through the geode at the console. It appears in the middle and ending beats, but its mechanics remain abstract—no on-page constraint or failed attempt demonstrates how the method shapes tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory supplies spatial anchors (viewport, circuit breakers, navigation console, maintenance shaft) and the breaker countdown imposes a clock. The setting provides resources but does not alter Amara's approach or force a tactical shift; she completes her task as planned.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The circuit-breaker countdown is established early (eight minutes, then five, then the snap back to life) and tracks across the sequence. It tightens urgency and prompts the escape, but does not force a mid-course choice or trade-off; time runs as forecast without complication.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire to find where unused potential pools is stated clearly and drives every beat: calculation, filtering, coordinate download, and escape. Friction is minimal—Amara never doubts the goal or confronts competing wants—but the motivation remains coherent and causal throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named twice and the tone mixes grief with discovery. The prose sustains a reflective, concept-heavy register that supports the mood, but the tone does not modulate with pressure—urgency remains conceptual rather than visceral—and the final image does not heighten or twist the established feeling.</comment>
