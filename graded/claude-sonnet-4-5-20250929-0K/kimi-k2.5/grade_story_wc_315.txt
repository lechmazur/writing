<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is consistently embodied through the parachute buckle, micro-fracture detection, and muscle memory, grounding her expertise in physical sensation rather than abstract competence. Her fear manifests through breath-holding and twitching fingers, not therapy-speak. The trust/burden dynamic drives micro-choices (adjusting the clip angle, positioning at the edge) that alter tactics under pressure. Minor slip: Kael's interior state remains opaque on arrival; his whispered line feels slightly generic against the specificity of Elara's perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal with Accumulative/Textural accents (pattern-seeking, soundless echo motifs). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly within 120 words. The closure—Elara's rest after catching Kael—qualifies as Earned Stasis: the burden is carried through to dawn with visible cost (three-hour wait, breath held, fingers still resting on the buckle). The cost is felt but quiet; the final image reweights "watcher's burden" and "trust intact" without overt dramatization. One meaningful tightening occurs when she revises the clip angle to avoid the rogue thermal, narrowing options causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor, sulfuric mist, and stratospheric wind constrain Elara's choices (positioning, buckle adjustment) and charge the final image (collapse onto platform, landing lights). Sensory details—vapor walls, soundless echo through boots, cold metal teeth—are filtered through her professional attention. The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting, handled repeatedly and warming at closure. Minor gap: the "genetically engineered sequoia" and "salvaged glider wings" world-build but do not press a choice in the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Kael's survival/trust preservation, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: detecting the micro-fracture and revising the clip angle by three degrees narrows options causally, carrying him past the rogue thermal. The escalation is driven by Elara's agency (revision, positioning, emergency anchor readiness) with visible cost (the "burden of the watcher," breath held, muscle memory under pressure). No antagonist required; coincidence (sulfuric mist, thermal) complicates but does not resolve. The resolution is earned by her calculations and the chute blooming as predicted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust under pressure, the watcher's burden—emerges from particulars: the buckle, the revised angle, the soundless echo. The final image (Elara resting, fingers on warmed metal) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the silence after radio static and the shared relief "felt rather than heard." Minor slip: "preserve trust under pressure" and "the watcher's burden" are repeated as label-phrases slightly more than the particulars require, edging toward thematic echo in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is stable and tight. Perceptual signature is distinct: "midnight mathematics," stress points, drag coefficients, micro-fracture detection. Diction ("nocturnal arbor," "stratospheric wind," "sulfuric mist") matches her technical training without register drift. The brief dialogue from Kael ("You saw the pattern") is natural and goal-driven, advancing closure. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during the revision, longer breath at rest). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance pressure or world detail (micro-fracture, muscle memory, thermal detection). Rhythm varies purposefully: short beats during revision ("Her hands moved, not waiting for conscious confirmation"), longer cadence at closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Minor ding: "soundless echo" recurs four times with slight redundancy; the phrase "the burden of the watcher was not in the watching itself, but in the knowing" slightly over-explains. A few filter verbs ("she could see," "she had spotted") are acceptable but not strictly necessary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The midnight pattern seeker in a nocturnal arbor above clouds is a fresh synthesis; the parachute catch via micro-fracture detection and revised buckle angle transforms familiar trust/rescue material through specific technical detail. Muscle memory as method and "soundless echo" as motif feel purposeful. Minor limitation: the premise (guardian catching a jumper) is structurally familiar; transformation comes through world-specific detail (genetically engineered sequoia, sulfuric mist, stratospheric arbor) rather than a non-obvious moral calculus. The risk (technical density, quiet closure) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (midnight pattern seeker) makes the key decision to revise the clip angle by three degrees, altering tactics causally and driving the successful catch. Present in setup, middle revision, and closure (resting after the catch). Her choices—detecting the micro-fracture, positioning at the platform edge, emergency anchor readiness—create the story's turns. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the trait is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The parachute buckle appears in at least four beats: Elara turns it in her hands, spots the micro-fracture, revises the clip angle, secures Kael's harness to the arbor line, and rests fingers on the warmed metal at closure. It drives the revision (middle causal turn) and charges the final image. Strong early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage. Highly specific; no near-synonym could replace it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"The watcher's burden" is named three times and shapes Elara's stake (knowing her calculations are the only thread). It presses her positioning choice and frames the closure relief. Present in setup ("the watcher's burden pressed against her sternum"), middle explanation ("not in the watching itself, but in the knowing"), and closure ("carried the burden of watching through to dawn"). Strong thematic presence and one tactical choice (positioning at edge, leap readiness). Could score higher if the burden created a sharper on-page cost or visible tradeoff beyond waiting and breath-holding.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Attentively inventive" is shown through Elara's modification of the landing grid from salvaged glider wings and her revision of the buckle under pressure. It constrains her tactics (she must revise rather than rely on standard settings) and enables the catch. Present in setup (modified arbor grid) and middle revision. The trait is visible in action with cost (the three-degree calculation, the need to adjust mid-crisis). Could score higher if the inventiveness faced a sharper on-page friction or failure mode.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Revise" drives the major turn: Elara revises the clip angle by three degrees to avoid the rogue thermal, changing Kael's trajectory and ensuring the catch. The action is signaled early (buckle adjustment), executed mid-story, and pays off at closure (chute blooms in the safe corridor). It cannot be swapped; the revision is the hinge of success. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage. Swapping "revise" for "adjust" or "correct" would not alter the structure, capping at high 8s rather than 9+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Muscle memory is signaled early ("the same motion she had performed a thousand times during her own jumps") and shapes the revision: "Her hands moved, not waiting for conscious confirmation, guided by the embodied knowledge of falls survived." It enables the buckle adjustment under pressure and reappears at closure ("her hands finding his harness with the precision of long practice"). Present in setup, middle execution, and closure. Strong causal work and specificity. Could score higher if the method faced a friction (e.g., memory failing under new conditions) with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor above the clouds pressures Elara's choices: the platform sways in stratospheric wind, noise behaves differently, the modified landing grid (salvaged glider wings, tension cables) is her tool. It supplies the catch zone and constrains positioning (edge of platform, emergency leap readiness). Present in setup, middle (platform sway, vapor walls), and closure (landing lights, collapse onto platform). Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage. The setting is irreplaceable; the arbor's height and modification are structural.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" frames the story's start and the silence that follows. The seventeen-minute countdown to drop tightens tactics (revision must happen now) and the live clock is felt in Elara's waiting and breath-holding. Present in setup (three-hour wait, seventeen minutes remaining), middle (speck growing, chute furled), and closure (chute blooms, descent). The timeframe shapes pressure but does not alter a choice as sharply as other elements. Could score higher if the countdown forced a visible tradeoff or if time scarcity created a friction at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To preserve trust under pressure" is Elara's dominant motive, dramatized through waiting, detecting the micro-fracture, revising the buckle, and positioning for emergency leap. It conflicts with fear (the burden, breath-holding) and drives the revision choice. Present in setup ("ensure that when Kael descended...he would find the catch zone waiting exactly where promised"), middle revision, and closure ("the trust intact"). Strong friction between wants (trust preservation) and cost (the watcher's burden). Could reach 8+ if the trust faced a sharper on-page test or if Elara's fear nearly prevented the revision.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Soundless echo" recurs four times, modulating from environmental detail (sequoia creaking "with a soundless echo that vibrated through her boots") to emotional charge (heartbeat, shared relief). It coheres through turns and charges the final image. Tone is consistent (quiet, technical, sensory) and supports the watcher's burden theme. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Could score higher if the tone shifted more sharply under peak pressure or if the final "soundless echo of their shared relief" reweighted prior uses with greater conceptual cost.</comment>
