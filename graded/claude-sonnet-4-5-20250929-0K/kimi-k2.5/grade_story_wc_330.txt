<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's thirteen-year silence and persistent carpentry are established traits with consistent embodiment through the observation of "wood grain, to wind, to the spaces between heartbeats." His unlocking voice and decision to return with tools shows a choice with cost. However, the piece leans heavily on reflection and summary rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure; the motivation is richly told but the on-page conflict is largely internal meditation. The final stance feels less earned by dramatic struggle than by lyric accumulation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (abandoned circus train, Elias, dawn) land within the opening lines. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias holds the halo fragment under the sky, understanding his silence was a song all along, with the cost legible in thirteen years of voicelessness now reweighted. The piece accumulates motifs—carousel, silence, fragment, song—and the final image recharges them without a decisive external change. One minor slip: the narrative occasionally drifts into exposition about what Elias "understood" rather than showing the realization through image alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train and improvised greenhouse (ferns, mist, shattered glass) anchor the scene with vivid, purpose-driven detail. The halo fragment on the marble pedestal and the wind bells supply recurring objects that constrain the sequence and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: dining car → corridor → observation car → outside. The mist and birch forest modulate atmosphere in step with Elias's emotional arc. Minor cap applied per Q2 orientation debt would not trigger here; no debt was assessed.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reclaiming voice/carousel craft through the halo fragment. The wrong turn into the hidden oasis provides one meaningful tightening; touching the fragment unlocks his voice with immediate on-page consequence (he sings, the fragment vibrates, ferns unfurl). However, the escalation is more lyric accumulation than contested pressure—no antagonist, no external opposition, and the cost (thirteen years) is historical rather than paid in present friction. The piece meets the Accumulative lens standard but the protagonist's struggle is primarily internal and summative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as workshop, emptiness as potential, craft as devotion. The halo fragment and carousel motif recur with shifting weight, culminating in the final image where the fragment "scattered light like seeds," reweighting the premise without stating a moral. The piece resists tidy resolution—Elias remains silent but "no longer voiceless"—and the insight (silence was never prison but workshop) is earned through his thirteen-year practice. One minor slip: occasional phrases ("infinite potential for creation") veer toward abstract philosophizing rather than staying anchored in image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices brass gears, sanded oak, scrollwork—craftsman's details. Voice modulates from ruin-walk to lyric wonder in the greenhouse without head-hopping. However, reflection dominates many beats ("understanding now that silence had never been his prison"), and some sentences lean into elevated, poetic register ("symphony in stillness") that occasionally floats above embodied perception. Filter verbs ("He realized," "He understood") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with vivid imagery: "velvet rot," "sequins like dried scales," "whispering gleam." Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure breathes. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "quietly persistent nature" is repeated, and adjacent lines restate ideas without added pressure (e.g., "silence had never been his prison but his workshop" / "emptiness held infinite potential"). Template cadence is detectable in the final paragraphs ("He turned to leave… He held the halo fragment up… He walked toward the horizon"). Filter-verb stacks ("He realized," "He understood," "knowing he would return") cluster in the closure beat, applying −0.5 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of silent carpenter, carousel restoration, and vocal unlocking via a halo fragment offers a fresh angle. The wrong-turn-to-oasis motif and the lyric equation of silence with possibility feel specific rather than template-derived. However, the core arc (rediscovering lost voice through magical object) echoes familiar quest-restoration structures, and the piece does not take bold structural risks beyond its accumulative lens. Transformation is present but incremental; the final image reweights prior material without fully surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias (silent carousel carpenter) is present throughout, drives the exploration, and makes the decision to return with tools. His trait (silence) shapes perception and the unlocking moment. However, most of his "choices" are observational or internal; the key on-page action (touching the fragment, singing) happens *to* him as much as *by* him. Middle development is dramatized but the character functions more as vessel than agent in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears early (~40% mark), is handled and held in multiple beats (touch unlocks voice, vibrates during song, clasped to chest, held to sky at closure), and its properties (whispering gleam, warmth, vibration) evolve with each touch. It is causally active: unlocking voice, projecting horse shadows, scattering light. Closure participation is strong; the final image depends on it. Minor swappability: another "lost carousel piece" could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Misting hush" is named twice and evoked through fog/mist imagery in the greenhouse. It modulates atmosphere and is tied thematically to silence and possibility, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. It functions more as mood descriptor than stake-shaping force. Closure participation is metaphorical ("settled into a new quiet") rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly persistent" is labeled once and demonstrated through Elias's steady carpentry habits and his approach to the fragment. It enables the unlocking moment (patience rewards him) but the trait is more backdrop than active constraint—no on-page beat where persistence costs him or forces a tradeoff. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Singing is the central transformative action: it unlocks after touching the fragment, resonates with the halo, causes ferns to unfurl and shadows to appear, and marks Elias's reclamation of voice. It drives the climax and shapes the ending (he stops singing but the fragment continues to hum). Causal and irreplaceable. Minor limiter: the act itself is brief and somewhat passive (it "began" rather than a hard choice to sing).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"A wrong turn leads to a hidden oasis" is signaled early (corridor that shouldn't exist) and is the mechanism that delivers the halo fragment and greenhouse. It constrains the sequence: no wrong turn, no discovery. However, the method is coincidental rather than shaped by Elias's agency, and it does not return or complicate later beats. Setup and payoff present; middle development thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train anchors the entire story, supplies tactile detail (velvet rot, sequins, ferns, mist), and its nested spaces (dining car, corridor, observation car) structure the exploration. The greenhouse environment affects the climax (mist deepens, ferns unfurl during song). Closure scene remains inside/adjacent to the train. The setting is essential and irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Inside the chime of wind bells" frames the middle section and is mentioned at entry and exit ("marking the end of the timeframe"). However, the timeframe is vague—no live clock, no ticking urgency—and Elias's actions do not race against it. It functions more as lyric bracket than pressure device. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To interpret silence as possibility" is stated early as Elias's "deepest motivation" and recurs at closure ("silence had never been his prison but his workshop"). It shapes his thirteen-year trajectory and justifies his response to the fragment. However, the motivation is mostly told rather than tested by friction or competing wants on the page. It drives theme more than on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Whispering gleam" is named once and evoked through the halo fragment's light (soft gradients, neither bright nor dim, living warmth, scattering light like seeds). Tone is consistently hushed, luminous, and reverent across the piece, modulating from ruin-melancholy to wonder without tonal breaks. The final image charges it (light scattered as seeds). Coherent and purposeful, but the label itself is ornamental; the tonal work would stand without the phrase.</comment>
