<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation is declared ("to preserve wonder in routine") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. Interiority remains abstract—"communicated through the grinding of gears, a sound like glaciers calving"—without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal internal conflict. The identities' resistance and surrender are told rather than enacted through on-page tension. The librarian's arc lacks visible cost; the task proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a before (wandering identities) and after (crystallized records), and the librarian's task completes on the page, satisfying basic closure. However, cost remains asserted rather than felt—"excess fear escapes" and identities "surrender their restlessness" without on-page friction or visible forfeiture. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (atrium, librarian, moon, tides by ~80 words). No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the smelting proceeds as expected without reversal or tactical adjustment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is anchored vividly with sensory particulars (marble floor, saltwater, glass dome, pale gold light) and the moon-phase mechanic is integrated into setting pressure. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The bamboo creel and furnace chambers in the librarian's chest function as micro-setting that constrains the smelting process, lifting the score toward the 7.0 gate, though the creel's role is more vessel than active constraint that alters a key choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving migrating identities—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. The identities arrive, resist briefly, then surrender without meaningful pressure or cost that narrows options. The librarian's moon-phase weakness is mentioned but does not force a tactical trade-off or complication. No reversal or tightening occurs; the smelting completes as planned. Coincidence does not resolve, but protagonist agency does not drive a turning point either.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme—wonder preserved in routine, migration leading to home—emerges through images (tides, moon phases, bamboo creel) and the identities' transformation. The closing crystalline records and the humming tune offer resonance without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph's explicit statement "that wonder survives best when woven into the everyday like reeds in a fisherman's creel" is thematic echo that reduces subtlety (−0.5). The piece resists simplistic binaries and earns a coherent conceptual stance, but the last lines drift toward summary rather than letting the image stand alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to the librarian; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("titan-gear," "migrating identities," "smelt them into the permanent record"), though some phrases skirt abstraction ("essence," "luminescent fog," "captured amazement"). The prose maintains a distinct, formal texture appropriate to the mechanical narrator, and the voice modulates subtly with the tide and moon imagery. No dialogue is present; filter verbs ("communicated," "conveyed") are voice-motivated and legible. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the opening third. The piece avoids paraphrase loops and maintains clarity. However, several lines lean toward overwriting: "shimmering like heat waves," "luminescent fog that smelled of cedar and old rain," "pale gold light filtering through the glass dome" cluster figurative language densely without pattern-teaching (−0.4). Metaphor coherence holds, but the final paragraph's "like salt left behind by evaporating water, or like amber holding ancient motion" stacks similes where one would suffice. No scaffold or template cadence appears. Propulsion remains steady but does not accelerate under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—mechanical librarian preserving wandering identities after time breaks—offers a fresh synthesis of surreal elements. The bamboo creel as crucible and the moon-phase fluctuation are specific, non-obvious details. However, the emotional arc (resistance → acceptance → integration) follows a predictable template without a sharp turn. The "wonder in routine" resolution, though thematically coherent, lacks the friction or ambiguity that would elevate originality. The piece commits fully to its surreal logic without retreat, but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks beyond the premise itself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian is present throughout and performs the smelting action, but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The task proceeds as planned without internal conflict or choice under pressure. The librarian's presence is functional but not causal to a turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fisherman's bamboo creel appears in three distinct beats: held empty, lowered into brine to capture identities, and serving as crucible during the smelt. Its woven gaps allow "excess fear to escape while retaining the essential wonder," constraining the smelting method. It is named again in the final third as "the bridge between wandering and rest." The creel is integral to the action and charged at closure, but does not drive a reversal or choice, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Migrating identities are the central stake, introduced early ("souls that had slipped their anchors"), dramatized on arrival ("shimmering like heat waves"), and transformed through the smelting action. The concept shapes the librarian's task and the piece's closure (crystalline records). Their resistance and surrender form the narrative arc, and the final humming identity charges the ending image. The concept is irreplaceable and drives both middle action and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The moon-phase fluctuation is introduced in paragraph two ("strength fluctuated with moon phases"), constrains the librarian's power during the task ("with the moon a slender promise...the great gears struggled"), and recurs at closure ("worked through the turning of the tide...when the moon set"). However, the constraint does not force a visible trade-off or alter tactics; the smelting succeeds despite the weakness. The attribute is present and coherent but does not drive a choice with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Smelting is the major action: signaled early ("smelt them into the permanent record"), executed on the page ("opening furnace chambers in its chest"), and completed at closure ("the smelting was complete"). The action transforms wandering identities into crystalline records, making it indispensable to the narrative arc. The method is specific (furnace in the librarian's chest, bamboo creel as crucible) and irreplaceable. Removing or swapping the action would break the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Accepting contradictions is introduced as the "difficult work" and the librarian "convey[s] that permanence and motion were not opposites but partners." The method is named explicitly and the identities' transformation hinges on this acceptance ("one by one, the migrating identities surrendered their restlessness"). It shapes the middle action and thematic resolution, but the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page demonstration of how contradictions are accepted. Present and functional, but not dramatized with visible cost or tactical detail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is introduced immediately, anchors all action, and provides the rhythm that defines existence ("filled and emptied with saltwater twice daily"). The tide's turning sets the task's deadline ("arrived at low tide," "worked through the turning of the tide," "tide reached its peak") and the marble floor's flooding shapes spatial choreography. The setting is inseparable from the story's closure and provides the structural pulse. Removing the atrium would require fundamental restructuring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" is introduced in the opening and establishes the story's conceptual frame (time pooled rather than flowed). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the smelting proceeds without a ticking clock or tactical pressure tied to the absence of tomorrow. The concept is present thematically and recurs in the closing ("after tomorrow disappears, one must find the infinite within the repeated"), but it does not constrain on-page action with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve wonder in routine is stated early ("preserve what mattered") and shapes the librarian's task. The identities' transformation into routine (dancer → rhythm of tides, astronomer → moon phases) enacts this desire. The closing records "teach the next arrivals...that wonder survives best when woven into the everyday." The motivation drives the arc and closure, but is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between the librarian's desire and competing costs. The final articulation borders on thematic echo but remains grounded in the creel image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Wintersun serenity is anchored in "wintersun serenity of the atrium deepened as dawn approached, pale gold light" and recurs at closure ("wintersun climbed higher, casting long, serene shadows"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly with the task's completion. Diction ("slender promise," "glaciers calving," "captured amazement") sustains the calm, formal register throughout. The tone charges the final image (humming tune, turning world) without breaking under pressure. Not indispensable—another tone could serve—but well integrated and purposeful.</comment>
