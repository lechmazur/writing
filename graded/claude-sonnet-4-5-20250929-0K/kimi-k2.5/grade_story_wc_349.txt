<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is heavy on abstraction ("integrated fragmentation," "quantifying absence") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to find "the place where stories begin" is declared but never faces a concrete test that forces a trade-off until the final paragraph, where she steps through without visible internal conflict. The choice to abandon parole and cart feels more asserted than earned by prior micro-decisions under pressure. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we see measurement and gesture but no visceral hesitation or contradictory impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a situational lens (Elara's bounded exploration within parole constraints) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: she crosses into the white room, abandoning vendor identity for "the silence between words." Cost is conceptual—freedom forfeited, servitude left behind—but remains abstract rather than felt in embodied consequence. Orientation anchors arrive late (who/where/when coalesce only after the opening sentence's lyric density), applying a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The causal chain from measurement to incision to threshold is more thematic than because/therefore linked; the measurements never constrain a prior tactical choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and cloud-sea are vividly rendered but function as backdrop rather than constraint; no choice depends on spatial access or environmental pressure. The bottles appear on the cart and are scattered, but their placement doesn't alter Elara's access to the white room. Spatial choreography is coherent (cart, shelves, alcoves, threshold), and sensory detail is selective, but the setting remains ornamental to the core conflict. The cap from orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) holds Q3 at 7.0 maximum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching the origin point of stories—is signaled early but never tightens into a forced trade-off until the final paragraph. Elara measures and calculates, yet no measurement fails or forces a revised tactic; the parole flickers as warning but doesn't block her physically or test resolve mid-scene. The incision and threshold appear as results of her method rather than hard-won reversals. Cost at closure (abandoning cart and parole) is declared but not dramatized through visible hesitation or sacrifice that alters her stance incrementally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of origin, silence, and erasure emerges from the recurring images of moonlight, absence, and the white room. The final image—Elara becoming "the silence between words"—offers a resonant reconfiguration that reweights her vendor identity without moralizing. However, the thematic vocabulary leans abstract ("integrated fragmentation," "quantifying absence") and risks label-speak, reducing embodied particularity. The moonlight bottles and measured voids function more as symbols than as concrete pressures that test her values, softening thematic impact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steadily to Elara's perception, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("breathless pause," "amber time," "nursery of narrative"), reading as consistent narrative voice rather than POV-specific cognition. The prose remains legible but filter-heavy ("She was," "Her presence here depended on"), dulling immediacy in high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on measurement and absence, but the lexicon (e.g., "surgical intention," "negative portrait") drifts toward abstract/academic register that feels imposed rather than character-organic under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density in almost every sentence ("clouds swirled...in patterns," "books that grew," "amber time," "heat distortion," "negative portrait," "incised the air") without pattern-teaching or escalation payoff, applying −0.6 for density. Mixed metaphors appear ("glass orchard library," "negative portrait of human absence," "nursery of narrative") without physical coherence. Paraphrase loops are present: "mindfully scattered" appears twice, and the final two paragraphs restate her departure in overlapping terms. Template cadence: "She had not come to sell… She had come to find…" and "Three point seven seconds… Forty-two centimeters…" without dramatized linkage. Deductions total approximately −1.2 to −1.4 in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat ("scattered mindfully" recurs in the final paragraph), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise of a parole-bound vendor seeking narrative origin in a floating glass library offers fresh synthesis of metaphor and setting. However, the core transformation—vendor abandons cart to become silence—follows a familiar arc of self-erasure/transcendence without a non-obvious complication or moral calculus. Specific details (quantified absence, incised air) are imaginative but remain decorative rather than driving irreplaceable turns. The ending feels inevitable from the opening rather than earned through unexpected friction, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her vendor role frames the opening, but her decisions (scattering bottles, measuring absence, cutting the incision) are not tested or opposed until the final paragraph. She observes and acts methodically without mid-scene reversal or cost that alters tactics. Her choice to step through the threshold is declared rather than dramatized through hesitation or consequence that changes prior options. Present in setup and closure but minimal causal pressure in development, capping around 4.6 for missing middle pressure; small lift for closure participation to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears in three beats: initial cart description, the rattling as she reaches toward the source, and the final scattering/abandonment. The bottles are handled and repositioned, and their "weight of forgotten yesterdays" links to the erasure theme. However, they do not constrain a mid-scene choice or enable a tactic under pressure; Elara's access to the white room does not depend on their properties. Present in setup, middle, and closure with charged reprise, but lack of causal pressure or cost tied to their use limits the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Glimmering parole is signaled early ("conditional release") and recurs at the threshold moment ("flickered as she reached"), framing her violation of the fundamental rule. It shapes the stake (she risks parole by seeking genesis) and appears at closure (she abandons it). However, the parole never physically constrains her movement or forces a mid-scene tactical choice; the risk is declared but not tested. Present in setup and closure with thematic weight, but minimal development pressure, landing around 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" appears twice: once describing bottle placement on the cart and again in the final paragraph. The trait enables her method (constellation of absence) but does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost. The scattering is more thematic gesture than functional pressure; removing "mindfully" would not alter the story's logic. Present in setup and closure reprise, but lack of causal constraint or mid-scene cost caps around 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The incision action appears in two beats: "She incised the air with her finger" opens the seam, and "Her finger cut deeper" widens the threshold. It is the decisive act that enables closure and cannot be easily swapped. However, it arrives late (final third) and resolves a problem (reaching the white room) without prior failed attempts or costs that shaped earlier tactics. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability lift it above mid-band despite late introduction, landing around 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Quantifying absence is signaled early and detailed across multiple beats (measuring silences, tracking mist distances, calculating vacuum). The method shapes her approach and is present at closure ("by measuring what was missing—she calculated the exact coordinates"). However, the measurements do not fail or force revised tactics; they accumulate descriptively rather than causally. Present in setup, development, and closure with thematic coherence, but lack of on-page constraint or cost limits to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and cloud-sea are vividly established in the opening and recur throughout. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that alter her approach; she measures and cuts the air without environmental obstacle. The library floats as backdrop rather than crucible. Present in setup and referenced at closure, but missing functional development that constrains action, capping around 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The lull and opening day are mentioned in the second paragraph and recur ("The lull deepened, the store's opening day stuttering"). However, the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten Elara's decisions; she works during quiet without a ticking clock. The moment "hung suspended in amber time" actively removes temporal pressure. Present in setup and referenced at closure, but the effect is to suspend rather than compress time, and no tactic depends on the time window. Swappable without structural loss, landing around 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to find "the place where stories begin" is declared early ("She had come to find") and shapes the entire arc, appearing at closure when she steps into "the white room where all tales germinated." It is sustained and drives her method. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicted micro-choices or visible cost until the final paragraph; we see pursuit but not hesitation or trade-off. Present across all three gates with strong closure linkage, but minimal friction in development, landing around 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Integrated fragmentation is enacted through the lyric, mosaic description and the final image of Elara "integrated into the fragmentation she had once merely sold." The tone is consistently elevated and abstract, with figurative density throughout. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure; measurements and threshold-crossing carry identical lyric register without escalation or breathlessness. Present in setup and charged at closure, but static mood through turns limits to mid-band.</comment>
