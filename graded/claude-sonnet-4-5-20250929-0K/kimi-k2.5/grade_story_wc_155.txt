<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's journey from shuttered artist to rekindled creator is embodied through concrete actions—kneeling to uncover the fresco, hanging film strips, painting with phosphorescent pigments. Internal conflict appears in "stubborn spark" after "years of ash," though the progression from despair to joy accelerates without substantial on-page resistance or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to carry the daydream "folded in her pocket" reads as acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost, meeting baseline motivation but not the Q1 9+ test of contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece operates through density increase and pattern layering—mycorrhizal whispers, exposed film, phosphorescent paint, projected memories—that converge in the fog gallery. Orientation anchors (Mara, ruined orchard, daydream fold) arrive early. The closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (joy "exposed and waiting, like film held too long in the chemical dark"), reweighting her creative capacity through the final sun-touching-fresco image. One meaningful deepening occurs when she begins painting light and the trees pulse bioluminescence in response, though the conceptual cost (returning to "gray apartment and empty studio") is stated rather than dramatized with visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fog functions as both atmosphere and canvas, constraining visibility while enabling the light-paint gallery; the fresco fragment grounds the orchard's history and charges the final sun-beam moment. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "taste of silver and rain," "fog curled like stale wool," "ceramic with a hollow chime." Spatial choreography remains clear across Mara's movement from walking to kneeling to hanging film to painting. The environment actively participates—root systems pulse bioluminescence, trees serve as witnesses—meeting the Q3 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging the final image, though the daydream frame slightly softens the stakes' material weight.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rediscovering creative joy, signaled early through "hands empty and heart shuttered." Pressure accumulates through the knowledge network's guidance, the fresco discovery, and the alchemical marriage of light-paint and film. One meaningful deepening occurs when the trees add bioluminescence, transforming Mara's solo act into collaboration. Agency appears in her choice to paint the air and work faster, though the daydream frame and the trees' convenient participation reduce the sense of resistance. The cost—returning to the gray apartment with only a "secret negative"—is conceptual rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows on-page options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: joy as latent film awaiting development, creation outlasting ruin, light finding the sensitive. The fresco-to-fog-gallery progression and the final sun-touching-painted-face image offer a resonant answer without explicit moralizing. Subtext operates in the knowledge network as underground memory, the exposed film as unrealized potential. Minor thematic echo: "creation outlasts ruin" arrives as narrative assertion rather than dramatized discovery, and "she remained sensitive" skirts label-speak, though the photographic metaphor system integrates tightly enough to sustain resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyrical register: "logic wore soft edges," "time breathed slowly," "fog her infinite wall." Perceptual signature filters through an artist's lens—chromatic joy, symphonies of color, alchemical marriage. Psychic distance compresses during peak creation ("Mara laughed, the sound surprising her") without head-hopping. Elevated diction ("mycorrhizal threads," "phosphorescent pigments") fits the voice-motivated aesthetic consciousness. Register drifts slightly into expository clarity during the knowledge-network explanation and the "exposed film had done its work" summary, where the voice smooths into explanatory mode rather than maintaining the dreamy compression established in the opening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with strong individual images ("fog curled like stale wool," "silver halides eager to receive new information"). Information density is high in the opening third; middle beats begin paraphrasing the same creative rekindling across multiple sentences ("shadows that crept into her workshop and silenced her brushes" / "years of ash" / "darkness lately"). Template cadence appears in the film-hanging, pigment-opening, painting sequence where each beat follows "Then she [verb]" structure. The photographic metaphor system (exposed, latent, developer's tray, sensitive) recurs with purpose but borders on over-saturation in the final third. Figurative language clusters densely without always advancing pressure: "dissolving like sugar in tea," "folded like soft dough," "like prayer flags" within close proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of mycorrhizal knowledge network, camera obscura, phosphorescent pigments, and fog-as-canvas offers a specific, non-obvious angle on artist-recovery narratives. The fresco-to-fog-gallery bridge across centuries transforms the stock rediscovery arc through fantastical naturalism. Emotional specificity ("pensive mirth," "stubborn spark after years of ash") avoids generic templates. However, the daydream frame and the convenient tree-collaboration soften stakes, and the core emotional arc (blocked artist finds inspiration in liminal space, returns renewed) follows a recognizable template. The piece commits fully to its premise but retreats slightly by framing the entire event as daydream, reducing the transformation's material weight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; her choice to follow the knowledge network cartography, uncover the fresco, hang film, and paint with phosphorescent pigments drives all major beats. The decision to work faster and the final choice to carry the daydream as "secret negative" alter her stance. However, the daydream frame reduces agency—she is guided by tree-whispers rather than generating autonomous turns. Two gates met (setup, development, payoff); causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but passive ("she would carry").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (eastern wall, hollow chime, emerald moss reveal), the fresco fragment depicts "laughing face surrounded by golden fruit" with "residual warmth." It reappears when it "seemed to glow in response" during the light-painting and again in the final sun-touching moment, bridging centuries and charging closure. Handled twice (uncovering, final sun-beam), with reweighted meaning at the end. Three gates met; causal pressure moderate (it teaches Mara what the trees "had been trying to display"); closure linkage strong; specificity high (laughing face, golden fruit, preserved by fog).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Exposed film strips are present early ("strange fragments... scattered among root systems"), hung from branches, and trigger reaction through light-paint. The concept shapes the central action—chemical exposure completing what life interrupted. At closure, "exposed film had done its work" by proving "the light still knew how to find her." Three gates met; beat involvement (discovery, hanging, developing); causal pressure present (enables the fog gallery); closure linkage strong ("she remained sensitive"). The metaphorical extension (Mara as film awaiting development) is thematic but the film's physical properties constrain the middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The phosphorescent pigments ground from fireflies and plankton enable the air-painting that triggers film development and creates the fog gallery. Introduced at the 60% mark ("opened her tin"), slightly late. Used in one extended beat (painting sweeping gestures, bending light). The trait is specific and irreplaceable (phosphorescent enables the light-capture mechanic), but it resolves a problem (developing the film) it did not help create earlier. Two gates met (development, payoff); causal pressure moderate; late introduction −0.3; problem-solving without prior setup −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Display" operates throughout: the knowledge network trying to display through networked memories, Mara displaying her past through the fog gallery, images beginning to "display themselves upon the fog." The action shapes the major turn (gallery materializing) and closure (final image fading). Swappable with "show" or "project" in many instances, reducing irreplaceability. Three gates met; beat involvement high (network whispers, fog projection, final fade); causal pressure strong; closure linkage present; but specificity moderate due to synonym overlap.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mycorrhizal knowledge network appears early (organic whispers, communications between dying trees, fungal threads) and guides Mara to the eastern wall. It hums approval and adds bioluminescence during painting, then whispers farewell. Mechanics are poetic rather than constraining—it provides convenient guidance without cost or limitation. Three gates met but causal pressure is low (it solves orientation and provides collaboration without friction). The network enables rather than shapes attempts; Mara does not negotiate with or struggle against it. Ornamental late addition (bioluminescence) −0.4; swappable with generic "intuition" or "map" −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district frames the entire piece: ancient apple trees, thick fog obscuring sky, root systems, eastern wall, ceramic hollow chime, emerald moss. The fog functions as infinite wall/canvas, enabling the light-paint mechanic. Setting supplies the fresco, the trees as witnesses/collaborators, the atmospheric conditions for film exposure. Three gates met; beat involvement across all major moves; causal pressure high (fog preserves fresco, enables projection, becomes her studio); closure linkage strong (fog lifts to let sun touch fresco); specificity high (centuries of fog, mycorrhizal threads, bowed apple trees).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" frames the opening and closing ("she would wake soon"), establishing the experience as liminal/oneiric. Time is explicitly soft ("hours or perhaps for mere breaths," "time breathed slowly," "time folded upon itself"). The daydream frame reduces rather than tightens stakes—nothing material is at risk. Timeframe does not constrain tactics or create urgency; instead it licenses logic to "wear soft edges." Two gates met (setup, payoff) but development absent; no live clock; pressure reduced by the frame; closure weakened (she simply wakes). Frame-as-escape-hatch −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to rediscover joy is introduced early ("fierce happiness had evaporated slowly, leaving her hands empty and heart shuttered") and drives her to follow the knowledge network, uncover the fresco, and paint. The "stubborn spark" rekindling and her laughter ("the sound surprising her") dramatize the motivation's arc. At closure, "joy was not lost, merely exposed and waiting" articulates the realization. Three gates met; beat involvement moderate (following trees, painting, final understanding); friction appears in "years of ash" and "shadows that crept into her workshop," though on-page resistance is minimal—the trees conveniently guide, the fog cooperates, the process succeeds. Cost is stated ("gray apartment and empty studio") rather than enacted. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong but summary-inflected −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone blends melancholy and delight from the opening ("taste of silver and rain," "logic wore soft edges") through "pensive yet genuine, a mixture of sorrow and delight" to "pensive mirth" in the penultimate paragraph. The oxymoron holds across turns—the fog is both protective and obscuring, the past both lost and recoverable. Tone modulates with pressure: somber in the "years of ash" reflection, lighter during the laugh, charged in the final sun-touching image. Coherence strong; modulation purposeful; closure charge present ("still smiling with pensive mirth"). The label "pensive mirth" appears explicitly twice, reducing subtlety −0.2, but the tone itself is earned through diction and image.</comment>
