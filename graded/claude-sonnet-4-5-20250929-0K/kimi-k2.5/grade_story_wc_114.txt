<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is well-differentiated through her professional oracle framing and fever-recovery state, with embodied trembling and vision smearing. The motivation to measure her delirium's damage is consistent, and the final choice to center the illustration demonstrates agency with visible cost (moving from margin-dwelling to confrontation). Internal contradiction operates effectively through her history of rounding toward hope versus present acknowledgment. Minor deduction: the "complicity" realization in paragraph 5 edges toward diagnostic clarity that feels slightly over-articulated for someone just emerging from fever, though it remains grounded in concrete observations.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elara, weather station, post-fever dawn) land cleanly in the opening lines. The accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds through layered realizations (smudged illustration → weeks of dismissed anomalies → complicity in hiding warming trends) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when she tapes the illustration at the center of the log, a Charged Poise moment that crystallizes her stance shift from peripheral observer to confronter with undeniable conceptual cost (acknowledging her role in climate-data manipulation). The cost is legible in her physical placement of evidence and the "could no longer treat the anomaly as peripheral" closure beat. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is vividly rendered through triple-glazed window, anemometer shadow, satellite uplink hum, and steel struts contracting in cold—all filtered through Elara's professional attention. The setting constrains choice: she moves along margins, avoids the transmission console center, and the old logbooks yield the botanical illustration that becomes the story's pivot object. The auroral dawn and frost-rimed desk charge the final image. Micro-setting (the desk, the glass, the console) functions as purposeful constraint rather than postcard description, and the anemometer's closing presence reinforces her interpretive uncertainty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—measuring and confronting the damage her fever-distorted reports caused—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery of prior anomalies she had dismissed. The escalation operates through accumulative deepening: personal error → systemic complicity → climate catastrophe acknowledgment. Agency is present in her final act of centering the illustration, a renunciation of margin-dwelling that forecloses her prior coping method with visible cost (she must now "see it"). The cost is conceptual and relational (complicity in warming-trend concealment) and legible in the final beat. One meaningful pressure point is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—complicity in systemic failure through small accommodations—emerges organically from Elara's professional oracle role, her habit of "occupying margins," and the warming-trend data she quietly adjusted. The botanical illustration functions as both literal evidence (upward plant migration) and charged image of adaptation under climate collapse. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: moving the anomaly from footnote to center is both tactical correction and symbolic acknowledgment, reweighting prior "fault tolerance" as moral evasion. "Auroral sorrow" fuses beauty and devastation without stating a moral, and the final anemometer image—readings "swaying between seasons, between what had been true and what was becoming real"—reprices certainty itself. No overt thesis or label-speak appears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly filtered through Elara's professional-oracle lens and fever-recovery state. Perceptual signature is distinctive: "isobars had danced like fever dreams," "reality and hallucination bleeding together in watercolor washes," and the anemometer shadow as "finger pointing toward the margins" all reflect her meteorological training and current disorientation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during smudging, slightly wider during reflection on weeks of denial). Diction remains within her plausible lexicon—technical terms (barometric pressure, isobars, scree) anchor voice, and elevated phrasing ("fault-tolerant oracle," "logarithmic records") fits her scientist role. No head-hopping. Minor note: "specific gravity of what she had consumed" in paragraph 5 is a shade abstract for peak emotional pressure, though the metaphor is internally coherent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and opening/closing images are strong. Information density is high throughout, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or thematic layering. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of paragraphs 1, 4, and 6—"auroral sorrow," "luminous," "finger pointing," "swaying certainties," "vessel at sea," "watercolor washes," "skin too tight," "bruised purple," "charged particles of grief"—creating moderate overwriting that slightly dulls momentum during high-pressure beats. The accumulation doesn't fully obscure causality but adds texture where directness would sharpen. Minor filter-verb presence ("seemed to pitch," "realized she had been") is acceptable but clusters in paragraph 4. No loops or template cadence. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate scientist, fever recovery, and botanical-evidence discovery is specific and non-obvious, with the "fault-tolerant oracle" frame offering fresh inflection on complicity narratives. The emotional arc (margin-dwelling → confrontation) transforms the familiar "scientist acknowledges inconvenient truth" template through her fever-distorted data reports and the century-old illustration's wrongness. The "occupying margins" motif and "swallowed truth" conceit are purposeful rather than generic. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and heavy figurative texture are bold but don't obscure clarity. The premise avoids derivative pitfalls through the oracle/weatherperson specificity and the botanical migration detail, though the climate-change-denial theme is well-traveled terrain; transformation here is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "fault-tolerant oracle" character drives key turns: her fever-distorted reporting creates the initial problem, her post-fever investigation uncovers systemic complicity, and her final choice to center the illustration (versus continuing margin-dwelling) is the closure act. The trait shapes her professional identity (trained to accept prediction failure) and her moral calculus (treating errors as "tolerable" symptoms). Present in setup (paragraph 2), developed through middle reflection (paragraphs 4–5), and active at closure (paragraph 6). Causal pressure is strong, and the oracle framework is irreplaceable—no generic "scientist" would carry the fault-tolerance/prediction-failure specificity. Cost is visible in her shift from peripheral observer to confronter.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in three distinct beats: discovery (paragraph 3), examination and smudging (paragraph 4), and centering in the log (paragraph 6). Its wrongness (too many petals, valley roots, migration signal) drives Elara's realization that anomalies predate her fever, and her smudging it becomes a physical micro-turn. The final beat—taping it "at the center of the current log"—is the story's closure act, reweighting her prior margin-occupation. The object is irreplaceable: its century-old botanical specificity (Edelweiss, alpine adaptation) ties directly to climate-warming stakes. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" is signaled early (paragraph 4: "Swaying certainties rocked her") and shapes Elara's tactics—she questions whether she imagined discrepancies, her vision is "smeared at the edges," and the fever left reality/hallucination bleeding. The concept recurs in the final image: anemometer readings "swaying between seasons, between what had been true and what was becoming real." This reweights her professional oracle stance (predictions that "sometimes fail" versus systemic distortion). The concept constrains her confidence and charges the ending, but middle development is more atmospheric than tactical—she doesn't make a choice because of swaying certainties so much as reflect on them. Setup and payoff strong; middle causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" governs Elara's tactics throughout: she moves "by occupying margins, skirting the center," keeps "to the edges where old logbooks accumulated," and realizes she "had been peripherally aware of this wrongness for weeks." The trait enables her discovery (margins = logbooks = illustration) and is explicitly renounced at closure when she places the illustration "at the center...could no longer treat the anomaly as peripheral." The attribute is causally active in at least two beats (paragraph 2 movement, paragraph 5 realization, paragraph 6 reversal) and carries visible cost (confronting complicity versus continuing evasion). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Specificity is high; the peripheral-vision frame is character-particular.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The smudge occurs mid-story (paragraph 4: "her thumb...managed to smudge the century-old ink, blurring the stem into a ghost") and marks a micro-turn—physical alteration of evidence that mirrors her distortion of climate data. However, the smudge itself doesn't drive the major closure turn; that belongs to the taping/centering action in paragraph 6. The smudge adds thematic resonance (her mark on historical record parallels her complicity) but could be replaced with another form of engagement (e.g., tearing, folding) without breaking story logic. Present in middle development and thematically charged, but not indispensable to closure mechanics. Setup implicit, development moderate, payoff indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"By occupying margins" is signaled early (paragraph 2: "moved by occupying margins, skirting the center") and its mechanics matter: she literally keeps to room edges, finds the illustration in marginal logbooks, and reflects that she "had avoided the center of the catastrophe, hiding in the footnotes where decimals could be quietly rounded toward hope." The method enables her discovery and is explicitly reversed at closure ("taped it not in the margins this time, but at the center"). The means shapes at least two attempts (physical movement, data handling) and is causally active in the ending. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Irreplaceability high; the margin/center spatial metaphor unifies action and theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies the professional context (satellite uplink, anemometer, transmission console, logbooks) that constrains Elara's choices and pressures her: she must navigate the equipment-filled space, her movements are tracked relative to consoles and desks, and the old logbooks at the margins enable her discovery. The setting's isolation and the predawn cold charge the atmosphere ("steel struts contracting," "frost-rimed desk") and the anemometer's final appearance reinforces interpretive uncertainty. The station is not swappable—only a weather station provides the oracle role, the climate-data stakes, and the botanical-archive logbooks. Setup immediate, development spatial (margins/center choreography), payoff present (anemometer in final line). Micro-setting (desk, glass, console) functions as tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" is anchored in the opening line and governs Elara's state: residual weakness, trembling fingers, vision smeared at edges, and the realization that her fever-distorted readings were reported as truth. The timeframe creates urgency (she now can and must assess damage) and tightens her choices (no longer in delirium, she's accountable). However, the time itself doesn't apply visible pressure beyond initial setup—there's no ticking clock or deadline that alters tactics. The "after" framing primes the central question but remains more atmospheric than mechanical. Setup strong, development moderate (state-based rather than clock-based), payoff implicit (her new clarity enables the closure choice).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is dramatized in paragraph 2 ("she needed to find the weight of that swallowed truth—to measure what damage her delirium had wrought") and drives the investigation: examining the illustration, recognizing prior anomalies, and confronting complicity. The desire is conflicted—she sways between doubting her perceptions and acknowledging systemic failure, and the "swallowed" metaphor recurs ("she had swallowed these truths, accepting them as fault tolerance"). The final act (centering the illustration) literalizes the weight: she places the evidence where she can't ignore it. Setup clear, development sustained through reflection and micro-choices, payoff direct. Cost is visible (she must abandon margin-dwelling and face complicity). Friction between wanting certainty and fearing what she'll find operates throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is signaled in the opening line ("auroral sorrow of dawn") and sustained through "auroral too, beautiful and devastating, illuminating the atmosphere with charged particles of grief" and the closing "aurora fade into the bruised purple of morning." The tone—beauty intertwined with devastation—coheres through Elara's perceptual filter (luminous yet hollowed, fever-recovery clarity laced with grief) and modulates with pressure (initial disorientation → growing dread → resigned confrontation). The aurora imagery charges the final image by literalizing the sorrow as atmospheric phenomenon, linking personal grief to planetary warming. Tone is consistent and purposeful, though it edges toward static lyricism in paragraph 6 where the aurora metaphor is slightly over-explained. Setup immediate, development atmospheric, payoff strong.</comment>
