<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and coherent—finding the sacred in the ordinary through guerrilla gardening—but interiority leans abstract and label-heavy ("creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle") rather than embodied contradiction. The final sharing scene shows a micro-choice with cost (offering the bread pudding), yet the progression feels more illustrative than driven by genuine internal conflict. The other tea-house regulars remain gestural presences without applying immediate pressure. Emotional states are asserted ("understanding that redemption did not arrive as thunder") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative lens: Mara plants, cultivates, and finally shares the harvest in a communal meal that reweights the bakery's absence. Orientation anchors (Mara, overgrown palace courtyard, post-bakery closure) arrive early. The closure—serving bread pudding made from the preserved loaf and guerrilla wheat—lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "tenuous absolution" crystallizes the community's new stance toward loss). Cost is present but subtle: the fragility of the garden, the illicit nature of the work, the acknowledgment that "absolution was not a state but a practice." One meaningful deepening occurs when the eating becomes a communal act of resistance. However, the final paragraph drifts into summary ("she tended her garden...teaching the city") rather than holding the charged moment, slightly dulling closure impact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: wisteria-consumed tea house, cracked marble, pumpkin vines trained up walls, winter wheat in the broken fountain. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the garden's evolution. The setting constrains choice (illicit planting requires "softness of a ghost") and charges the final image (scent of the garden carried into streets beyond). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's priorities (anise and memory from bread, frost silvering vines). The tea house functions as both sanctuary and contested space, though the "secret but no longer hidden" paradox in the final paragraph introduces mild confusion about access and discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the sacred ordinary lost with the bakery—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Mara's illicit cultivation, building toward the communal meal. The "uncloak" beat (serving the bread pudding) provides one meaningful turn that reweights the group's relationship to loss. However, escalation is gradual and atmospheric rather than urgent; no live opposition or tightening constraint forces harder trade-offs. The line "tenuous absolution" names the cost, but the piece does not dramatize a moment where Mara forecloses a path or pays a visible price. The ending's summary mode ("continued her creeping observations") diffuses rather than crystallizes stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—finding the sacred in everyday acts of care and resistance to erasure—emerges organically from Mara's guerrilla gardening and the communal meal. The bread functions as a charged object that shifts meaning from relic to offering. Subtext operates in the group's silent understanding and the city's "adjusted to absence without acknowledging the void." The final image of the garden teaching the city "how to remember without breaking" offers resonance without overt moralizing. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("absolution was not a state but a practice"), and phrases like "tenuous absolution" and "ordinary miracles" risk becoming stock formulations. The piece earns its insight through specifics but occasionally tilts into abstract assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization through Mara is stable and controlled. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices incremental change, speaks to soil, moves with deliberate gentleness. Diction is elevated and lyrical ("the fermentation of dough and the patience of growing things"), which fits the reflective, observational stance. The single line of dialogue ("We lost the bakery slowly...") feels natural and goal-driven, advancing theme without exposition. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophy ("divinity hid not in cathedrals") and the prose leans toward uniform syntactic patterns (long, clause-heavy sentences). Under peak pressure (the communal meal), the voice maintains its texture but does not modulate or compress to reflect emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is dense and lyrical with high information load per sentence. Sentence openings vary and paragraph structure supports rhythm. However, multiple artifacts cluster: repetitive phrasing ("creeping," "tenuous," "heuristically gentle" appear as labels without dramatic pressure), near-paraphrase loops in the final paragraph ("tended her garden...teaching the city"), and elevated diction that occasionally obscures concrete action. The line "worked heuristically gentle" is syntactically awkward (missing "with" or "-ly"). Metaphor coherence holds, but stacked modifiers and clause chains slow momentum in high-stakes beats. The closing paragraph summarizes rather than propelling through image, dulling the closure beat with scaffold summary ("She continued her creeping observations...requiring daily renewal").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—guerrilla gardening as ritual recovery of community loss—offers a fresh synthesis of urban resistance, memory, and ordinary sacredness. The specific details (anise-scented loaf, chamomile in flagstones, winter wheat in a broken fountain) ground the concept in lived texture. The tea-house regulars (calligrapher, knitter with unspun wool, architect who only draws trees) provide distinctive character sketches. However, the emotional arc of gradual cultivation and communal sharing follows a fairly linear, predictable path. The "creeping normality noticer" and "heuristically gentle" labels feel like prompt artifacts rather than organic voice. The piece does not take bold structural risks; the progression from planting to harvest to meal is straightforward and the ending's summary mode retreats from the intensity a more daring close might achieve.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara as "creeping normality noticer" is named in the opening and her observational stance frames the narrative. She records microclimate changes, notices the neighborhood's adjustment to loss, and later observes resistance forming. However, her noticing does not create key turns; decisions (planting, sharing the meal) arise from her motivation to restore the sacred, not from the observation itself. The trait is more thematic label than causal driver. Present in setup, middle gardening, and final reflection, but does not constrain a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bread appears in three distinct beats: preserved on the center table as relic, crumbled into pudding (the "uncloak" action), and tasted by the group with recognition of the vanished bakery's flavor. Its transformation from preservation to offering drives the central turn. Removing it would collapse the story's logic of memory and recovery. However, the bread's handling is somewhat passive (wrapped, sitting, then crumbled off-page); more tactile interaction in the preservation phase could have strengthened irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly in the knitter's line and echoed in the final paragraph ("absolution was not a state but a practice"). It shapes the meal's stakes: the offering seeks forgiveness for communal forgetting. The concept charges the ending image of the garden teaching the city to remember. However, it is primarily thematic rather than tactical; Mara's choices are driven by her motivation to find the sacred, not by the need for absolution per se. Present in setup (implied by the loss), middle (gardening as reparation), and closure (named and reflected), but not a lens that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is introduced as a description of Mara's working method: testing seeds, never forcing the earth, coaxing with compost. It recurs in the final image ("the heuristically gentle persistence of green things"). However, it functions as label rather than constraint. No scene shows a cost or trade-off tied to this gentleness (e.g., slower progress, vulnerability to opposition). The trait is consistent but ornamental, not causally active. Late cap applies as the payoff phrase appears in the final third without middle dramatization of cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Uncloak" anchors the story's central turn: Mara decides it is time to reveal the garden's purpose and serves the bread pudding. This action reweights the bread from relic to offering and shifts the group's stance from passive loss to active recovery. The beat is clearly signaled ("decided it was time to uncloak the final purpose") and lands with cost (the fragility named as "tenuous"). However, the uncloaking is more declarative than dramatic; no resistance or complication tests the choice. Swapping "uncloak" for "reveal" or "share" would not break story logic, though the specific word choice carries thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early (planting winter wheat in palace rose beds, chamomile between flagstones) and its illicit nature shapes Mara's tactics (moving "with the softness of a ghost"). The method drives multiple beats: smuggling compost, recording microclimate, training pumpkin vines, and harvesting for the meal. The wheat grown in the broken fountain supplies the bread that sustains the community in the ending. Removing this method would collapse both the middle escalation and the closure's causal logic. Mechanics are legible and purposeful, though the piece does not dramatize external opposition or consequences of being caught.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tea house in the overgrown palace courtyard is introduced early and functions as both sanctuary and contested space. Its ruin (ivy-swallowed gate, dying elm, wisteria-consumed structure) mirrors the city's soul erosion. The cracked marble and compacted soil provide resistance that Mara must work around. The setting charges the final image: scent carried into streets beyond the rusted gate. However, the "secret but no longer hidden" paradox in the ending introduces mild confusion about access. The courtyard supplies resources (space, soil, fountain) and constrains tactics (illicit planting), reaching the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south" is stated in the opening and closing paragraphs, establishing a seasonal frame (late autumn/early winter, evidenced by October, first frost, winter wheat). The timeframe provides atmospheric texture and signals passage toward harvest, but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No live clock or deadline presses Mara's choices. The lyric reprise in the final paragraph reweights the phrase slightly (the courtyard "became a sanctuary" after the migration), but the temporal element remains more symbolic than tactical. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to find the sacred in the ordinary" is stated early and dramatized through her gardening, her preservation of the bread, and her belief that "divinity hid...in the fermentation of dough and the patience of growing things." The motivation drives her decision to plant, cultivate, and finally share. However, it is never conflicted or tested by competing wants; no scene shows friction between this desire and a cost or fear. The motivation shapes the arc but lacks internal contradiction or visible trade-off. Present in setup, middle action, and closure reflection, but told more than struggled with.</comment>
