<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "translate isolation into independence" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her realization ("not a shattering, but a delicate frost") reads as an unearned epiphany—no prior causality forces this shift. Interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("brittle awakening crystallize within her") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final smile at her reflection feels like emotional summary rather than a lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: imagery and reflection accumulate toward a final reweighting. Closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (she accepts the Sky-Singers' dispersed state and her own independence), but the cost is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page—no visible forfeiture or trade-off materializes. Orientation anchors arrive quickly (Athenaeum balcony, cloud-ocean, Mira). The single tightening (placing the sundial in the circle) occurs but the "brittle piece...snap cleanly away" moment lacks causal grounding in prior resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal library, cloud-ocean, and stone circle are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (subsonic hum "vibrating in her teeth," coral shelves "breathing"). The sundial's atomically reflective surface and the basalt pillars constrain the climactic choice—she uses their interaction to reach the Sky-Singers' memory. Spatial choreography is clear (balcony to northern terrace to stone circle to descending stacks). However, some details ("living coral breathing in thin atmosphere") are decorative rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (overcome isolation after remembering her extinct companions) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Mira places the sundial in the circle, but the escalation is textural (hum intensifies, light dances) rather than narrowing options or raising cost. The resolution ("I am the first librarian of a new solitude") is declared rather than earned by a visible trade-off. No credible loss or renunciation appears on the page; the sundial hovering and the "brittle piece...snap cleanly away" are metaphoric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (isolation as raw material for independence) emerges from imagery and action, not direct statement, until the final paragraph where "she had learned to coexist with absence by filling it with presence" borders on moralizing. The sundial and stone circle recur with shifting meaning (tracking sun → amplifying reflection → warm presence), and the final image of volumes that "wept ink and sang" supports thematic resonance. However, the epiphany lacks friction; the protagonist's arc resolves too neatly without ambiguity or counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature (Mira notices "frozen lightning," "photons against basalt") rooted in her librarian/scholar identity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during reflection, wider during environmental sweep). Register occasionally elevates beyond POV's plausible lexicon ("subsonic resonance," "coherent beams," "mathematical precision") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Prose rhythm varies, though some passages lean toward purple ("brittle awakening crystallize within her...delicate frost forming on the window of understanding").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("frozen lightning," "cloud-tides," "equations of time in photons") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff; several metaphors compete for attention in single beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "She was not the last companion...she was the first librarian" and "isolation was merely the raw material...independence was forged" restate the same concept without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("The humming intensified...the hum settled...the hum reached its crescendo") and filter-verb reliance ("she realized," "she saw," "she felt") dull immediacy. No major causality breaks, but momentum sags under ornamental phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (floating library, extinct crystalline species, reincarnation memory) offers surface novelty but the emotional arc (lone survivor learns to accept solitude) is a familiar template. The sundial and stone circle are specific objects, yet their symbolic function (bridging past and present) is conventional. The ending reframes isolation as independence, but this turn is asserted rather than discovered through non-obvious synthesis. Mira's realization lacks the specificity or moral calculus that would make it feel inevitable in hindsight rather than a prompt-driven conclusion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is identified as "once...brother to the Sky-Singers" early (setup gate met). Her contemporary status informs her motivation but does not create key turns—she observes and reflects rather than making choices that alter tactics. The middle choice (placing the sundial) is enabled by her knowledge but not uniquely tied to her contemporary identity. Closure participation is thematic (she accepts their dispersal) but not causal. Swappable: the plot would function with a researcher or descendant.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears early (setup gate met), is handled in two distinct beats (carrying it to the terrace, placing it in the circle), and returns warm at the end with reweighted meaning (from alien/intimate to warm presence). It enables the middle action (reflection amplification) and appears in the closure image ("carrying the brass sundial like a lantern"). Causal pressure is moderate—it facilitates but does not constrain the choice. Cost connection is implied (she must use it) but not visceral. Irreplaceability is moderate; a similar reflective object could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The concept "brittle awakenings" is introduced early ("brittle awakening in physical form") and recurs at the climax ("brittle awakening crystallize within her"). It shapes the dominant stake (moving from fragile realization to independence) and informs closure ("the brittle awakening had passed, leaving her strong in the broken places"). However, it functions more as thematic label than on-page constraint—it does not narrow options or create visible trade-offs. The metaphor is ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The trait "atomically reflective" is mentioned three times (early label, middle use "atomically reflective surface catching the sun," final reprise "atomically perfect"). It enables the middle action (splitting sun into coherent beams) with some specificity. However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Mira simply places the sundial and it performs as described. No trade-off or friction appears. The attribute is present and functional but replaceable; "perfectly polished" or "mirrored" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The action "coexist" is seeded early ("when they coexisted with humanity") and drives the thematic question throughout. The climax hinges on Mira's realization that coexistence does not require physical return but "acceptance of this translated state." The final image ("learned to coexist with absence by filling it with presence") directly reprises the action. Causal linkage is moderate—the action frames the question but does not force specific tactical choices. It shapes theme more than plot turns.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method "by the hum of an ancient stone circle" is signaled early (northern terrace, seven basalt pillars humming). Its mechanics matter: the subsonic resonance amplifies the sundial's reflection, and the hum intensifies through the climax ("hum settled her bones...hum reached its crescendo"). The method enables the middle attempt and participates in closure (the circle quiets, becoming "a pulse, a heartbeat"). It constrains the how of Mira's action with some specificity. Irreplaceability is moderate; another amplification device could substitute, but the hum's physicality (vibrating in her teeth, settling bones) is concrete.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal library is introduced early with vivid detail (shelves of living coral, stratospheric currents, moon's pull). It supplies resources (the stone circle on the northern terrace, the volumes that sing) and its movement (groaning, shifting altitude) appears at the climax and closure. However, it does not pressure choices—Mira's action would work in any isolated, atmospheric location. The setting is atmospheric but not tactical. Micro-setting (the stone circle) does alter tactics and earns credit, but the larger library remains postcard-level.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the reincarnation memory" is signaled immediately ("she had remembered yesterday") and frames Mira's motivation. The memory's recency creates urgency ("she had feared the loneliness would crush her") and the story tracks her movement from that fear to acceptance. However, time does not tighten decisions—no live clock or deadline appears. The "after" is a setup marker rather than a pressure device. It participates in closure (she catalogs their history "not as tragedy, but as prologue") but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate isolation into independence" is stated early ("The motivation burned in her chest") and drives the arc. It is dramatized in the middle choice (using the sundial to reach the Sky-Singers' memory) and at closure (she becomes "the first librarian of a new solitude"). Friction between wants (connection) and costs (acceptance of absence) is present but largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The desire is clear and persistent but lacks the embodied conflict required for higher scores.</comment>
