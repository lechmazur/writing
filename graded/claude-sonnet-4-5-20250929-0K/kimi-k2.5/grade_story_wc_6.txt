<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya's core motivation is signaled early and her scars provide embodied history, but her choices in the present feel more symbolic than genuinely conflicted. The graft procedure itself unfolds without meaningful internal resistance or competing impulses acting simultaneously—she executes the plan rather than wrestling with it. The backstory (father's arson, truck choice) is extensive but remains told rather than filtering present perception with visible micro-costs. Interiority leans heavily on elevated metaphor ("gracefully alert," "singing scars") rather than character-particular thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (lagoon, dunes, migration of clouds). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density increases through layered imagery (black sand, kelp, coin, scars) and the final image attempts a cadence shift where "scars finally singing" reweights the opening premise. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Maya emerges with the graft "taken hold" by "stubborn hope" and mineral salts, a wished-for success rather than a renunciation or trade-off that forecloses a path. The ending offers Charged Poise in image but the pressure feels asserted ("loud enough to drown the past") rather than undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and kelp-drift environment are rendered with sensory specificity and recur across beats. The lagoon's mineral salts enable the graft attempt, meeting the micro-setting-as-constraint test. However, spatial choreography remains vague (where exactly is she in the water? how deep? how does she surface after twenty minutes submerged?). The "migration of clouds" timeframe supplies atmosphere but does not tighten or constrain her actions, remaining decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving scars can "sing" through grafting kelp to scar tissue—is signaled early and sustained. The piece offers one meaningful action (submersion with the graft) but no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Maya's plan succeeds as hoped; no complication forces adaptation. The escalation is atmospheric (deeper immersion, twenty-minute passage) rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure. Cost is implied emotionally but not made undeniable in a choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (transformation, healing from trauma, fire versus water renewal) emerges through concrete images—black sand, kelp graft, the foreign coin. The piece resists overt moralizing and sustains ambiguity about whether the procedure will work. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "scars finally singing in the language of tide and renewal, loud enough to drown the past" tells rather than showing the reweighting. The coin and sand recur but feel ornamental rather than charging a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. The voice carries a distinct lyric texture with extended metaphors and elevated diction ("gracefully alert," "kelp-drift peace," "geological time"). However, register repeatedly drifts into abstract lyricism that feels authorial rather than character-bound—would a firefighter think "cellular possibility of new growth and regeneration" or "marks that spoke louder than DNA"? Perceptual signature is consistent but generic; the narration could belong to any reflective protagonist rather than this one. No dialogue on the page to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries figurative language or elevated abstraction ("genetic compulsion toward flame," "baptism by fire," "ghost she refused to drown," "singing with the cellular possibility"). Template cadence appears in repeated "she + past-tense verb" stems across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops recur: "scars can sing" / "singing scars" / "scars finally singing" cycles without added meaning. "Gracefully alert" appears twice as a recycled phrase. The closure beat—"scars finally singing in the language of tide and renewal, loud enough to drown the past"—stacks metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Artifacts touch the ending, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering cumulative deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The grafting-kelp-to-scars premise offers a fresh bodily metaphor, and the volcanic-sand ritual adds specificity. However, the emotional arc (traumatized person seeks healing in nature) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived occupational detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The firefighter profession remains label-only; her skills do not shape the graft attempt. The piece leans heavily on lyric atmosphere rather than ingenuity in character choice or turn. Risk-taking in style does not fully compensate for predictable thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The character is present throughout and her background (arsonist's daughter, firefighter) frames the thematic stakes. However, her occupation does not constrain on-page action—she could be any profession. Her key choice (attempting the graft) is made before the story opens; on-page she executes rather than decides under conflicting pressure. Swappable with "trauma survivor" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Black sand appears in three beats: clinging to boots/pockets, slipping from fingers into water, swirling in spirals. It carries symbolic weight (childhood ash, penance) and the final mention attempts to reweight it as "whispering witnesses of her transformation." Setup is early, middle involvement is present (clouding the water), and it appears in the closure paragraph. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its role is atmospheric and thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is named twice as a phrase ("unyielding compassion for her own broken geography," "unyielding compassion for the girl she had been") but functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. It does not create friction between wants and costs or narrow options. The concept is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears twice as a repeated phrase describing Maya's movement. It does not enable or constrain a specific action with visible cost; it is a trait label applied to her demeanor. No tradeoff or tactical choice hinges on being "gracefully alert" versus another state.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The graft is the story's central action, signaled early and executed across multiple beats: preparing the kelp, tying the coin, pressing the blades to her wrist, submerging, and the graft "taking hold" at the end. All major turns trace to this action. However, the procedure itself is not tested by complication or reversal; Maya succeeds as planned. Removing "graft" would collapse the plot, but the lack of on-page friction or cost tied to the act keeps it from indispensable range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The foreign coin is introduced early with backstory (refugee, burning tenement) and used functionally: drilled, strung on red thread, tied to kelp, used as a weight to sink the frond, and pressed to her heart at the end. It appears in setup, middle (sinking mechanism), and closure (pressed to heart). However, its specific properties (foreign, copper, traded by a dying refugee) do not matter to the mechanics—any weight would serve the same function. The coin's symbolic charge does not constrain a choice or alter the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is present throughout, supplies the mineral salts that enable the graft, and houses the submersion action. It appears in setup, development (the underwater twenty-minute passage), and closure (she emerges onto the shore). The lagoon's specific properties (mineral-rich, beneath dunes, obsidian glass floor) enable the procedure. However, spatial choreography remains vague and the setting does not create obstacles or alter Maya's tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"During the migration of clouds" is named in the opening and recurs in the final paragraph ("clouds continued their slow migration overhead"). It supplies atmosphere and frames the scene temporally but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The twenty-minute submersion is mentioned but not tracked or made to pressure choices. Time remains decorative rather than a live constraint shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is stated early and returns in variations throughout ("scars finally singing"). It frames the dominant stake and the graft attempt is her method to pursue it. However, the motivation is told and metaphorical rather than dramatized through conflicting wants and costs on the page. No friction between this desire and a competing fear or need forces a choice that alters tactics. The ending asserts success ("her scars finally singing") without visible cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named once mid-story and "the kelp-drift peace where light could not penetrate" recurs during submersion. It contributes to the underwater tone but remains a static descriptor rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image. The tone is consistent (meditative, elegiac) but does not shift to reflect escalation or cost, and the phrase itself does not participate in the closure beat.</comment>
