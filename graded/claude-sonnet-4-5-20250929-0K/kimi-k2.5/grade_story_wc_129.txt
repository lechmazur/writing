<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is declared ("desperate to graft oneself onto community") but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The seventeen-cycle isolation is told rather than shown constraining present action. The weeping moment when Joss speaks is a gesture toward "boldly sympathetic," but it remains a single illustrative beat rather than a trait that creates visible tradeoffs. The final "offer" arrives without prior renunciation or foreclosed path—no on-page cost that makes the choice difficult.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the search for silver glyphs accumulates into kinship, culminating in the bridge dedication. The closure unit—Kael's bridge and the mute artist's blessing—lands on the page, but the cost is asserted ("years spent alone") rather than dramatized as a present forfeiture or choice that narrows options. The final paragraph's "Years later, travelers would speak" shifts into distant summary, evacuating immediate pressure and blunting the closure image. Orientation is present early (marsh-reed sculptor, crystalline orchard, crater); no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (fruit "like frozen starlight," air "tasted of copper and old songs"). The arbor appears in gatherings and the final dedication, charging the closure image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Kael's bridge-building proceeds without spatial obstacles or resource scarcity that alter tactics. The micro-setting (reeds, volcanic glass) enriches atmosphere but remains ornamental to the escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—connection versus isolation—is signaled early. The shared search for glyphs provides one tightening: solitary inhabitants converge into a group. Yet the mute artist's reveal does not narrow Kael's options or force a trade-off; discovery and bridge-building proceed frictionlessly. No on-page reversal or visible price (time, stamina, relational cost) alters later tactics. The bridge solves the isolation without dramatized cost, undercutting escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme—art as antidote to loneliness, kinship through shared search—emerges organically from the glyph hunt and bridge imagery. The final image (bridge, mute artist's blessing) attempts resonance, but the closing paragraph's "Years later" summary and explicit thematic statement ("art was not meant to outlast the artist, but to outlast the loneliness") replaces scene pressure with moralizing. The "webs of kinship" motif recurs but does not constrain choice, reducing thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("geometries that whispered of drowning and resurrection," "luminescent ache"), but elevated diction occasionally clashes with narrative urgency. Kael's perceptual signature is generic—poetic observations that could belong to any artist-narrator. Dialogue is minimal (one line: "I offer the reeds"); when it appears, it lacks subtext or goal pursuit. The final "Years later" shift abandons Kael's immediacy for distant retrospective, weakening focalization at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language density is high throughout ("fruit hung like frozen starlight," "voice breaking with luminescent ache"), creating a lyric texture but occasionally obscuring causality in peak beats. The final paragraph's paraphrase loop ("webs of kinship tightened, crystallized, became permanent structures" restates the prior bridge image without added pressure) and template cadence in the opening (repeated "who" clauses for eight inhabitants) dull momentum. Stock metaphors ("spider silk," "sugar in rain") and the therapy-adjacent "graft oneself onto community" reduce specificity. Information density is moderate; many sentences prioritize ornament over advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The marsh-reed sculptor in a crystalline orchard offers surface novelty, but the emotional arc—lonely artist finds community through collaborative search—follows a template premise without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The silver-glyph street artist and mute reveal are fresh touches, yet the resolution (bridge-building, collective acceptance) unfolds without risk or surprise. The lyric register and SFF setting distinguish the piece, but the core loneliness-to-belonging trajectory remains unmodified by the specifics of reeds, glyphs, or crater.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael is the POV throughout and performs the final bridge dedication, but no on-page choice creates a key turn. The decision to build the bridge is summarized ("prepared to dedicate") rather than dramatized as a choice under pressure. The sculptor role is functional but replaceable—any communal artisan could serve the same plot role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The glimmering obsidian arbor appears in the gathering scenes (middle beat: "Each night, they gathered in the hollow") and the final dedication ("Kael stood within the glimmering obsidian arbor"). It frames the kinship meetings and charges the closure image, showing purposeful early–final reprise. However, it is not handled or used—characters gather there, but the arbor does not constrain action or evolve in meaning beyond backdrop. Two touches across beats with closure linkage, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is mentioned twice: metaphorically ("webs of kinship fragile as spider silk") and literally in the final paragraph ("spinning webs of kinship"). It shapes the thematic stake but does not alter on-page tactics—characters form bonds without the web metaphor changing their choices. Present in setup and payoff (lyric reprise), missing middle development; cap at 4.6. The concept remains ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is illustrated once: "Kael, boldly sympathetic by nature, found themselves weeping openly when Joss spoke." This is a label-only mention without on-page cost or constraint. No second beat demonstrates the trait enabling or complicating action. The weeping moment is descriptive rather than a choice with tradeoff. Present in setup, absent in development and closure participation; cap at 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dedicate" appears in the climax: "prepared to dedicate their life's work" and the bridge presentation. The dedication frames the closure unit, but the major turn—finding the mute artist—is not tied to dedication; it is a shared discovery. The bridge dedication is the final act, but Kael's choice is summarized rather than dramatized with cost. Present in closure, drives one beat, but easily swappable with "offer" or "present" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "shared search for an elusive street artist's tag" is signaled early ("began noticing the marks simultaneously, drawn together by a shared search"), drives the middle collaboration ("traced the silver burns across the crater's geography"), and is resolved when they discover the mute artist. The search method shapes the group's formation and tactics (tracing glyphs, gathering at the arbor). Present across setup, development, and payoff; enables key beats with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard perched at the crater's edge is established early and houses the obsidian arbor gatherings and final bridge dedication. The orchard supplies the volcanic glass and crater gap that the bridge spans, providing mild setting-driven pressure. The environment charges the final image (bridge "connecting the orchard to the world beyond"). Present in all three gates; however, the orchard does not constrain a choice—Kael's bridge-building proceeds without spatial obstacle dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears once in the opening as atmospheric phrasing ("time existed beyond the murmur of lost languages"). It does not tighten decisions or track elapsed duration. The seventeen cycles and "Years later" retrospective are vague temporal markers that do not pressure tactics. The timeframe is ornamental; no live clock or deadline alters moves. Absent from development and closure; cap at 2.8, but lowered further for purely decorative use to 1.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To graft oneself onto community" is stated early ("desperate to graft oneself onto community") and motivates Kael's participation in the glyph search and bridge-building. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no on-page moment where Kael must choose between solitude and connection with visible cost. The final dedication fulfills the motivation but without friction. Present in setup and payoff, weak middle development; lyric reprise without escalation trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears explicitly in the climax: "their voice breaking with luminescent ache, each word glowing with the pain of years spent alone and the brilliance of no longer being so." The tone—longing suffused with beauty—is sustained through lyric diction ("frozen starlight," "spectral rainbows," "sugar in rain") and modulates at the final beat, charging the bridge image. Coherent across turns with purposeful intensification at closure. Present in development and payoff; tone elevates the final image without static repetition.</comment>
