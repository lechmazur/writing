<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's methodical nature and her motivation to help vulnerable others are consistently embodied through concrete actions (caching fragments, cataloguing with care). Interiority shows her recognizing the tape fragments' "sense memory" properties and connecting them to her grandmother's kitchen, though this reflection feels slightly prompt-directed rather than deeply character-particular. The final choice—distributing the recordings—emerges logically from her established traits, but no on-page contradiction or internal friction complicates her resolve; she executes a plan without visible cost or foreclosed path. The piece lands in the competent band but lacks the contradictory impulses or genuine struggle required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Maya), where (library basement), and when (dawn after an outage) by the second paragraph, satisfying the test. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Maya's systematic retrieval of fragments across locations builds toward a pattern of distribution that reweights her invisibility into visible care. However, closure is a Conceptual Repricing without on-page cost—Maya smiles in satisfaction, having completed her plan, but no decision, renunciation, or visible price appears in the final image. The ending reconfigures "visibility" conceptually but lacks the felt or opportunity cost required for a strong RR or DC. The Orientation Test penalty is waived, but the Cost proof test reveals no exact sentence where cost is legible at closure, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting detail is specific and purposeful: rusted junction boxes, pipe chases, heating grates, and the rare books room all constrain Maya's movements and anchor her caching choices. The "sapphire hush of pre-dawn" and "fluorescent emergency lights" create a coherent sensory envelope. Spatial choreography is clean—crawl spaces, tool lockers, boiler room, third-floor carrel, rare books room—and the environment directly shapes Maya's tactics (she places fragments where vulnerable people shelter). The body and small objects (thermos, flashlight) function as micro-setting. This satisfies the 9+ quick test, but minor slips in occupational depth (no sign of actual maintenance duties or tool use beyond carrying fragments) and a slight postcard quality to "sapphire hush" keep it from the high 8s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maya's desire to become visible through her gifts—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece accumulates pressure through her methodical retrieval and distribution, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Maya executes her plan without complication or cost. The power outage timeframe is invoked but never constrains her work or forces adaptation. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the final paragraph reconfigures "visibility" conceptually but without a felt price or foreclosed path. Band guardrails: entering 8.0+ typically requires a tightening that forecloses a live option; this piece trends mid-band because the plan unfolds without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of invisibility and care emerges organically from Maya's actions and the tape fragments' symbolic weight ("I survived. I crossed the water. I am still here."). The final image—"Maya smiled in the darkness, finally visible through the artifacts she had left behind"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the closing line edges toward stating the thesis rather than letting the image alone carry it; "finally visible through the artifacts" is near-explicit articulation of the theme. The ferromagnetic tape fragments recur purposefully (cache → distribution → "humming in the walls"), and the piece resists tidy morals by keeping Maya's future uncertain. Minor thematic echo in the final paragraph lowers the score by −0.3.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("gardener's patience," "arteries beneath the reading rooms"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, using technical terms (ferromagnetic tape, iron oxide) within Maya's plausible lexicon as a maintenance dweller. Under peak emotional moments (uncovering fragments, remembering her grandmother), the prose maintains rhythm without collapsing into filter verbs or over-articulation. Minor register drift: "vessels of sense memory" and "pregnant with possibility" feel slightly elevated for a character described through tactile, maintenance-world detail. Free indirect style is clean throughout. No head-hopping or tense inconsistency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: the second paragraph explains that fragments are "not merely obsolete media; they were vessels of sense memory" and then immediately restates "preserving not just words but the breath, the hesitation…" in adjacent lines. The phrase "methodically, kindly" recurs across paragraphs as a template stem. Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "pipe chases that ran like arteries," "curled like metallic insects." The final paragraph contains a soft scaffold: "her work would remain, magnetic memories humming in the walls, waiting for the hands that needed to find them" paraphrases the prior distribution without adding pressure. Applying the paraphrase-loop and template-cadence checks: −0.6 cumulative in Q7. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—a homeless maintenance worker distributing recovered oral history recordings to other vulnerable people—synthesizes familiar material (hidden lives in infrastructure, archival rescue, care networks) with specific, grounded detail (ferromagnetic tape, pipe chases, 1970s oral history project). However, the core concept closely follows a recognizable template: the invisible caretaker who leaves gifts for others in need. Maya's choice to distribute the fragments is foreshadowed early and unfolds without surprise or earned hindsight. The transformation test flags moderate concern: plot and arc could transfer to a different caretaker role (janitor, night guard) with minimal edits. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −0.8 in Q8 for template adherence without full transformation through non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya, the crawl space dweller, is present from the opening and drives every beat: she navigates tunnels, retrieves fragments, catalogues them, and distributes them to vulnerable locations. Her decisions shape the entire narrative arc and the final image ("Maya smiled in the darkness"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all pass. Causal pressure: her choices narrow where and how she places each fragment based on who might find them. Closure linkage: the final image centers her satisfaction and the network she built. Specificity: her status as a maintenance-savvy, homeless dweller is irreplaceable; a generic helper could not access pipe chases or understand the building's hidden spaces. Cost connection is weak—no on-page price or foreclosed path appears. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost absent −0.0 baseline held.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ferromagnetic tape reel fragments appear in setup (junction box cache), development (uncovering more in pipe chases, wrapping and cataloguing), and payoff (final placement beneath heating grate, "magnetic memories humming"). Three distinct beats: cache, retrieval/cataloguing, distribution. Causal pressure: the fragments' magnetic properties and oral history content enable Maya's entire plan. Closure linkage: "magnetic memories humming in the walls" directly charges the final image. Specificity: the exact medium (ferromagnetic tape from a 1970s project) matters—digital files or paper would not carry the same sensory-memory weight or work without power. Cost connection is modest; Maya's effort is shown but no visible price. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.7, no cost −0.0 baseline.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sense memory is invoked in the second paragraph ("vessels of sense memory… triggering involuntary sense memories of her own") and subtly echoed in the final image when the tape fragments "hum" with preserved voices. Setup gate passes; development is thin—sense memory is mentioned but does not constrain Maya's choices on the page; payoff is present as thematic resonance. The concept shapes stakes conceptually (the fragments carry trauma and hope) but does not alter Maya's tactics or force a trade-off. This reads as a lyric seed → final reprise without mid-scene causal work, eligible for the 5.5–6.3 range. Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, lyric reprise +0.5, no causal pressure −0.0 baseline, ornamental description −0.5, swappability moderate −0.4 (digital recordings could carry similar emotional weight with minor edits). Lands mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is signaled in the opening line and embodied through Maya's actions: she catalogues with "gardener's patience," wraps fragments in archival cloth, and places them in locations corresponding to where vulnerable people seek shelter. Setup, development, and payoff gates all pass. The trait constrains her approach (she does not rush or scatter fragments randomly) and enables her systematic distribution. Cost is implicit—methodical work takes time during the narrow pre-dawn window—but not dramatized as a trade-off or friction. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal enabling +0.8, closure linkage +0.5 (the final image of her smiling reflects satisfaction in completed methodical work), no visible cost −0.4. Swappability moderate −0.3 ("patient" or "careful" could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Caching drives the structure: Maya retrieves fragments from a previous cache, catalogues new finds, and distributes them as caches for others. Three beats: opening cache at junction box, ongoing retrieval and wrapping, final placement beneath heating grate and in multiple locations. Setup, development, and payoff gates pass. Causal pressure: the act of caching shapes every tactical choice—where to hide fragments, how to ensure discovery by the right people. Closure linkage: "her work would remain… waiting for the hands that needed to find them" directly echoes the caching action. Specificity high: removing "cache" and substituting "leave" or "place" would weaken the tactical and thematic resonance. Cost modest: effort is shown but no foreclosed path. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost weak −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Uncovering in pipe chases" appears in setup (second and fourth paragraphs: "pipe chases that ran like arteries," "uncovering in pipe chases that had not been opened since… 1924") and development (retrieving fragments "previous technicians had dropped or abandoned"). Payoff is implied—the fragments now cached were uncovered this way—but the method does not constrain the final beat; the rare books room placement uses a heating grate, not a pipe chase. Two beats; method shapes retrieval tactics but is not irreplaceable (ventilation shafts or storage crawl spaces could substitute). Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal enabling +0.6, closure linkage weak +0.2, swappability −0.5. Missing tight payoff cap at 4.6 is waived because the method participates in development; lands mid-band on modest integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn is signaled in the title phrase and anchored early: "In the shadowed library at dawn, while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage." Setup, development, and payoff gates pass. The setting pressures Maya's choices: she works during the narrow pre-dawn window when the building is empty but emergency lights provide minimal visibility. Spatial details (basement crawl spaces, eastern wall, third-floor carrel, rare books room) guide her distribution. Closure linkage: "the dawn light was strengthening now… and Maya would retreat" ties the ending to the timeframe. Specificity high: a daytime or evening setting would eliminate the urgency and cover. Cost implicit: limited time and dim light constrain her work. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6, cost weak −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" is invoked in the opening and mentioned again in the second paragraph ("fluorescent emergency lights sputtered") and closing ("Soon the generators would catch, the lights would stabilize"). Setup and payoff gates pass; development is thin—the outage provides cover and urgency conceptually but does not force a tactical shift or complication on the page. The clock is invoked but not tracked; Maya's work unfolds without time pressure testing her choices. This reads as a framing device that sets tone but does not narrow options. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, causal enabling modest +0.4, closure linkage +0.6, time not tracked as live constraint −0.6, swappability moderate −0.4 (a scheduled maintenance window could serve similarly). Lyric seed → final echo allows mid-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To become visible to those who need you" is articulated in the fourth paragraph and dramatized through Maya's distribution choices: she places fragments where vulnerable people (maintenance workers, night janitor, homeless student) will find them. Setup in first third passes; development shows her matching cache locations to people in need; payoff: "finally visible through the artifacts she had left behind." The motivation shapes all her tactical choices (where to place each fragment) and charges the final image. Cost is conceptual—visibility through evidence rather than direct presence—but not felt as a trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, no friction between wants and costs −0.8 (told motivation trends low per the test), summary phrasing −0.3. Strong integration overall but lacks on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" is introduced in the second paragraph ("the sapphire hush of pre-dawn") and echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("pushing through high windows to dissolve the sapphire hush into ordinary grey morning"). Setup and payoff gates pass; development is absent—the tone is described but does not modulate with pressure or constrain choices. Coherence is high: the quiet, reverent tone holds throughout and supports Maya's methodical work. The final reprise reweights the tone by marking the end of her protected window, but the charge is modest—dawn arrives as expected without complication. Lyric seed → final reprise without mid-scene causal work allows 5.5–6.3 range. Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise +0.6, coherence +0.5, closure linkage moderate +0.4, static mood −0.5, ornamental description −0.3. Lands low-mid band on purposeful but non-essential integration.</comment>
