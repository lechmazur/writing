<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is stated clearly—"benevolently ruthless clarity: she would free the truth"—but her interior contradictions remain largely abstract. The piece tells us she lived "half-false, half-true" without dramatizing competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to read the ledger aloud feels inevitable given her stated goal rather than earned through on-page struggle between self-preservation and exposure. Embodied emotion is present in "her voice that trembled neither with false drama nor with survivor's guilt" but much of the interiority leans on metaphor rather than character-particular sensation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira reads aloud, sunlight illuminates the empty pawn squares, and she understands her transformation into "the historian of small gestures." The cost is conceptual—exposure of complicity—but remains largely asserted rather than visibly paid on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the walking pattern, the chessboard, the penumbra, and the ledger accumulate to reweight her stance. Orientation is solid (cathedral, interregnum, Mira's role), and the lens holds, but the closure image's charge relies heavily on thematic echo rather than a felt forfeiture that narrows future options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is used functionally: it carries her voice to the crowd below, directly enabling the climactic act. The chessboard's empty pawn rows supply a concrete image that charges the ending when sunlight strikes. The nomadic penumbra anchors atmosphere and mirrors Mira's internal liminality. Spatial choreography is clear (gallery, altar, oculus), and the interregnum setting pressures the stakes by creating a leaderless moment. The setting does more than backdrop; it constrains and enables key choices, reaching the 7.0+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing suppressed truth versus maintaining survivor safety—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Mira severs the cords and begins reading, a single meaningful escalation that fits the Accumulative lens. However, the opposition is almost entirely internal and abstract; no on-page force resists her, and the cost of exposure (her complicity revealed) is told rather than dramatized in tactical consequences. The tightening occurs, but the felt price remains conceptual rather than visceral, capping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the chessboard's missing pawns, the diplomat's alphabet, and the ledger of "small gestures," cohering around the erasure and recovery of the ordinary. The final image—sunlight illuminating empty squares—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. "Luminous absence" as a motif accumulates meaning across the penumbra, the hollow chessboard, and Mira's half-false existence. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection, though the thematic vocabulary ("historian of small gestures," "benevolently ruthless") occasionally edges toward thesis statement rather than full dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence," "historian of small gestures"). Psychic distance is controlled, and perceptual signature is present (Mira notices the interregnum's liminality, the chessboard's absence). However, the diction leans heavily on abstract, ornate phrasing throughout—"benevolently ruthless," "authentic suffering," "luminous absence"—creating a uniform textural layer that rarely modulates with emotional pressure. The prose reads as consistently literary rather than rhythmically responsive to scene urgency. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is ambitious and controlled but struggles with density and figurative coherence. "Nomadic penumbra drifted... that permanent half-eclipse... a shadow that moved like a slow predator" stacks three metaphors for the same phenomenon in quick succession without adding pressure. Register is elevated throughout ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless") without modulation for urgency, and several beats paraphrase: "half-false, half-true, walking the boundary between performance and authentic suffering" restates the same idea within one sentence. Template cadence appears in the final paragraph's triple "how" construction. Clarity is maintained, but overwriting and synonym loops dull momentum, triggering cumulative deductions in the −1.0 to −1.4 range and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The chessboard missing pawns as memorial and the walking pattern that spells words offer specific, grounded inflections on the "recovering erased history" premise. The interregnum as liminal crisis-moment and the whispering gallery's architectural function are well-integrated. However, the core frame—survivor becomes truth-teller by exposing hidden records—is familiar, and the transformation relies on thematic vocabulary ("historian of small gestures," "benevolently ruthless") that reads more as prompt fulfillment than lived particularity. The synthesis is coherent and purposeful but not unexpected in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mira's identity as "crisis actor real crisis survivor" is introduced early and frames her internal conflict (performance vs. authenticity). It shapes her motivation and the thematic question but does not drive a specific on-page choice with visible trade-off. The trait is told and echoed rather than tested in a discrete beat where her actor training enables or constrains a tactic. Present across two gates (setup, thematic closure) but lacks middle causal involvement, capping score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chessboard appears at setup (central altar), is handled (fingers hover, ledger beneath), and charges the closure (sunlight illuminates empty squares). It concretizes the "missing pawns" motif and the theme of erasure. The object is irreplaceable: removing it would collapse the final image's resonance. Three-gate integration with closure linkage and beat involvement (observing, retrieving ledger, illumination) pushes the score into the 7.0+ band. Specific cost tied to the element: the ledger's unbinding and reading occur because the chessboard houses it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "nomadic penumbra" is described vividly and mirrors Mira's liminality thematically. It appears in setup and at the ending ("passed, and for three full minutes, pure sunlight struck"). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric parallel rather than causal pressure. The shift from penumbra to sunlight marks the closure moment but does not change Mira's options—she has already begun reading. Two gates (setup, closure participation as backdrop) but no middle development and no causal work, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is introduced early as a label for Mira's motivation and recurs in the cord-cutting beat ("severed the cords with a knife that cut cleanly, ruthlessly, even as her other hand shielded the pages"). The trait is told rather than enacted in a choice with visible trade-off; the simultaneous tenderness and cruelty are asserted but not tested under competing pressures. Setup and thematic echo present, but no discrete beat where the attribute enables a tactic or forecloses a path with felt cost, capping below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears concretely when Mira severs the leather cords binding the ledger, enabling the climactic reading. The action is irreplaceable: without unbinding, the ledger cannot be read and the closure fails. Setup (finding the cords), middle beat (cutting), and closure participation (reading the unbound text) all present. However, the unbinding itself is not dramatized with significant resistance or cost—she cuts "cleanly"—so the action shapes the arc but does not redefine options under pressure. All three gates met, pushing into mid-6s, but lacks the charged struggle to reach 7.0+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The walking pattern is introduced early ("footsteps tracing a pattern... spelling out LIBER"), repeated mid-scene ("steps now spelling REMEMBER"), and paid off at closure ("The pattern of her earlier walking had inscribed itself into dust, temporary yet legible, a map for those who would follow"). The method is specific and irreplaceable, and it charges the final image by leaving a legible guide. Three gates met, but the pattern does not constrain a choice or shape an attempt under pressure; it functions as symbolic action rather than tactical method. Lyric reprise with closure linkage places it in the 5.5–6.5 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is introduced early, used functionally in the middle (Mira circles the altar within it), and enables the climax: "her voice carrying through the architectural miracle to the crowds gathering below." Without the gallery's acoustic properties, the ending would collapse—she could not address the leaderless crowd from this single point. The setting constrains her tactic (speak from this specific location to reach many) and charges the closure. Three gates, causal pressure, and closure linkage present, placing it solidly in the 7.0+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The interregnum is established early ("that hollow space between the Chancellor's death and the Regent's arrival when law itself seemed to hold its breath") and recurs at closure ("still leaderless, still waiting"). It frames the stakes—truth can be spoken in this power vacuum—but does not tighten as a live clock. The time window is asserted rather than felt; no countdown or ticking pressure shapes Mira's tactics on the page. Setup and thematic closure present, but no middle beat where the timeframe narrows options, capping at mid-5s per the two-gate allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire "to become the historian of small gestures" is introduced early, drives the ledger retrieval and reading, and is fulfilled at closure ("she had become what she sought"). It shapes two beats (retrieving, reading) and the ending. However, the motivation is mostly told rather than dramatized in friction: Mira's goal and her actions align smoothly without a visible trade-off between competing wants. Setup, middle involvement, and closure participation all present, but the lack of felt cost or on-page conflict between desire and fear caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is introduced as the penumbra's quality ("a light that revealed by obscuring") and recurs at closure ("In that luminous absence, Mira understood"). The tone is coherent and charges the ending image when sunlight makes the empty pawn squares "visible, making their absence count." It modulates subtly from the dim opening to the bright closure beat. Three gates met and closure participation present, but the tone does not shift with tactical pressure; it remains a stable atmospheric layer rather than a dynamic pressure element, placing it in the mid-6s.</comment>
