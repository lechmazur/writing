<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's profession and goal are clearly signaled, but interiority remains largely conceptual rather than embodied—we see her "knew better than to seek crowns" but not contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The choice to ascend feels inevitable from the start rather than earned through visible cost; no path is foreclosed. The "wisely adventurous" trait is asserted but never tested by a micro-choice that tilts present stance with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early, but the drive lens reads ambiguous: causal linkage (ruby flake → coordinates → waterfall) competes with accumulative texture (murals, pears, cascading prisms). The closure unit—Elara ascending and witnessing dawn—lands as Conceptual Repricing of the throne/wisdom binary, yet the conceptual cost remains abstract: "the weight of ages" and "that was adventure enough" are told rather than demonstrated through a forfeited option or felt price on the page. No meaningful tightening occurs; the quest proceeds smoothly from trigger to summit without a reversal or narrowed choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Futuristic detail (neural monocle, titanium plating, quantum superposition) creates vivid texture, and sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's archival focus (synthetic lavender, ozone, bioluminescent trees). The ruby flake's glow and the waterfall's "impossible geometries" guide her movements, qualifying as micro-setting that constrains choices. However, spatial choreography in the orchard and stairway remains postcard-static: no environmental obstacle forces a tactical trade-off or charges the final image beyond visual beauty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the stairway to restore the archive—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: the ruby flake pulses brighter as she nears, but no reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the waterfall, orchard, and stairway appear exactly as promised. The resolution (unlocking the repository) is delivered by the ruby flake's resonance rather than Elara's agency at closure. The three-hour time window is mentioned but never exerts pressure on her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme—wisdom over dominion, preservation over power—emerges from the unclaimed throne premise and is reinforced by the architects' holographic debate and Elara's final reflection. The ruby flake's transition from pulsing to dark offers a concrete image tied to purpose fulfilled. Yet the ending statement "that was adventure enough for one lifetime" and "true leadership required...the wisdom to know when to simply preserve" explicitly articulate the theme rather than trusting the final image to carry non-literal resonance, lowering the score per the Thematic Echo penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable throughout; diction ("quantum superposition," "liminal hours," "membrane of suspended droplets") sustains a consistent futuristic-archival register. Perceptual signature reflects Elara's lore-keeper role through attention to murals, codes, and cultural fragments. However, psychic distance stays uniform across beats—no modulation under peak pressure—and the final paragraphs summarize her return and compositional intentions ("already composing the new entries") rather than filtering the summit experience through embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and vivid figurative language ("memories surfacing from deep water," "liquid crystal," "weight of ages"). Two paraphrase loops appear: "the ruby flake...pulsed" recurs without added pressure, and the final two paragraphs restate her return and archival mission in near-synonym terms ("composing the new entries" / "archive would live on"). Template cadence is visible in repeated "she [verb]" openers across the middle third, and the closure beat includes scaffold phrases ("understood now why," "treasures greater than") that tell rather than trusting image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of cyberpunk setting, unclaimed throne, and lore-keeper role draws on familiar genre templates (the reluctant hero who chooses knowledge over power). The quantum-orchard twist and holographic architect debate add specificity, but the emotional arc—seeking wisdom, finding it intact, returning satisfied—proceeds without surprise or counter-intuitive turn. The stairway dissolves exactly when needed, and the throne remains symbolically empty in a way that feels predetermined rather than transformed through Elara's particular choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara as lore keeper shapes her goal (restore the archive) and frames her perceptual lens (murals, codes, cultural fragments). Her profession motivates the quest and colors two beats: peeling paint layers and interpreting the holographic recordings. However, her choices do not create turns—she follows the ruby flake's pulse and the murals' coordinates without deviation or trade-off. The role is essential to tone and stakes but does not constrain a middle decision or charge the closure beyond thematic fit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ruby flake appears in three beats: initial pulse, glowing brighter as she nears coordinates, and resonating to unlock the repository before going dark. Its mechanics matter—guides navigation, grants access—and its final state (dark, purpose fulfilled) offers a concrete image of completion. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure or force a tactical trade-off; it functions as a quest compass that delivers solutions rather than complications. Early signal and closure participation elevate the score, but swappability (a "key fragment" could replace it with minor edits) and lack of cost connection cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne frames the premise and motivates the architects' backstory debate. It recurs in the final reflection ("the unclaimed throne would remain empty") to underscore the wisdom-over-power theme. However, it never constrains Elara's on-page choices: she seeks the stairway, not the throne itself, and no beat tests her temptation or forces her to renounce it with visible cost. The concept shapes thematic stakes but remains abstract, never altering tactics or participating causally in closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" is labeled in one line ("someone wisely adventurous, calculating risks against the weight of history rather than rushing headlong") but never dramatized through a choice that balances caution and boldness with visible consequence. Elara proceeds methodically without facing a trade-off where haste would tempt her or excessive caution would cost her the window. The attribute describes her but does not constrain an action or enable a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Sally" appears once as she "initiated her sally, slipping through the service tunnels." It marks the transition from research to action, bridging the mural discovery and the waterfall arrival. However, the action itself—slipping through tunnels—is summarized in a single clause and does not create a turn or redefine options; it could be replaced with "journey" or "departure" with minor edits. Early-to-middle placement and causal linkage (research → movement → discovery) provide modest integration, but lack of specificity and swappability keep it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Peeling paint layers to reveal hidden murals is described in detail ("running her fingers...found the imperfection...began to peel away the paint layers, each stratum releasing scents") and directly enables the next beat by providing the coordinates (grove, waterfall, archway). The method is signaled early, its mechanics matter on the page, and it drives one key turn (research → location knowledge). However, it does not constrain a middle choice under pressure or charge the closure; once the murals are revealed, the method is complete. Two-gate participation (setup, development) without closure linkage places it in the 6.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The hidden orchard appears in two beats: Elara pushes through the waterfall membrane and finds herself among bioluminescent trees, then locates the marble stairway at its center. The setting provides the spatial anchor for the stairway and offers a vivid image (fruit "that tasted of childhood summers"), but it does not pressure her choices—no obstacle, no resource constraint, no tactical trade-off. The orchard functions as a threshold location rather than a crucible. Middle and closure participation without causal constraint place it in the 5.5–6.3 range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The sunrise timeframe is mentioned once ("only three hours until sunrise") and recurs at closure ("first light of sunrise filtered through"). However, the clock is never tracked between those points, and no beat shows Elara adjusting tactics under time pressure. The quantum orchard's liminal-hours requirement is stated but not tested; she arrives, ascends, and completes her goal without the window tightening her decisions. Setup and closure mention without middle development or causal constraint cap the score at the low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Finding the stairway of ascension is Elara's stated goal from the opening paragraph ("she sought the stairs themselves") and drives her entire sequence: decoding murals, traveling to coordinates, passing through the waterfall, and ascending. The motivation is clear and coherent across all beats. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted—no competing want tests her commitment, no cost forces her to weigh the goal against another value. The desire shapes the plot but lacks friction or visible sacrifice, capping it in the mid-6s despite strong setup and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia is sustained through diction ("neural monocle...analog glass...mechanical resonance no hologram could replicate," "synthetic lavender," "bioluminescent trees bore fruit that tasted of childhood summers") and the premise (restoring corrupted archives, rediscovering lost culture). Tone remains coherent across beats and modulates slightly at closure (elegiac satisfaction). However, the tone does not charge the final image with additional pressure or cost; it provides consistent atmosphere without deepening stakes. Coherence without intensification places it mid-band.</comment>
