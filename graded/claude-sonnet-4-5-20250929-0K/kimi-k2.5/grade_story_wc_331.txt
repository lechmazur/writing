<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is declared ("to reawaken the narrative") but never tested by on-page contradiction or cost; she succeeds without friction. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("sanely eccentric," "observed solitude") rather than embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's memory functions as exposition rather than a live conflict that shapes Elena's present choices. No meaningful change or renunciation with visible cost occurs; the final smile signals completion without foreclosing a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (architectural imagery, scarf-as-motif), but no tightening or deepening occurs; Elena moves through space without narrowing options or encountering resistance. Closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (reawakening the story) but the "vibration in the silk" and the narrative stirring are told, not dramatized with visible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~150 words, borderline but no penalty applied. No meaningful escalation: Elena calculates, steps, wraps, succeeds—each beat is additive summary without pressure or reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hyperbolic library architecture is vividly rendered ("shelves curved inward like Pringles chips") and the scarf returns with physical specificity ("tattered silk," "frayed edges"). Spatial choreography of the non-Euclidean stacks is coherent and voice-filtered through Elena's mathematical understanding. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Elena's trajectory is pre-calculated and unimpeded, so setting remains atmospheric rather than pressure-bearing at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reawaken grandmother's story) is signaled early but never tested by opposition, cost, or a difficult choice. No on-page reversal or tightening; Elena's three-year calculation pays off without friction. The reawakening occurs via wrapping the scarf—an action that lacks agency since no live decision or trade-off is dramatized. Pressure remains static; each beat is a step in a predetermined sequence rather than escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of analog memory vs. digital recollection is woven through the scarf and the library's geometry, avoiding direct statement. The final image (scarf holding a reawakened story) attempts resonance but is undermined by the ease of Elena's success; no cost complicates the thematic question. Subtext in "observed solitude" and the contrast between flat Euclidean patrons and Elena's hyperbolic journey is present but not deepened by conflict. The ending's "duty complete" reads as mission-accomplished satisfaction rather than a reweighted question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; diction ("Atheneum of Quantum Verses," "negative-curvature bookshelf") commits to an elevated, concept-heavy register that fits Elena's mathematical lens. Perceptual signature is consistent (physics-inflected metaphors, geometric observations). However, the voice becomes repetitive in syntactic structure (long noun-chains, stacked prepositional phrases) and the prose leans abstract rather than embodying Elena's state under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("comet's tail of physical memory," "cutting through the digital age's haze") without pattern-teaching or payoff; many metaphors are ornamental rather than propulsive. Template cadence is pervasive: "She [verb], [noun phrase]; She [verb], [noun phrase]…" runs across multiple paragraphs without taught pattern. Paraphrase loops appear: "the place where stories lived" / "where stories truly lived" / "where stories pulsed" restate the same concept. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (character + setting) but several beats summarize rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise (librarian navigates hyperbolic geometry to reawaken a dormant narrative) is fresh in its synthesis of speculative architecture and analog memory. The scarf as physical mnemonic device and the scientific-poetry library are specific, non-generic choices. However, the emotional arc and plot structure are template-familiar: protagonist undertakes quest, succeeds without complication, fulfills duty. The hyperbolic geometry functions as atmospheric detail rather than a constraint that forces transformation; swapping it for another fantastical method would leave the arc unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena (odd-hour librarian) is present throughout and her occupation frames the setting, but her choices are declarative rather than turning: she "had calculated," she "moved," she "wrapped." No on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses an option; her trajectory is pre-set. The role shapes atmosphere but not plot pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tattered silk scarf appears in beats 1 (adjusted), 5 (analog memory), 11 (traced with trembling fingers), 14 (streaming like a comet's tail), 17 (wrapped around the narrative), 18 (vibration in the silk), and 21 (loosened, holding the reawakened story). It seeds early, recurs across the arc, and participates in the closure image. However, its function is largely symbolic; Elena never faces a choice whether to use it, risk it, or sacrifice it. The scarf enables the reawakening but does not constrain prior action or impose visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Analog memories (the scarf vs. synthetic neural threads) are introduced early and contrasted with digital recollection in beats 5–6. The concept returns at closure ("analog memory of the scarf" bridges history and myth), shaping the thematic question. However, on-page choices never hinge on analog vs. digital; the concept flavors stakes but does not alter tactics or options. It functions as theme rather than plot mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is labeled in beat 4 ("Elena was sanely eccentric") but never demonstrated through on-page contradiction, social friction, or a choice that costs her. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized; it could be removed without altering any action. Label-only mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Reawaken" structures the entire arc: Elena's goal (beat 10), her calculation (beat 9), the wrapping action (beat 17), the vibration (beat 18), the stirring (beat 19), and the closure image (beat 21). The action drives all major beats and anchors the ending. However, it occurs via summary ("The reawakening began") rather than a dramatized moment of agency or cost, weakening its felt necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is seeded early (beat 3, "spiral staircases that disobeyed the parallel postulate") and recurs in beats 4, 8, 9, 13, 17. Elena's understanding of it enables her trajectory ("the hyperbolic geometry obeyed her understanding"). However, the method never imposes difficulty, failure, or a tactical adjustment; it functions as atmospheric permission rather than a constraint that shapes attempts. Present across beats but not pressure-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library (Atheneum of Quantum Verses) frames every scene: the stacks (beat 3), the restricted section (beat 7), the astrophysics-lyricism shelves (beat 12). It provides the hyperbolic architecture and the dormant narrative's location. However, the setting does not pressure Elena's choices or supply resources she must navigate; it is traversed rather than negotiated. Atmospheric integration without tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" is mentioned in beats 2, 12, and 20 ("patrons browsed above"), establishing a contrast between Elena's hidden journey and the surface routine. However, no time pressure or ticking clock constrains her actions; the browsing patrons are backdrop rather than a deadline or tactical complication. Timeframe is present but does not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories live" is declared in beat 4 and reframed at closure (beat 20, "she had finally found where stories truly lived"). It drives Elena's three-year calculation and her journey into the hyperbolic fold. However, the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants, doubt, or cost; Elena pursues it without friction or sacrifice. Told and enacted, but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" appears in beats 12 and 20 ("that particular brand of observed solitude," "stepped back…into observed solitude"). The tone is coherent and stable, modulating slightly as Elena moves from preparation to action to completion. However, the tone does not deepen or charge under pressure; it remains a consistent atmospheric layer rather than intensifying at closure. Present and consistent, but static.</comment>
