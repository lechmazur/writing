<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to ground spirits is coherent and her self-revelation about breaking her mask intentionally shows internal complexity. The confession-as-ceremony structure provides emotional progression, though the interiority leans toward abstract declarations ("I am broken," "Only a cracked vessel can hold this kind of silence") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The final transformation into a repository feels conceptually earned but the choice itself unfolds without visible struggle or renunciation cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira becomes the net, holding silence so others can rest, with conceptual cost legible in "absolute stillness" and her waiting state. Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what). The accumulation—twelve ghosts released across four hours, silence filling her mask—creates a meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake. Cost is conceptual and felt in the final image, though the physical price (what she forfeits by becoming a silence-repository) remains implied rather than dramatically tested.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vividly rendered with spectral geometries, obsidian table, and prismatic walls that split starlight into unnamed colors. The tapestry needle and fisherman's net are handled tactilely across multiple beats, grounding the ritual in concrete objects. The broken mask functions as micro-setting, constraining her perception ("eyes exposed to the accumulated silence") and charging the final image when silence fills its cracks like dark kintsugi. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grounding the twelve spirits—is signaled early and pursued methodically. Pressure accumulates through the unraveling ritual: each knot releases a ghost, and silence gathers in Mira's fractures, deepening the cost with each spirit freed. The textural escalation is visible (six spirits by the fourth hour, starlight sharpening, her confession spilling out), but the resolution is a willing transformation rather than a forced trade-off. Agency is present as endurance and acceptance, though the final cost (becoming the net) is accepted without on-page resistance or visible renunciation struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Mira's paradox: a broken restorer who releases rather than binds, taking trauma into her own fractures so others can rest. The net-as-prison and mask-as-vessel motifs recur with shifting meaning, and the final image—"she had become the net now"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how brokenness enables healing. Subtext operates through the ritual itself; the confession ("I came here to die") deepens thematic complexity. No overt moralizing; the ending reweights prior material without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices "interlaced hush," "accumulated silence," and starlight refracted into unnamed colors. Diction ("exhume the twelfth ghost," "lucid unrest," "absolute stillness") is controlled and purposeful, creating a consistent textural voice. The whispered confession to the net maintains psychic distance without head-hopping. Some elevated phrasing ("letting them settle like sediment rather than whirl in eternal turbulence") risks register drift, but the voice remains coherent under pressure and the final image holds steady rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("silence...grew heavy enough to crush breath from lungs," "starlight...bending into colors that had no names"), creating a lush texture that sometimes crowds the syntax. Several phrases loop conceptually: "accumulated silence" appears multiple times, and "interlaced hush" is restated without new pressure. The opening sentence is syntactically dense ("worked...needle poised...sanctuary...fracturing...geometries...danced...mask") but legible. Momentum occasionally stalls under ornamental weight ("the awareness that everything was precisely where it should be, yet nothing felt safe"), though the ritual progression provides propulsion. No major template cadence or paraphrase loops, but the density near peak beats (final knot, final image) risks obscuring immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—releasing spirits by unraveling knots rather than binding them—offers a fresh inversion of the exorcism trope. Mira's broken mask as qualification rather than liability, and her willing transformation into a silence-repository, feel specific and earned. The prism sanctuary and fisherman's net are particularized through sensory detail and ritual mechanics. The story commits fully to its lyric-accumulative design without hedging. Some risk in the elevated register and figurative density, though the conceptual integrity holds and the final transformation feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira drives every beat: she chooses to work the net, confesses to it, and accepts the transformation into a silence-repository. Her decision to break her mask intentionally (backstory) primes the ending choice. Present across setup, middle unraveling, and closure transformation. Causal pressure is visible in her ritual choices and the cost she absorbs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in the opening, is used to tease apart knots across multiple beats ("worked the tapestry needle through the mesh," "another knot," "the final knot surrendered to her tapestry needle"), and is set down in the final image. Functionally essential to the unraveling method, though its specific properties (why a tapestry needle vs. another tool) are not dramatized. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; shapes the ritual but does not constrain a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is named early, defined as "woven quiet that had kept these souls suspended," and drives the central conflict: Mira must unravel it to free the spirits. Each unraveled thread releases "a fragment of the interlaced hush." The concept shapes tactics (unweaving vs. cutting) and reappears at closure when it "unraveled completely into the waiting air." Causal role in setup, middle, and ending; constrains method and charges the final release.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira "accumulates silence" throughout the ritual: it pools in the tower, gathers in her broken mask, fills the cracks "like gold in kintsugi, but darker, heavier." The trait enables her role ("Only a cracked vessel can hold this kind of silence without shattering completely") and drives the ending transformation. Visible cost: she becomes a repository, sealed in "absolute stillness." Causal pressure across setup, middle, and closure; indispensable to the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Exhume" is signaled in the opening ("Tonight she would exhume the twelfth ghost"), enacted across the middle ritual, and completed at closure ("the last spirit exhaled"). The action defines the story's through-line: releasing trapped souls. Each knot loosened is an exhumation beat; the final knot completes the set. Removing this action would collapse the plot. Causal, irreplaceable, and closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The method—unraveling knots in the fisherman's net—is signaled early, mechanically detailed ("using the tapestry needle to tease apart"), and executed beat by beat ("worked the first knot," "another knot," "half the net lay in untangled heaps," "the final knot surrendered"). The method distinguishes this ritual from binding or cutting, shapes tactics, and is indispensable to the closure effect. Causal pressure across all beats; the specificity (centuries-old net, knotted by salt and time) matters.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary under starlight frames every beat: starlight refracts into geometries, splits darkness into colors, sharpens into blades, and bends around Mira at the end. The sanctuary's "lucid unrest" charges the atmosphere and its walls provide sensory texture. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice, but it charges the closure image ("the starlight bent around her, acknowledging the exchange"). Present in setup, middle, and ending; essential to tone and final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"across sharing a secret"—is introduced early ("beginning the timeframe of their shared secret," "the sharing of their secret") and tracked loosely ("By the fourth hour, half the net lay in untangled heaps"). The confession unfolds across the ritual, creating intimacy. Time does not tighten decisions (no live clock pressure), but the durational unfolding supports the accumulative design. Present in setup and middle; functional but not causal in shaping the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation—"to ground restless spirits"—is stated early, dramatized through the unraveling ritual, and fulfilled at closure ("six spirits had found their way to the ground, no longer restless"). Mira's method (release, not binding) embodies the desire. Friction appears in the cost she absorbs: taking their trauma into her fractures. The motivation drives every beat and the ending transformation; visible cost ties it to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named early ("the sanctuary's characteristic lucid unrest settling over her—the awareness that everything was precisely where it should be, yet nothing felt safe"), modulates through the ritual ("The lucid unrest of the sanctuary intensified"), and finds resolution at closure ("the sanctuary's unrest found its lucid resolution in her absolute stillness"). The tone is coherent, matches the paradoxical stakes, and charges the final image. Purposeful and consistent across beats.</comment>
