<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and specific—his trembling fingers and three decades of checking dam integrity create credible history. However, his final motivation ("to spin stories into shared meaning") arrives through direct statement rather than through contradictory impulses tested under pressure. The nurse Sarah Chen and the grandmother's ambulance arrive as backstory exposition without forcing a present choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. His decision to build an archive feels inevitable but lacks the embodied tension of competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: drought exposes the town, photographs accumulate across thirty yards, and the final image of Elias walking up with his satchel reconfigures his role from maintenance warden to archivist. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he carries "the weight of resurrection," crystallizing his stance with conceptual cost (the town's history now his burden). Orientation is clear by the second paragraph. One deduction: the photographs' arrangement "as if placed by careful design" hints at agency never dramatized, a setup without payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective: "reservoir's surface becomes indistinguishable from the bruised sky," "viscous mud that had been Mrs. Callahan's prize-winning vegetable garden," the sapphire label matching "the deep October sky perfectly." The exposed foundations and retreating waterline constrain Elias's discovery and charge the final image of stars "trembling in the remaining water like memories trying to surface." Micro-setting (the mahogany floor, the embankment) shapes his physical descent and the trail's logic. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving drowned Millhaven's true history before the rains return—is signaled early and tightens through the photograph trail leading to the sapphire label with its damning date. The accumulative pressure builds: each image reweights the "precisely humane" official narrative. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias recognizes the label and recalls Sarah Chen's death, shifting his purpose from dam maintenance to historical witness. Cost is conceptual (carrying the town's silence) but legible in the final image. No overt antagonist, consistent with Situational/Accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the photographs contradict official records, the sapphire label's date three days before flooding, Sarah Chen's death during furniture-saving. The final image—"carrying the weight of resurrection"—offers a resonant answer to the question of how buried truth resurfaces without stating a moral. "Expunged from the ledger of bureaucratic lies, not erased, but corrected" risks direct statement but is earned by prior accumulation. The mirrored hush and trembling reflections charge the ending with the urgency of memory against erasure. No thematic drift; complexity holds without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Elias with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a distinct elevated register ("liminal hour," "archaeological patience," "turbid water") that fits a reflective warden but occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing: "water against stone and the whisper of sediment settling into new configurations" front-loads lyricism before stakes are clear. Perceptual signature is strong—he notices stress fractures, clay, granite foundations. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("he recognized," "he understood") are acceptable and voice-motivated. One slip: "innocent people" editorializes in a way that breaks the POV's measured tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the middle paragraphs (photograph trail, label discovery). However, overwriting clusters in the opening: "the heartbeat of water against stone and the whisper of sediment settling" and "stone foundations emerged like broken teeth through the retreating silt, and the main street resembled a scar healing in reverse" stack metaphors without pattern-teaching. "Viscous mud that had been Mrs. Callahan's prize-winning vegetable garden" delivers specificity and irony efficiently. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the first third without payoff triggers −0.4. Grammar and syntax are clean; no pronoun drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—reservoir drought exposes a drowned town and forces a warden to confront official lies—synthesizes familiar elements (submerged history, archival witness) through the specific trail of photographs and the sapphire label's precise date. The warden-as-archivist turn feels earned rather than imposed. However, the "forced marches in the night, of burning homes left to ash" echoes broad historical templates without the lived detail that would make Millhaven irreplaceable. Sarah Chen's death is specific but arrives as backstory exposition. Risk-taking is moderate; the accumulative structure and mirrored-hush tone elevate but do not fully transform the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and makes the closure choice to gather the photographs and build an archive. However, most of his interiority is reflective observation; the only on-page decision is the final gathering. Two beats: recognizing the label and deciding to preserve the evidence. His choice alters his role but does not narrow prior options with visible tradeoff on the page. Setup clear, development observational, payoff present but low-agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sapphire-hued label appears twice: first as "a sapphire-hued liqueur label peeling from a shattered bottle" with the clock emblem, then as an object Elias places in his satchel. Its color matches the October sky, charging the visual motif. The date (October 14, 1963) provides the causal key that reweights the official narrative. Setup in the middle third, development through recognition of the date and distillery emblem, payoff as a carried artifact. Specific and irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the historical proof. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The reservoir town resurfacing shapes every beat: the drought lowers the waterline, exposing foundations and enabling the photograph trail. It frames the stakes (truth will be reburied when rains return) and provides the spatial logic for Elias's descent. The concept appears in the opening, drives the middle discovery sequence, and charges the final image ("before the returning rains swallowed the truth again"). Removal would eliminate the story's engine. Setup immediate, development across all beats, payoff explicit. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" is used once to describe the official records and is immediately contradicted by "forced marches in the night, of burning homes." It functions as ironic counterpoint rather than a constraint on action. No on-page choice is enabled or limited by this attribute; it exists as thematic label. Present in the middle third, no development, no closure participation. Swappable with "orderly" or "compassionate" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears in the final third: "The town needed its history expunged from the ledger of bureaucratic lies, not erased, but corrected." It clarifies Elias's motivation but does not create a turn; the decision to gather evidence precedes this articulation. The word reframes his purpose as correction rather than revelation, adding specificity. However, it arrives after the key choice and could be replaced with "corrected" or "liberated" (the next clause) without altering the action. One beat involvement, late signal, no causal pressure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The trail of photographs structures the discovery sequence: "each image arranged as if placed by careful design across thirty yards." Three photographs are described (nurse, child, saloon interior), leading to the sapphire label. The method provides spatial and causal logic for Elias's descent and governs pacing. Setup in the middle, development across the sequence, implicit in the final gathering. However, the "careful design" phrase hints at intentional arrangement never explained or paid off, and the photographs themselves are vessels rather than active constraints. Two beats, moderate causal pressure, closure participation via the satchel.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Midnight Ridgeway appears in the opening ("twilight had arrived at Midnight Ridgeway") and the closing sentence ("The warden walked back up Midnight Ridgeway"). Twilight creates the "mirrored hush" and frames the temporal pressure (stars appear, bats stitch the sky). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource; it functions as atmospheric anchor. The ridgeway itself is not described or used tactically. Setup early, no middle development, reprise at closure reweights the image but does not alter options. Lyric resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the wind chime falls silent" appears in the opening sentence and is followed by "valley enters a vacuum where sound forgets to echo." The timeframe anchors the opening mood but does not recur or constrain later choices. Elias checks his watch once; twilight becomes starlight by the end, marking elapsed time passively. No middle development, no closure participation. The wind chime is ornamental; removing it would not alter the sequence. Present but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To spin stories into shared meaning" is Elias's stated motivation in the penultimate paragraph: "His motivation had never been merely to maintain concrete and pressure gauges, but to spin stories into shared meaning." This reframes his thirty-year role and drives the final choice to build an archive. However, it is articulated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants. One beat (the realization), late signal, direct participation in closure. Functional and thematically central but told rather than shown under pressure. No on-page friction between this desire and a competing cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears twice: in the opening ("creating a perfect mirrored hush between earth and air") and near the end ("the mirrored hush of the reservoir, their reflections trembling"). The tone is maintained through elevated, meditative diction and the accumulation of stillness, silence, and submersion imagery. It modulates slightly—opening is observational, ending is charged with urgency ("trying to surface for one final breath"). The tone supports the Accumulative lens and charges the final image of stars trembling. Setup immediate, development consistent, payoff clear. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
