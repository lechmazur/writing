<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lys possesses clear motivation (preserving virginity as resistance, harvesting echoes to defy conformity) and the final act of entering the sanctuary and gathering echoes demonstrates agency. However, interiority leans heavily on poetic abstraction ("bodily poetic," "verses in the air") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The piece tells us she is resistant but does not dramatize internal conflict or a moment where contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. Backstory exposition (House of Twelve Sighs, Empire's song) anchors present choice but occupies significant real estate without micro-choices that alter present options until the final third.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric, layered design early and holds it. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lys unlocks the sanctuary, steps inside, sees infinite failed selves, and begins gathering echoes while "the snow continued to fall... erasing footprints, preserving the secret." The final image reconfigures her act as a covert preservation against erasure, with felt cost (secrecy, the alarming serenity deepening into "something sacred and terrifying"). However, the orientation test reveals ambiguity: "who" is clear, "where" (silver courtyard) is anchored, but "when" remains vague (Empire-era palace, no historical marker) past ~120 words. The timeframe "between sigh and smile" is poetic rather than a legible temporal anchor, creating minor orientation debt that does not fully obscure the closure but delays grounding. Cost proof is present in the final image (secrecy, the snow erasing footprints, the thaw "that must inevitably come"). Applying −0.3 for orientation ambiguity and waiving the Q3 cap since the poetic frame ultimately charges the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (flakes "like ash from a silent burning," starlight bouncing off snow to create "monochrome radiance"). The prism sanctuary's glass and quartz facets catch moonbeams and fracture them into spectral geometry, and the final image uses the sanctuary's refracted infinities to charge the closure. Spatial choreography is clear (courtyard to sanctuary heart to inside). The environment constrains choice: the temporal filaments must be untangled to unlock the sanctuary, and the snow-muffled night provides cover while also creating "alarming serenity." This crosses the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice and charges the final image). Minor deduction: the Empire's broader world rules are asserted but not shown through action; the "House of Twelve Sighs" and "lullaby of conformity" remain abstract without micro-setting texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unlock the sanctuary and harvest echoes to preserve memory against the Empire's erasure. The piece signals this early and tightens once: Lys must untangle temporal threads (middle beat) to unlock the sanctuary (final beat). Agency is present (her fingers untangle, she steps inside and gathers echoes), and the cost is legible in the final image (secrecy, the snow erasing her footprints, the "thaw that must inevitably come"). However, the escalation is mild—no reversal or complication tests her commitment; the threads resist but she succeeds without visible trade-off or foreclosed option until the very end. The tutor's death and the three-minute window create temporal pressure that is asserted but not dramatized (no clock ticking down, no consequence for running late). Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, but the lack of a visible micro-cost during the untangling sequence keeps this in mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and action: memory preservation versus enforced forgetting, chastity as integrity and resistance, the cost of defiance. The final image (infinite failed selves in each facet, the snow erasing footprints while preserving the secret) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. However, several phrases veer into thematic echo: "her virginity a blade she whetted against the lullaby of conformity," "defying the lullaby of conformity," and "bodily poetic" as a recurring label that abstracts rather than dramatizes. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection, but the prompt-adjacent language ("harvest echoes," "lullaby of conformity," "bodily poetic") occasionally replaces scene pressure with thematic assertion. Subtext operates well in gesture and image (starlight meeting starlight, snow as erasure and preservation), lifting the score despite the label reliance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited focused on Lys. Distance is controlled, and perceptual signature is present (she notices the tutor's exhale, the temporal filaments, the starlight geometry). However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated, poetic register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "bodily poetic," "spectral geometry," "fourth-dimensional tangles," "accumulated stillness." These phrases are lyric and purposeful but lack the specificity of Lys's lived idiom. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose rhythm supports pressure adequately, though runs of similar syntactic structures (comma-laden descriptors) create mild monotony. No head-hopping or tense slips. The voice is distinct and coherent but not character-particular enough to reach high bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is lyric and ambitious, with vivid images ("flakes fell like ash from a silent burning," "shadows moved like living ink"). However, overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "bodily poetic" appears three times; "lullaby of conformity" twice; figurative language clusters densely without pattern-teaching or payoff ("verses in the air," "calligraphy against the white expanse," "temporal threshold," "fourth-dimensional tangles"). Mixed metaphors: "her virginity a blade she whetted against the lullaby" conflates weapon and song incoherently. Register drift into abstract philosophical diction ("flux," "temporal filaments," "accumulated stillness") clashes with the POV's immediate sensory experience. Paraphrase loop: "bodily poetic" is restated as "each gesture bodily poetic and deliberate" within one sentence. Template cadence is mild but present (several sentences open with participial phrases). Applying −0.8 for density and coherence overwriting, −0.4 for mixed metaphor and register drift, totaling −1.2 in Q7. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("bodily poetic grace" in the final sentence), triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise (chaste courtesan harvesting crystallized memories in a totalitarian empire) synthesizes familiar dystopian and fantasy elements with a fresh angle: virginity as resistance currency and echoes as physical objects. The prism sanctuary and temporal filaments offer specific, non-obvious world logic. However, the "lullaby of conformity" and "harvest echoes" read as prompt-adjacent labels rather than lived-in concepts; the piece does not transform these templates through particularized stakes or moral calculus. The final image (infinite failed selves, snow erasing/preserving) is resonant and inevitable in hindsight, lifting the score. The lyric mode is bold but the thematic echo in the final line ("bodily poetic grace") recycles a phrase already used twice, reducing freshness. Transformation is partial: the emotional arc (defiance, gathering echoes) could transplant to other settings without loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lys (chaste courtesan) is present throughout. Her chastity is signaled early ("remained untouched, her virginity a blade") and stated as key to her resistance ("her integrity a key that no lock could reject"). It shapes one middle choice (her chastity is "part of this resistance") but does not constrain a visible decision with cost—it is told as thematic armor rather than dramatized as a trade-off. The final beat (gathering echoes) does not hinge on her chastity; her skill with temporal threads does. Two gates (setup, middle development as thematic pressure) are met; closure participation is weak (mentioned in the final paragraph but not causally active in the gathering act). Swappable: her resistance could be courage, skill, or another trait without altering the unlock sequence. Applying −0.5 for swappability and −0.3 for summary-only use in the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is introduced early (courtyard's heart, structure of glass and quartz), used in the middle beat (Lys untangles threads to unlock it), and central to the closure (she steps inside, the facets reveal infinite failed selves, she gathers echoes within). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the sanctuary's locked state creates the obstacle; its interior properties (refracted infinities) charge the final image. Specificity: the quartz facets, spectral geometry, and "accumulated light" are irreplaceable; a generic vault would not support the closure's mirror-image revelation. Cost connection: the "alarming serenity deepening into something sacred and terrifying" ties to the sanctuary's interior. Minor deduction: the sanctuary is described but not handled/used in ≥2 distinct physical beats (it is unlocked once, entered once); the interior use is primarily visual revelation rather than tactile interaction. Applying +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal pressure, +1.4 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity; −0.3 for minimal tactile handling across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" frames the story's goal early ("Tonight she would harvest echoes") and the final beat shows Lys gathering echoes ("cupping them in her palms"). Two gates (setup, closure). However, the mechanics remain abstract: echoes are "crystallized memories" but their physical form, the act of gathering, and the consequence of possession are told, not shown. The concept does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics—Lys's actions (watching the tutor die, untangling threads, stepping inside) would be identical if she were seeking a key, a relic, or knowledge. The stakes (preserve memory against erasure) are shaped by the concept thematically, but the on-page choices are not. Applying +0.5 early signal, +0.7 closure linkage; −0.6 for summary-only use, −0.5 for swappability (relic/key).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" appears three times as a label ("her chaste courtesan's gait a sonnet," "each gesture bodily poetic and deliberate," "bodily poetic grace") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It is descriptive texture, not a trait that shapes choice. No gate is met: it is mentioned early but never developed as a skill or limitation in the middle beats, and in the closure it is invoked as a label ("with bodily poetic grace") without altering the act of carrying echoes forward. The untangling sequence could be performed with skill, patience, or precision; "bodily poetic" is swappable. Applying −0.8 for label-only use across all beats, −0.5 for swappability, −0.3 for ornamental closure mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unlock" is the central action: Lys must unlock the prism sanctuary to access the echoes. Setup early (sanctuary "sealed," threads "knotted"), middle beat (untangling threads, "final thread slipped free," doors open), closure (she steps inside and gathers). Three gates met. Causal pressure: the locked state is the obstacle; unlocking it is the turning point that enables the final gathering. Specificity: the unlock method (untangling temporal filaments) is unique and irreplaceable; a generic key would not fit the world logic. Cost: the untangling is described as resisting with "voices of previous custodians who had failed," imposing a skill test, though the cost to Lys is not visible (no injury, fatigue, or trade-off shown). Applying +0.7 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.3 causal pressure, +1.1 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity; −0.4 for generic implied cost (effort, not visible price).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is the method signaled in the middle beat ("to unlock the prism, one had to surrender patience... fingers dancing through fourth-dimensional tangles"). The mechanics are described (spirals, figure-eights, stripping away decades) and matter: the threads resist, she must avoid prior custodians' mistakes, the final thread releases the lock. Two gates (middle development, closure enabler). However, the method is not signaled early (first mention is at the sanctuary, midpoint of the story) and the specifics (fourth-dimensional tangles, temporal filaments) remain abstract—no on-page cost, injury, or trade-off demonstrates the difficulty. The method shapes one attempt (the untangling sequence) but is summarized rather than dramatized beat-by-beat. Applying +0.4 one beat, +0.8 causal pressure, +0.5 closure linkage; −0.4 late signal, −0.5 summary-only mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "silver courtyard under snow" is introduced in the opening line and sustained throughout. Setup early, used in the middle (Lys crosses it, the snow muffles sound and provides cover), and present in the closure (the snow continues to fall, erasing footprints and preserving the secret). Three gates met. The snow constrains choice subtly: it muffles the night (enabling stealth), provides temporal cover (the household is drugged, the tutor's death gives her a window), and erases evidence. The courtyard's monochrome radiance and starlight guide her path. However, the setting's pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical—no moment where Lys must navigate the snow, avoid a patrol, or use the courtyard's layout to solve a problem. Applying +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 causal pressure (cover/stealth), +0.9 closure linkage (snow erasing footprints); −0.4 for atmospheric rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" is introduced early as "the temporal threshold when the veil thinned, when a dying breath and the birth of joy became indistinguishable moments." The tutor's death provides the sigh, the kitchen girl's morning smile the endpoint, and Lys has "perhaps three minutes" before the household stirs. Setup gate met. However, the timeframe is poetic abstraction rather than a live clock: no moment where Lys checks time, hurries, or faces consequence for delay. The three-minute window is asserted but not tracked or tested. The closure does not confirm whether she succeeded within the window; the snow falling "in heavy sheets" implies ongoing time but no urgency. Missing middle development (no tightening tied to elapsed time) and closure participation (time is not causally active in the final beat). Applying +0.5 early signal; −0.6 for summary-only use, −0.5 for missing gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Defy the lullaby of conformity" is stated twice explicitly and frames Lys's resistance throughout. Setup early ("her virginity a blade she whetted against the lullaby of conformity"), middle development (the lullaby "urged her to stop, to sleep, to become like the others"), closure mention ("carry it forward into a thaw"). Two gates (setup, middle as internal obstacle). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in choices: no on-page moment where Lys is tempted to conform, weighs giving up, or pays a visible cost to resist. The untangling sequence references the lullaby but she succeeds without internal conflict or trade-off. The motivation shapes the goal (harvest echoes to resist erasure) but does not create friction between wants and costs in scene. Applying +0.6 early signal, +0.4 one beat (middle internal obstacle); −0.6 for told-only dramatization, −0.3 for label repetition.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" is introduced early ("the alarming serenity of the snow-muffled night pressed against her skin, beautiful and suffocating") and modulates in the closure ("the alarming serenity deepened into something sacred and terrifying"). Two gates (setup, closure). The tone is coherent through turns: the snow's beauty/suffocation tension holds, and the final deepening charges the image with undeniable pressure. However, the tone does not modulate with mid-story pressure—the untangling sequence maintains lyric description without tonal shift to match the resistance of the threads or the urgency of the three-minute window. The tone is atmospheric and consistent but does not heighten stakes or narrow choices in the middle beats. Applying +0.7 early signal, +1.1 closure linkage, +0.5 coherent modulation; −0.4 for static mood in middle beats, −0.3 for label repetition ("alarming serenity" used twice verbatim).</comment>
