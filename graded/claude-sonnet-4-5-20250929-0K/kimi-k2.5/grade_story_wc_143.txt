<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions—climbing, mixing reagents, refusing shelter despite hypothermic cold. Her purposeful curiosity drives micro-choices (kneeling to inspect fusion-glass, checking aperture, wrapping arms around heating coils) that reveal hierarchy of values. Internal conflict between witness-duty and futility ("her curiosity had only served to archive extinction") operates simultaneously in the final descent. Minor slip: the grandfather's smuggled grain feels more symbolic prop than lived contradiction shaping present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: Elena descends with both photograph and "melancholy certainty," crystallizing the cost of bearing witness to erasure—she has stolen the image but cannot stop the drills. Causal lens holds throughout: climb → chemical prep → outlasting cold → shutter at dawn → descent as drills begin. Single continuous scene on the summit with clear spatial and temporal anchors by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening when sunlight reveals the iridescent shock fractures she must capture before drilling vaporizes them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The moonlit summit constrains multiple choices: extreme cold forces her to wrap heating coils and decide whether to retreat; the terminator line's movement dictates when she can photograph; regolith and fusion-glass veins provide the material for her chemical message. Micro-setting (titanium plaque, spectrograph, camera aperture) is handled tactilely and shapes tactical moves. The dawning light transformation—"cathedral of gold and obsidian"—charges the final image without tourist-catalog excess. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities: she notices stratigraphic data and interference patterns first.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (document pristine crater before corporate destruction) is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens through the hypothermic vigil: she must outlast darkness to capture the dawn moment or lose the photograph forever. Agency is endurance with visible cost—minus-170° cold, fogging helmet, arms wrapped around coils. The price is legible: she witnesses the end but cannot prevent it, and her chemical message may wait for "hands that might never come." Single meaningful deepening when the drills stir and she realizes documentation only "served to archive extinction."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between preservation and progress, witness versus complicity, corporate extraction versus irreplaceable beauty. The hourglass grain bridges "ancient vigilance and modern duty" through concrete action (catalyst timer) rather than assertion. Final image offers resonant answer without moralizing: "in her camera, the dawning hush remained eternal—proof that someone had cared enough to witness the end." The chemical message's uncertain future and the corporation's indifferent advance create genuine moral complexity without false equivalence. No thematic echo in prompt-language; the piece trusts its images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; perceptual signature is consistently professional-elegiac (noticing "fusion-glass veins," "interference pattern of impact melt"). Diction modulates appropriately under pressure: technical vocabulary ("regolith," "ferricyanide," "terminator line") anchors her expertise while poetic compression ("razor-thin crescent," "cathedral of gold and obsidian") reflects emotional stakes without register clash. Psychic distance tightens during the hypothermic vigil and opens slightly for the final reflective descent. Minor texture issue: "drowning in black velvet" and "jaws of progress" edge toward stock metaphor but recover quickly through specific technical grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Strong information density and propulsion; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes simultaneously. Rhythm varies appropriately—longer technical exposition early, tighter syntax during the cold vigil, measured cadence at closure. Minor overwriting in the opening: "blinding lunar glare" and "moonlit peak" in consecutive sentences create mild redundancy, and "blue marble drowning in black velvet" is a stock Earth-from-space image. The phrase "made her heart seem thunderous in its cage" approaches cliché. No major loops or scaffold, but figurative density in the Earth paragraph slightly exceeds the surrounding pressure level.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The chemical-message preservation method and the hourglass grain as catalyst timer offer fresh synthesis of lunar resource extraction with archival resistance. The "dawning hush" as the specific photographic moment transforms the familiar last-witness premise through technical specificity (interference patterns, UV oxidation rates, titanium plaque encoding). Emotional truth—melancholy duty without heroic triumph—avoids genre defaults. Slight derivative pressure: the corporation-versus-individual-preservationist frame and the bittersweet "archive extinction" conclusion echo established eco-SF templates, though the lunar crater and chemical-timer mechanics provide enough specificity to elevate above median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's choices create all major turns: she climbs to the summit (inciting action), mixes the chemical paste (preservation attempt), refuses to retreat during hypothermic cold (endurance test), triggers the shutter at the precise dawn moment (capture), and descends as drills begin (acceptance/closure). Each decision narrows options and demonstrates hierarchy of values under pressure. Present in setup (paragraph one), middle development (vigil and chemical prep), and ending (photograph and descent).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sand grain appears in three beats: removed from pouch and held (paragraph two), mental synchronization during the cold vigil ("one hour remaining"), and theoretical completion at dawn ("would have reached the bottom now"). It functions as a catalyst timer bridging "ancient vigilance and modern duty," but its mechanics remain abstract—we never see it fall or directly trigger the reagent activation. The grain enables the timed-message method but could be replaced with a digital timer without breaking story logic. Closure participation is indirect (mentioned as journey complete when her tenure ends).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "dawning hush" shapes Elena's central tactic: she must outlast the lunar night specifically to capture the moment when "sunlight first touched the central peak" to "reveal the crater's true colors." This vacuum-sealed quiet makes "her heart seem thunderous" and transforms the crater into "a cathedral of gold and obsidian," enabling the photograph. Present in setup (foreshadowed as the goal), middle (awaited during the vigil), and ending (arrives and enables the shutter, then "remained eternal" in the camera). The concept constrains timing and defines success, though it operates more as atmospheric condition than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" appears twice as a label (paragraphs three and five) describing Elena's approach to the fusion-glass veins and shadow shifts, but the trait is better dramatized through actions: kneeling to inspect formations the archives dismissed, mixing reagents to encode data, refusing shelter to witness the terminator crossing. These choices show the attribute in action with visible cost (hypothermic cold, exhaustion, melancholy certainty of futility). Present throughout but more enacted than explicitly constrained; removing the label would not change the story since her investigative persistence drives all beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Outlast" defines the story's central ordeal and shapes multiple tactical decisions: wrapping heating coils, refusing retreat to shelter, remaining conscious through "hypothermic plunge," and timing all actions to endure until "the dawning hush." The action appears in setup (goal stated), development (vigil through minus-170° cold with embodied cost), and closure ("had outlasted the darkness, had stolen the final pure image"). Removing this verb would require fundamental restructure—the entire middle section depends on endurance as the enabling condition for the photograph. The final line's "outlast" callback charges the closure by linking physical survival to archival purpose.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Chemical reactions appear in setup (paragraph three: mixing potassium ferricyanide with regolith to create photosensitive paste, encoding stratigraphic data in molecular layers that oxidize at different UV rates), development (the mental timer synchronized to reagent activation during the vigil), and payoff (watching "the chemical message on the titanium plaque begin its slow bloom" as dawn arrives). The method is specific, signaled early, and its mechanics matter: the three-century delay and UV-triggered oxidation directly serve her preservation goal. The timed aspect constrains her vigil—she must wait for the reagents to activate. Slightly diminished by abstraction: we see the bloom but not how the timing precisely shaped her tactical window.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The moonlit summit supplies resources (regolith for the chemical paste), imposes constraints (extreme cold forcing the endurance test, terminator-line timing dictating when she can photograph), and determines spatial relationships (ninety-kilometer climb to "central peak," crater bowl below, Earth on horizon, crawlers stirring at base). The setting is handled tactilely: boots crunching, kneeling beside spectrograph, mounting camera, checking aperture. The summit's exposure to the terminator crossing is irreplaceable—lower elevations would miss the "razor-thin crescent" effect. Present in all three gates and pressures multiple choices; minor limitation: the regolith's chemical properties are asserted rather than discovered through trial.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Space age" frames the corporate extraction context (colony, drills, crawlers) and the obsolescence of Earth relics (Greenwich Observatory hourglass grain from "the age when humans watched stars instead of mining them"). The timeframe enables the central conflict—industrial lunar mining versus archival preservation—and the technology Elena uses (spectrograph, chemical encoding, camera). Present in setup and ending; less active in middle development where the immediate twelve-hour deadline and dawn timing drive pressure more than the broader era. Swappable with "near-future colonial period" without major structural loss, though the "space age" nostalgia tonally supports the melancholy.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The desire to "photograph the last of something precious" drives every beat: the ninety-kilometer climb, the chemical encoding, the hypothermic vigil, the shutter trigger, and the melancholic descent. Friction between want and cost is visceral—she succeeds in capturing the image but realizes "her curiosity had only served to archive extinction," a "love letter written in oxidation for a world that no longer looked up." The motivation is dramatized through embodied choices (refusing shelter, wrapping heating coils) and charged at closure when she carries "both the photograph and the melancholy certainty." Present in setup (stated goal), development (tested by cold and futility), and payoff (achieved but repriced).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Melancholy saturates the piece from "blinding lunar glare" through "profound stillness" to the final "melancholy certainty," cohering through elegiac diction ("the last pristine impact structure," "what had been lost," "love letter... for a world that no longer looked up"). The tone modulates appropriately: technical precision during the climb and chemical prep, lyric intensity at the dawn transformation ("cathedral of gold and obsidian"), resignation at closure. "Dawnlit" is embodied in the central image—the "razor-thin crescent of sunlight" that both enables the photograph and marks the end. The tone charges the final image by framing preservation as beautiful futility. Minor flatness: "mechanical predators waking from slumber" slightly over-explains the crawlers' menace.</comment>
