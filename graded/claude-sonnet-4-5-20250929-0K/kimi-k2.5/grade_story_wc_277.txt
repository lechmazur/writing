<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's interiority is concrete and her motivation to verify the fraud is clear, but her emotional arc feels too smooth—the decision to publish and destroy her inheritance arrives without sustained internal contradiction. The moment of "solemn playfulness" conducting "an autopsy on her own inheritance" gestures toward ambivalence but doesn't dramatize competing impulses in action. Micro-choices are present (beginning calculations, composing the correction) but lack visible cost until the very end, where the forfeiture is declared rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal lens: journalist's claim → Eleanor's proof by contradiction → decision to publish correction. Orientation anchors appear promptly (observatory, Eleanor, after the call). The closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (destroying wealth to preserve integrity), and the rosewood pen seeding and return charges the final image. However, the escalation compresses most causality into a single night of calculation with minimal on-page friction; the contradiction proof arrives quickly and Eleanor's resolve follows without meaningful obstacle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echoing observatory is vivid and purposeful—sound "bouncing between brass telescopes like accusations" physicalizes moral pressure, and the glass floor "turning into a lantern" at dawn marks closure. Sensory detail is filtered through Eleanor's focus (ink from depths, wax "color of dried blood"). The rosewood pen nib functions as micro-setting, constraining her proof and charging the final act when placed in the museum display. Spatial choreography (spiral staircase, elevator descent) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—truth versus inheritance—is signaled early and tightens once when Eleanor discovers the impossible orbit. However, the proof arrives without setback or alternative hypothesis, and her decision to publish follows immediately without competing pressures (family, employees, her own children mentioned but not dramatized as obstacles). The cost is declared ("destroying her own wealth") and felt in the final image ("stepped outside" the orbits) but never tested by a reversal that might make her hesitate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the orbit metaphor and Eleanor's choice: lies require perpetual energy, truth offers escape velocity. The final image of stepping into the elevator "with the future uncharted" answers the central question without moralizing, and "orbits of regret" accumulates pressure across paragraphs. The piece resists tidy binaries (integrity has economic cost, family legacy is moral void). One weakness: "atmospheric deception" and "body in free fall" veer toward on-the-nose abstraction rather than letting the rosewood pen and corrected charts carry full thematic weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated diction, complex syntax, metaphoric density ("orbits of regret that circled back to destroy his heirs"). POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into expository philosophy ("proving that some orbits could be escaped if one simply stopped calculating around the wrong center") that feels more thesis than character perception. The "solemn playfulness" tone modulates appropriately across the night's work, but a few phrases ("economic impossibility that somehow felt mathematically sound") lean toward authorial summary rather than Eleanor's lived idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("sound bounced between brass telescopes like accusations," "lantern" dawn), but several metaphors stack without clear propulsion: "orbits of regret" appears four times with slight variations that blur into paraphrase. Template cadence in paragraph four: "The orbits of regret were not celestial but moral... The orbits of regret continued their eternal paths" loops the concept. "Solemn playfulness" is asserted twice without embodied texture. Sentence openings vary, but information density sags in expository beats where abstraction replaces concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The celestial-fraud premise and proof-by-contradiction method offer a fresh synthesis, and Eleanor's choice to self-immolate her empire has emotional specificity. However, the "heiress destroys inheritance for integrity" arc follows a familiar template without transformation through lived obstacle or moral ambiguity—Eleanor never seriously considers protecting the lie or bargaining for partial correction. The "rosewood pen as relic" and "cloud-bound mastheads" details are particular, but the emotional through-line remains predictable once the fraud is confirmed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Eleanor's choices drive both major turns: initiating the proof and deciding to publish the correction. She is present throughout and her decisions narrow options with visible cost at closure (destroying wealth, "stepped outside" the orbits). Setup is immediate, middle development constrains her night's work, and payoff charges the final descent. The heiress role is causally necessary—only she can authorize publication and only her birthright creates the inheritance/integrity dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in three beats: opening (pressed to palm), middle (dipping into ink, gliding with grace), and closure (placed in museum display as "artifact of truth"). Its specificity (rosewood, nib vs. whole pen) distinguishes it, and the museum-display reprise reweights it from tool to relic. However, its material properties don't constrain her work—any writing instrument could perform the same function. The pen charges the ending image but doesn't enable or limit a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" is seeded early (paragraph one) and returns four times, framing the moral stake and the final escape ("stepped outside them"). It shapes Eleanor's understanding of her family's cycle and motivates her intervention. The concept deepens from celestial to moral in paragraph four and charges the closure when she becomes "a body in free fall." However, it functions primarily as thematic gloss rather than constraining on-page tactics—her proof and decision would proceed identically if the metaphor were absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is labeled in paragraph one ("by temperament and by necessity") and reprised at the end ("still devotedly observant, but now she observed her own capacity for honesty"). The trait motivates her proof methodology and is consistent with her silence and calculation. However, it never constrains a choice with visible cost—being observant always aids her goal and never forces a tradeoff. The attribute is present but doesn't generate friction or limit options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Intervene" is seeded in paragraph four ("She had to intervene before the next cycle began") and enacted in paragraph five (composing the correction) and paragraph seven ("intervened in the only way that mattered"). The decision to intervene redefines her options from passive inheritance to active rupture, and the intervention itself (publishing the correction) is the story's decisive change. The action is causally central and shapes closure. Swapping "intervene" for "act" or "stop" would require reframing the cyclical-regret premise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Proof by contradiction is named in paragraph two and executed on-page in paragraph three: Eleanor assumes the journalist's premise false, calculates the comet's trajectory, discovers the logical impossibility (comet would have crashed), and concludes the documentation was false. The method shapes her approach and the contradiction itself provides the evidence that drives her decision. However, the mechanics are compressed into one paragraph and the proof arrives without false starts or competing hypotheses that would test the method's rigor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The echoing observatory is present throughout: sound "bouncing between brass telescopes" physicalizes accusation, the glass floor becomes a lantern at dawn, and the spiral staircase and elevator anchor the descent. The setting's acoustic property ("returned [her words] threefold, as if the building itself approved") charges her resolution, and the location above the clouds isolates her decision from social pressure. The observatory constrains her work (nightlong isolation) and its sensory signature (echoing, glass, brass) recurs at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe anchor ("three hours ago" the journalist called) is established immediately and the night's duration is tracked ("worked through the night," "dawn cleared the cloud layer"). However, the elapsed time doesn't tighten tactics—Eleanor has no deadline, and the journalist's return call is anticipated but not imminent. The timeframe provides sequence but doesn't create a clock that alters her choices or escalates pressure. The "after the call" framing is causal (initiates her investigation) but not coercive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is stated in paragraph four and motivates Eleanor's proof. The desire is dramatized through her night of calculation and is consistent across the arc. However, it's never conflicted—truth-seeking aligns perfectly with her integrity, and no competing want (protect family name, preserve wealth for future use) gains traction on the page. The motivation is present and causal but lacks the friction of contradictory impulses that would charge her final choice with ambivalence or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is labeled twice: paragraph two ("solemn playfulness of a woman conducting an autopsy") and paragraph six ("solemn playfulness of her situation"). The tone is coherent in Eleanor's metaphoric density and the laugh "like silver coins dropping into velvet," and it modulates appropriately (grim smile at the contradiction, quiet proof at closure). However, the tone is more asserted than embodied—her diction and rhythm remain uniformly elevated rather than oscillating between gravity and levity in a way that charges pivotal beats.</comment>
