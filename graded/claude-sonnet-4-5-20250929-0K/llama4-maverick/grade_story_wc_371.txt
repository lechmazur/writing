<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" remains a label without interiority; we never see her notice change in scene—she observes tranquility and sips tea across multiple visits with no contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The gardener appears as an ideal archetype ("heuristically gentle," "quiet reverence") without flaws or friction. The protagonist's "tenuous absolution" is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses a path; the final gratitude reads as summary rather than earned shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (repeated visits, seasonal framing, tonal layering), but no meaningful deepening or cadence shift occurs—each visit mirrors the last without narrowing options or reweighting stakes. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (courtyard, tea house, noticer's routine). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the final-visit frame and smile, yet no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page; the noticer "would return again," undercutting finality. The bread's mystery (vanished bakery) seeds a question but is never paid off causally.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Vivid setting (woven vines, weathered wood, crumbling stones, blooming flowers) grounds the reader early and consistently. The tea house itself functions as micro-setting that anchors recurring action (sipping tea, tending plants), but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—visits are frictionless. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail leans visual with scent accents (jasmine, blooming flowers) but remains static across visits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("to find the sacred in the ordinary") is declared in reflection but never tested by a live choice or reversal. No on-page tightening or deepening occurs; the noticer returns "again and again" with identical emotional valence and no escalation. The gardener's arrival does not complicate or force a decision; they work "in tandem" without conflict. Agency is absent—bread appears on the doorstep, the tea house exists, absolution "washes over" passively—leaving the protagonist as recipient rather than decider.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("the sacred in the ordinary") is stated outright in reflection ("she too was searching for a way to connect with the world, to find the sacred in the ordinary") rather than emerging from image and choice. The bread-as-key metaphor is told in the penultimate paragraph ("a key to unlocking a deeper understanding") instead of enacted. The final smile and return promise feel tidy rather than resonant; no non-literal answer to the central question charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains generic literary ("tenuous absolution," "quiet reverence," "newfound appreciation") without a character-specific perceptual signature—the noticer's way of noticing is never shown in idiosyncratic detail. No dialogue appears. Register is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; every visit reads at the same emotional temperature.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate; grammar clean. Paraphrase loops recur: "secret tea house" appears six times, "tenuous absolution" twice in adjacent paragraphs, "again and again" echoes "return again." Sentence stems repeat ("She was," "The noticer," "As she") across most paragraphs. Figurative language is sparse but stock ("wisps of summer fog," "beacon of hope"). Information density is low—multiple sentences restate the noticer's gratitude and sense of peace without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Premise (secret garden refuge grants absolution) is familiar; no fresh angle transforms it. The vanished bakery mystery seeds intrigue but is abandoned without payoff. The "creeping normality noticer" label promises a specific observational mode but never manifests in action. Emotional arc follows a safe, upward trajectory (discovery → repeated visits → gratitude) with no risk or complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character label present throughout; appears in opening and closing beats. Observation is described but never enacted in scene—no noticing of change drives a choice. No cost tied to this role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Bread appears in three beats (discovery, tea pairing, penultimate reflection) and is explicitly reweighted as "a key" in the ending zone. However, it is never handled or consumed in dramatized action—only mentioned in summary—and the vanished-bakery mystery is unresolved, weakening causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Concept labeled twice ("tenuous absolution wash over her," "sense of tenuous absolution that it brought") but never operationalized in choice. Present in final paragraph as thematic echo. No on-page cost or constraint tied to seeking absolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Attribute applied to the gardener in one paragraph ("heuristically gentle approach to gardening"). Label-only; no on-page action shows gentleness enabling or constraining a choice. No visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Action appears once: "uncloak hidden corners of the city, revealing secret gardens." Described in summary rather than dramatized. No major turn traces to uncloaking; easily replaceable with "tended" or "cultivated."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Method labeled ("guerrilla gardener") and mentioned in one paragraph. Described as an approach but never shown shaping an attempt or constraining tactics. No mechanics detailed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setting anchors the opening and recurs across all visits; named in final sentence. Functions as backdrop for action (sitting, tending plants) and charges the final image ("drawn by the allure of the secret tea house"). However, it supplies no resource or obstacle that alters tactics—visits are identical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Timeframe mentioned once in penultimate paragraph ("as the days shortened and the birds flew south") and implied in "final visit of the season." No tightening of decisions; time remains vague and untracked throughout visits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly in reflection ("searching for a way to connect with the world, to find the sacred in the ordinary"). Present across beats as thematic driver and in final gratitude. However, desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; no friction between want and cost appears on the page.</comment>
