<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Eli's interiority is present but largely label-driven ("diligently curious nature kicked in," "absorbed expression"). The apprentice observes and notes patterns but makes no difficult choice with visible cost; the crew's return offers no interpersonal pressure. Emotional states are declared rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final decision to withhold the discovery reads unmotivated—no trade-off is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: the reader learns "antique airship" and Eli's role within the first paragraph, but spatial anchors (cabin layout, table position) remain vague. The luminance discovery triggers curiosity but no narrowing of options; Eli simply charts it. The ending gesture ("ready to set course") projects future action rather than landing an on-page change with cost. Under a loose Accumulative lens, the piece offers recurrence (starlings, luminance glow) but no decisive tightening or felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The airship cabin, navigation table, dusty hopscotch board, and recurring starlings provide atmospheric anchors. The hopscotch board constrains Eli's code-breaking in one beat, lifting the score. However, spatial choreography remains soft (where is the phrasebook relative to the table? how does the luminance "dance"?), and the logbook's sudden appearance mid-scene feels ungrounded. Sensory detail skews visual; no scent, temperature, or tactile weight appears under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—chart the luminance to discover its secret—is signaled early but never tightens. Eli faces no obstacle, resource limit, or competing demand; the crew's return could interrupt but does not. The luminance glows brighter in apparent response to Eli's work, suggesting external validation rather than protagonist-driven escalation. No on-page cost or trade-off alters tactics. The final sentence postpones action ("ready to set course") rather than executing a choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>A theme of solitary discovery and "sociable isolation" emerges through recurrence of the airship as microcosm and Eli's deferred sharing. The luminance and hopscotch code offer symbolic texture but remain ornamental—neither constrains choice nor charges the ending with conceptual cost. The closing image (starlings watching, luminance dancing) gestures toward wonder but delivers no non-literal answer or thematic repricing. Prompt language ("sociable isolation") appears directly on the page, reducing emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is mild: Eli notices charts and luminance but the diction stays generic ("faint, shimmering light," "warm glow"). Narrative distance holds steady but lacks embodied signature—syntax does not shift under excitement. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("began to note," "felt a sense") stack in several lines, dulling immediacy. The voice reads competent but not character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Clarity is adequate; no pronoun confusion or tense breaks. However, paraphrase loops appear: "chart the luminance's movements, creating a new map" near-duplicates "note its movements, searching for a pattern." Template cadence runs through several beats ("Eli began to note," "Eli set to work," "Eli pored over"). Stock metaphors (starlings "murmuring," light "dancing") recur without fresh inflection. Information density is low in the middle third—multiple sentences restate Eli's excitement without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The airship-and-mystery premise is familiar (treasure map, cryptic code, lone scholar); no element transforms the template. The luminance and hopscotch board offer quirky detail but function as interchangeable puzzle pieces rather than inevitable choices rooted in character or world logic. The ending defers discovery, avoiding risk. Swapping the luminance for any other mysterious object would leave the emotional arc unchanged. No bold structural or tonal choice elevates the familiar frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Eli observes, decodes, and charts but makes no on-page choice that narrows options or incurs cost. Present throughout but functionally passive; the apprentice role frames setting rather than driving turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in one early beat (page-turn releases the luminance) and is mentioned again in backstory reflection but never returns with reweighted meaning. The dog-ear detail is ornamental. Swappable with any container object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The luminance is discovered, observed, charted, and glows brighter—present across beats but never constrains a choice or imposes cost. It enables Eli's curiosity but does not force a trade-off. Shapes one turn (discovery) but remains thematically inert at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is declared once ("Eli's diligently curious nature kicked in") but functions as a label rather than a visible constraint. No moment shows curiosity costing Eli time, safety, or social capital. Trait mentioned, not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Note" appears twice with distinct functions: noting luminance movements and noting findings in the logbook. Both beats advance plot, but the action is replaceable (observe, record, study would fit). Does not uniquely define the turning points or closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The hopscotch board is signaled early, used in one substantive beat (pattern-decoding that reveals the cryptic message), and briefly echoed in the ending paragraph. Its scuff marks and alignment with the star chart supply specificity. Shapes one key turn and contributes texture to closure, meeting two gates with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The airship frames every beat, supplies the navigation table and logbook as tools, and isolates Eli from external interruption. The cabin's physical features (hopscotch board, wall chart) enable the code-breaking turn. However, no airship property constrains Eli's choices or imposes cost. Present throughout and essential to atmosphere, but postcard-level rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Starlings appear in the opening, middle, and closing sentences as atmospheric texture but exert no temporal pressure. "Hours" pass off-page; the sun sets and rises with no urgency. Time is backdrop, not a tightening constraint on Eli's work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The desire to chart discovery is stated early and recurs in the final line but never conflicts with a competing want or cost. Eli's choice to withhold findings from the crew hints at friction but is not dramatized as a trade-off. Told more than shown under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is directly named on the page, reducing organic emergence. The tone is consistent (quiet wonder, solitary focus, crew camaraderie at a distance) but does not modulate with escalation or charge the final image with new emotional weight. Present, coherent, but static.</comment>
