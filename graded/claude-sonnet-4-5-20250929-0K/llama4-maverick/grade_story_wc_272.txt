<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The artist remains abstract throughout, defined by label-only interiority ("crestfallen," "luminescent ache") rather than embodied contradiction. No micro-choices under pressure test her motives; the untangling of threads is described but never constrained by competing impulses or visible cost. The final "descent into necessary darkness" is asserted, not earned through dramatized struggle. Therapy-speak ("necessary darkness," "redesign her perception") replaces character-particular thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No legible closure unit lands on the page. The piece describes a process ("threads untangled," "weight...begin to lift") but no decisive change, renunciation with cost, or crystallized stance occurs in a final beat. The orientation test fails: who she is (name, age, history), where precisely (room layout, lighthouse function), and when (season, time of day, duration) remain vague past 120 words. Causal lens is attempted but causality between untangling and transformation is asserted rather than dramatized with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse library is painted in broad strokes ("dusty tomes," "worn leather," "flickering light") without spatial choreography or micro-setting that constrains action. No tool, body state, or environmental detail shapes a choice. The setting remains postcard description—evocative but inert—never pressuring tactics or charging the final image. Orientation penalty already applied in Q2; descriptive vividness cannot lift the score when setting does not participate in pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("What was the purpose of art?") is declared but never tested on the page through a choice with competing costs. The untangling action is summary-only; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option. The resolution ("redesign...complete," "darkness was not an end, but a beginning") is told, not earned through protagonist agency. Coincidence does not complicate because no complication occurs—the process is frictionless summary.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "luminescent ache," "necessary darkness," "fragmented reality" recur as labels without fresh inflection from particulars. The final paragraphs summarize the theme ("power of art to transform") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. Rhetorical questions ("What was the purpose of art?") function as thematic echo rather than scene pressure. The broken tarot box is decorative; its "secrets revealed" claim lacks on-page proof.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Voice drifts into elevated register ("luminescent ache," "otherworldly essence," "hallowed halls") that clashes with the immediate frame of a struggling artist. Template cadence dominates: runs of "The artist's..." and "As she..." openers across multiple paragraphs. No perceptual signature distinguishes her way of noticing. Free indirect style is attempted but distances into abstract narration ("she felt," "she knew") without embodied rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "fractured and disjointed" / "shattered and useless," "labyrinth, a maze," "whispers of ancient tomes" appears three times. Template cadence: "The artist's..." opens five sentences in close succession. Stock metaphors ("threads of reality," "river," "beacon") and therapy-speak ("luminescent ache," "necessary darkness") cluster in peak beats without fresh vehicle. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt," "knew") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure zone (final third), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (struggling artist finds solace in symbolic task) is template; the lighthouse-library setting and tarot box are decorative rather than transformed through specific lived detail. The untangling metaphor is on-the-nose and widely used. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges into abstract poeticism instead of committing to a concrete, irreversible choice. Transformation test fails: swap "portrait artist" and "tarot box" for generic equivalents and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The crestfallen portrait artist is named and present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She observes, untangles (summary-only), and "stands...ready" without a causal choice. Missing middle development and closure participation; present only as static label.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The broken tarot card box appears early (setup gate met) and returns multiple times ("stared at," "untangle the threads," "lay still" at end). However, its use is ornamental: it is described and untangled in summary without on-page mechanics or consequence. Swappable with any symbolic broken object. Mid-band: present across beats but causal pressure and cost are absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Fragmented reality is asserted as theme ("fragments of reality were not disparate, but intertwined") but does not shape stakes or constrain on-page action. Label-only; the artist's tactics do not change based on this concept. Missing development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear twice ("What was the purpose of art?" "What lay beyond the fragments?") but function as thematic echo, not as a constraint or enabler of action. They do not alter a choice or impose cost. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Redesign is mentioned ("redesign her understanding," "redesign...complete") but the action is summary-only and abstract. The term appears late (second half) and does not drive a turn; it labels the outcome rather than shaping attempts. Missing causal involvement; swappable with "reframe" or "reconsider."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Untangling threads is described across multiple beats ("methodically untangle," "threads carefully unraveled") and frames the process. However, the mechanics are summary-only; no on-page snag, choice, or cost emerges from the method. Functional but replaceable with any meditative task. Mid-low band: present but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a lighthouse is seeded early (setup gate met) and recurs as backdrop. It provides atmosphere ("dusty tomes," "beam through the dusty air") but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Postcard description without micro-setting constraint. Functional presence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" appears twice as a vague metaphor for pressure but no clock, deadline, or tracked urgency alters tactics. Time remains abstract; no tightening decision follows from temporal constraint. Ornamental phrase only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to descend into necessary darkness" is stated multiple times but never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible cost. It is told as theme rather than tested as a want that competes with another desire. Missing friction; label-only motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Luminescent ache recurs as a phrase ("luminescent ache of creativity," "luminescent ache continued to glow") and attempts to unify tone. However, it remains a static label rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image through embodied perception. Functional as motif but does not deepen under stress. Mid-low band: present but not transformative.</comment>
