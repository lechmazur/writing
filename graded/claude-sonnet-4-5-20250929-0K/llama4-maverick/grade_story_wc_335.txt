<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The archivist is characterized primarily through decorative attributes (brown eyes "holding sorrow," the backwards-walking habit) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority relies on abstract labels—"combative tenderness," "fierce protectiveness"—without embodied perception or micro-choices under pressure. The final "quiet triumph" and smile feel asserted rather than earned through prior causality; no visible cost forecloses a path. The walking-backwards trait is mentioned twice but never constrains an on-page action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who (archivist), where (library), and when (afternoon) are anchored by ~80 words, passing the test. However, no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing occurs on the page with visible cost. The archivist "unlocks secrets" and takes "the first step towards reversing the exile," but this remains summary-only assertion; the shadow's state does not change, no option is foreclosed, and the final image (empty cup, lingering gaze) carries no legible price. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (annotations deepen via tea-leaf patterns), but closure does not land because no before/after reweighting or cadence shift occurs that makes cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The library is anchored through dust motes, creaking shelves, old books, and the playground swing outside. The empty cup and tea leaves are handled across beats and constrain the annotation method, giving the setting functional pressure. However, the environment does not alter a choice or charge the final image decisively; the archivist's actions would proceed identically in any archive. Sensory hierarchy and spatial choreography remain clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reversing the exile by annotating the shadow—is signaled early. However, escalation is summary-driven: "annotations grew more fervent," "uncovered a hidden pattern," "unlocked the secrets." No on-page reversal, tightening choice, or visible tradeoff narrows options or changes knowledge through protagonist agency. The tension in the archivist's shoulders "eased" without cost, and the resolution ("done their work well") asserts success without dramatizing a price or consequence that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges around exile, longing, and resilience through the shadow metaphor and tea-leaf geometry. Yet the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "the very fabric of reality was a little more resilient, a little more whole" reads as a stated thesis rather than a resonant image. The playground swing recurs but does not reweight prior material or constrain choice; it remains atmospheric decoration. The "mentor resilience quietly" motivation is told rather than dramatized through specific conflict or earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on the archivist. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on geometry, tea leaves, and shadows, and diction stays within the archivist's implied lexicon. However, voice lacks rhythmic control under pressure: abstract intensifiers ("fierce, gentle light," "combative tenderness") replace concrete perception at peak beats. Elision of the annotation process itself (the core action) is not paid off on the page; we are told discoveries occur without witnessing the method.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn weaken momentum: "unravel its secrets and understand the geometry" / "unlock the shadow's mysteries"; "lost in thought" / "the hush wrapped around them like a shroud" restates the same atmospheric stasis. Template cadence appears in repeated "As…" and "The archivist's…" sentence stems across multiple paragraphs. Figurative language clusters without earned payoff—"combative tenderness," "topography of the soul," "fabric of reality"—elevating diction in a way that dulls rather than sharpens the beats. Stock metaphors (dust motes dancing, eyes holding sorrow) reduce specificity. These artifacts appear throughout, including near the ending, triggering −1.4 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—annotating a shadow via tea-leaf geometry to reverse an exile—offers a non-obvious synthesis of archival work and divination. However, the execution relies on generic mysterious-librarian and soul-in-object tropes without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The archivist's methods, the shadow's properties, and the exile mechanics remain abstract; specificity (brown eyes, oily tea, yellowed manuscript) does not alter tactics or stakes. The final image (empty cup, lingering gaze) feels familiar rather than fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The archivist is present throughout and performs the central action (annotation). However, no on-page choice alters tactics or creates a turn; the character observes, studies, and concludes without friction or cost. The backwards-walking trait and "combative tenderness" are mentioned but do not constrain decisions. Swappable with "determined scholar" or "careful researcher" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The shadow caught in glass is signaled early, handled across multiple beats (studied, annotated), and appears in the final paragraph ("unlocked the secrets"). However, it does not evolve or return with reweighted meaning; its state remains static, and the archivist's success is asserted rather than shown through a visible change in the object. The shadow shapes the stake but does not constrain a choice or charge the ending image with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Reversible exile frames the premise and appears in exposition ("a person who had been cast out but could potentially return") and summary ("taken the first step towards reversing the exile"). However, it does not shape on-page tactics or choices; the reversal mechanism is never dramatized, and no option narrows or changes because of this concept. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The backwards-walking habit is mentioned twice: as a trait that "sometimes manifested in their sleep" and later when it "slowly subsided as tension eased." Neither mention constrains or enables an on-page action; it remains label-only characterization. Easily removable without affecting the story's logic or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Annotation is the archivist's task and frames the story's action across multiple beats (analyzing leaves, scribbling notes, uncovering patterns). It drives the middle and ending. However, the method is summarized rather than shown; we are told discoveries occur without witnessing the annotation process itself. The action is essential to the premise but executed in a way that keeps the reader at a distance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is signaled early (cup beside glass, archivist's eyes darting between them) and mentioned in the middle ("analyzing the geometry of tea leaves"). However, the mechanics never matter on the page; we do not see how the leaves constrain attempts or shape the annotation process. The method is present but ornamental, functioning as atmosphere rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The forgotten library is anchored early and sustained through sensory detail (dust, creaking shelves, old books, faint tang of tea). The setting provides the cup, manuscript, and glass, which are handled across beats. However, the library does not pressure choices or alter tactics; the archivist's work could occur in any quiet archive. The playground swing recurs but does not constrain action or charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" appears as atmospheric description (swing mentioned three times: opening, middle, near end). However, time remains vague and untracked; no clock tightens decisions, and the "hush" functions as static mood rather than temporal pressure. The swing's drift does not alter the archivist's pacing or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to mentor resilience quietly" is stated in exposition ("guide the exiled soul back towards the light") and the ending summary ("done their work well"). However, it is never dramatized through a conflicted choice or visible cost; the archivist proceeds smoothly without friction between this desire and competing pressures. The motivation is told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is declared in exposition and echoed in phrases like "fierce protectiveness," "fierce, gentle light," and "small, fierce smile." However, the tone remains asserted through abstract modifiers rather than modulating with pressure or charging the final image through syntax and action. The ending ("quiet triumph," "hush wrapped like a shroud") shifts to contemplative stasis without tension, and the declared tone does not coherently intensify across turns.</comment>
