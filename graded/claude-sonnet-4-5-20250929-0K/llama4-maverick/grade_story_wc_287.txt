<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The gardener remains a cipher throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses under pressure, only abstract descriptors ("wistfully pragmatic"). The lockmaster backstory is told rather than dramatized through present micro-choices. The final act (pruning, descending) is unmotivated by any interior conflict or cost; the character operates as a vessel for thematic concepts rather than a person forced to choose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure with cost. The gardener begins tending flowers and ends having tended flowers; no decision alters options, no stance crystallizes with visible price. The piece claims transformation ("instilled a new sense of life") without dramatizing what changed or what was risked. Orientation is provided early (harbor, fire escape, night), so no penalty there, but the accumulative lens never tightens into a closure beat—merely dissolves into summary assertion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The harbor and fire escape are named but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Sensory detail (moonlight, oars) is vivid yet ornamental, filtered through no POV bias. The lockmaster's tooth appears as a pocket token without spatial or tactical consequence. Micro-setting credit withheld; nothing in the environment shapes the gardener's final act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("bring light into darkness") is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, no tightening choice, no cost that narrows options. The rosebush's pruning is complete by paragraph two; the rest is atmosphere and summary. Coincidence (the boat's rhythm) provides mood, not complication. No escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emergent: "reflect light into dark corners," "weaving a spell of protected vulnerability." The lockmaster's tooth is introduced as symbolic souvenir without dramatic friction. The final paragraph announces theme ("the power of their work") instead of allowing image or choice to charge meaning. Subtext is absent; all resonance is declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable (single, third-limited) but the perceptual signature is generic: "wistfully pragmatic," "quiet reverence," "sense of peace" are labels, not idiosyncratic perception. Diction is elevated and uniform throughout, never modulating under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The voice reads like consensus literary narration, not a singular mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "bring light into the darkness" / "reflect light into dark corners" / "reflection of the light they had brought into the darkness." Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs ("As they worked… As the night wore on… As the sun rose"). Stock metaphors ("weaving a spell," "wrapped in a soft blanket") and therapy-speak ("protected vulnerability") in peak beats. Deduction: −1.4 for patterned artifacts touching closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise (urban gardener as spiritual guardian) is familiar; execution relies on stock imagery (rosebush cycle, lone boat, moonlit harbor) without fresh synthesis. The lockmaster backstory is mentioned but never transformed into present choice. Emotional arc could transfer unchanged to any caretaker figure in any liminal space. No risk-taking; the piece hedges into abstraction rather than committing to a specific, irreplaceable moment.</comment>
