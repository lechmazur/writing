<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria is given label-only traits ("quietly proactive," "watchful dreamer") that never constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Her interiority consists of therapy-speak abstractions ("graft new meaning onto old wounds," "protected vulnerability") rather than embodied contradictory impulses acting in scene. The figure's appearance and flower gesture lack any dramatized tension or resistance; Aria's acceptance is frictionless. No internal conflict is shown—just a summary arc from pain to healing without credible struggle or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Aria is, what "the confession" entails, and why she's here remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The piece offers no escalation or meaningful tightening—Aria walks, kneels, receives a flower, and leaves feeling healed. No options narrow, no knowledge changes, and no cost appears on the page. The "closure" is an asserted emotional shift ("a sense of healing") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing grounded in prior causality. The inferred lens is accumulative/textural, but no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The moss garden setting is described with some textural detail (vines, moss, rusting servers) and supplies the icicle pattern as a micro-setting moment. However, the environment does not constrain choice or charge the closure—it remains backdrop. The icicle pattern is ornamental: Aria kneels to admire it, but it does not alter tactics or options. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting functions as postcard description rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") is declared but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs—the figure's arrival and flower gesture do not narrow options or force a trade-off. Aria's acceptance is passive and cost-free. The "healing" is summarized rather than earned through agency, renunciation, or endurance with visible sacrifice. Pressure remains static throughout; no escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The amber pendant and icicle pattern are mentioned as symbolic tokens but never constrain choice or accumulate pressure. The theme of healing is stated rather than earned from particulars: "protected vulnerability," "quietly proactive," and "honeyed hush" function as prompt labels echoed in the final paragraph without resonance. The ending moralizes directly ("she was ready to face whatever came next") instead of offering a non-literal answer through image or action. No thematic question is posed or reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-person limited. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated, abstract register ("honeyed hush," "grafted into a new narrative of hope and resilience") inconsistent with embodied perception under pressure. The figure's arrival lacks interiority or subtext—his "deep concern" is told, not shown. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Aria felt a sense of…," "Aria knew…," "The world outside might be chaotic, but…" The final two paragraphs restate the healing arc three times with synonym churn ("peace," "hope," "resilience," "strength," "beacon"). Stock metaphors ("raw edges," "beacon of hope") and therapy-speak labels ("protected vulnerability") appear in peak beats without embodiment. Information density is low; scaffolding sentences do not advance story or character. Artifacts touch the closure, triggering elevated Q7 penalties and the global 9+ disqualifier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—healing in a reclaimed-nature sanctuary after a viral confession—is a familiar template without fresh inflection. The moss garden, amber pendant, and icicle pattern are ornamental rather than transformed through specific choice or world logic. Emotional beats follow a predictable arc from wound to sanctuary to unnamed companion to restoration. No turn, intensification, or final image grows inevitably from prior particulars; the ending could be transplanted to any "finding peace" narrative without alteration.</comment>
