<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kaito's motivation is declared rather than tested through contradictory impulses. The protagonist walks, picks up compass, makes lace, releases it—each move feels like illustrative demonstration without internal friction or cost. The "cerulean regret" label appears repeatedly but never manifests as embodied emotion or a choice that forecloses another path. Students appear late as audience rather than pressure, flattening any earned stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the story accrues symbolic objects and reflective motifs. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly. However, closure relies on ritual release without dramatized cost—Kaito wraps and tosses the compass, then returns "clearer" via assertion. No on-page reversal or deepening narrows options; the ending recounts emotional shift rather than enacting it. The felt cost required for RR is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The islet setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (wet earth, salt, seaweed) and the post-rain atmosphere is sustained. The compass and lace function as micro-setting elements that participate in the ritual closure. Spatial choreography remains clear. However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it provides backdrop rather than pressure, capping the score below high bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"finding the color of unspoken apologies"—remains abstract and is never tested by a live choice with visible cost. The lace-making sequence unfolds without obstacle or trade-off; the compass release happens without consequence. No reversal or tightening narrows options. The protagonist moves through a predetermined ritual rather than escalating under pressure, leaving escalation inert.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring motif of tides and the cerulean hue, and the lace pattern attempts to literalize emotional work. Yet the final image—releasing the compass—delivers a stated peace rather than a resonant reconfiguration; the ending explains rather than enacts. The story avoids overt moralizing but substitutes thematic echo ("tides of remembrance," "color of unspoken apologies") for earned insight from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable with a consistent perceptual filter tied to Kaito's slow, deliberate temperament. Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate. However, interiority drifts toward abstract summary ("felt the weight of regret," "sense of peace settle") rather than embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but never modulates to heighten a turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean. Sentence variety is present and rhythm supports the placid tone. However, paraphrase loops appear: "felt the weight of regret" / "cerulean regret still lingered"; "rhythmically placid atmosphere" recurs unchanged. Template cadence in the students-epilogue section ("As Kaito's students grew and learned, they carried…") stalls momentum. The compass-release beat uses summary ("felt the weight…slowly lift") instead of concrete image, dulling closure. Apply −0.8 for loops and template runs touching the ending third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lace-weaving ritual and ghost-ship compass offer surface novelty, but the emotional arc—solitary figure processes grief via symbolic object and returns healed—follows a familiar template. The ending's declared peace lacks surprise or fresh inflection; the tides-of-remembrance concept remains ornamental metaphor rather than a transformed premise. Swapping names and setting would leave the arc unchanged, signaling insufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kaito is present throughout and initiates the lace ritual, but his choices feel illustrative rather than pressured. The tutor role and slow speech are mentioned but do not constrain action or shape a turn. He observes, decides, and completes without friction—present but replaceable with a generic seeker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The compass appears in three beats: discovery, held during lace-making, and release. Setup is early; middle involvement anchors the ritual; closure participation is direct. However, its "needle frozen in time" detail is noted once and never revisited; the compass functions as inert talisman rather than a constraint or enabler. Causal pressure is minimal—swapping it for another relic would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Tides of remembrance" is invoked as metaphor in grandmother's stories and the final paragraph, but it never shapes a tactic or narrows an option. The concept remains thematic dressing rather than a rule or pressure that alters Kaito's choices on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" describes the atmosphere in three passages but does not constrain or enable a single action with cost. It is a tone label without mechanical consequence—mentioned, not dramatized as a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears as intention ("to diffuse his sorrow") and a closing verb ("continued to diffuse his sorrow"). Setup is present; closure mentions it. However, the action itself is abstract—no on-page sequence shows diffusion mechanics or cost. Swappable with "process" or "release" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The lace-weaving method is signaled early ("follow the method his grandmother had taught"), executed in a dedicated beat with concrete detail (threading needle, murmuring instructions), and the finished pattern reveals the sought color. Setup, development, and closure participation are present. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than tested—no error, obstacle, or trade-off emerges. Causal pressure is low; the method succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The islet is anchored early with sensory detail (breeze, wet earth, waves) and brackets the story (opening and return mention). Setup and closure framing are present. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop. One beat involvement (walking the shore) without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the severance" frames backstory and motivates the quest, appearing in the opening third. Closure mentions "days passed" and students later carry lessons forward, but no live clock or timeframe pressure shapes a tactic. The element provides context without tightening decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The desire to "find the color of unspoken apologies" is stated early, drives the lace ritual, and is answered ("deep blue hue") before the release. Setup, development, and closure are present. However, the motivation is asserted rather than conflicted in choices—no friction between wants and costs dramatized. Told more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" is named repeatedly across the arc, modulates slightly (from "weighing" to "still present, but…no longer overwhelming"), and colors the final image. Tone is coherent and participates in closure. However, it remains a label applied to beats rather than an embodied current that charges the ending through rhythm or image. Present across beats with modest reprise at closure.</comment>
