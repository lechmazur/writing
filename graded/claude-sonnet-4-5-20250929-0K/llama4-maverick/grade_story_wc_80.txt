<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The surveyor's motivation ("become the archeologist of abandoned dreams") is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interior life relies heavily on abstract philosophical framing ("interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The character observes and documents but makes no on-page decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. "Stoically sensitive" appears as a label in the opening line but never constrains action or creates a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page. The surveyor finishes work, departs, and leaves the inkwell behind—a circular return to stasis without visible cost or altered options. The piece presents a single documentarian task (survey the pavilion) that proceeds without reversal, tightening, or on-page friction. Orientation is adequate (who/where/when anchored early), but the absence of closure with felt cost prevents higher scoring under any inferred lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (silt, aquatic life, stonework) and the drawbridge signals temporal transition. However, the environment functions primarily as scenic backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging the final image. The inkwell is handled once (retrieved) but does not alter tactics or shape the ending beyond symbolic presence. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting the pavilion—faces no opposition, reversal, or escalation. The surveyor's task proceeds smoothly from start to finish without a decision that narrows options or a price that alters tactics. The drawbridge rising signals day's end but creates no pressure on the protagonist's choices. Agency is observational; the inkwell retrieval and note-placing happen without dramatized cost or consequence that reweights the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of absence and preservation emerges through repeated abstract language ("interlaced absence," "stories untold," "testament to the past") rather than from concrete, on-page choices. The final image (inkwell left behind, "empty, yet full of stories") gestures toward resonance but lacks the on-page cost or reweighting needed to earn it. The piece tells its thematic concerns rather than letting them arise from pressure and particulars. No earned insight emerges from struggle; the surveyor's reflection feels externally imposed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable with clean focalization and no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("stoically sensitive," "wrest the stories from the silence") that reads voice-motivated rather than arbitrary. However, perceptual signature is generic—the surveyor notices in catalogue fashion without character-specific bias. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") that weakens immediacy at key moments. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "The surveyor's task was not merely to survey, but to wrest..." / "The surveyor's task was not just to document the past, but to preserve it..." Multiple paragraphs restate the same thematic claim without added pressure. Figurative language ("hushed blaze," "interlaced absence") appears frequently but remains abstract rather than embodied. Clarity is maintained but information density is low; many sentences do only one job (thematic assertion) without advancing situation or character knowledge. Scaffold sentences like "As the surveyor worked..." and "The surveyor's thoughts turned to..." slow momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—surveyor documenting submerged ruins—is functional but familiar. Abstract phrasing ("archeologist of abandoned dreams," "interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") reads as prompt-templated rather than discovered through lived detail. The method (placing notes in foundation repairs) is mentioned but not dramatized or transformed. No bold structural risk; the piece proceeds in straightforward chronological order without a turn that redefines the material. Emotional specificity is lacking; the surveyor's reverence and passion are told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The surveyor is present throughout and performs actions (wades, documents, retrieves inkwell) but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or creates a turn. Observation and completion of a predetermined task dominate; no choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The inkwell appears in two beats (discovery mid-story, left behind at end) and is physically handled once (retrieval). It carries thematic weight ("stories untold") but does not constrain choice or enable a tactic under pressure. The final reprise reweights symbolically but without causal force or dramatized cost tied to the object itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Interlaced absence" is named once mid-story as a feeling but never shapes stakes, alters options, or appears in the closure image. It functions as thematic decoration rather than a concept that pressures on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Stoically sensitive" is a label in the opening and closing lines but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible tradeoff. No beat demonstrates how stoicism and sensitivity create friction or alter a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears once in metaphorical phrasing ("wrest the stories from the silence") and again as "wrestled a piece of the past into the present" near the end. The action is told rather than dramatized; no on-page struggle or turn hinges on this verb. Easily swappable with "retrieve" or "preserve."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Placing notes in foundation repairs is mentioned once in exposition ("These notes, like the inkwell, held the power...") and again in reflection ("The surveyor's thoughts turned to the notes they would place..."). The method is never shown on the page, does not shape a beat, and appears only in summary. No mechanics or cost dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion is vividly described and anchors the entire scene. It provides the surveyor's workspace and frames the discovery of the inkwell. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the setting functions as atmospheric container rather than active constraint. Present across all beats and in the closure image but without causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"After the drawbridge rises" signals the timeframe in the opening and returns as imagery near the end ("The drawbridge, now still, cast a long shadow"). Time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the surveyor works at their own pace without a live clock. The element frames the scene but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams" is stated once in exposition ("driven by a motivation to..."). It is never dramatized through a choice with friction, cost, or conflicting want. The surveyor's task proceeds without on-page struggle between desire and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" appears once mid-story ("the surveyor's heart burned with a hushed blaze") and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("a hushed blaze that burns"). The phrase gestures toward a tonal quality (quiet intensity) but is told rather than embodied in rhythm, diction, or sensory modulation. Tone remains static and elevated throughout without variance under pressure or a charge at the final image.</comment>
