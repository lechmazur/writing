<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lena's motivation arrives late (paragraph 17) and is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her interior life consists largely of abstract claims ("felt an inexplicable jolt," "overwhelming urge") without embodied sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The lens fragment triggers no visible behavioral cost or trade-off; she purchases it and proceeds to contemplate it in loops of similar phrasing ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition") that function as labels rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural but remains ambiguous past midpoint; no taught pattern by 25%, and the final paragraphs loop rather than deepen. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear by ~120 words, so no Orientation Test penalty. Closure unit is unclear: the ending recycles earlier abstract language ("eternal instant," "anchors of intuition," "hidden histories") without a legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The story asserts transformation ("newfound purpose," "boundaries begin to blur") but does not dramatize a before/after with visible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is named early and described with sensory specificity (sandalwood, myrrh, rooftops). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as backdrop for Lena's reflective loops. The lighthouse lens fragment and paintings are handled but remain static props rather than environmental pressures. Spatial choreography is vague (stalls, canvases, vendors fade into background) and does not track across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to honor overlooked histories") is declared in paragraph 17 but never tested on the page. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Lena moves from spotting the fragment to purchasing it to pondering it to descending with it, all without opposition, cost, or a meaningful tightening under any lens. The story asserts escalation ("vibrating with newfound intensity") but provides no causal trigger or price paid. Coincidence does not complicate; nothing complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in final paragraphs ("honor the overlooked," "weave a new narrative") rather than earned through concrete action. The "eternal instant," "anchors of intuition," and "elusively tangible" are recycled as prompt labels without transformation or non-literal resonance. No fresh inflection or reweighting occurs at closure; the ending summarizes the premise in the same register as the opening. The lighthouse lens and painting motifs are introduced but not used to constrain choice or charge the final image with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature exists (translator's eye for "elusively tangible objects," "hidden details") but diction drifts into abstract/corporate register ("unfasten the anchors," "bounded expanse of possibility," "tools she needed") that feels externally imposed rather than character-particular. Template cadence appears: multiple paragraphs open with "Lena felt" or "Lena knew," and adjacent sentences restate content ("She knew that she would return… For in this realm… she had found her true home"). Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "began to sense") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "elusively tangible" appears five times; "eternal instant" four times; "anchors of intuition" recurs without reweighting. Adjacent sentences restate ("the secrets of the anchors… the role that the lighthouse lens fragment played in their unfolding" then "began to unravel the mystery of the anchors"). Template cadence dominates the final third: "Lena felt… Lena knew… Lena felt… she knew…" across consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("heart afire," "beacon that shone bright") and abstract nominalizations ("the essence of the unknown," "the boundless expanse of possibility") replace concrete action. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the −1.7 floor and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise (translator seeks hidden histories via mystical market and lens fragment) follows a familiar template: protagonist discovers magical object, gains insight, pledges to continue quest. No fresh synthesis or transformation through specific lived detail. The "between-worlds translator" role, "alchemist's market," and "lighthouse lens" are evocative but generic fantasy furniture; they could swap for other mystical props without altering the emotional or thematic arc. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story hedges toward abstraction and safety.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Lena is present throughout but makes only one low-stakes decision (purchasing the fragment, paragraph 8) with no visible trade-off or consequence. The remainder is observation and reflection. No key turn traces to her agency; the story unfolds as contemplation rather than choice-driven action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment appears in three beats: spotted (paragraph 4), purchased (paragraph 8), and held while descending (paragraph 25). However, its use is static description and metaphor ("key to unlocking," "glow with otherworldly light") rather than evolving mechanical or causal function. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Present in closure but ornamental; no felt cost tied to its specific properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Anchors of intuition" is named five times but functions only as an abstract theme label. The concept does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; Lena's goal ("unfasten the anchors") is declared, not dramatized through action with cost. Swappable with any mystical-knowledge phrase.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" appears as a descriptor for objects (paragraph 3) and a figure in the painting (paragraph 13) but does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost. Label-only trait without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>"Unfasten" is declared as Lena's urge (paragraph 9) and goal (paragraphs 27–28) but never enacted on the page. No turn traces to this action; it remains abstract intention. Easily swappable with "unlock," "release," or "discover."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Hidden details in paintings appear in one extended beat (paragraphs 10–14): Lena searches canvases and spots a figure holding a lens. The method signals early but does not recur or shape later attempts; she does not return to paintings or use the discovery to alter tactics. Functional in one beat, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is named early (paragraph 1) and provides the lighthouse lens and paintings, shaping one key turn (Lena's purchase). It does not constrain later choices or pressure the ending; after paragraph 14 it fades into background. Present in closure as a reference ("would remain her guiding light," paragraph 29) but without causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>"Between childhood and now" is mentioned once (paragraph 7) as a vague temporal frame for a memory but does not tighten decisions or function as a live clock. Time is untracked; the visit could span minutes or hours without affecting tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to honor overlooked histories" is declared in paragraph 17 but not dramatized through conflicted choices. Lena's desire is told ("began to resurface") rather than tested against cost or competing want. It appears in the final paragraphs as thematic summary, not friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Eternal instant" is named four times and establishes a contemplative, suspended tone. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image; it remains static across beats. The phrase is recycled rather than reweighted, functioning as label rather than lived cadence.</comment>
