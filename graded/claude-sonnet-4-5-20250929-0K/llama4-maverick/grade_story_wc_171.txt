<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elian remains abstract despite the length—"operatively gentle hands," "flawed beauty," and "red-rimmed" eyes are labels rather than embodied contradictions. No micro-choices under pressure reveal competing impulses; he moves through the negotiation without visible internal friction or a decision that forecloses a path with cost. The delegates "open up" and grow "conciliatory" without dramatized resistance, flattening any sense of earned change. Motivation is declared ("to anchor ideals in practice") but never tested by a dilemma that forces sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is vague: we never learn which factions are negotiating, what specific conflict divides them, or what concrete terms are at stake. The negotiation itself is summarized in passive constructions ("negotiations progressed," "delegates departed") rather than dramatized through reversals or choices. No on-page decisive change occurs—Elian feels hope and exhaustion, but no before/after is legible in his options or the world. The piece gestures toward Resonant Reconfiguration but supplies no visible cost or foreclosed path at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ancient terrace and midsummer sun are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is absent—delegates arrive and depart without clear positioning or movement. The ebony clipboard appears often but remains a static symbol rather than a tool that shapes action. The "slow dance of celestial bodies" is described but never tightens a deadline or pressures a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—brokering peace—is declared but never tested by a concrete dilemma or reversal. No antagonist applies pressure; delegates simply "began to open up" without visible resistance or cost. The piece lacks escalation: the atmosphere "grew more charged" and voices became "more conciliatory," but these are assertions rather than dramatized turns. Agency is passive throughout; Elian observes and feels rather than choosing between competing goods with on-page consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in phrases like "the price of redemption" and "anchor ideals in practice" rather than emerging from particulars. The ebony clipboard is assigned "ritual significance" by fiat rather than accumulating meaning through changing use. The final paragraphs moralize explicitly: "a testament to the power of flawed beauty," "redemption was possible." No image or action offers a non-literal answer; instead, the text tells the reader what to conclude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Diction drifts into elevated abstraction inconsistent with urgent negotiation: "poignant reminder," "celestial bodies slowly danced," "flawed beauty." Psychic distance is unstable—some beats offer close interiority, others summary. Phrases like "operatively gentle" and "ritual significance" feel coined rather than organically character-voiced. The prose reads as written literary narration rather than filtered through Elian's perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops: "ritual significance" appears three times, "ebony clipboard" recurs without functional variation, "price of redemption" is restated across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence dominates—most sentences follow "As [X], Elian [verb]" or "The [noun] [metaphor]." Stock metaphors abound: "weight of centuries," "delicate balance," "deep currents." The final third stacks summary lines that restate closure claims without new imagery. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering elevated penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—weary negotiator seeks peace—is a stock template without transformation. "Flawed beauty," "price of redemption," and the symbolic clipboard feel assembled from prompt elements rather than integrated into a singular vision. The piece avoids risk: no sharp moral calculus, no subverted expectation, no specific detail that couldn't apply to any negotiation. The ending offers tidy satisfaction without cost, retreating to the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elian is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses an option. He observes, feels, and "musters," but the negotiation's turns happen off-page or are summarized. His role is passive witness rather than agent who shapes the outcome through choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in multiple beats but remains static—"cradling," "clutched," "symbol." It never enables a tactic, constrains a move, or returns with reweighted meaning. Its "ritual significance" is declared three times rather than demonstrated through changing use. No specific cost is tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"The price of redemption" is mentioned four times as a thematic label but never dramatized as a trade-off that narrows Elian's options. We never see what he sacrifices, what he gains, or what path he forecloses. It functions as abstract theme rather than shaping stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" appears once as a descriptor of Elian's hands and once as an "approach" that soothes delegates. It never constrains an action or creates a visible trade-off—no moment where gentleness costs him leverage or where its absence would fail. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Muster" is mentioned once ("began to muster the key players") but the action itself is not dramatized. We never see whom he calls, how they respond, or what this assembly changes. The negotiation's progress is summarized rather than shown through this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Through ritual significance" is stated three times but the ritual's mechanics are never enacted. We don't see Elian perform a ritual, reference one in argument, or use the clipboard in a ceremonial way that affects the delegates. The phrase remains abstract claim rather than demonstrated method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The ancient terrace appears throughout but functions as static backdrop. It does not constrain movement, supply cover, impose heat stress, or otherwise pressure Elian's choices. The "worn stone" and "midsummer sun" are described but never leveraged as resources or obstacles. Postcard description without tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"During the slow dance of celestial bodies" frames the story but imposes no deadline. Time passes ("sun began to set," "stars began to twinkle") without tightening pressure or altering Elian's tactics. No clock forces a rushed decision or retreat. The timeframe is poetic label rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"To anchor ideals in practice" is declared as Elian's motivation but never tested by a choice that pits ideal against expedient compromise. We are told he is "driven" and "determined," but he faces no dilemma where anchoring an ideal costs him tactical advantage or ally support.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Flawed beauty" is named explicitly and applied to Elian and the terrace. The tone attempts lyric elevation—"poignant reminder," "sweet scent of blooming flowers"—but remains uniform rather than modulating with pressure. No shift occurs as stakes rise or fall; the same register persists from opening to close, dulling the final image's charge.</comment>
