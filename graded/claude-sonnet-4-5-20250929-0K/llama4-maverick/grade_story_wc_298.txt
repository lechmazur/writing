<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains an abstraction throughout—"the idealist" functions as a label rather than a person with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Motivation is told via the metaphor of "patch holes in her soul" but never dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing desires under pressure. The spell-weaving sequence describes actions without embodied emotion or internal conflict, reading more like a ritual catalog than a character under stress. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; the ending asserts transformation without visible cost or foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough, but causality remains decorative rather than motivated. The protagonist wanders, spots a card, weaves a spell, and leaves—each beat operates in loose sequence without because/therefore linkage. The closure asserts transformation ("forever changed," "more whole") but no on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs with legible cost; the final image is a mood statement, not a reweighting of prior material. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural by intent, but no pattern break or cadence shift charges the ending—density remains uniform throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard setting is vivid and atmospheric in early description ("tree roots snaked between ancient bones"), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The burned tarot card is handled twice (pickup, pocket), yet neither touch alters a tactical choice or charges the closure image—it serves as symbolic luggage. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail (damp earth, decaying leaves) anchors the reader, but no environmental feature shapes a decision or forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to patch holes in her soul"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete loss or trade-off tests it on the page. The spell-weaving sequence unfolds without reversal, complication, or visible price; darkness "began to recede" without agency or sacrifice. No tightening, deepening, or cost materializes—pressure is asserted ("the air thickening with otherworldly energy") rather than dramatized through narrowed options or forced choices. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist action; the orchard "responds" passively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation and self-repair emerges from the imagery (burned card, spell-weaving, catacomb orchard), but the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("she would carry the lessons") rather than letting the image speak. The Eight of Swords motif (entrapment/limitation) is noted mid-story but never constrains a choice or reappears with reweighted meaning at closure. Subtext operates in the atmospheric details, yet the ending flattens resonance by declaring "a sense of peace" and "a brighter future" instead of offering a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("morbid perfume," "dusky resolve," "expectant hush") that reads more authorial than character-specific, especially during peak beats when compression or intensity would serve better. Perceptual signature is generic—"the idealist" notices roots, bones, and corridors in catalog fashion rather than through a selective, biased lens. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "began to shift" / "began to recede," "her own intentions, her own desires, and her own fears," "more pronounced, more alive." Template cadence appears in repeated "As she…" and "The idealist…" sentence stems across multiple beats. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh angle: "skeletal fingers reaching for the sky," "threads of fate." Figurative density in the spell-weaving sequence (otherworldly energy, expectant hush, pulse with fierce energy) obscures rather than clarifies what actually happens, harming the closure image. Apply patterned-artifact penalty: −1.2 in Q7, and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical bartered destinies in a catacomb orchard—assembles familiar gothic-fantasy tropes (tarot, spell-weaving, liminal spaces) without transformation through specific choice or grounded consequence. The protagonist's journey follows a template arc (seek solace → find symbol → perform ritual → achieve peace) with median choices that avoid risk. Emotional specificity is absent; "patch holes in the soul" and "dusky resolve" read as abstract placeholders. No turn or image feels inevitable in hindsight, and the ending's symmetry (darkness recedes, peace settles, brighter future) delivers safety rather than synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "reckless idealist" label appears throughout but never drives a key turn through a decision that alters tactics or narrows options. The protagonist wanders, picks up a card, weaves a spell, and leaves—all actions could proceed identically if the character were cautious or pragmatic. "Reckless" is asserted in the opening line but not demonstrated in any on-page choice with cost. Missing development and closure participation; ornamental labeling only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The burned tarot card is handled in two beats (pickup at mid-story, pocketed at the end) and receives symbolic interpretation (Eight of Swords as entrapment), but it does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image with reweighted meaning. The card functions as a passive talisman rather than an object whose properties enable or block an action. Setup and closure mention present, but middle development and causal pressure are absent; swappable with any symbolic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Bartered destinies" is mentioned once in the opening as a rumor that draws the protagonist to the orchard, then never operationalized on the page. No exchange, trade, or negotiation occurs; the spell-weaving sequence does not dramatize a barter or show competing destinies. The concept exists as thematic backdrop without shaping stakes, altering options, or participating in closure. Ornamental mention only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" appears once as an adverbial phrase modifying how the protagonist smooths the card's edges, but the action itself is trivial and costs nothing. The attribute does not constrain or enable any decision; it reads as label-only description. No setup in the first third, no middle development, no closure linkage. Static modifier without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears mid-story as the protagonist's intention ("to trammel the darkness"), linked to the spell-weaving action, but the mechanics and outcome remain abstract—no on-page detail shows how binding occurs or what cost it extracts. The action does not create a turn; it unfolds as uncontested ritual. Setup and middle mention present, but closure participation is ornamental (the darkness "began to recede" passively). Functional but swappable with "bind," "constrain," or "contain."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is described mid-story as the protagonist imbuing trees, roots, and bones with intentions, but the method's mechanics are never shown—no detail of how meaning is inlaid or what cost the process demands. The action unfolds as summary ("she began to weave a spell… imbuing… with her own intentions") without scene pressure. Setup and middle mention present, but the method does not shape closure or force a choice. Functional but replaceable with "casting a spell" or "channeling energy."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly established in the opening (tree roots snaking between bones, damp earth, decaying leaves) and frames the entire sequence, with the protagonist walking among roots and bones throughout. The setting provides atmospheric coherence and recurs in the closure image ("twisted roots and bones"), but it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Setup, development across beats, and closure mention all present; however, the orchard functions as stage rather than constraint. Solid presence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Within the glow of half-lit corridors" appears twice—once mid-story ("the glow… cast an eerie light") and once near the end ("into the glow of the half-lit corridors")—but functions as atmospheric description rather than a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock or deadline shapes the protagonist's actions; "time seemed to lose all meaning" explicitly suspends temporal pressure. The element is present but does not constrain tactics or alter the pace of choices. Ornamental use only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To patch holes in the soul" is stated explicitly as the protagonist's motivation and recurs thematically ("she felt the weight of her soul lifting"), but the desire is never dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. The spell-weaving unfolds without resistance or sacrifice; no on-page moment shows the protagonist weighing competing impulses or paying a price to mend those holes. Setup and closure assertion present, but middle development through choice is absent. Told-only motivation without enacted friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" appears once near the end as a declared emotional state, and the overall tone maintains a solemn, shadowy register consistent with the catacomb setting. However, tone does not modulate with pressure—the narrative voice remains uniformly atmospheric from opening to close without cadence shift or intensification at the closure beat. The final image asserts peace and brightness ("a brighter future") that tensions rather than deepens the dusky mood. Functional coherence but static; the tone does not charge the ending.</comment>
