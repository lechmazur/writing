<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is declared ("determined to complete," "driven by knowledge") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her internal experience consists largely of abstract emotional labels ("overwhelming sense of purpose," "deep sense of connection," "sense of wonder and awe") without embodied contradiction or character-particular texture. The final moment—smiling in darkness—reads as satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed paths; no prior desire is renounced on the page. The perfume vial's mechanistic pulsing replaces genuine interior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt: who/where/when anchors arrive promptly, but causality is thin—Kael's success in "untangling" and "harnessing" is asserted via summary rather than dramatized through reversals or obstacles that test her method. The temple's energy "responds" without resistance, and the climax ("with a final burst of energy, Kael succeeded") skips the peak moment entirely, summarizing the outcome instead of showing the decisive act. Closure form is unclear: the device preserves memories, but no before/after choice or felt cost is legible—Kael waits for rescue with "bittersweet" reflection, not a path foreclosed or stance crystallized with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The underwater temple setting provides atmospheric anchors (salt, decay, crumbling stone, labyrinthine passageways) and the crystal orifice at the heart serves as the goal location. However, spatial choreography is vague—how Kael moves through passageways, what tools or physical constraints she encounters, and how the decaying infrastructure resists her work remain abstract. The perfume vial's light "guides" her, but this is told rather than shown constraining navigation choices. The setting does not visibly alter tactics or charge the closure image; it functions as backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the temple's memories before the energy dies—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens: no reversal or obstacle tests Kael's method, and "time runs short" is asserted twice without on-page consequences (no failed attempt, no tool loss, no tactical shift). The perfume vial pulses brighter "with each passing moment," but this is atmospheric rather than causal escalation. Agency is minimal; Kael works "with frenzied intensity" and succeeds in a summarized beat, bypassing the moment where cost or trade-off would be legible. The ending offers melancholy reflection, not a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation of memory and lonesome splendor of solitary duty—is stated overtly rather than emerging from scene particulars: "she was not just preserving memories, but also the essence of a long-lost civilization," "the lonesome splendor of her task," and the final paragraph's "bittersweet reminder" all summarize rather than dramatize thematic weight. The perfume vial "touches memories" as a concept label, not a device that creates friction or moral calculus. No thematic question is tested through conflicting goods or visible sacrifice; Kael succeeds and feels sad, which lacks the earned, non-literal resonance required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic: "eyes fixed," "heavy with," "filled her heart" are stock constructions that could belong to any character. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral energy," "otherworldly power," "palpable force") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. No dialogue is present, so voice distinction cannot be assessed. Psychic distance remains consistent, and tense is clean, but the prose lacks a distinct rhythm or vocabulary that reflects Kael's specific mind under pressure—her interiority reads like narrated exposition rather than lived perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "the lonesome splendor of her task" appears twice with synonym churn ("sense of melancholy and longing"); "touches memories" is repeated with near-identical phrasing. Template cadence runs dominate ("As she inhaled…," "As she worked…," "As she progressed…," "As time runs short…," "As she waited…"). Stock metaphors ("heart of the temple," "weight of her mission") and filter-verb stacks ("felt an overwhelming sense," "felt the presence," "felt a deep sense") dull immediacy in peak beats. The climax—"with a final burst of energy, Kael succeeded"—is scaffold summary, not dramatized action. Information density is low; adjacent sentences restate content without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—lone operative preserving ancient knowledge in a dying temple—is a widely used template (explorer-scholar race-against-time in exotic ruin). The perfume vial as memory-trigger and energy-guide is ornamental rather than transformative; swapping it for another mystical object would require only minor edits. "Unsnarl the tangled threads of energy" and "harness the ephemeral" are abstract rather than specific, and no particular detail (method, world logic, moral calculus) distinguishes this version from countless similar stories. The "lonesome splendor" tone and bittersweet ending are executed competently but add no fresh inflection or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout as the POV and labeled "distress signal sender," but her role as sender does not drive key turns—she works to harness energy, and the beacon "flickered back to life" only after task completion, without causal link to her choices. The distress signal does not constrain tactics or shape the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in multiple beats (opening anchor, pulsing during work, glowing at climax, fading at closure) and returns with shifted meaning (gift → guide → poignant reminder). However, its function is largely atmospheric and told: it "pulsed," "illuminated," "glowed brighter," but Kael never handles, risks, or chooses with it in a way that narrows options. The final reprise is lyric but does not charge a decisive change—Kael simply waits, surrounded by its scent. Present across beats but not indispensable to the story's causal logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is mentioned twice as a descriptive phrase ("the gathered hush of the temple's secrets began to unfurl," "now a palpable force") but does not shape stakes or tactics. It functions as atmospheric theme language rather than a constraint or mechanic that alters Kael's choices on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Touches memories" is a recurring descriptive label for the perfume's scent, appearing in three beats. However, it remains ornamental—Kael inhales and feels transported or guided, but no specific memory constrains her actions or creates a tradeoff. The attribute is told, not dramatized as a cost or enabler of choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is introduced mid-story ("to unsnarl the tangled threads of energy") and mentioned again ("her efforts to unsnarl"), but the action is summarized rather than dramatized: Kael "focused her mind" and "slowly beginning to untangle" without shown obstacles or steps. The action does not create a key turn; success is asserted in the climax summary. Functional but replaceable with "repair," "restore," or similar verbs.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" appears once in a single sentence ("By overriding instinct, she focused her mind") without setup, cost, or payoff. The method is not signaled early, its mechanics are not shown, and it does not shape attempts or recur. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple is introduced in the opening line and anchors the setting throughout (crumbling stone, labyrinthine passageways, crystal orifice at the heart). It provides goal location (the heart) and atmospheric pressure (decaying infrastructure, dying energy). However, the setting does not constrain Kael's tactics in specific ways—navigation and structural obstacles are told rather than shown affecting choices. The temple's "whispers" and "secrets" function thematically but do not alter moves. Present across all three gates and shapes one turn (reaching the heart) but not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is stated twice but never tracked or enforced—no failed attempt due to time pressure, no tactical shift to compensate, no visible countdown. The timeframe is asserted as urgency without altering Kael's moves or the ending. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is signaled early ("sent to this forsaken place to harness the ephemeral energy") and drives the goal across beats (untangling, working, succeeding in harnessing). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires—Kael is "determined," but no friction between wants and costs appears on the page. The task succeeds without visible trade-off. Functional across setup, middle, and payoff but lacks felt stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is stated twice as a label ("the lonesome splendor of her task") and the tone is consistent—melancholic, reflective, tinged with awe. However, it remains static rather than modulating with pressure, and the final image repeats the mood ("bittersweet reminder") without reweighting it. The tone does not charge the closure with a new cost or realization; it echoes the opening without transformation.</comment>
