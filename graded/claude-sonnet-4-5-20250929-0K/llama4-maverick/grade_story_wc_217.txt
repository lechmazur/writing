<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains entirely passive—she sits, breathes, receives a feather, speaks a poem, walks away—without a single micro-choice under pressure or contradictory impulse in scene. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("deep understanding," "profound truth") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. The protagonist's arc from receiving beauty to "discovering something profound" is asserted rather than earned through struggle or visible cost. No internal conflict acts simultaneously; the narrative offers only smooth epiphany without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words; no penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern of dawn imagery, mist, feather). The closure image—poet walking away with feather, world "new"—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The kite-string snap arrives as an unmotivated external event with no causal link to prior beats or the poet's choices, failing to tighten stakes. Under the Accumulative lens, the final paragraph reweights nothing; the Cost Proof Test fails—I cannot point to a sentence where cost is legible at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon after rain anchors early and recurs throughout, providing sensory specificity (mist, wet sand, lapping water). However, setting remains postcard descriptive—it never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The feather, water, and dawn imagery supply texture but do not function as micro-setting that shapes the protagonist's single decision to walk away. The 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; the lagoon is backdrop only.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled but never tested by on-page pressure. The poet encounters no opposition, makes no trade-off, and faces no cost; she simply receives beauty passively. The kite-string snap offers a potential complication but deflates immediately without altering her stance or tactics. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; the protagonist's agency is limited to walking away after a completed epiphany. Under the chosen lens, one deepening or cadence shift that narrows options is required; none appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in the incomplete, connection to existence—is declared directly rather than emerging from event and image: "discovered something profound," "threads of existence weave themselves into her very being." The final image (poet walking away with feather) attempts resonance but the non-literal answer is absent; instead, the text moralizes ("she would carry the beauty of this moment with her always"). The feather returns but without reweighted meaning tied to cost. Thematic Echo penalty: the poet articulates the story's thesis in prompt-like language ("to discover beauty in the incomplete") without embodied dramatization, triggering −0.4 baseline; the final paragraph's sermon adds −0.5.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to the poet throughout. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions that feel imported rather than character-particular: "harmonize the very essence of her being," "channeling it into her art," "threads of existence." Perceptual signature is generic—what this poet notices could belong to any contemplative figure. The prose carries some rhythmic intent but lacks the specificity or idiomatic grounding to establish a distinct mind. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are present but not excessive; no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "She was a part of the world, connected to its rhythms and its beauty" restates "connected to the very fabric of existence" from two paragraphs prior. Template cadence runs: "The poet's eyes closed… The poet rose… The poet's footsteps…" across multiple sentences. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh angles: "gentle breeze," "soothing melody," "threads of time." These artifacts dull the closure beat ("the world was new, fresh, and full of wonder"), triggering −1.2 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact-in-final-third rule. Synonym churn: "burnished hush" recurs without functional shift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—contemplative poet receives symbolic object, has epiphany, walks away transformed—follows a widely used template without transformation through lived specificity or non-obvious moral calculus. The feather, mist, and dawn imagery are familiar lyric tokens. The kite-string snap gestures toward surprise but remains ornamental, unintegrated. No risk heightens stakes; the poet encounters no friction or cost. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 within Q8 for template reliance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The quiet shoreline poet is present throughout (setup ✓) but makes no decision that alters tactics or stakes. She observes, receives, speaks, and walks—pure passivity. Development gate missed: no middle choice. Closure gate missed: her final action (walking away) does not change options; the epiphany was complete before the walk began. Late first-action penalty does not apply since she appears early, but ornamental use (−0.8) and swappability (−0.6) drop the score. Starting anchor 3.0, minus frictions: 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drake's tail feather appears early (setup ✓), is handled in the lap and clutched while speaking (development partial ✓), and recurs in the final image (closure ✓—cameo only, not causally active). Two distinct beats: receiving it, holding it at the end. However, the feather's meaning does not reweight; it remains a static symbol of beauty throughout. Swappability moderate (−0.5): any iridescent object would function identically. Starting 3.0 + early signal +0.5 + two beats +0.9 + closure cameo +0.4 − swappability −0.5 − ornamental use −0.5 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Woven dawns appears once as a phrase the poet speaks ("spoke of woven dawns") and once in the final paragraph as memory ("the memory of the woven dawns"). Setup ✓ (first third mention). Development gate missed: the concept does not constrain or enable a middle choice. Closure gate missed: it is mentioned but does not shape the final image or action. Label-only (−0.3), summary-only (−0.3), swappability high (−0.7). Starting 3.0 + setup +0.3 − 1.3 frictions = 2.0, round to 2.1 for minimal presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Warmly attentive appears once: "fingers wrapped warmly attentive around the feather." Setup ✓ (early). Development and closure gates missed: the trait does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost; it is description only. Label-only (−0.3), ornamental (−0.6), swappability total (−0.8). Starting 3.0 + setup +0.3 − 1.7 = 1.6, round to 1.8 for presence without function.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Tend appears as "she tended the poem, nurturing it by harmonizing the discordant notes." Setup ✓ (first half). Development gate partial: the action occurs during poem-speaking but does not enable a distinct middle turn. Closure gate missed: the poem is finished well before the final image; tending does not shape the walk or the lagoon moment. Summary-only (−0.4): the tending is recounted, not dramatized with concrete gestures. Swappability moderate (−0.5): "composed" or "shaped" would substitute easily. Starting 3.0 + setup +0.4 + one beat +0.4 − 0.9 = 3.9, round to 3.6 for functional presence without necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>By harmonizing discord: the method is named once ("tending the poem… by harmonizing the discordant notes"). Setup ✓. Development and closure gates missed: no mechanics shown, no stakes shaped, no tactics altered. The kite-string snap offers potential discord but is not harmonized on the page. Summary-only (−0.4), label-only (−0.3), swappability high (−0.7). Starting 3.0 + setup +0.3 − 1.4 = 1.9, round to 2.3 for minimal signal without follow-through.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon after rain anchors throughout (setup ✓). The poet sits, walks, and gazes at it (development ✓: setting frames all action). The final image includes the lagoon explicitly: "gazing out at the lagoon… the water was calm" (closure ✓). Three gates met, eligible ≥6.1, but the lagoon never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it is backdrop only. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but ornamental use (−0.8) and no causal pressure (−0.8). Starting 3.0 + 2.8 positives − 1.6 frictions = 4.2; lyric-resonance allowance +1.0 for charged final reprise = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.2</grade><comment>As a kite string snaps appears once, mid-story: "a kite string snapped, its shrill twang piercing the air." Setup missed (appears past first third). Development gate missed: the snap does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the poet simply watches the kite vanish. Closure gate missed: the timeframe does not constrain the ending. Late arrival (−0.6), ornamental (−0.8), swappability total (−0.7). Starting 3.0 − 2.1 = 0.9, round to 1.2 for isolated mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>To discover beauty in the incomplete is stated directly: "Her motivation was not to create something perfect, but to discover beauty in the incomplete." Setup ✓. Development gate partial: the motivation frames the poem-speaking but does not create friction or choice. Closure gate missed: the final walk asserts discovery without dramatizing conflicted desire or cost. Told-only (−0.5), label-only (−0.3), no friction between wants and costs (−0.8). Starting 3.0 + setup +0.5 + one thematic beat +0.4 − 1.6 = 2.3, round to 3.1 for thematic presence without embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Burnished hush anchors early ("a burnished hush that wrapped around her") and recurs in the final paragraph ("The burnished hush of the dawn lingered"). Setup ✓, closure ✓. Development gate partial: tone remains static across all beats—no modulation with pressure. The final reprise recharges the opening image, qualifying for lyric-resonance allowance. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, lyric reprise bonus +1.0, but static mood (−0.6). Starting 3.0 + 2.5 positives − 0.6 = 4.9, round to 5.4 for coherent tone with minimal modulation.</comment>
