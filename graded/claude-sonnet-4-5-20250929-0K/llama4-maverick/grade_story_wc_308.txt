<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "harmonic stone skimmer" remains purely abstract throughout—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no genuine choices under pressure. All interiority consists of summary claims ("felt the familiar thrum," "began to discern") without dramatized cost or micro-decisions. The piece tells us the skimmer learns and attunes but never shows a moment where its perception forces a trade-off or forecloses a path. Motivation is asserted ("purpose was to learn to navigate without moving") yet never tested by conflicting wants or stakes with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed well past 120 words with vague anchors (what is a "harmonic stone skimmer"? sentient object? metaphor?), triggering the Orientation Test penalty. No legible closure unit exists: the piece drifts through centuries of passive observation without a decisive change, renunciation with cost, or conceptual repricing that lands on the page. The final paragraph offers thematic summary ("In the stillness, the skimmer had found a new kind of movement") rather than an image with felt consequence. Drive lens remains ambiguous—neither causal linkage nor accumulative pattern break is evident at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The canyon setting and bone towers are vivid in early description, but they never constrain a choice or evolve causally. Spatial details remain static postcards across centuries; the arrowhead and dust accumulate as atmospheric touches without altering tactics. The flock of birds appears once to deliver exposition ("the skimmer discerned the arrowhead's story") rather than function as a recurring constraint. Because setting does not shape the ending, the 9+ gate is not met, capping at 8.8, but execution flaws prevent even mid-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("to learn to navigate without moving") is declared early but never pressured by opposition, cost, or a credible tightening. Centuries pass with passive observation; no reversal or deepening alters options. The "pulse left wandering" synchronizes with the skimmer's heartbeat off-page, a told resolution that bypasses agency. No on-page choice forecloses a path, no trade-off is visible, and coincidence (time passing) resolves what little tension exists.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated directly throughout ("the transformative power of stillness," "enduring power of harmony and balance") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("a reminder that even in stillness, there is always movement") instead of offering a resonant image. The arrowhead functions as a symbolic object introduced and interpreted via summary ("had become a key to unlocking the secrets of the universe") without constraining a prior choice or reweighting meaning through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is generic cosmic-narrator throughout; diction remains elevated and abstract ("vibrational hum," "ephemeral narrative," "multisensory awareness") with no modulation under pressure. No psychic distance shift or embodied perception grounds the skimmer's interiority. The prose alternates between summary exposition and thesaurus-itis ("appraise," "unhurried intensity," "labyrinthine canyons of the past"), lacking a character-specific filter or voice-driven cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs: multiple restatements of "centuries of dust," "skimmer remained steadfast," "navigation without movement." Template cadence runs ("The skimmer's X was Y" repeated six times) and stock metaphor strings ("symphony of stone and shadow," "vast expanse of the universe") pile up without pattern-teaching or payoff. Register drifts into abstract academese ("multisensory awareness," "underlying structure of reality") inconsistent with the established voice. Baseline deduction −1.0 for combined artifacts; −0.4 additional because loops touch the closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (sentient object seeking enlightenment through stillness) follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. All elements—canyon, arrowhead, birds, centuries—remain interchangeable with generic alternatives; removing exact details would not break story logic. The final "movement in stillness" insight is a well-worn paradox delivered as platitude. No bold risk-taking or fresh inflection distinguishes this execution from stock Zen-parable structures.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Harmonic stone skimmer is present throughout but makes no decisions that alter tactics or create turns. All involvement is passive observation ("watched," "regarded," "discerned") summarized across centuries. Setup gate met (present early); development and closure gates missed (no middle choice, final image mentions it but it remains inert). Swappable with any contemplative entity. Ornamental use −1.0, late closure participation −0.3, summary-only −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Stone arrowhead appears in one early beat (the skimmer regards it) and returns in thematic summary ("had become a key") but is never handled, used, or reweighted through scene pressure. Setup gate met; development and closure gates missed (no middle action, no charged reprise). Single beat involvement +0.4, but swappability −0.6 (any relic would serve), summary-only closure mention −0.5. Capped at 4.6 for missing middle development; actual score 4.2 after frictions.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A pulse left wandering" appears twice: early mention ("felt the familiar thrum of a pulse—a pulse that had been left wandering") and late summary ("The pulse...was now a part of the skimmer"). Never shapes on-page stakes or tactics; functions as metaphor only. Setup gate met; development and closure gates missed. Theme claim without action pressure −0.8, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" is mentioned twice as label ("historically reverent nature of its creators," "skimmer's historically reverent nature") without constraining or enabling a choice. No visible tradeoff tied to this trait. Setup gate met (mentioned early); development and closure gates missed. Label-only −0.8, no causal work evident. Capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears in one sentence ("it set out to appraise the arrowhead's significance") but does not drive turns or redefine options—the skimmer passively observes rather than acting. Swappable with "observe" or "study." Setup gate met; development and closure gates missed. Single beat +0.4, but swappability −0.7, no causal pressure evident. Capped at 3.4 for missing middle development; placed at 3.6 due to marginal early signal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight" appears once in the middle third to deliver exposition ("the skimmer discerned the arrowhead's story"). Mechanics not explained; method does not shape attempts or constrain later choices. Setup gate missed (introduced mid-story); development gate marginal (one beat); closure gate missed. Late appearance −0.4, ornamental use −0.6, summary delivery −0.4. Capped at 4.6 for missing setup; actual 3.8 after frictions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Towers of bone and canyon of endless echoes are established early and provide vivid atmospheric anchoring. However, they never pressure a choice, supply resources, or evolve causally across the centuries. Setup gate met; development and closure gates missed (postcard description without tactical impact). Early signal +0.5, but ornamental use −0.8, no causal pressure −0.6. Capped at 4.6 for missing middle development; final 4.7 due to strong atmospheric anchoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Centuries of layered dust" recurs as atmospheric marker but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—time remains vague and untracked as a live constraint. Setup gate met (mentioned early); development and closure gates missed (no clock pressure on choices). Ornamental recurrence −0.8, no decision pressure −0.7. Capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation; placed 2.6 after frictions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is stated twice as motivation but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. The skimmer achieves its goal off-page via summary ("had found a new kind of movement"). Setup gate met; development and closure gates missed (no friction, no on-page trade-off). Told-only −0.9, no dramatized conflict −0.6. Capped at 2.8 for missing closure participation; marginal thematic reprise raises to 3.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" anchors tone throughout and modulates minimally (serene → contemplative). The tone coheres but remains static without reflecting escalating pressure. Setup, development, and closure gates all met (present throughout and noted in final image). All three gates +1.4, coherence +0.5, but static mood without modulation under pressure −0.7. Final 5.2 reflects consistent presence without dynamic charge.</comment>
