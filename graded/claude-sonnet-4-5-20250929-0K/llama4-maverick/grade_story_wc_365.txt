<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The map maker remains a functional role rather than a person with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Interiority consists largely of abstract concepts ("weaving between worlds," "hidden patterns," "larger structure") without embodied emotion or micro-choices under pressure. The final "discovery" is asserted but never dramatized—we're told she uncovered a secret without witnessing the revelation or its cost. Motivation is declared ("weight of a withheld truth") but never tested through conflicting wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story provides exposition about a phenomenon and a quest but no on-page closure with visible cost. The protagonist moves through "a succession of worlds" in summary, then emerges claiming she "finally uncovered the secret"—but the reader never sees the discovery, the choice it forces, or the price paid. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchor by the first paragraph), but causality is summary-only: each transition is narrated as completed rather than dramatized with because/therefore linkage. No decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The repair bay is anchored early with concrete detail (rust, decay, grimy windows, skeletal starships), and the green glass shard is handled twice (picked up, glows). However, the "parallel universes" remain generic placeholders—"diverse landscapes" and "ever-changing topography" without sensory specificity or POV-filtered detail. The shard's glow guides her but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it simply fades when she's done. Spatial choreography within each world is absent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("discover the weight of a withheld truth") is signaled but never tested on the page. The narrative summarizes movement through worlds without a single on-page reversal, tightening, or choice that narrows options. The protagonist's agency is passive observation; coincidence (the shard's glow) guides her rather than her decisions driving turns. No visible price is paid—she emerges "reeling" but unchanged in tactics or capability. Escalation is asserted ("intense light," "kaleidoscope") rather than dramatized through causal pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than earned: "weight of a withheld truth," "hidden structure," "larger pattern" appear as labels without concrete anchoring. The final paragraph offers thematic summary ("she would never see the multiverse in the same way again") in place of a resonant image. The green glass shard recurs but does not shift meaning—it functions identically at pickup and at closure. No concrete particulars generate thematic complexity; the piece reads as allegory with transparent stand-ins (map maker = seeker, doorway = possibility) lacking narrative life.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with stable psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but controlled within the POV's lexicon ("cyclically spontaneous phenomenon," "labyrinthine pathways"). However, perceptual signature is generic—sensory details (rust, decay, glow) could belong to any observer. No dialogue is present to assess. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") stack throughout without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in what should be high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "diverse landscapes" / "ever-changing topography" / "succession of worlds" restate without added detail; "senses reeling" appears twice within six paragraphs. Template cadence dominates the middle third: "She had been…," "She had spent…," "She moved through…," "She had been haunted…" in successive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("reflection on rippling water," "kaleidoscope of images") appear without fresh inflection. The final third carries no artifacts touching closure, limiting the deduction, but density is low—many sentences repeat the same claim (she sought truth, she navigated worlds) without advancing knowledge or situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise (sensory cartographer explores multiverse via artifact) combines familiar elements without transformation. The "withheld truth" remains abstract and interchangeable; removing the map-making trait would not alter the arc. Turns are summary-only and arise from the shard's convenience rather than character-specific insight. The emotional template (seeker finds revelation, feels gratitude) is generic. No lived detail, world logic, or non-obvious moral calculus distinguishes this from writing-prompt defaults.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The sensory map maker is introduced early and present throughout, but her map-making skill never constrains or enables a key turn. She observes and is pulled by the shard; her profession functions as a label rather than a causal force. Swappable with "explorer" or "scholar" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in three beats: picked up with a "jolt of connection," glows to guide transitions, fades at closure. It enables the journey but does not constrain choices or carry reweighted meaning at the end—it simply stops working. Functional but replaceable; any talisman could serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is the plot vehicle but remains thematic rather than tactical. The concept does not shape on-page stakes or alter options—transitions are narrated as fait accompli. The protagonist does not choose when or how to weave; the shard does. Present and echoed, but not driving pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" describes the phenomenon in the opening but never constrains or enables an action. The cycle is not tracked, and spontaneity does not create friction or force a timed choice. Label-only mention without visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Redirect" appears in the protagonist's intention ("redirecting her path through parallel universes") but no major turn traces to an act of redirection. She is pulled through worlds and emerges; no on-page moment shows her choosing to redirect. Summary-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Parallel universes are the setting for most of the narrative, but their mechanics remain opaque and do not shape tactics. The protagonist does not test or exploit the method; she is guided passively. Present across many beats but without causal pressure or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is anchored early with concrete detail (rust, skeletal starships, tangled wreckage) and frames the opening and closing beats. However, it does not constrain choices or supply resources that affect outcome—it is a launch point and return site without tactical involvement. Functional setup and reprise, but not essential to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears as a poetic opening phrase but does not function as a timeframe. Time is not tracked, and no clock or temporal pressure tightens decisions. Ornamental mention without structural role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>"To discover the weight of a withheld truth" is stated as motivation midway through and referenced at closure, but never dramatized through conflicting choices or friction between want and cost. The protagonist pursues it without obstacle or doubt. Present as a thematic claim, but not tested on the page.</comment>
