<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to help her father is clear, but her interior life remains abstract—poring over notes, pondering concepts, gathering insights—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under live pressure. The father never appears on the page, so the relationship exists only as summary backstory. The final resolve feels declared rather than earned through a dramatized struggle that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("lucid contradictions," "clover melancholy") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who and where early, satisfying the Orientation Test. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she starts with a plan, rides trains gathering insights, and ends with the same plan reinforced. The closure unit is a stated resolve to create a therapy program, not a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no stance crystallizes under pressure. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain is missing; under Accumulative, no cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rainwashed library and candle lantern are described with consistent sensory detail and recur across beats, charging the final image. However, the subway setting remains generic—no spatial choreography or concrete sensory hierarchy shapes Elara's attention. The mica pane is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or alters tactics, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—helping her father overcome addiction—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Elara faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and encounters no cost that narrows her options. The graffiti phrase and probability theory remain tools she considers, not pressures that force a difficult choice. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the ending restates her initial intention without escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the concept of lucid contradictions and the quest for certainty, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the final image—Elara walking into rain with resolve—does not offer a non-literal answer that reweights prior material; it simply restates her determination. The candle lantern recurs but remains a static symbol rather than a resonant element that shifts meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice is stable and maintains consistent third-person limited focalization throughout. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("clover melancholy," "theoretically rebellious") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears, so conversational subtext cannot be evaluated. The perceptual signature is present but not strongly distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure, but several passages exhibit paraphrase loops and synonym churn—"casting a misty gloom" / "casting a soothing melody," repeated references to the lantern's "soft glow" and "gentle light" without new pressure. Template cadence appears in adjacent "she began to" / "she felt" / "she realized" constructions. Stock metaphors ("beacon guiding her journey") and filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "felt a") dull immediacy in key beats. Apply −0.6 for patterned artifacts; the closure beat itself is not obscured, preventing heavier penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—academic applies probability theory to father's gambling addiction—is functional but not fresh; the transformation test fails as the emotional arc could play out unchanged with different occupations. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material. The subway-graffiti method is mentioned but never deployed in a way that shapes tactics or outcome, remaining ornamental.</comment>
