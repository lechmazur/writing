<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The survivor's motivation to translate stillness into music is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or costly micro-choices. Eli remains a gentle cipher—his "silently expressive" eyes and economical movements are told labels without embodied tension or internal friction. The protagonist's emotional arc from frazzled nerves to peace and pride feels tidy, lacking the self-deception or irrational layering that would ground the transformation. The final parting carries gratitude but no visible foreclosure or renunciation with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: who (survivor, Eli), where (winterglass conservatory), and when (post-catastrophe silence) anchor by the fourth paragraph. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: the heat-map device and tuning fork vibrations layer atmosphere, but no causal because/therefore linkage tightens options. The ending offers Charged Poise—the "symphony of silence" and the survivor carrying the music forward—but the cost is asserted ("no longer alone") rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift. The closure unit exists but lacks the undeniable pressure or visible price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vivid—frosted panes, tropical plants, automated light spectrum—and the setting constrains the scene spatially. The heat-map device and tuning fork case are handled on the page, charging the final collaborative moment. However, the environment does not force a tactical choice or alter the protagonist's options; it remains a backdrop for the emotional arc rather than a pressure that shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal narrows options: the survivor and Eli work together, adjust frequencies, and succeed without friction or trade-off. "Rectify the discord" is mentioned but not dramatized as a cost or obstacle. The piece accumulates texture (vibrations, heat-map readings) but never tightens into a choice that forecloses a live path or imposes visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—beauty and connection in a silent world, "unshaken marvels"—emerges through the conservatory's fragile ecosystem and the collaborative music-making. The heat-map device visualizing emotion offers a concrete metaphor. However, the final image ("music of the winterglass conservatory," "strength to face whatever lay ahead") states rather than dramatizes the thematic answer, edging toward summary. The piece resists a tidy moral but also avoids a resonant, non-literal final turn that reweights prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to the survivor's POV with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"frosted panes," "gentle hum," "mesmerizing display"—but the diction remains safely literary without character-particular syntax or rhythm under pressure. Eli's silence is managed through "eyes, silently expressive" and a single nod, which reads as an efficient device rather than embodied constraint. No dialogue appears; the collaborative work is summarized ("together they worked") rather than shown in voice-distinct exchange.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no loops or major artifacts. Several sentences carry template cadence: "She had always found solace… where the outside world seemed to fade away, and the beauty of nature was preserved…" stacks clauses without propulsion. "A sense of peace," "a sense of connection," "a sense of pride" recur as abstract labels rather than embodied states. Figurative language ("ripples on a pond," "delicate flower in ice") is conventional and does not muddle, but density is moderate—many lines restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—post-catastrophe silence, translating emotion into felt vibrations—is conceptually interesting but not transformed through specific, grounded friction. The heat-map device and tuning forks feel ornamental rather than inevitable: the story would function with any tool that visualizes or externalizes emotion. The conservatory as sanctuary and the survivor-musician partnership are familiar comfort arcs. No turn or reconfiguration feels earned in hindsight by prior particulars; the resolution is declared rather than discovered.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The capsize survivor is named and her frazzled state is mentioned, but no on-page choice turns on her survival experience. She observes, sits, activates the device, and nods—passive witnessing rather than decision-making. The survival backstory does not constrain or enable the collaborative music-making; it could be swapped for any trauma with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in three beats: resting beside Eli, opened to reveal instruments, and packed away. It enables the music-making and returns at closure, satisfying setup and payoff gates. However, the case itself is a container; the forks do the work. Swappable with any instrument case without altering stakes or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is named twice—in the conservatory's preserved beauty and in the final paragraph—but it functions as thematic label rather than a stake-shaping concept. The marvels do not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page; they are observed and claimed, not tested. The story would hold with "fragile beauty" or "resilient wonders."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Eli's "silently expressive" eyes appear in one beat where he nods and his gaze drifts. The trait justifies minimal dialogue but does not impose cost or enable a tactical advantage. It is label-only; we do not see him communicate essential information or fail to communicate under pressure in a way that alters the survivor's choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears once: "time to rectify the discord that had crept into their composition." This prompts the collaborative adjustment of frequencies, which leads to the "symphony of silence" closure. The action is named and shapes the final beat, satisfying setup and payoff. However, the discord itself is not dramatized—we do not witness the error or the cost of correction—so the rectification is summary rather than a causal turn that redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions appears in three beats: introduced as a tool, activated to cast glow over Eli, and used to guide the collaborative adjustment. It participates in the closure unit by "using the heat-map to guide them." The device shapes the method of composition. However, its mechanics are vague—"readings danced," "heat-map evolving"—and could be replaced by any emotion-visualization tool without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory anchors every beat: frosted panes, tropical plants, automated light system, and the final dimming lights. It provides spatial coherence and atmospheric pressure, and the plants "lean in" at closure, charging the final image. The setting does not force a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, but its recurring presence and charged ending participation justify mid-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after noise becomes impossible" is established in paragraph nine ("aftermath of the catastrophe that had rendered the world silent") and informs the entire premise. However, time does not tighten decisions—no clock or deadline pressures the scene. The post-silence condition is backstory context rather than an on-page constraint. The element is present and consistent but does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation to translate silence into music is stated twice: "dedicated herself to translating the stillness into music" and "music they were creating together." It drives the scene's collaborative effort and closure. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting desires or visible trade-offs. The survivor's want to create music faces no friction—Eli is willing, the tools work, and success is achieved without cost.</comment>
