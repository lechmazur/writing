<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The summoner remains a static archetype throughout, making no difficult choices that reveal contradictory impulses or internal friction. The motivation "to hush a prophecy" is declared but never tested by competing desires or visible costs that alter tactics. Interiority consists entirely of abstract meditation and cosmic energy flows without embodied emotion or character-particular perception. The final "satisfaction" arrives unearned, as no prior struggle or foreclosed path makes the ending a credible change or endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past the opening: "nocturnal haven" anchors atmosphere but not spatial or temporal specifics (−0.4 per Orientation Test; Q3 capped at 7.0). The piece moves from meditation to wing release without a single reversal, tightening, or on-page cost that narrows options. The prophecy's "hushing" is asserted complete in summary rather than dramatized, offering no before/after legible to the reader. No meaningful closure unit (DC/RR/CR with visible cost) lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven, brook, and flowers are described vividly but never constrain a choice or alter tactics; the summoner could perform the same ritual anywhere. Spatial choreography (sitting, walking to brook edge, releasing wing) is minimal and generic. Sensory detail (scent, rustle, glow) decorates rather than pressuring the stake, and the origami wing's physical handling lacks tactile specificity that would charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy—is declared early but never subjected to on-page escalation, tightening, or trade-off. The summoner encounters no opposition, friction, or complication; the ritual proceeds smoothly from intent to completion without a single moment where options narrow or cost becomes legible. The release of the wing at dawn is framed as triumphant satisfaction rather than a choice that forecloses a path, leaving the conflict inert.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of silence and tranquility emerges through repeated abstract claims ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "mapping silence") rather than concrete particulars that shift meaning. The crane's wing serves as a prop for cosmic energy rather than an image whose meaning reweights prior material. The ending restates the premise ("power of silence") in near-prompt language instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer. No competing tensions or ambiguity invite reflection beyond the immediate declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains stable third-person distance and a consistent elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze"). However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular: the summoner notices cosmic forces and tranquility but never through idiosyncratic bias or selective attention. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("smoothed the hush," "distilled into the air") that obscures concrete action, and several phrases feel synonymous across paragraphs without deepening pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence and paraphrase loops accumulate: "tranquil" and "hush" recur decoratively across multiple beats without evolving function (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("fabric of reality," "conduit for forces") and near-synonymous restatements ("smoothed the hush," "enveloped...smoothing the hush") dull momentum. Several sentences summarize the same meditative state without advancing stakes. Figurative language in high-pressure beats (releasing the wing, achieving closure) remains generic rather than sharp, and the final paragraphs loop the theme statement multiple times.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—summoner meditates to silence a prophecy using origami—offers surface novelty but executes through familiar mystical ritual beats without transformation. The "mapping silence" method is declared rather than shown through specific, non-obvious mechanics. The emotional arc (serenity to satisfaction) follows a predictable meditative template, and the prophecy's threat never materializes in scene to create friction. Removing specifics (origami, brook) and substituting generic equivalents (talisman, forest) would leave the plot and emotional logic unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and performs the ritual, but makes no difficult choices that create turns. The decision to release the wing is framed as completion rather than a trade-off with visible cost. Observation and meditation dominate; agency is passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in the opening (clutched in hands), glows mid-ritual, and is released at closure—three touches. However, its use remains static: a focal point for energy without evolving function or reweighted meaning. The wing's release does not causally resolve prior friction, as no friction was dramatized. Lyric reprise present but minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" appears as a repeated phrase in description and theme statements, but never shapes tactics or alters options on the page. The concept is ornamental rather than a constraint the summoner must navigate or a cost that changes the ending's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" is a label-only trait describing energy the summoner taps; it enables no specific action with visible cost or constraint. The trait could be swapped for "mystical" or "ethereal" with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Flow" appears as the summoner's meditative method and is mentioned at setup and mid-ritual. However, the action does not drive a turn or tightening; the meditative flow proceeds uninterrupted. Removing "flow" and substituting "focus" or "attune" would leave the plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.5</grade><comment>"By mapping silence" is declared as the summoner's method but its mechanics are never shown: what does mapping entail? How does it differ from meditation? The method is mentioned at setup and closure in thematic summary but does not shape a single attempt or tactical choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven and brook anchor atmosphere and provide the stage for the wing's release, but the setting does not constrain or enable tactics. The summoner could perform the ritual indoors or elsewhere with no change to conflict or outcome. Postcard description dominates over functional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears once in the middle as vague atmosphere. No timeframe tightens decisions: the summoner works "as the night wore on" and finishes "as dawn crept," but elapsed time does not alter tactics or raise cost. The clock is decorative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"To hush a prophecy spoken in code" is stated early as the summoner's goal and drives the ritual's intent. However, the motivation is never dramatized through conflicting desires or on-page friction; the summoner feels "an overwhelming need" without struggle. No trade-off between hushing the prophecy and another want makes the choice costly. Setup and thematic closure present, but development lacks pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" recurs as a phrase (setup and closure) and attempts to fuse serenity with intensity. However, the tone remains static: meditative calm throughout with no modulation under pressure, as no pressure materializes. The oxymoron is asserted rather than embodied in rhythm or image that charges the final beat.</comment>
