<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria remains largely observational despite being framed as the protagonist; her "altruistic ghost" status is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. The settlers as a collective lack individual voice or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Lyra appears briefly but never acts under pressure, and the "strangely trustworthy" attribute is asserted without dramatized cost or constraint. The ending grants satisfaction without visible forfeiture—Aria orchestrates, the settlers comply, transformation occurs—leaving no path foreclosed or trade-off felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural (symbols, energy signatures, collective ritual), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the nebula plan is proposed and executed without reversal, resistance, or cost. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the transformed landscape, yet no before/after choice or stance crystallization is legible—the settlers celebrate an achieved state without visible price paid on the page. The "brambled hope" and butterfly garden return as ornamental callbacks rather than reweighted constraints.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating rock arches are described but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Lyra's butterfly garden and watering bell appear as atmospheric details without pressure application. Spatial choreography remains abstract—settlers "gather beneath arches" and "work together" without legible physical positions or tool interactions. The nebula's energy signature is told as a world-building fact but not dramatized through sensory perception or POV-filtered attention.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harnessing the nebula's energy—is declared but never faces opposition, resource scarcity, or internal conflict. No reversal or tightening occurs: Aria proposes, the settlers decipher and build, success follows. Coincidence does not resolve (no lucky break), yet agency is absent—no character makes a high-cost choice that forecloses an option. The "brambled hope" label claims fragility without demonstrating a credible loss or tactical constraint that shapes the final outcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of collective effort and transformation is stated overtly ("power of collective effort," "beacon of hope") rather than emerging from image and event. The butterfly garden and nebula recur as symbols but do not shift meaning at closure—they confirm the thesis mechanically. The final paragraph moralizes: "they knew that they had created something truly special" and "both a refuge and a beacon of hope" replace scene pressure with thematic summary. No counter-reading or ambiguity invites reflection; resolution is tidy and affirming without conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person omniscient distance remains stable but generic; no distinct perceptual signature differentiates Aria's centuries-old perspective from the settlers' present experience. Diction ("altruistic ghost," "kaleidoscope of colorful creatures," "turbulent history") reads as elevated catalog rather than character-filtered observation. The cryptic chalk messages are told as "messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn" without showing Aria's physical act or the settlers' real-time decoding process. Free indirect access to Aria's motivation ("she realized") tells rather than dramatizes internal pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "struggles and triumphs" / "hardship...thriving community," "guidance or solace" / "wisdom," "sense of excitement and anticipation began to build" / "sense of brambled hope took hold." Template cadence runs through middle paragraphs ("As the settlers...," "As they...," "As the pathways..."). Stock metaphor "kaleidoscope of colorful creatures" and therapy-speak "sense of belonging" flatten texture. Register drifts into Wikipedia voice: "the planet's unique energy signature, which emanated from a nearby nebula." Information density is low—many sentences restate setup without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The ghost-guides-settlers premise follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The butterfly garden, chalk messages, and floating arches are mentioned but remain interchangeable ornaments—none impose unique constraints or costs. The nebula energy-harnessing plot resolves without friction, and the "collective effort" theme restates cooperative-utopia tropes. No fresh inflection or risk-taking distinguishes this iteration; the ending's "refuge and beacon of hope" could cap any community-building narrative with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout and her "orchestration" frames the plot, but she makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Observation and summary dominate; she "began to sense," "realized," "began to reexamine," then communicates. No cost or constraint tied to her ghost nature shapes the outcome. Mid-band functional presence without causal pressure or closure participation beyond framing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The watering bell appears twice: initial description in Lyra's garden and a final-paragraph callback ("now a familiar sound, seemed to resonate"). Neither beat involves handling, use under pressure, or reweighted meaning that shifts stakes. Static ornamental recurrence without causal work or cost connection. Swappable with any garden tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is introduced at midpoint, named as the energy source, and described as harnessed by the settlers. It shapes the declared stake (tap nebula energy) and is present in the closure image ("integral part of the planet's ecosystem"). However, its mechanics never constrain a choice or generate on-page conflict—no scarcity, risk, or trade-off dramatized. Functional setup and payoff without middle pressure; swappable with any mystical energy source.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is asserted in paragraph five: "the settlers had grown to trust her strangely trustworthy nature." Label-only mention without action that constrains, enables, or costs. No dramatized moment where trust is tested or her ghost-nature creates friction. Ornamental trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears once: "she began to reexamine the planet's energy patterns." This beat leads to the plan (causal role in one major turn) but is told in summary—no on-page process, cost, or discovery dramatized. Present in setup and linked to middle action; absent from closure beats. Functional but thin, swappable with "analyze" or "study."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Chalk messages appear in one paragraph: "Through a series of messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn, Aria communicated her plan...using cryptic symbols and diagrams." The method is named and the settlers "decipher their meaning," but no mechanics shown—no on-page act of chalking, no illustrated puzzle-solving, no constraint (why chalk? why dawn?). Setup present, middle friction claimed but not dramatized, absent from closure. Functional placeholder.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating rock arches are described in setup and closing paragraphs. Arches serve as gathering spots ("beneath the floating rock arches") but never constrain movement, supply resources, or alter tactics. The orchard's beauty is told; no micro-setting interaction dramatized. Present across beats as backdrop, but replaceable with any exotic landscape without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" frames the opening: "After years of hardship, the settlers had created a thriving community." This timeframe is told in backstory, not a live pressure on the page. No clock tightens decisions; the "now" of the story spans an untracked duration of planning and building. Setup mention only; no development or closure participation. Ornamental framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to orchestrate collective effort is stated early ("Aria's motivation was to orchestrate...") and drives the declared stake (harness nebula energy). The settlers' collective work is summarized across multiple beats and present in the closure celebration. However, no on-page friction between want and cost is dramatized—Aria's desire meets no resistance, error, or trade-off. Functional across setup, middle summary, and payoff, but lacking visible conflict or price. Mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is named once at midpoint: "a sense of brambled hope took hold, a feeling that was both fragile and resilient." The tone label claims tension (fragile/resilient) but the prose delivers smooth optimism throughout—no syntactic or imagistic bramble that snags momentum. The final paragraphs ("truly special," "beacon of hope") deflate any remaining ambiguity into celebration. Mentioned without modulation or closure charge; ornamental mood label.</comment>
