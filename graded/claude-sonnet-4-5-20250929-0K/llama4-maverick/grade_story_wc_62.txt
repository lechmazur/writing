<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The carver's interiority remains abstract throughout—"turmoil within," "weight of her grief," "sense of peace"—without embodied contradiction or specific micro-choices under pressure. The "fiercely meditative" attribute appears only as a label in the opening; no on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining a choice. The spectral mentor materializes without resistance or friction, and the carver's final "discovery" of collective grief's shape is asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle. Internal conflict is summarized, not shown acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening, but "when" remains vague (dusk, then "weeks," then "hours," then unspecified night). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural, yet no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—the carver "realizes" the shape of grief and sits in stillness, but no choice is made, no path foreclosed, and no visible cost paid. The ending recounts her insight and emotional state without dramatizing a before/after shift. Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the closure unit makes a felt or conceptual price legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly anchored with tropical plants, headstones, and lunar glow, filtered through the carver's professional POV. Spatial choreography remains clear across the scene. The setting provides atmosphere and frames the butterfly arrival, which charges the final image, but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the carver works, then stops, then sits. The greenhouse functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover the shape of collective grief"—is signaled late (mid-story) and remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the carver finishes her work, the mentor nods approval, butterflies arrive, and she sits in stillness. The "discovery" is recounted as a realization ("she realized") without agency, renunciation, or a trade-off that forecloses a path. Escalation is absent; pressure does not cohere or grow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—collective grief, beauty in death, life/death cycles—emerges through the butterflies, ribbon custom, and poem fragments, avoiding overt moralizing until the penultimate line ("loss was a part of life, but that it was not the only part"). The final image of butterflies and the poem's whisper carries resonance, but the carver's "discovery" is asserted rather than dramatized, and the shape of grief remains a generic abstraction. The theme threads through particulars yet resolves into a tidy summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, meditative texture—"thundering calm," "serene gloom"—that modulates with emotional beats. Psychic distance widens for reflection and tightens for sensory moments (breeze, scent, butterfly wings). However, elevated diction ("spectral figure materialized," "intricate web of life and death") drifts into generic literary register rather than the carver's particular idiom, and the narrator's perceptual signature remains indistinct under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally with lyric phrasing and purposeful paragraph structure. However, paraphrase loops appear: "sense of peace settle over her" recurs twice within three paragraphs; "the carver felt" and "the carver smiled" are repeated stems. Stock metaphors—"turning of a great wheel," "intricate web of life and death"—dull specificity in peak beats. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") cluster in the second half without voice motivation. Clarity remains high, but information density sags in the closing third where summary replaces scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Gravestone carver, spectral mentor, and butterfly migration offer a fresh synthesis, yet the emotional arc—grief processed through nature's beauty and a mentor's wisdom—follows a familiar template without transformation. The "shape of collective grief" remains an abstraction never made specific through lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's lyric stillness and whispered poem feel inevitable given the setup, but the insight is told rather than discovered through causality, reducing ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The carver is present throughout and her role shapes the setting, but her choices do not create key turns. She finishes work, retrieves ribbon, recites a poem, and sits—actions without consequence or trade-off. The "discovery" is recounted as realization, not decision. Present and functional, yet swappable with another contemplative artisan.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ribbon roll appears once mid-story, is unraveled, and prompts a poem fragment, then disappears. It does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain a choice. Functional in one beat, but replaceable with any keepsake without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is present on the page: the mentor materializes, nods approval twice, and urges the carver to "retrace." This shapes one beat (mentor's presence prompts reflection) and contributes to the lyric tone, but does not change options or tactics—the carver's insight would unfold similarly without the ghost. Present in setup, middle, and implied at the end, yet causal pressure is mild.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" appears as a label in the opening line and is never dramatized. No on-page action shows the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Retrace" is mentioned once when the spectral mentor urges the carver "to retrace the steps that had led her to this moment." This prompts reflection but does not drive a turn or redefine options. The carver's subsequent insight is asserted, not causally linked to retracing. Present and thematically consistent, but swappable with "reflect" or "remember" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The family custom of trading poems is mentioned once mid-story as backstory context for the ribbon and poem fragment. It does not shape an attempt, constrain a choice, or return at closure. Present in one reflective beat, but replaceable with any inherited ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk frames the entire scene, supplies the tropical plants and headstones that anchor atmosphere, and hosts the butterfly arrival that charges the final image. Spatial details—mist, fading light, lunar glow—modulate with emotional beats. The setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics, but it is indispensable to tone and the closure image of butterflies clustering around flowers and headstones. Present in setup, middle, and payoff with strong specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The butterfly migration timeframe ("weeks," "hours passed," "night wore on") is mentioned but never tightens decisions or alters tactics. The carver sits "lost in thought" as time passes, with no clock pressure. Present as thematic context, but does not constrain action or shape the ending causally.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation to "discover the shape of collective grief" is stated mid-story and recurs at the climax ("she had finally discovered"). However, the discovery is told as a realization, not dramatized through conflicted choices or friction between wants and costs. The desire is present and named, but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is named once in the middle ("a thundering calm that was both powerful and serene") and the tone is sustained through lyric diction, measured pacing, and the carver's stillness. The oxymoron modulates with the arrival of insight and the butterflies' gentle dance, charging the final image of silence and whispered poem. Coherent and purposeful, yet the tone remains static rather than escalating with pressure.</comment>
