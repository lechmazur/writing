<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria remains a label rather than a living character; her motivation to "pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. The "elective exile" backstory and "nostalgia ban" worldbuilding are told without anchoring her present stance or forcing trade-offs. Interiority relies on generic abstractions ("sense of unity," "purpose and belonging") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she simply dances, succeeds, and departs with "peace."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear spatial frame (twilight garden) and names a goal (cosmic verse), but no causal linkage drives the sequence: Aria stands, touches the moonstone, dances, and finds the verse "etched on her skin" without obstacle, reversal, or cost. The "spontaneously anchored" hand and glowing dust speck are inert descriptions that do not narrow options or alter tactics. The ending declares success and emotional shift ("weight of her elective exile lifting") without on-page evidence of what was risked or foreclosed. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost is legible; the closure reads as wish-fulfillment summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The twilight garden, ocean, and stars are anchored early with sensory detail (night flowers, lapping waves), but the setting remains postcard decoration rather than constraint or resource. The moonstone cabochon and weathered stone are named yet never used to complicate or enable choice. "Obsidian grace" appears as a metaphor for movement without spatial consequence. The environment does not tighten decisions or charge the final image; Aria moves through it unimpeded.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The stated goal—to capture cosmic essence in art—faces no on-page opposition, trade-off, or cost. Aria's dance proceeds without reversal or tightening; the verse simply appears "etched on her skin" as a reward for completion. The "nostalgia ban" is mentioned as backstory but does not complicate her present action. Agency is absent: no decision alters tactics, no credible loss shapes the outcome. Pressure remains flat; escalation does not occur under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of cosmic interconnectedness and artistic transcendence is stated directly ("observing gaps," "unity with the universe") rather than emerging from specific choices or images. The final paragraph moralizes the lesson ("power of art to transcend") in place of resonant action. The moonstone's glow and the verse on skin are symbolic gestures without causal weight or cost. No counter-reading or complexity is offered; the ending resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or earned wisdom from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but the narrative voice defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("elective exile," "cosmic verse," "obsidian grace") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Interiority relies on generic constructions: "felt an inexplicable connection," "knew that she had to fledge." No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is absent; Aria's way of noticing is indistinguishable from a neutral observer. Psychic distance is consistent but uninflected by stress or embodied state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "tranquility of the surroundings seep into her bones" → "serene and isolated haven"; "dance became a form of poetry" → "movements were infused with an obsidian grace"; multiple sentences repeat "Aria knew" or "Aria felt." Template cadence runs: "She had always been…," "And when she…," "As she…" open consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("canvas of stars," "swirling vortex") and abstraction ("essence of the universe," "sense of unity") dull momentum. The final third recycles "Aria knew" three times without new information. Apply artifact penalty −1.2 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per patterned-artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—artist in mystical setting seeks cosmic inspiration—follows a familiar template without fresh inflection. The "nostalgia ban" worldbuilding detail is mentioned but not transformed into specific constraint or conflict. The moonstone, dance, and verse-on-skin are generic mystical trappings easily swapped for similar props. No bold structural or perspectival choice heightens stakes; the arc proceeds predictably from intent to success without risk or earned surprise. Emotional specificity is absent; the piece reads as a median execution of a stock premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Aria is named early and present throughout, but her role as "skilled tide dancer" is label-only; no on-page choice creates a turn. She stands, dances, and succeeds without obstacle. The trait does not constrain or enable action with cost. Setup present, middle and closure are observational only; no causal pressure or specificity. Cap at 2.8 (missing closure participation as decision); apply −0.4 for ornamental use and label-only trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears early, is touched mid-scene ("hand became spontaneously anchored"), and glows at the end, satisfying three beats. However, the object is passively described; Aria does not use it to solve a problem or face a cost tied to its properties. The glow "imbues her with its essence" without specific consequence. Present in closure image but not causally active. Two beats + closure mention = eligible ~5.0; subtract −0.8 for swappability (any talisman would serve) and −0.5 for ornamental closure cameo; round to 3.6, but the "spontaneously anchored" beat reads as summary rather than dramatized action, lowering further. Final: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elective exile is established early as backstory ("having left behind the bustle of city life") and the ending declares "the weight of her elective exile lifting." The concept frames her presence but does not constrain a present choice or create friction; she dances freely without consequence from her exile status. The nostalgia ban (tied to exile motivation) is mentioned but does not alter tactics. Setup + thematic closure = two gates; lyric reprise eligible ~5.5–6.0, but no middle development or causal pressure. Apply −0.6 for late payoff that does not transform prior material and −0.5 for summary-only resolution. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development); final 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" appears once mid-scene when Aria's hand is drawn to the moonstone "as if by an unseen force." The text states "This was not the first time," but no on-page cost or constraint follows; she continues dancing unimpeded. The attribute is told rather than shown through consequence. Setup present but no middle development or closure use. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle); apply −0.8 for label-only mention and −0.5 for summary. Final: 2.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Fledge" appears once in narration: "Aria knew that she had to fledge—to take the leap and allow herself to be guided by her intuition. She began to dance." The action is the initiation of the dance, central to the arc, but the term itself is metaphorical and swappable (she could "surrender," "commit," "begin" without structural loss). The dance drives multiple beats and closure, but "fledge" as a specific verb is ornamental. Setup + development + closure via dance = three gates; eligible ≥6.1. Subtract −1.2 for high swappability (the dance matters, the label does not) and −0.8 for metaphorical use without embodied cost tied to the term. Final: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"By observing gaps—the spaces between the stars, the silence between the waves" is named once mid-scene as a method that grants Aria "a sense of unity." The mechanics are not dramatized; no prior attempt fails, and the method does not shape a tactical choice or cost. It appears as thematic statement rather than enacted process. Setup present, but no middle development or closure use. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle); apply −0.8 for ornamental mention and −0.5 for summary-only. Final: 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The twilight garden under stars is established in the opening line and anchors all action; Aria dances there and departs at the end. The setting supplies atmosphere (night flowers, ocean, stars) but does not constrain choice or provide resources that alter outcome—she moves freely without spatial consequence. The final image includes the garden as backdrop. Setup + closure presence = two gates; lyric reprise eligible ~5.5–6.0. No middle development where setting alters tactics. Postcard description lowers by −0.5; no causal pressure lowers by −0.4. Strong setup and closure anchor lift slightly. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The nostalgia ban is mentioned twice: it "had been enacted years ago" and "driven Aria to this place of exile," and it "had also freed her to explore new ways." The timeframe provides context but does not tighten present decisions; no clock or urgency shapes her dance or departure. The ban is backstory without present-tense cost. Setup present as backstory, but no middle beat where it constrains action, and closure does not invoke it. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle); apply −0.6 for vague backstory use and −0.4 for no on-page pressure. Final: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"To pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin" is stated early as Aria's motivation, repeated mid-scene, and fulfilled at the end when "the verse was there, etched on her skin." The desire frames the action but is never conflicted or tested; no trade-off or friction emerges between wanting the verse and the cost of obtaining it. The goal drives the dance (one beat) and closure, but the path is frictionless. Setup + development + closure = three gates; eligible ≥6.1. Subtract −0.8 for told-only motivation without dramatized conflict and −0.5 for wish-fulfillment resolution with no visible cost. Final: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" appears once mid-scene to describe Aria's movements: "infused with an obsidian grace, a fluidity and darkness." The phrase is metaphorical descriptor rather than modulating tonal texture; the surrounding prose remains elevated and abstract throughout without shift under pressure. Tone is static rather than responsive to escalation. Setup present as single mention, but no development or closure charge. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle); apply −0.5 for ornamental metaphor and −0.3 for single static mood. Final: 4.1.</comment>
