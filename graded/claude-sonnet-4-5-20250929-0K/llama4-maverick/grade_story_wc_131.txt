<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dweller remains a noble archetype without internal contradiction or competing impulses. Motivation is declared ("to become visible") but never tested against cost—no moment where visibility conflicts with safety or solitude. The sensory memory from the tape fragment feels ornamental rather than a choice-altering recognition. Interiority relies on summary labels ("kindly methodical soul," "eyes shining with soft light") instead of embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: gathering fragments and arranging treasures to invite discovery. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, no decisive change, renunciation, or charged poise occurs on the page—the dweller's final disappearance mirrors the opening routine without foreclosing a path or reweighting the dominant stake. The ending asserts mythic presence ("whispered rumor") but does not dramatize a cost or consequence that reconfigures the dweller's options or the library's reality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Pipe chases, emergency lights, and hidden shelves are signaled early and recur with specificity. The tape reel fragment constrains one beat (the memory trigger) but does not alter a subsequent choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The "sapphire hush" and flickering lights charge atmosphere but do not pressure a decision at closure, keeping the setting functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—becoming visible—is declared but never tested. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the dweller's work proceeds without resistance, loss, or adaptation. The city lights return, patrons arrive, treasures are noticed, all confirming the dweller's intent without friction. Agency requires foreclosing a path with cost; here the protagonist observes and arranges without consequence, yielding outline-like progression.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of hidden presence and the desire to be seen emerges from repeated imagery. However, the ending defaults to meta-assertion ("their story was one of sense memory, of hidden worlds, and of the power of being seen") rather than letting the final image reweight prior material. The sense-memory beat with the tape reel offers a glimpse of complexity but remains decorative, not integrated into a thematic turn or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds throughout with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("whispered promise," "beacon in the sapphire hush") that reads more lyric than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature remains generic—"eyes lit up," "soft smile"—without idiosyncratic detail that grounds the dweller's way of noticing. The voice is coherent but lacks the specificity and rhythmic control required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Heavy reliance on paraphrase loops ("hidden treasures" recurs five times; "shadows" and "hidden" appear in adjacent lines without added pressure) and template cadence ("The dweller's eyes..., The dweller's hands..., The dweller smiled"). Stock metaphors cluster in the final third: "beacon," "gentle breeze," "stars." Filter-verb stacks ("began to," "seemed to") appear in mid-pressure beats. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The premise—library dweller preparing clues for discovery—follows a familiar "hidden helper" template without transformation through specific world logic or moral calculus. The tape reel fragment and pipe chases offer concrete detail but do not recombine into a non-obvious synthesis. The ending's assertion of mythic presence retreats from risk rather than pursuing a bold inflection point. Emotional generality ("hope," "being seen") replaces particular stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and drives routine actions (uncovering passages, arranging discoveries). However, no key turn results from a dweller choice under pressure; all actions proceed without friction or cost. Observation and arrangement dominate; decision-making is absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced in the second third, handled in one extended beat (discovery, scent memory), then cached as a talisman. Returns at closure via mention on the hidden shelf but is not reweighted or causally active there. The fragment enables the sense-memory moment but does not constrain a later choice or charge the final image beyond static presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The tape reel triggers one vivid memory (child's laughter, summer day, wooden planks) that transports the dweller. This beat deepens interiority momentarily but does not alter tactics, stakes, or the dweller's subsequent actions. Sense memory remains thematic decoration rather than a mechanism that changes options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" appears as a label in the opening; methodical work (careful uncovering, arranging) is shown. However, no scene dramatizes a tradeoff where kindness or method constrains a choice or imposes cost. The trait exists as character summary without friction or consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Caching drives the dweller's routine from the start and anchors the final tableau (hidden shelf with arranged treasures). The action is signaled early, recurs across multiple beats, and culminates in the closure image. However, the cache does not face a challenge or alter the dweller's options; it proceeds without resistance, making it essential to structure but not to dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Pipe chases are named early and recur as the dweller's workspace. The method of uncovering passages is signaled and shown (tools, hidden compartments). However, the mechanics remain generic—no specific constraint or discovery alters tactics. The method supports setting but does not shape a key turn or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn frames the entire piece, provides spatial anchors (pipe chases, shelves, hidden recesses), and charges atmosphere with emergency lights and flickering. The setting enables the dweller's routine and the patrons' eventual arrival. However, no environmental constraint forces a choice or alters outcome; the library remains backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The outage and flickering lights are mentioned at the start and resolved mid-story ("city's lights flickered back to life"). This transition marks a shift in the dweller's urgency ("newfound sense of urgency") but does not create a live clock or deadline that alters tactics. Time remains loosely tracked without causal pressure on decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The desire to become visible is stated explicitly ("driven by a deep-seated motivation") and shapes the dweller's arrangement of treasures for patrons to discover. However, this want is never dramatized in conflict with another impulse or cost—no moment where visibility risks exposure or safety. Motivation exists as intention without friction or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears twice, framing the city's awakening and the dweller's presence. The tone remains consistent—quiet, reverent, gentle—but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image beyond static atmosphere. The phrase feels decorative rather than purposefully tied to a turn or emotional escalation.</comment>
