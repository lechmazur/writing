<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Zephyr remains a label throughout—"pioneering," "steadily curious," "irreverent awe"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The "mechanical heart" moment at closure arrives unearned by prior interiority that would make such a sensation legible. Internal experience is summarized ("Zephyr felt an odd sense of wonder") rather than dramatized through perception and action under pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path; the bell-ringing is declared successful without trade-off or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive immediately, satisfying the test. However, closure lacks on-page cost: Zephyr "grasps" the algorithm and rings the bell, but no prior option is foreclosed, no tactic altered, no felt price paid. The piece summarizes an odyssey ("Throughout the evolution") rather than dramatizing escalation through because/therefore linkage. The ending asserts harmony and belonging without a visible or conceptual reweighting that makes a before/after legible with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop and acid sea are vividly named and recur throughout, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics. The kaleidoscope and arrow tip function as static props rather than tools that shape Zephyr's attempts. Sensory detail (churning acid, noxious clouds, glinting edge) remains decorative, filtered through summary ("odd sense of wonder") rather than immediate perception that pressures a decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake (ring the unheard bell) is signaled early but never tested; no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. Zephyr's "transliteration efforts" and "determination" are asserted without dramatized failure, adaptation, or visible price. The resolution is convenient—algorithm understood, bell rung—without protagonist agency that forecloses a live alternative. Pressure remains flat across the accumulative structure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme (curiosity, yearning, harmony through understanding) is stated rather than earned through particulars. The arrow tip and kaleidoscope recur but do not shift meaning at closure; they remain ornamental. The final paragraph moralizes ("testament to the power of curiosity," "boundless potential") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext is absent; epiphanies are declared without specific struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance and no head-hopping. However, diction often drifts into elevated register incongruent with a mechanical cart glider's perceptual signature ("caustic backdrop to Zephyr's odyssey," "imbuing her with a deeper sense of purpose"). Sentence stems recur ("As she…," "With each…," "Throughout the evolution…") creating template cadence. Perceptual specificity is thin; what a cart glider notices is told, not shown through idiosyncratic filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "As she examined…," "As she turned…," "As the acid sea churned…," "As the workshop evolved…" across multiple paragraphs. Paraphrase loops appear ("steadily curious" restated; "yearning algorithm" repeated without added detail). Stock metaphors ("sharp and piercing, cutting through the complexity") and filter-verb stacks ("began to ponder," "decided to transliterate," "felt an odd sense") dull immediacy in peak beats. Synonym churn ("pioneering," "steadfast," "unyielding") substitutes for concrete action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise (sentient cart glider seeks understanding in a steampunk workshop) is functional but derivative, closely matching template quest-for-knowledge arcs. No fresh inflection transforms the material; the emotional arc (curiosity → understanding → belonging) could be transplanted to any setting with minor edits. The acid sea and kaleidoscope are vivid but ornamental; neither introduces a non-obvious moral calculus or constraint that makes the ending feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Zephyr is named early and present throughout, but her "choices" are summarized ("decided to transliterate") rather than dramatized with visible alternatives and cost. She observes and ponders without on-page decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. The bell-ringing at closure is declared, not shown as a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The arrow tip appears in paragraph three ("particularly fascinated by a hunter's arrow tip") and returns in the final third as a symbolic relic, but it is never handled, used, or made to constrain a choice. Two mentions do not constitute two beats; the second is a thematic echo without causal work. It does not shape the closure image or alter Zephyr's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The yearning algorithm is named early and recurs as the object of Zephyr's study, shaping the plot's direction. However, its mechanics remain abstract; it does not constrain or enable specific on-page actions with visible cost. The algorithm is more theme label than causal pressure. Present in the closure ("grasped the yearning algorithm's essence") but without demonstrating how its rules alter options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" appears as a label in the opening and recurs ("steadily curious presence" at the end), but the trait does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. Curiosity is asserted, not shown through a micro-choice where curiosity conflicts with another need. Label-only use without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>Transliteration is introduced in paragraph six and recurs as Zephyr's method, shaping the middle of the story. However, the process is summarized ("painstaking," "yielded a hidden pattern") rather than dramatized with attempts, failures, or adaptations. It does not drive a key turn; the bell-ringing at closure could occur without this exact action with minor rewording.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>The kaleidoscope is named in paragraph six and used for transliteration ("turned the kaleidoscope's handle"), appearing in one functional beat. It recurs as a thematic motif ("echoed the kaleidoscope's symmetries") but does not shape attempts or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Present in middle development but swappable with another decoding device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop and acid sea are introduced immediately, anchor the setting throughout, and recur in the closure paragraph ("gears-and-cogs machinery continued to whir"). However, neither pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome; they remain atmospheric backdrop. The workshop's "beauty and complexity" is declared, not shown constraining Zephyr's tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Throughout the evolution" is asserted in the opening and repeated as a refrain, but time remains vague and untracked. No deadline tightens decisions; the passage of time is told ("steadily," "slowly revealing itself") without dramatizing how duration alters tactics or raises stakes. The timeframe is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The motivation to ring the unheard bell is signaled in paragraph eight and recurs as the stated goal, shaping the plot's direction. However, desire is told ("driven by her vision") rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No on-page friction between the want and a competing cost; the bell-ringing succeeds without visible sacrifice. Present in closure but without felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Irreverent awe" is named in paragraph eleven and recurs ("irreverent awe for the mysteries she had uncovered"), but tone remains static and asserted rather than modulated through pressure. The diction is consistently elevated and distant, lacking irreverence in voice or syntax. The phrase charges neither the closure image nor the perceptual signature; it reads as a label rather than an embodied stance.</comment>
