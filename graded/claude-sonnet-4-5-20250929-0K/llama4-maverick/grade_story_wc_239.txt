<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aria exists as a label collection ("end of history witness") rather than a dramatized consciousness. Interiority consists of abstract purpose statements ("to unify the fragmented truths") without embodied emotion, contradictory impulses, or micro-choices under pressure. The "journey inward and outward" is told as concept, never shown through on-page tension between competing wants. No genuine cost or renunciation materializes; she simply completes her task and returns.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed well past 120 words; "the heart of the ancient temple library lost in time" provides no spatial or temporal anchor, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty. The piece reads as accumulative/textural in ambition but lacks a legible closure unit with cost: Aria closes the dictionary and re-enters, but no before/after change in options or meaning is dramatized. "Cosmic illusions unraveled" and "universe restored" are asserted without on-page proof. The structure loops through paraphrase ("the witness had done her work," "the true treasure lay in the understanding") rather than tightening toward a decisive image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The temple library is sketched with stock gothic imagery ("shelves that stretched like sentinels," "scent of aged parchment") that does not constrain a single choice. Spatial choreography is vague: Aria steps "out into the temple's surroundings" and later "re-entered the temple" without legible geography. The dictionary appears as a prop in multiple beats but its physical state never alters tactics or charges the final image, remaining ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition, scarcity, or competing good forces a choice with visible cost. The "universe's hiccup" is a convenience event that begins and resolves off-stage; Aria's walking and reading face no friction. The ending asserts success ("distortions cleared") without showing a single live option foreclosed or a tactic altered by prior pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Thematic statements proliferate in the final third ("the power of the human spirit," "potential for change," "guardian of the threshold") rather than emerging from enacted particulars. "Spiral arbitration" remains an abstract concept never dramatized as a lived method with cost. The dictionary, "hiccup," and temple do not accumulate into a resonant final image; instead the last paragraphs mechanically restate the opening labels. No non-literal answer to a central question lands; the piece summarizes its thesis rather than enacting it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable but carries no perceptual signature; diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("guardian of the threshold between the ages," "melody that echoed through eternity") inconsistent with a lone figure's lived thought. Sentence stems recur: "As she…" opens seven paragraphs, flattening rhythm. The narrator withholds no knowledge but also reveals none; Aria's interior is a glossary of cosmic concepts rather than a mind under pressure. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the witness had done her work" / "Aria's unwavering dedication to her task" / "the end of history witness remained" recycle the same claim across six lines. Template cadence dominates the middle third with "As she [verb]" openings. Stock metaphors ("dance upon the walls," "beacon in the darkness") and therapy-speak abstraction ("clarity she sought," "cosmic harmony") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the −0.3 to −0.7 overwriting penalty. These artifacts touch the closure paragraphs, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The core premise—mystic solves cosmic imbalance through reflective ritual—follows a widely-used template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Prompt labels ("end of history witness," "spiral arbitration") function as faux-specificity rather than earned synthesis. The "journey inward while walking out" is stated but never dramatized with a cost-trade that would make it irreplaceable. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges into abstraction and declares resolution rather than enacting a turn that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Aria as "end of history witness" appears throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses an option. She reads, walks, closes the book, and re-enters; each action is asserted without friction or cost. The role is a thematic label rather than a causal engine. Present but ornamental; swappable with "guardian" or "seeker" without structural change. Late arrivals and summary-only use cap at 2.8; lack of middle beat involvement and causal pressure lower further.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The softcover dictionary is handled in three beats: Aria holds it while reading (para 3–5), it accompanies her walk (para 11), and she closes and shelves it at the end (para 19, 23). Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4. However, it never constrains a choice or evolves in meaning; it provides "the lexicon of the universe" as static metaphor. No causal pressure, no closure linkage where it reweights the image, and easily swappable with "tome" or "codex." Functional but replaceable. Caps: swappability −0.4 to −0.8, ornamental use −0.5 to −1.0, no closure participation cap at 2.8 — the combination holds the score near 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Spiral arbitration" is named once (para 4) as "a method of resolving cosmic discord" and echoed thematically in para 14–15 ("spiral arbitration…became a lived experience") without dramatization. It does not shape a single on-page stake or tactic. Label-only, summary invocation, and no closure participation cap at 2.8; ornamental presence and swappability lower further to 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.5</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" appears once (para 5) as a descriptor for Aria's eyes with no on-page action enabled or constrained by the trait. No cost, no beat involvement, no closure link. Label-only mention −0.3, late first appearance (second third) −0.2 to −0.5, ornamental −0.5 to −1.0, and no closure participation cap at 2.8. The combination yields ~1.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Unify" is Aria's stated goal (para 6) and recurs as resolution claim (para 14–15, 26). It does not drive a major turn; no action labeled "unify" changes options on the page. She walks, reads, and declares success; the unification is told, not shown through a choice with visible cost. Present across beats +0.9, but summary-only −0.4 to −0.8 and swappable with "restore" or "harmonize" −0.4 to −0.8 cap functional reach near 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Journeying inward while walking out" is introduced in para 7 and enacted in para 8–13 as simultaneous physical walk and introspection. It signals early +0.3, spans multiple beats +0.9, but its mechanics never impose a cost or alter a tactic—Aria simply does both without friction. No causal pressure and no closure participation (she re-enters without the method recharging the image) cap at 2.8; decorative presence lowers slightly to ~2.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is seeded in para 1, revisited in para 18 ("rediscovered"), and present in the framing (para 1, 22–23, 28). Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4. It provides atmosphere but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; Aria walks out and back in with no spatial pressure. Micro-setting (the dictionary on the shelf) is static. Functional but replaceable setting; no causal pressure and ornamental use −0.5 to −1.0 hold the score near 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The "universe's hiccup" is named in para 9, recurs in para 16–17, 20, and 25, providing a time frame. Early signal +0.3, four beats +1.4. However, it does not tighten decisions or track as a live clock; it begins, Aria walks and reads, then it "faded" off-stage. No causal pressure tied to urgency, and the timeframe is vague rather than constraining. Present across beats but decorative; no closure participation cap at 2.8 plus slight credit for recurrence yields ~2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to unravel cosmic illusions" is stated in para 5–6 and recurs in para 20, 27. Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4. Yet the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or a cost-trade on the page; Aria pursues it without friction. Told-only invocation −0.4 to −0.8 and swappable with "restore balance" −0.4 to −0.8. Functional presence but no friction between want and cost holds the score near 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" and "silence" recur in para 12–13, 19–20, 27. Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4. Tone remains static rather than modulating with pressure; the same solemn register persists from opening to close. The final image ("silence, her story became a testament") echoes the midpoint without reweighting. Coherent but one-note, trending mid-band. No closure charge beyond repetition and decorative presence lower slightly to ~4.3.</comment>
