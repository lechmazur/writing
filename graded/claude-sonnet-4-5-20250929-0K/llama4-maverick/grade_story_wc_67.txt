<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lena's role as "charcoal portrait ash scatterer" functions as label-only; her interiority consists of abstract philosophical musings ("pondering the concept of safety") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The piece tells us she "feels an inexplicable connection" and "finds herself drawn" but never dramatizes contradictory impulses or a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Eli appears briefly to deliver exposition, applying no immediate pressure that forces Lena's stance to crystallize.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, no meaningful escalation occurs: Lena observes, Eli explains, Lena scatters ash, then departs—each beat is additive narration without a tightening that narrows options or changes knowledge. The ending offers only summary reflection ("comes to realize that the true value of art lies…") rather than an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. The inferred lens (Accumulative/Textural) never crystallizes pressure or delivers closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vanishing point gallery is named and the mask's "powder-coated surface of the frame" supplies tactile detail, but setting functions primarily as backdrop. The charcoal and powder return at the scattering beat, where Lena "powders the remaining charcoal"—a concrete action that charges the final image with ephemeral texture. Spatial choreography (Lena before the portrait, Eli approaching) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lena's relationship to transient art—is signaled early but never tested by a choice with cost. She performs her role without friction, and the conversation with Eli is exposition rather than a pressure point. No reversal, tightening, or credible loss alters tactics; the scattering itself is ritual completion, not a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "mirage of safety" appears as a label in narration and again in summary: "The memory…stays with her, a poignant reminder of the mirage of safety." The mask and scattering supply concrete images, but the piece never dramatizes an earned epiphany—Lena's final realization is stated rather than discovered through on-page struggle. The theme is asserted, not emergent from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and perceptual filtering ("her eyes fixed," "Lena notices") is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("pervades our lives," "acknowledging the transience") that exceeds immediate perception. Eli's dialogue ("I wanted to crystallize a fleeting emotion") reads as thematic ventriloquism rather than goal-driven speech. No head-hopping, but voice lacks idiosyncrasy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "Lena's gaze lingers…seems to weave truth…eyes appear to hold…Lena finds herself drawn" restates attraction across four consecutive sentences. Template stems ("As she…," "As they speak…," "As she turns…") appear in five paragraphs. The phrase "somber" appears four times, "fleeting" twice in adjacent beats—synonym churn without added pressure. Artifacts touch the final-third summary, disallowing 9+ globally and triggering −1.2 in Q7 for spread and closure proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "charcoal portrait ash scatterer" occupation is inventive on the surface, but the premise—reflecting on art's impermanence—remains a familiar meditation executed without fresh moral calculus or non-obvious synthesis. The mask, rocking chair, and powder are present but do not transform trope material. Middle-ground choices (somber tone, gentle artist, respectful scatterer) avoid bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lena observes, listens, and performs her scattering role, but makes no choice that alters tactics or stakes. Present throughout, yet decisions are absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The mask appears in the opening description, is discussed briefly with Eli, and recurs in the penultimate paragraph as "a poignant reminder." Two touches across the arc, but no evolving use or causal pressure—Lena never handles it or allows it to constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Named twice in narration ("the mirage of safety") as a thematic label. Does not shape on-page stakes, alter Lena's options, or force a trade-off. Ornamental concept claim.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears once as description of the mask's construction. No action or cost tied to this attribute; label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Powders the remaining charcoal" is the central action of the scattering beat and supplies tactile specificity to the closure image. Present in two beats (frame description, scattering), but the act does not redefine prior options—it completes a ritual Lena intended from the start.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Eli explains "I achieved this through incomplete information, leaving some aspects…to the viewer's interpretation." Mentioned once in dialogue as artistic method, not as mechanics that shape Lena's attempts or constrain her understanding on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The vanishing point gallery is named in the opening line and provides spatial continuity. Its "unique perspective and carefully curated exhibits" is told rather than shown, and it does not supply resources or obstacles that alter Lena's choices—backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"As the old rocking chair finally slows to a stop" appears only in the opening line. No live clock, no time pressure on decisions, no return. Ornamental timeframe cue.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To crystallize a fleeting emotion" is Eli's stated motivation in dialogue and echoes Lena's appreciation for transience. Present in two beats (Eli's explanation, Lena's final reflection), but never dramatized as conflicted desire with on-page friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Somber" appears four times, "marvel" twice; tone is consistent across the arc and modulates slightly at the scattering beat, where delicate tactile language charges the image. Coherent but static—no turn in register that corresponds to escalation, as escalation itself is absent.</comment>
