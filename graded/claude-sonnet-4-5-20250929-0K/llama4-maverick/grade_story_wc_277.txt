<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Adelaide remains a label-only construct throughout: "devotedly observant," "solemn playfulness," and her investigative resolve are asserted but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied choice under pressure. The rosewood pen nib functions as a passive talisman rather than constraining her tactics. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("orbits of regret," "web of logic") without character-particular texture or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final smile and knowledge that she is "one step closer" lacks visible cost or renunciation; no path is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early, but causality remains outline-sequential: Adelaide receives a call, ponders using proof by contradiction, then descends with renewed determination—no because/therefore linkage tightens options. The "proof by contradiction" method is declared but never applied on the page; no assumption is tested, no contradiction surfaces to alter her stance. Closure is a Charged Poise attempt (she smiles, knowing truth is within grasp), but no visible or felt cost is legible in the final image; the descent into mist is atmospheric rather than a reconfiguration of prior stakes. The piece reads as setup without a turn that narrows options or changes knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The observatory above clouds is vividly sketched with mist, echoing silence, and swirling clouds, and the rosewood pen nib receives texture ("exquisite," "passed down through generations"). However, the setting does not constrain a choice: Adelaide picks up the pen, ponders, and descends without the environment pressuring her tactics or altering available moves. The clouds and mist function as mood rather than spatial or physical factors that shape outcome. Micro-setting (the pen nib on the console) is present but does not charge the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the scandal and freeing the family from "orbits of regret"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: Adelaide begins determined to intervene and ends equally determined, with no dramatized obstacle, miscalculation, or trade-off. The journalist's allegations are referenced but never tested; "proof by contradiction" is declared as a method yet no assumption is overturned on the page. Agency is intention without cost; the final descent and smile assert progress but do not foreclose a path or demonstrate a visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus legacy-burden emerges through recurring imagery (mist, orbits of regret, the pen nib as heirloom), and the piece attempts a conceptual arc from secrecy to transparency. However, "orbits of regret" and "solemn playfulness" function as ornamental labels rather than earned through specific events. The final image—Adelaide smiling as mist swallows her—gestures toward resonance but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; the pen nib's "otherworldly light" is asserted symbolism without dramatized cost. The thematic question is posed but not answered through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and diction ("newsprint heiress," "web of logic") aims for a heightened register consistent with the observatory setting. However, perceptual signature is generic: phrases like "eyes, devotedly observant" and "solemn playfulness" are external descriptions rather than character-specific ways of noticing. The prose treats Adelaide's internal state as summary ("her mind whirling," "felt an odd sense of calm") without embedding thought in embodied perception. Psychic distance shifts are minimal; the voice reads as neutral narration rather than filtered through Adelaide's particular consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster densely: "hidden truths" appears three times, "orbits of regret" four times, and "the truth" / "uncover the truth" recur without added pressure. Template cadence dominates the final third with repeated "As she…" and "With…" sentence openers across eight consecutive paragraphs, flattening rhythm. Stock metaphors ("web of logic," "catalyst for change," "beacon of truth") and filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "saw") dull immediacy in peak beats. Figurative language in most sentences of the descent sequence ("clouds swirling in tandem," "glimmer of a new path," "otherworldly light") remains decorative rather than pattern-taught. Baseline −1.2 for loops and template runs; −0.3 for filter stacks; artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—heiress using logical method to investigate family scandal—is functional but closely templates the "legacy heir confronts institutional secrets" plot without fresh inflection. "Proof by contradiction" as a mathematical method offers specificity but is never demonstrated on the page, reducing it to label. The rosewood pen nib as mystical heirloom ("power to reveal deepest regrets," "otherworldly light") invokes familiar artifact tropes without transformation through lived use. Emotional truth is asserted ("solemn playfulness," "orbits of regret") rather than earned through specific, non-obvious synthesis. No turn or final image grows inevitably from prior particulars; the descent into mist reads as atmospheric closure rather than a risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Adelaide is present throughout and narrates her determination to intervene, but her choices do not create key turns: she receives the call, picks up the pen nib, ponders, and descends with the same resolve. Observation ("devotedly observant") is declared but not dramatized in a decision that alters tactics. Her agency is intention without on-page cost or reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The rosewood pen nib appears in two beats: Adelaide picks it up and feels calm (mid-story), then clutches it during her descent and it "seemed to glow" (ending). However, its use is passive—she holds it while thinking—and its "power to reveal deepest regrets" is asserted but never demonstrated. The object does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it functions as symbolic ornament rather than a tool with evolving meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Orbits of regret" is mentioned four times as a thematic label for the family legacy but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Adelaide's goal is to break free from this pattern, yet no dramatized regret or cyclical behavior is shown; the concept remains metaphorical rather than a constraint that alters her options or costs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Devotedly observant" is stated twice as a trait ("eyes, devotedly observant") but never enables or constrains an on-page action. Adelaide's observation does not reveal a key detail, force a tradeoff, or narrow her choices; the attribute is label-only without visible cost or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intervene" is the stated goal early ("Adelaide was determined to intervene") and frames her decision to investigate the journalist's claims. The action shapes the initial turn—she moves from passive heiress to active investigator—but the intervention itself is not dramatized on the page; no attempt, obstacle, or consequence is shown. The ending references her readiness but does not trace major turns to the act of intervening.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Proof by contradiction" is named mid-story as Adelaide's chosen method and explained in one sentence ("By assuming the opposite of what the journalist claimed, she could test..."). However, the method is never applied: no assumption is stated, no contradiction tested, no result shown. It appears as a label rather than shaping her attempts or altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The "echoing observatory above clouds" is established early with vivid sensory detail (mist, silence, clouds drifting below) and frames the entire scene. The setting supplies the rosewood pen nib on the console and provides atmosphere, but it does not pressure Adelaide's choices or constrain her tactics—she could conduct the same internal reflection anywhere. The descent through clouds at the end uses the setting for symbolic closure but not as a resource or obstacle that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"After the journalist calls" is referenced in the opening paragraph as the inciting event and briefly mentioned again mid-story. The timeframe anchors causality (the call prompts Adelaide to act) but does not tighten decisions—no deadline, urgency, or clock is tracked. The pacing is reflective throughout with no time pressure shaping her tactics or moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To discover hidden truths" is Adelaide's stated motivation, repeated three times, and frames her decision to investigate the scandal and employ proof by contradiction. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices: no friction appears between the want and a competing cost, and no on-page discovery or failed attempt tests her commitment. The motivation remains abstract declaration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Solemn playfulness" is named twice ("solemn playfulness gave way to a sense of purpose," "felt a sense of solemn playfulness") but the tone on the page is uniformly earnest and declarative without playful modulation. Sentence rhythm and diction remain consistent throughout; no tonal shift accompanies turns, and the final image (smiling as mist swallows her) asserts mystery rather than charging the ending with the promised oxymoric quality.</comment>
