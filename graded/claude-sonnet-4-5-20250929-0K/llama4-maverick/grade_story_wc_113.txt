<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Rachel remains passive throughout, experiencing the moment without meaningful contradiction or choice. Her "decision to disrupt the tranquility" by tilting the program lacks consequences or internal resistance—the images simply reveal themselves. The story tells us she's "changed forever" but shows no visible cost or foreclosed path. Interiority consists largely of vague inspiration and observation; no embodied struggle or contradictory impulse drives action under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is established early (orchestra pit, flooded opera house), but no meaningful causal escalation occurs. Rachel discovers the program, tilts it to reveal markings, reads a hidden message, feels peace—each beat simply unfolds without resistance or narrowing options. The "code" resolves itself through water damage without Rachel making a choice that forecloses anything. The ending offers Charged Poise language ("forever changed") but no legible cost or before/after distinction on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and flickering lanterns create vivid atmosphere, and the water lapping against the viola grounds sensory detail. However, the setting remains largely decorative—the flood doesn't constrain Rachel's actions or shape her choices. The program's water damage becomes a plot convenience rather than an environmental pressure that forces tactical adaptation. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment never meaningfully limits or enables the protagonist's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling the maestro's code—is signaled but never tested. No opposition or cost appears; Rachel tilts the program and the images "respond to her actions" without friction. The resolution arrives through passive observation rather than agency. What should be a climactic discovery ("the final words," "a sense of peace") is summarized rather than dramatized, and no option is foreclosed or price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme gestures toward liminal spaces and the boundary between music and silence, but relies heavily on abstract statement rather than earned particulars. The ending's "forever changed" and "magic that lay just beyond the threshold of reality" are asserted rather than demonstrated through specific cost. The program as motif appears repeatedly but doesn't constrain choice or accumulate pressure—it's decorative recurrence without thematic reweighting at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with stable distance and apt psychic positioning. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("liminal areas," "otherworldly glow," "hypnotic") that feels decorative rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; Rachel notices beauty and atmosphere but lacks a distinctive filter. The prose reads competently but without a singular texture that reflects her mind under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops mar momentum: "the music seemed to seep from the very walls" echoes "music and silence" redundantly; "flickered, casting" structure repeats three times; "in between spaces" and "threshold" churn the same concept. Template cadence dominates: "As she [verb]" opens five paragraphs. Stock phrases cluster in peak beats: "otherworldly glow," "haunting and sublime," "forever changed." The ending stacks summary paragraphs that restate Rachel's transformation without fresh information, triggering −1.2 cumulative in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—musician discovers ghostly code in flooded opera house—assembles familiar Gothic and mystery tropes without transformation. The water-damage-as-revelation mechanic offers a fresh detail, but the execution (images simply appear, message is read, peace arrives) follows template steps. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the "wordless conversation with the ghost" remains metaphorical decoration rather than a bold formal choice that heightens stakes.</comment>
