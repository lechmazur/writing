<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elian remains an abstraction throughout—their profession is stated but never manifests in concrete micro-choices under pressure. The "retrocognitively trapped" premise is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied confusion. The character's interaction with the halo fragment is purely receptive; no visible cost or foreclosed path emerges from their choices. Interiority defaults to generic wonder ("exhilarating and terrifying") without character-particular embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words and remains vague (who is Elian beyond a label, where precisely in the garden, what time window). The lens appears accumulative/textural by design, but no meaningful before/after legibility emerges—Elian begins studying hyperbolic geometry and ends studying it, with the fragment's "power" asserted rather than demonstrated through altered options. The closure image (gathering the fragment to weave into a maze) is told intent, not an on-page change with visible cost. The dominant stake—"to discover the texture of time"—is claimed but never tested or narrowed by on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The living bridge garden offers vivid sensory details (chirping birds, blooming flowers, dappled shadows) that establish tone but do not constrain a single choice or alter tactics. The halo fragment is described as crystalline and glowing but functions as a passive prop. Spatial choreography is coherent within a single clearing, and the garden's transformation into "a realm of wonder" is asserted without mechanical grounding. The micro-setting option (the fragment as object-setting) is present but ornamental; it does not force a trade-off or shape the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("discover the texture of time") is signaled early but never escalates or tightens through on-page choice. No reversal or complication arises; the fragment simply "begins to glow" and images grow vivid without Elian taking a risk, making a trade-off, or facing meaningful opposition. The resolution—gathering the fragment to use in future work—is stated intention, not earned consequence. Agency is absent: Elian observes and comprehends but does not act in a way that forecloses a path with legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of time's texture is introduced through abstraction ("dissolving into a quaking reverie," "embracing the entirety of existence") rather than earned from specific events. The halo fragment, hyperbolic geometry, and retrocognitive trapping are invoked as labels without causal integration; the story tells us Elian is discovering something profound rather than dramatizing the discovery through particulars. The final image (weaving secrets into a maze) offers a gesture toward synthesis but arrives as assertion, not resonant reconfiguration. No irony, cost, or ambiguity deepens the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance remains flat across beats—no modulation for emotional intensity. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("metaphysical odyssey," "hidden harmony") that sits outside a lived perceptual signature. The narrative voice is generic literary rather than character-particular; Elian's profession as a maze designer never inflects word choice or rhythm. Filter verbs ("felt," "began to grasp") dull immediacy in peak moments. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "experience was disorienting, yet exhilarating" echoed by "exhilarating and terrifying"; "discovering the texture of time" restated as "uncover the underlying fabric of reality." Template cadence dominates the middle third (runs of "Elian felt," "Elian's mind," "Elian stood"). Stock metaphors ("lotus flower," "threshold of a new reality") and elevated register ("quaking reverie," "metaphysical odyssey") obscure rather than sharpen. Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, violating the density and coherence checks. Sentence openings recycle "As they," "The," and "Elian" stems across consecutive lines.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (time manipulation via mystical object) is a widely used fantasy template without fresh transformation. Specific elements—hedge maze designer, hyperbolic geometry, retrocognitive trapping—are present but not synthesized; they could be swapped for other occupations, methods, or constraints with no impact on the arc. The emotional journey (wonder → comprehension → intention to create) follows a predictable template. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece hedges toward safe abstraction rather than committing to embodied particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elian's profession is stated in exposition but never constrains a choice or enables a tactic. The maze-design skill is invoked only in the final sentence as future intention, not present action. No observation-into-decision beat demonstrates the profession shaping how Elian approaches the fragment or the garden.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in three beats: discovery, glowing transformation, and gathering at the end. Its "power to manipulate time" is told rather than dramatized through cost or altered options. The fragment enables the photograph's reconstitution but Elian remains passive; no choice or trade-off hinges on the object's specific properties. Present across setup, middle, and ending, but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Fading photographs appear once as a vision triggered by the fragment and are described as "slowly fading into nothingness" then "growing more vivid." The concept does not shape stakes or tactics; it is a byproduct of the fragment's power rather than a constraint or driver. No choice or cost is tied to the photographs themselves.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced in a single exposition line ("their memories were being influenced by events that had not yet occurred") but never constrains an action or creates visible cost. Elian's experience is described as "disorienting, yet exhilarating" in summary; no on-page confusion, wrong choice, or trade-off results from the condition. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Disintegrate" appears once in exposition ("disintegrate the boundaries between past, present, and future") as a stated aim, not a dramatized action. The boundaries do blur in Elian's perception, but no beat shows Elian performing disintegration or facing a consequence from attempting it. The verb could be replaced with "dissolve" or "erase" without altering the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned twice: once in exposition as a method Elian "had been studying" and once as a principle they "aimed to" apply. The mechanics never appear on the page; no attempt, success, or failure tied to geometry shapes the middle or ending. Summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly described and frames all action, providing sensory atmosphere and the secluded clearing as a discovery site. It does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Elian could conduct the same arc in any tranquil setting. Present in setup and referenced at the ending ("stood poised") but functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated as Elian's quest and restated in variations throughout. No scene dramatizes friction between this want and a competing need or cost. The motivation is told and remains abstract; Elian's actions (reaching, standing, gathering) are passive observations rather than choices that test or complicate the desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" is introduced mid-story and sustained through elevated diction ("dreamscape," "heightened awareness," "metaphysical odyssey"). The tone is consistent but static; no modulation under pressure or cadence shift charges the final image. The phrase itself is ornamental—removing "quaking" would not alter the narrative arc or closure effect.</comment>
