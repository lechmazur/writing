<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The librarian remains a type rather than an individual: "sanely eccentric" functions as a label without embodied contradiction or on-page friction. Interiority consists largely of abstract declarations ("believed that stories...were living, breathing entities") rather than micro-choices under pressure. The "reawakening" itself—the pivotal choice—is told through summary ("her work done") rather than dramatized decision-making. Embodied emotion is absent; the scarf "glows" and "shimmers" externally while the character's internal state remains static throughout.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>No decisive change occurs on the page. The librarian begins seeking stories, ends having "found" them, but the transition is recounted in summary: "Through her work, she began to sense...," "It was a moment of profound beauty." Orientation is delayed: the "scientific poetry library" anchor arrives quickly, but the librarian's goal and method remain abstract until midpoint. The piece reads accumulative but lacks a pattern taught early enough to land as coherent design. Under any lens, cost is asserted ("done," "peace," "success") rather than shown through forfeited options or visible stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The library setting is vivid with selective detail: "tomes," "reading lamps," "sandalwood," "labyrinthine shelves." However, these function as atmosphere rather than constraint—no environmental detail alters a tactic or shapes the ending. The scarf returns at closure but as ornament (a "symbol") not as a tool that charges the final image through changed use. Spatial choreography is clear but static across the entire piece.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the place where stories lived"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal, complication, or tightening appears: the librarian works, senses progress, succeeds. "Painstaking" is declared but not dramatized through failed attempts or trade-offs. The ending asserts vitality and peace without showing a path foreclosed or a price paid. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme of stories-as-living-entities emerges from repeated images (scarf glow, hyperbolic geometry maps, analog memories), yet the ending restates rather than reweights: "analog memories that made the world...more wondrous" lands as platitude. Subtext operates weakly; the librarian's solitude and the patrons' blur suggest alienation, but this is told, not embodied in tension. The scientific-poetry fusion remains decorative. No non-literal answer charges the final image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent—elevated, archaic-tinged diction ("gnarled tree," "dwelled," "caretaker")—but filter verbs and abstract constructions dull immediacy: "believed," "felt," "seemed to." No perceptual signature individualizes the librarian's way of noticing beyond the generic. Template cadence appears in stacked "As [subject] [verb]" openers across paragraphs. No dialogue is present to judge, but the narration reads as distant third rather than tight focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "stories...were not just recollections, but living, breathing entities" is restated as "the stories start to reawaken, their presence a gentle hum," then "stories, once dormant, now pulsed." Template stems recur: "As she worked..." opens three paragraphs. Figurative language stacks without accumulation: "boundaries...blurred," "entwined like branches," "scarf...seemed to glow," "shimmer," all in peak beats without payoff. Information density is low; many sentences restate the librarian's project without advancing it. The closure paragraph cycles through synonyms for success without concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise—librarian uses hyperbolic geometry to map narrative spaces—offers a non-obvious synthesis, but the story treats it as set dressing rather than lived constraint. The "scientific poetry library" and "analog memories" remain labels without transformation into specific, irreplaceable choices. Emotional arc is generic: dedicated worker achieves goal, finds peace. The final image (scarf as "symbol," tidy contentment) echoes familiar closure templates without fresh inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The odd-hour librarian is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that creates a turn. Work is summarized; "task" and "goal" are declared, success is told. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The tattered silk scarf appears in three beats: early glow, mid-story shimmer, final "symbol." Each mention is ornamental description; the scarf is never handled, used, or reweighted through changed function. Static.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Analog memories appear as theme claim ("stories...analog memories") but never shape an on-page choice or tactic. The concept is echoed in summary without altering options or pressuring the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is a label in the opening line; no subsequent action demonstrates the trait's cost or constraint. Mentioned once, never embodied in choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is the story's verb and goal, signaled early and present at closure. However, the act is summarized ("she'd reawaken them") rather than dramatized through a beat where the librarian performs a decisive gesture. Swappable with "revive" or "restore."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is mentioned as method in one paragraph ("fascinated with...a method that allowed her to map"). The mechanics never matter; no attempt is shown, no failure forces adjustment. Ornamental expertise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library frames the piece, is named early, and supplies sensory anchors (shelves, lamps, scent). It provides atmosphere but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Present across beats, minimal causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Patrons browsing is established early and noted at intervals ("came and went," "last...departed"). Time passage is vague; no ticking clock tightens decisions. Functions as backdrop, not constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories live" is stated early and drives the librarian's activity. However, it is never conflicted or tested by cost; the desire is fulfilled without friction. Told goal, not dramatized stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is coherent throughout—patrons blur, librarian works alone, silence dominates. The tone modulates slightly (urgency mid-story, peace at end) but remains static during the key work beats. Present, legible, minimal charge at closure.</comment>
