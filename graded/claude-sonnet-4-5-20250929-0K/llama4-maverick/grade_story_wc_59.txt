<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prince remains an ornamental figure whose interiority consists almost entirely of abstract nostalgia and generic longing. No micro-choices under pressure appear; he simply "dedicated his life" and "worked tirelessly" in summary. The trembling hand on the egg and the tears at the end are stock gestures unsupported by contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The final "reawakening" arrives without dramatized cost or resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words, waived. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but never coheres; the piece assembles mood fragments without a legible tightening or deepening that narrows options. Closure arrives as summary assertion ("the world's rebirth") rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The device's completion and the world's shift are told, not dramatized, breaking the requirement for felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The suspended palace and stalactites are vividly sketched but remain postcard elements; they do not constrain a single choice or alter tactics. The egg is handled once with a trembling hand but never used or revisited to charge the closure. Spatial choreography within the palace is vague—no sense of distance, access, or how the device's assembly interacts with the space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is declared early but never tested by a live on-page dilemma or reversal that forces trade-offs. The prince encounters no opposition, makes no difficult choice, and experiences no visible cost. The device simply hums to completion and the world shifts in summary; coincidence resolves without agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The flawed-genesis theme is stated repeatedly ("the world was flawed, its genesis marred") rather than emerging from particulars. "Bitterly sweet nostalgia" and "quaking reverie" are abstract mood labels, not images that reweight prior material. The ending's "deep, abiding peace" is a label that replaces earned resonance; no non-literal answer crystallizes from the device or egg.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds without head-hopping. Diction slips into elevated register ("inextricably linked," "crescendo," "abiding peace") that clashes with the bedraggled prince's immediate experience. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "began to see") stack across high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; no character-specific way of noticing distinguishes this voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "the world was flawed" / "the world's flaws" / "the world slowly coming alive" / "the world around him begin to shift" / "the world's rebirth." Template cadence: "The prince felt… The prince's eyes… The prince's hands… The prince's heart…" across six sentences. Stock metaphors ("sleeping giant," "ghostly apparition," "mechanical heartbeat") clutter peak beats. Figurative density in the final third obscures rather than sharpens the closure image, triggering −1.4 for artifacts touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The bedraggled-prince-restores-beauty template is a widely used archetype executed without transformation. The suspended palace and extinct egg are vivid tokens but do not generate non-obvious choices or moral calculus. The device assembly and world rebirth follow convenience plotting—no fresh inflection emerges from prior particulars. Derivative premise penalty: −1.0.</comment>
