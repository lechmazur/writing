<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("fault-tolerant," "newfound clarity," "hidden truth") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The fever-breaking moment is told rather than dramatized with embodied cost. Her method of investigation—scribbling notes in margins—reads as description rather than a choice that forecloses options. The station inhabitants remain undifferentiated props, never applying relationship pressure or forcing a status-driven trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece sets up a quest for "hidden truth" but the closure—Aria grasping that truth is "provisional and ephemeral"—arrives through summary rather than on-page discovery with visible cost. The weather station setting and botanical illustration seed early but their causal linkage to the final realization is asserted, not dramatized through a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The ending states "auroral sorrow" and "weight of the swallowed truth" without an image or action that makes the cost legible on the page. Orientation is clear early; lens reads Accumulative/Textural but the final reconfiguration lacks felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is anchored early with sensory detail (crisp air, ozone, metal grating) and the botanical illustration provides a recurring image. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; neither the weather patterns nor the station's physical layout constrains Aria's investigation or charges the final moment. The illustration returns at closure but as thematic echo rather than an object that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the weight of a swallowed truth"—is declared but never tested through a concrete on-page obstacle or reversal. Aria's logbook note-taking accumulates without facing opposition or forcing a trade-off. The station inhabitants "watch with wariness" but never intervene, leaving pressure abstract. The resolution tells us she "grasped the truth" without showing a choice that forecloses a live option or imposes visible cost scaled to the quest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of uncertainty versus certainty emerges through the botanical illustration and weather patterns, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "the margins, where certainties were swayed, held the key to understanding." The piece leans on prompt-language recurrence ("swaying certainties," "fault-tolerant," "auroral sorrow") rather than letting the image earn thematic resonance. The illustration returns at closure but as a declared symbol rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register. However, Aria's perceptual signature is generic; she "breathes deeply," "feels tension ease," and "gazes" without character-particular idiom or filtering bias. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fluid, context-dependent construct," "liminal existence") that feels more like academic commentary than Aria's lived perception under pressure. No dialogue appears; the station inhabitants remain silent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "the weight of the swallowed truth began to reveal itself" → "As she finally grasped the truth" → "the weight of the swallowed truth would stay with her forever." Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs ("Aria moved," "Aria felt," "As she worked"). Stock metaphors ("like a shadow taking shape," "like a landscape taking shape in the mist") appear without fresh inflection. The line "her presence smudged, like a charcoal drawing" in the final beat adds figurative density that obscures rather than sharpens the closure image, triggering the overwriting penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—oracle seeks truth at a weather station—combines elements without a non-obvious synthesis. The investigation unfolds through generic research beats (poring over data, scribbling notes) rather than a unique method tied to "fault-tolerant" or "oracle" traits. The resolution echoes familiar epistemological themes (truth is provisional, certainty is ephemeral) without transforming them through specific lived detail or moral calculus. The piece plays it safe in the middle, avoiding bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout but her "fault-tolerant oracle" trait remains a label; no on-page decision demonstrates what "fault-tolerant" means or how "oracle" status constrains her method. Her choices—reviewing data, writing notes—are generic investigator moves, not oracle-specific tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in paragraph 4, returns in Aria's mind in paragraph 13, and surfaces again in the final paragraphs as a "symbol of her journey." It seeds early and reprises at closure, but its role is thematic echo rather than causal driver; removing it would not break the investigation's logic or alter the ending's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" appears as the illustration "seemed to sway her certainties" in paragraph 5 and recurs in the final line as "the margins, where certainties were swayed, held the key." The concept is present but operates as theme statement rather than on-page constraint; it does not narrow options or force a tactical choice during the investigation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" appears once in paragraph 3 ("peripherally aware of the station's automated systems") as scenic description. The trait does not recur or constrain any later action; Aria's subsequent investigation involves direct engagement, not peripheral attention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Smudge" appears in paragraph 8 ("smudging the neat entries") as Aria's method of annotation and returns in the final line ("her presence smudged, like a charcoal drawing"). It drives the middle beat—her intervention in the logbook—and charges the final image, creating a purposeful early–final reprise that reweights her departure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Occupying the margins" is signaled in paragraph 8 and developed in paragraphs 14–16 as the collaborative logbook space becomes "a boundary zone." The method shapes Aria's approach across multiple beats but does not constrain a peak choice or impose visible cost; the margins remain a workspace rather than a tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station anchors the setting from paragraph 1, provides spatial grounding (observation deck, metal grating, logbook), and houses the data streams Aria investigates. It supplies resources (data, logbook) but does not pressure her choices; the isolation and "liminal existence" are declared in paragraph 20 rather than dramatized as obstacles that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" appears in paragraph 6 ("as it broke, she felt a newfound clarity") to mark the inciting shift. The timeframe signals recovery but does not create urgency or tighten decisions; the investigation unfolds over "days" without a live clock that alters tactics or escalates pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is stated in paragraph 7 and recurs in paragraphs 17, 22, as the driving motivation. The desire is present across beats but remains abstract; no on-page friction tests whether Aria is willing to pay a cost (time, safety, collaboration) to pursue it, leaving the motivation told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" appears in paragraphs 10 and 19, establishing a melancholy tone. The tone is consistent but static; it does not modulate with pressure or escalate at the closure beat. The final image ("auroral sorrow that had accompanied her discovery") names the tone rather than embodying it through a charged sensory moment.</comment>
