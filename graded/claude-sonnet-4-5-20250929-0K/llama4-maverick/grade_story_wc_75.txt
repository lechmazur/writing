<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elena remains a static tour guide throughout; her "motivation for rescuing dying arts" is told rather than tested. No contradictory impulses, embodied emotion, or micro-choices under pressure appear—she simply observes and narrates history. The final "sense of purpose" is declared without any visible cost or path foreclosed. Interiority reads as generic museum-guide exposition rather than character-particular perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to land closure with cost. The thawing chamber sequence accumulates atmospheric detail yet no decisive change, renunciation, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page—Elena simply walks away with a vague resolve to "preserve stories." The beekeeper timeframe anchor ("after his last visit") is introduced late and never causally tightens options. Orientation is delayed: who Elena is and what stakes drive this tour remain unclear until well past 120 words, triggering the Orientation Test penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The grotto city setting is vividly described (luminescent fungi, frozen chamber, rough stone walls) and anchors the story spatially. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard description without pressure. The emerald-tinted opera glass lens is mentioned three times but never handled or used to affect Elena's perception or decision. Sensory detail is filtered through generic tour-guide observation rather than POV-specific urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled early or tested under pressure. Elena's tour proceeds without opposition, reversal, or tightening—the ice simply thaws, revealing bread sculptures. No agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) forecloses a path with on-page cost; the final "sense of purpose" is asserted without tactical constraint or trade-off. Coincidence (thawing ice) reveals history but does not force Elena to choose or lose anything.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Theme of cultural preservation and displaced persons is stated repeatedly ("importance of preserving cultural heritage," "memories of the displaced persons") rather than emerging from particulars. The bread sculptures and opera glass are symbolic tokens without thematic friction or choice-level integration. The phrase "rosewater dread" and "displaced persons" read as prompt labels rather than earned resonance. No non-literal answer to a central question; the ending moralizes Elena's guardian role explicitly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is stable and legible, with controlled third-person limited focalization through Elena. However, diction drifts into generic tour-guide register ("winding tunnels," "ethereal light," "complex history") without character-specific perceptual signature. Repetitive sentence stems appear: "Elena explained," "Elena's eyes," "Elena felt," "Elena knew." The final paragraph stacks template cadence ("once a hidden refuge... now a testament... once a place of refuge... now a place of remembrance") that flattens rhythm at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "preserve the stories" / "preserving cultural heritage" / "keep the memories alive" / "preserving the stories of the past"; "city's secrets" / "stories that lay just beneath the surface" (repeated twice). Template cadence dominates the final third: "once... now" appears twice in succession, and "Elena's [noun]" opens multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("weight of their discovery," "mantle") and filter-verb stacks ("began to thaw," "continued to be," "felt a sense") dull immediacy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the escalated Q7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The grotto-city-behind-waterfall premise and displaced-persons theme follow familiar refuge/preservation templates without transformation. The bread-shaped-initials custom is introduced late and feels ornamental rather than organically developed. Elena's arc (tour guide learns to value preservation) is a median, low-risk choice. The emerald opera glass and beekeeper timeframe read as checklist items rather than a cohesive synthesis; removing either would not fundamentally alter the emotional or thematic arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout but makes no decisions that create turns. She observes, explains, and narrates; the thawing happens to her group. Her final "sense of purpose" is asserted without a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The opera glass lens appears three times (pedestal, symbol, final reminder) but is never handled, used, or reweighted through action. Static description; no beat involvement beyond ornamental mentions. Introduced early but remains inert.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Displaced persons are mentioned repeatedly as theme and backstory (noblewoman, families, refugees) and frame the bread sculptures' significance. However, the concept does not change Elena's options or tactics on the page; it remains historical context rather than present-stake pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Historically oriented mind" is a label-only trait mentioned once. No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this attribute; it does not generate a visible tradeoff or shape a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The thaw action is central to the chamber sequence, revealing the bread sculptures and driving the tour's emotional peak. However, it is a passive environmental event rather than a protagonist-driven turn; Elena does not cause or resist it. Present in setup (sealed chamber) and payoff (revelation), but not shaped by Elena's choices.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The bread-shaped-initials custom is introduced at the thaw reveal and explained by Elena. It provides cultural texture and thematic weight (family histories, preservation) but does not shape attempts or constrain earlier choices. Present in one key beat (chamber reveal) and mentioned at closure, but mechanics appear only at the end.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The grotto city is vividly established early (tunnels, fungi, carvings, frozen chamber, waterfall) and anchors all action. However, it supplies atmosphere rather than pressuring choices or altering tactics. The chamber's sealed state creates mild suspense but does not force Elena to adapt or lose resources. Present across beats but postcard-level integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"After the beekeeper's last visit" is mentioned once in the final third as a vague historical marker. It does not tighten decisions, create a live clock, or alter Elena's tactics. The timeframe remains untracked and inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Motivation for rescuing dying arts" is stated once ("clear in her eyes") and asserted at the end ("sense of purpose"). No on-page friction between this desire and competing costs or wants; told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Rosewater dread" appears once as a phrase. Tone reads more as solemn reverence and educational exposition than sustained dread. No modulation with pressure or coherent tonal charge in the final image; the ending is declarative rather than dread-inflected.</comment>
