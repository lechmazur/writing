<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The poet character remains abstract despite the molting-personalities attribute, which is mentioned but never shown to constrain a choice or create internal contradiction on the page. Interiority relies heavily on generalized observations ("eyes shone with curiosity and defiance") rather than embodied, character-particular perception. The friendship with the incarcerated book lover is told in summary without dramatized interaction, and the vision to rebuild the library arrives as declaration rather than earned through on-page struggle. The final "sense of pride and accomplishment" reads as emotional summary without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, library steps, moon rising) arrive early, but causality remains weak throughout: the poet decides to rebuild, walks inside, works through the night, and the library is reborn—all without meaningful obstacles, reversals, or visible cost. The piece reads as outline-level sequencing ("As the night wore on... With a newfound sense of purpose... The poet stepped back") without because/therefore linkage. No closure effect (DC/RR/CR) with felt cost is legible; the ending offers emotional declaration ("the city was on the path to healing") rather than a dramatized shift in options or stance. The inferred lens (Causal) is not sustained; events accumulate without tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars provides a recurring anchor and the setting appears in the opening, middle, and final image, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains backdrop. Sensory detail is selective (moon's silver glow, rusty hinges creaking) and the coffee tin is handled on-page, yet spatial choreography inside the library is vague ("outlines of old bookshelves, dusty tomes"). The body and tools (the tin, the poet's hands) do not shape the outcome; the setting charges atmosphere but does not pressure the protagonist's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (rebuild the library) is signaled early, but escalation is absent: no obstacles materialize, no tactic fails, no price is paid on the page. The poet's "daunting task" dissolves without friction; they simply begin to work and "the library began to take shape" by dawn. Coincidence (moon rising, dawn arriving) marks time but does not complicate. The vision to rebuild and the method (friendship and collaboration) are told rather than tested, and the resolution lands without agency—luck and assertion replace protagonist choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of forging beauty from anarchy and the blooming resistance motif are stated multiple times but never earn resonance through concrete stakes or cost. The poet's "molting personalities" and the coffee tin with scraps gesture toward transformation, yet the piece delivers tidy fulfillment (library reborn, city on the path to healing) rather than ambiguity or earned wisdom. The final image of "luminous fracture" and dawn is lyric but does not reweight prior material; it restates the premise without interrogating it. Thematic statements ("to forge beauty from anarchy," "power of art and imagination") replace scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-person-limited focalization remains clean, but the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable across beats. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tangible representation of the poet's mantra," "embodiment of this resistance") that sits uneasily with the vagrant poet's lived experience. Purposeful compression in the night-to-dawn transition is legible, but perceptual signature is weak—observations read as neutral rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Internal thought formatting is consistent, though filter verbs ("felt a sense of...") flatten immediacy at key moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "beautiful from anarchy" restated as "resilience... power of art," "newfound sense of purpose" repeated twice within three paragraphs, and "eyes shone" / "eyes snapped back" / "eyes adjusted" / "eyes shone" cycle through similar constructions. Template cadence runs dominate transitions ("As the moon rose higher... As the night wore on... With a newfound sense of purpose"). Stock phrases ("torn apart by conflict," "phoenix from the ashes," "beacon of hope") cluster in closure beats. Sentence openings vary minimally in the final third. Information density is low; many lines restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The vagrant poet rebuilding a library and "blooming resistance" premise reads as familiar template without fresh synthesis. The molting-personalities attribute and the coffee tin with false bottom are mentioned but not transformed through specific, grounded choices that alter tactics or stakes. Emotional beats follow predictable arcs (desperation → hope → accomplishment) without non-obvious turns. The friendship with the incarcerated book lover is told in summary rather than shown with specificity, and the resolution offers surface satisfaction without risk or moral calculus. The piece assembles required elements but does not make them feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet appears throughout but makes no on-page choice that narrows options or alters tactics. Observations and declarations ("gazed out," "felt a surge of hope," "began to work") replace decisions under pressure. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but swappable with any character who decides to rebuild something.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The coffee tin with secret false bottom is handled once (opening beat, cradling it) and mentioned again when the poet carries it inside, but the false bottom is never opened, used, or reweighted. It holds "scraps" as symbolic cargo but does not constrain a choice or return with shifted meaning at closure. Setup present, no middle development, ornamental at ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Blooming resistance is stated three times as theme ("movement born of desperation," "taking root," "at its heart") but never dramatized as stake or tactic on the page. Does not shape what the poet attempts or costs; exists only as label. Mentioned in setup and ending, but no causal role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>Molts personalities monthly is described once in exposition ("One month they were a fiery revolutionary, the next a melancholy dreamer") but never shown to enable or constrain an on-page action. No visible tradeoff or friction; label-only. Missing setup integration, no middle role, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rebuild drives the stated goal and frames the ending ("library began to take shape"), appearing in setup vision, middle walk-inside, and final survey. However, the action is summarized rather than dramatized with obstacles or cost, making it replaceable with any restoration task. Present across all three gates but lacks causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>A friendship sparked sorting books at a prison library is mentioned once in retrospective summary (paragraph 2) and credited again in the penultimate paragraph as the source of strength, but the mechanics (how sorting books created the bond, how that bond informs present tactics) are never shown. Setup seed, no middle use, thematic reference at closure without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rusted library under stars anchors every major beat: the poet sits on its steps, envisions its restoration, enters it, works inside, and surveys it at dawn. The setting supplies the objective and recurring spatial anchor, and the rusty hinges and broken furniture briefly alter the poet's movements. Present in setup, middle, and closure; pressures choice minimally (entry/work) but does not fundamentally constrain tactics or reweight the ending image beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>As the moon clears the skyline opens the story and the moon's arc (rising higher, zenith, dawn) marks passage, but no on-page decision is timed or tightened by this clock. The poet works "as the night wore on" without urgency or deadline pressure. Setup present, middle tracking vague, closure notes dawn but time does not alter options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>To forge beauty from anarchy is stated as the poet's mantra in the opening and returns in thematic language at closure ("beauty emerging like a phoenix"), but the desire is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost on the page. Told rather than shown; no friction between the goal and a competing need. Setup declaration, middle absent, closure echo without tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Luminous fracture appears once as image ("moon... a fracture, a break in the darkness") and once as descriptor for the poet's eyes ("luminous fracture, a mix of sadness and hope"), but tone remains uniformly hopeful and declarative throughout without modulation under pressure. No coherent tonal shift or charge at closure; static mood. Setup gesture, no middle development, final mention ornamental.</comment>
