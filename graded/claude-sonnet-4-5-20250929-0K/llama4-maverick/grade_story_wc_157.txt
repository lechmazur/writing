<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lyra exists only as a label-holder without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. Her "charming rogue" trait is declared but never tested—she moves through beats with perfect competence and no internal friction. The final paragraphs summarize her legacy in abstract terms rather than showing a choice with visible cost. No moment dramatizes what she risks or forfeits; the story tells us about defiance without showing her pay for it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>No on-page closure unit: the piece summarizes Lyra's ongoing activities across seasons without a decisive change, crystallized stance, or reweighted image at the end. The narrative lacks a single causal turn—events are presented as-and-then sequencing (she obtains seed, plants it, watches it grow, reputation spreads) with no reversal or tightening that narrows options. The ending offers thematic echo ("her work was far from over") instead of felt cost. Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no payoff, triggering the penalty and Q3 cap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is anchored late and functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image. The gourd rattle seed's "unique properties" and "subtle vibrations" are asserted but never shown affecting tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—plots, soil, and plant arrangements are described generically without micro-setting pressure. The entomologist role is ornamental; no tool or environmental detail alters Lyra's options on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (protecting freedom of expression via coded messages) is declared but never tightened or tested. No on-page reversal, escalation, or cost appears—Lyra succeeds frictionlessly across all beats. The thoughts-tax legislation is told as background; no moment shows her losing stamina, social credit, or facing a surveillance threat. Agency is absent: she plants, waits, and her reputation grows without a single choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The theme of defiance and coded communication is stated repeatedly ("spark of defiance," "freedom of expression") rather than emerging from particulars. The gourd seed is introduced as symbolic ("key to deciphering") but never returns with reweighted meaning. The final paragraphs deliver thematic summary ("testament to the enduring power") instead of a resonant non-literal answer. The piece tells the reader what the story means rather than trusting scene work to convey it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Voice is anonymous and expository, lacking perceptual signature or character-specific diction. Prose defaults to stock phrasing ("converging chaos," "unbreakable spirit," "beacon of resistance") without modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is attempted but flattens into narrated summary: "she moved with a practiced air" tells competence without showing Lyra's internal texture. Register occasionally drifts into committee voice ("the art of subtle communication would always be in demand") that reads like averaged consensus rather than Lyra's singular perspective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "The greenhouse became... remained... stood as" in successive paragraphs restate legacy without advancing pressure. Synonym churn ("sanctuary/beacon," "testament/symbol") clusters in the final third, dulling the closure beat. Stock metaphors appear without fresh inflection: "spark of defiance burning bright," "tapestry of meaning." Filter verbs stack in high-pressure moments ("watched as the message took shape") where immediacy would serve better. Applying patterned-artifact penalties (−0.6 baseline, −1.1 for closure contamination) and paraphrase-loop check (−0.2).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The core premise (taxable thoughts → secret language via garden patterns) follows a derivative template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The thoughts-tax worldbuilding is asserted but never inhabited—no scene shows enforcement, evasion tactics, or the texture of this surveillance state. Lyra's methods (arranging plots to spell codes) are described generically; the story could swap "community gardens" for any other covert medium with minor edits. The ending retreats into safe abstraction ("art of coded language would continue to thrive") rather than committing to a bold, specific choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her "charming rogue" trait is label-only; no scene shows her charm enabling or constraining an action with cost. The narrative summarizes her activities (unwrapping, planting, watching) without dramatizing a choice under pressure. She appears in the final image but as passive legacy rather than active agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The gourd rattle seed is handled in two beats (unwrapped, planted) but its "unique properties" to "resonate with subtle vibrations" are asserted, not shown affecting tactics. It appears in the final third as a mature plant symbolizing legacy, but this cameo does not reweight prior material or participate causally in closure. The seed could be swapped for any other coded-key object with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The secret language club frames the premise and is present across beats (formation, motto, use of gardens), shaping the dominant stake on the page. However, no scene shows the club constraining or enabling a specific choice with cost—membership is backdrop rather than active pressure. It appears in the ending summary but does not charge the final image. Functional but replaceable with any covert-resistance group.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Candidly cryptic" is mentioned once as a motto-related trait but never constrains or enables an on-page action. No scene shows Lyra's cryptic expression creating friction, cost, or tactical advantage. The attribute is ornamental, present only as a descriptor without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Warp" appears once in "warp the perception of her messages" as a described effect, not an action that drives a turn. The term does not recur or shape closure; the story's escalation (absent as it is) does not trace to this verb. Easily swappable with "alter" or "disguise" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Planting message patterns via garden plots is signaled early and shapes the dominant stake across multiple beats (planning, execution, watching growth). However, the method's mechanics remain abstract—no scene shows how arrangement encodes meaning or what constraints the medium imposes. It does not participate in closure beyond thematic summary. Functional but lacks the specificity and cost linkage to score higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The entomologist's greenhouse is named in the opening and closing, framing the action. It provides the "hub" for operations and a cover of natural wonder, shaping tactics (people come to admire plants, absorbing codes unknowingly). However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—no scene shows Lyra using greenhouse-specific features under pressure. Present across beats and in the ending, but postcard-level rather than micro-setting that charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The thoughts-tax legislation is mentioned as context that formed the club and created demand for Lyra's skills. It appears in the ending ("as the thoughts-tax legislation continued to shape the world") but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—no scene shows a live clock, enforcement threat, or time-driven pressure. The timeframe is backdrop without causal development or middle beat constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motto "to stand guard over your own spark of defiance" is stated and echoed in the ending, framing Lyra's motivation. However, the desire is never dramatized in a choice with friction—no moment shows what guarding that spark costs her or forces her to trade competing goods. The motivation is told and summarized rather than constrained by on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Converging chaos" is mentioned twice (as atmosphere in the greenhouse and in the final third) but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. The tone remains uniformly expository and declarative throughout; no cadence shift or tonal break marks escalation. The phrase is ornamental rather than a coherent tonal driver integrated across beats.</comment>
