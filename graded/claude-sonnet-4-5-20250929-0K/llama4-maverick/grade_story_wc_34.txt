<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The balladeer remains a passive observer for most of the story, watching and pondering rather than making choices that alter her situation. Her interior life consists of vague "wonder" and generic contemplation without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The final departure reads as unmotivated wandering rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. Her picking up the bolt plate and creating graffiti are actions, but they lack the internal conflict and stakes-driven motivation required to anchor characterization in the mid-band or higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when remain hazy past 120 words, requiring the reader to infer a mystical realm from atmospheric description rather than clean anchors (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test). No meaningful escalation occurs; the balladeer sits, ponders, creates art, and leaves without a decision that narrows options or changes knowledge. The "ghost in code" remains an abstract presence that never constrains choice or produces a legible cost. The ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing—she gathers her things and slips away, leaving the courtyard "forever changed" by assertion rather than dramatized evidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard is anchored with vivid sensory detail (ozone, wet stone, swirling fog, statues) and the atmosphere is sustained throughout. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a backdrop for contemplation rather than a pressure that shapes action. The flower press bolt plate is handled twice (picked up, gathered at the end) but its "new significance" is told, not shown through changed options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>No dominant stake is signaled early or tested under pressure. The stated motivation—"to articulate unspoken needs"—remains abstract and never faces a concrete obstacle or cost. The storm intensifies around her work, but no reversal or tightening forces a choice; the balladeer creates art uninterrupted and departs at will. Closure is not earned by protagonist agency; the ghost's "response" is a passive breeze, and the final departure carries no visible price or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is declared rather than emergent: "the power of creative expression," "mysterious connections," and "tinkersong wonder" are stated in the final two paragraphs without being earned through specific, conflicted events. The graffiti art and ghostly code function as symbolic placeholders without particular meaning derived from the balladeer's struggle. The ending moralizes ("a testament to…") instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward communion between living and ghostly but never dramatizes friction or cost that would charge the concept.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The prose carries a consistent atmospheric register and the POV remains stable in third person. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific: "sense of wonder," "driftingly alert," and "tinkersong curiosity" are labels, not lived textures. The final paragraph slips into summary narration that tells the reader what the graffiti "remained" as a testament to, breaking psychic distance. Sentence rhythm is generally controlled, though some constructions are slightly stiff ("the atmosphere grew charged with electricity").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The prose is mostly clean and grammatically sound, but suffers from repetitive phrasing and template cadence: "seemed to" appears five times, "began to" three times, creating a passive, distanced texture. Figurative language is dense without clear payoff—"ghost in code," "tinkersong," "driftingly alert" are coined terms that accumulate without constraining action. Information density is low; many sentences restate atmospheric mood without advancing situation or knowledge. The final two paragraphs loop through summary and thematic assertion, dulling momentum at the closure beat (−0.8 in Q7 for pervasive scaffold and metaphor density that flattens the ending).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—artist communicates with a ghostly presence through graffiti in a mystical courtyard—is a familiar template (creative communion with the supernatural) without a fresh angle or transformation through specific choice. Coined terms like "tinkersong" and "ghost in code" feel ornamental rather than integral to world logic. The emotional arc is generic contemplation leading to departure; swapping the balladeer for any artist and the graffiti for another medium would leave the structure unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material beyond its template origins.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The balladeer is present throughout and performs the graffiti art, but her choices do not create key turns. She observes, ponders, creates, and departs without agency-driven escalation or cost. Present in closure (she gathers her things and leaves) but not causally active there—no decision alters options or stakes. Setup early, one action beat (creating art), ornamental closure participation: cap 4.6 for missing middle development and causal pressure; actual score lower due to passivity (−0.8 for swappability, −0.5 for summary-only interiority). Final: 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in two beats: picked up mid-story, gathered at the end. Its "new significance" is asserted but not dramatized—no on-page evidence shows how it has changed meaning or altered the balladeer's options. The object could be replaced with any token artifact without affecting the plot. Setup present, closure cameo without causal work: cap 2.8 for no closure participation; slight lift for two touches (+0.4). Final: 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The "ghost in code" is mentioned repeatedly but remains abstract—it exists as "cryptic messages," "eerie echoes," "subtle vibrations," and a final "ethereal breeze," never constraining or enabling a choice. The concept is thematic decoration rather than a driver of stakes or tactics. Setup present, ornamental throughout, no middle or closure work: cap 2.8. Final: 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears twice as a label (opening and near the end) but never constrains or enables action. No on-page trade-off or visible cost tied to this trait. Label-only, no causal work, late reprise without reweighting: cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; −0.6 for ornamental use, −0.3 for label-only. Final: 1.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The action "encode" is performed on-page (the balladeer scrawls symbols with charcoal) and occupies the middle section. However, no turn or escalation results from it—the ghost responds passively, and the balladeer's departure is not shaped by the encoding. Setup mid-story (late signal −0.3), one beat involvement (+0.4), no closure linkage (cap 2.8 waived slightly by middle presence), swappable with "create art" generically (−0.5). Lift for being the primary action visible on the page. Final: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Messages encoded in graffiti art" is signaled early in the motivation statement and executed in the middle section with charcoal on stone. The mechanics appear (symbols, patterns, visual language) but do not shape attempts or outcomes—the ghost responds without resistance, and no graffiti-specific constraint affects tactics. Setup early, one beat, mechanics present but not tested: eligible ~5.5; −0.6 for swappability (any art form would serve), −0.5 for no closure linkage, −0.2 for late first execution. Final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is anchored early and sustained with vivid sensory detail. It provides atmosphere but never pressures choices or supplies resources that affect outcome—the balladeer could create her art anywhere. Setup strong, no middle constraint, no closure participation beyond location: cap 4.6 for missing middle development; −0.8 for ornamental use, −0.4 for swappability. Final: 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "between lightning and thunder" is mentioned once mid-story ("the moment between lightning and thunder, when the world held its breath") and the storm intensifies during the art-making, but no live clock tightens decisions. Time remains vague and untracked; the balladeer works at her own pace without urgency. Late signal (−0.5), no middle or closure work, vague tracking (−0.8), ornamental (−0.5): cap 2.8, adjusted down for weak presence. Final: 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to articulate unspoken needs" is stated early and recurs in the middle section. However, it remains abstract—whose needs, what friction between articulation and silence, what cost for speaking or not speaking are never dramatized. The balladeer experiences no internal conflict between want and cost. Setup early, mentioned in two beats, no visible friction or closure linkage: eligible ~5.0; −0.8 for told-only, −0.6 for no cost connection. Final: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is mentioned three times as a label and the tone remains atmospheric and contemplative throughout. The tone does not modulate with pressure (there is no escalation) and does not charge the final image—the ending continues the same gentle, vague register. Setup present via label, consistent but static, no closure charge: mid-band eligible; −0.5 for label-only, −0.4 for static mood, −0.4 for no closure modulation. Final: 4.7.</comment>
