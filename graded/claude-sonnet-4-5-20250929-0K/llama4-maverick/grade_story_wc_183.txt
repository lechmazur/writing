<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's "chimera twin discoverer" role and "blissfully aberrant" trait are label-only assertions without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her interiority relies on stock phrasing ("thrill of excitement," "shiver run down her spine") rather than character-particular perception. The final "peace wash over her" delivers satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path, undercutting earned endurance. Motivation remains abstractly declared rather than tested through competing impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but closure fails the cost-proof test: Lyra "finally found what she was searching for" and feels "peace" without any on-page sacrifice, renunciation, or altered tactic. The Garden materializes as reward rather than reconfiguration. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (fog thickening, stories weaving, emerald glow), yet the ending supplies declarative arrival without cadence shift or reweighted image. The middle explores fragmented passenger stories but causality remains and-then sequencing—no tightening choice narrows options before the cove appears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship, fog, and bay anchor setting vividly with sensory specificity (decay scent, rusting corridors, rickety rollercoasters). Spatial choreography is coherent across decks and the hidden cove arrival. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining a choice or charging the final image—the ship's "decaying grandeur" mirrors theme but does not alter Lyra's tactics. The emerald card and leather-bound book serve as plot tokens without physical interaction that tests capability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the Garden) is signaled early but never tightens—Lyra encounters clues, reads fragmented stories, and the ship drifts her to the cove without agency-driven reversal or trade-off. "Memories alter" and "past and present began to blur" gesture at complication yet dissolve without on-page consequence. No visible price forecloses a path; the "trapped freedom" metaphor remains decorative. Escalation is asserted ("drawing her closer," "getting close to the heart of the mystery") rather than dramatized through narrowed options or contested moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges (fragility of memory, convergence of past/present) through ship metaphor and narrative threads, avoiding overt thesis. Yet the ending states rather than dramatizes the Garden as "a state of mind, a realm where the past and present converged," summarizing the concept instead of charging it with a non-literal image. "Trapped freedom" and "unkindled solace" remain prompt echoes without transformative particulars. The final "peace" flattens ambiguity into resolution without cost, undercutting thematic complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with clear focalization on Lyra; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("labyrinthine corridors of her own mind," "lush and vibrant oasis") that edges past immediate perception under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic (fog, mist, scent) rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean, and narrative distance is consistent. No dialogue appears; the prose texture is competent but lacks rhythmic variation—many sentences follow declarative subject-verb patterns without modulation for urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is consistent and grammar clean, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "As she... Lyra..." sentence stems recur across beats. Stock metaphors ("shiver run down her spine," "thrill of excitement") flatten peak moments. The emerald card "seemed to be glowing" and stories "began to take on a life of their own" rely on weak constructions and passive hedging. Information density is low—several sentences restate Lyra's proximity to the Garden without advancing knowledge or tactic. No figurative muddle, but propulsion stalls in the middle third with repetitive summary of fragmented stories.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise (carnival ship as memory archive leading to a mythical garden) is recognizable from numerous speculative templates. "Chimera twin discoverer" and "blissfully aberrant" are quirk-labels without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious calculus. The Garden's reveal as "a state of mind" delivers a familiar epiphany without specific synthesis. No bold structural risk or perspectival choice; the fog-shrouded vessel and emerald clue follow mystery-box conventions. Lyra's journey lacks a fresh inflection—the stories she uncovers remain interchangeable fragments rather than particulars that charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and her exploration drives the sequence, but her decisions do not create key turns—she reads, navigates, and observes without on-page trade-offs or contested choices. The role "chimera twin discoverer" is mentioned once and never constrains action. She is described as able to "see patterns and connections that others missed" yet this trait manifests only as summary ("began to see a pattern emerge") rather than a specific choice under pressure. Functional but largely observational; swappable with a generic seeker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The emerald swatch card appears in two distinct beats (slips from book, later "seemed to be glowing") and carries a cryptic message that Lyra follows. Setup is early (first third), and it reappears near closure to signal proximity. However, the card is never physically handled in a way that tests capability or alters tactics—it prompts interpretation but does not constrain a choice. The "glowing" remains atmospheric assertion rather than causal trigger. Causal role is present but modest; closer to purposeful reprise than indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Unkindled solace" appears once in the card's cryptic message and is never unpacked or dramatized in subsequent action. The concept does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; Lyra seeks the Garden for "forgotten names," not solace. The ending delivers "peace," which may thematically echo solace, but the link is implicit and the concept does not alter options. Present as prompt echo but ornamental to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Blissfully aberrant" is mentioned once as a label ("She was blissfully aberrant, able to see patterns and connections that others missed") but never constrains or enables a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait does not produce a trade-off or error; Lyra's pattern recognition succeeds without friction. Label-only mention; no demonstrated advantage or price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Recapture" appears twice: "recapture the essence of the tales" and "to recapture the essence of the narrative threads." The action describes Lyra's interpretive work and links to the middle progression, but it does not drive a major turn—stories are recaptured without visible struggle or failed attempt. Swappable with "decode" or "reconstruct" with minor edits. Functional presence but no irreplaceable causal role at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Narrative threads" are mentioned early ("seek the threads that bind") and recur as Lyra follows fragmented passenger stories. The method is signaled and shapes her middle exploration, but the mechanics are vague—how threads are identified or followed is summarized rather than dramatized. The threads do not impose a visible constraint or failed path; Lyra's progress is smooth. Present across beats but lacks specificity to be indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship is vividly established (fog, bay, rusting corridors, rollercoasters, game stalls) and anchors all action from opening to closure. The ship "approaching a hidden cove" provides the spatial endpoint. However, the setting does not pressure a key choice—Lyra explores freely without environmental obstacle or resource limit. The ship serves as metaphor ("fragility of human memory") but does not alter tactics. Strong descriptive presence and closure participation; lacks causal constraint to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"As memories alter" appears once in the middle as a vague temporal marker tied to Lyra's confusion ("past and present began to blur"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track a live clock. The phrase is thematic rather than tactical; no countdown or urgency shapes moves. Present but does not function as a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's desire to find the Garden of Forgotten Names is stated early, recurs across beats ("she had a hunch," "drawing her closer," "finally found what she was searching for"), and drives the sequence to closure. The motivation is told rather than tested through competing wants or visible friction—Lyra pursues without doubt or cost. The Garden materializes as reward rather than forcing a trade-off. Shapes structure and ending but lacks conflicted choice or felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" is mentioned once explicitly ("Lyra felt a sense of trapped freedom") and implicitly echoed in the ship's "decaying grandeur" as confinement-within-exploration. The tone does not modulate with pressure—Lyra's interiority remains declarative and abstractly reflective throughout. The ending shifts to "peace" without tonal continuity. Present as metaphor but not charged at closure or coherent across turns.</comment>
