<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Emilia exists primarily as a vehicle for abstract thematic statements rather than a character who makes choices under pressure. Her "expectantly resigned" stance is merely labeled, never dramatized through contradictory impulses or costly micro-decisions. The single on-page action—playing the zither—carries no visible stakes or trade-offs; she simply enacts a pre-formed philosophy. Interior life consists of summarized beliefs ("one must first unlearn hatred") rather than embodied tension or flawed perception driving inevitable mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>No decisive change, reversal, or cost appears on the page. The piece opens with Emilia already committed to her teaching philosophy and closes with the same resolve, merely restated. The phrase "traveled stillness" recurs as a mood label but does not reconfigure options or meaning. Under an Accumulative lens, the density never shifts; under Causal, no because/therefore chain alters knowledge; under Situational, no stance crystallizes—only pre-existing conviction is reaffirmed without on-page friction or visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn light anchor setting early with sensory specificity ("kaleidoscope of colors," "soft glow of the table lamp"). The zither rosette receives focused description that subtly mirrors Emilia's harmonizing goal. However, the environment remains postcard-static; no tool, spatial constraint, or recurring object alters a choice or charges the final image—the library functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than dramatized pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the choir to unlearn hatred and sing in harmony—is declared but never tested on the page. No choir members appear, no rehearsal unfolds, no resistance or complication arises. Emilia's solitary zither playing carries no opposition, reversal, or trade-off; she simply affirms a pre-existing commitment. The story asserts escalation ("weight of her task") but shows none; pressure remains abstract summary rather than dramatized narrowing of options or visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—harmony through embracing differences, preserving vanishing arts—is stated overtly rather than emerging from concrete choice and conflict. The rosette as symbol of "woven threads" is spelled out mid-text, eliminating subtext. The final image offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; it merely reasserts the premise ("music would continue to resonate"). Emilia's final smile and determination mirror her opening stance, so no conceptual repricing or resonant reconfiguration occurs—only thematic echo and declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice maintains consistent literary register and psychic distance throughout; focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Emilia notices beauty and harmony in ways that could belong to any reflective teacher. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("poignant reminder," "universal language," "beacon of hope") without grounding in embodied perception. No dialogue appears, so that bullet set is not evaluated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "vanishing arts" recurs four times with identical framing; "diverse voices" / "unified voice" / "sing as one" cycle without added pressure; the phrase "traveled stillness" appears twice as a mood label, never dramatized. Template cadence runs through much of the piece ("As she…," "As the…," "And so…"). Mixed metaphor: "braid diverse voices" conflates auditory and textile registers without coherent vehicle. These artifacts dull momentum and obscure any potential closure image, triggering accumulated deductions and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—teacher uses music to foster harmony—is familiar and executed without fresh inflection. The zither and rosette function as generic symbols of artistry rather than irreplaceable plot drivers. Emilia's method ("subtracting noise") is declared but never demonstrated through specific choice or trade-off. No turn, complication, or final image offers non-obvious synthesis; the ending restates the opening conviction. The piece reads as a treatise on a theme rather than a story with lived particulars and earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Emilia is present throughout but makes no key decisions that alter tactics or stakes. She plays the zither once, then packs it away; no choice-point or cost arises. Her role as choir teacher is told, not dramatized—no choir appears on the page. The character exists to embody a philosophy rather than to drive plot through agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The rosette is described in detail at the opening and mentioned again at the end, but it never changes meaning or constrains a choice. Its function is purely symbolic—illustrating "woven threads" as a metaphor for harmony. Emilia lifts the zither and later packs it away; no tactile interaction or evolving use charges the final image. Present across beats but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vanishing arts are declared as motivation and thematic frame, appearing in the opening and closing paragraphs. However, the concept never shapes on-page tactics or creates a live problem—no funding crisis, no lost students, no closing institution. It remains abstract backdrop rather than a stake that narrows options or forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" appears once as a descriptor in the second sentence and is never dramatized through contradictory action, visible trade-off, or constraint on choice. The trait is label-only; Emilia's subsequent behavior (playing music, smiling, feeling peace) reads as serene resolve, not resignation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Denote" appears once: "The notes seemed to denote a sense of longing." This is descriptive summary, not a plot turn. The zither playing itself does not create a reversal or redefine options; it illustrates Emilia's existing philosophy. Easily swappable with "express" or "convey."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Subtracting noise" is named as Emilia's method in one sentence but never demonstrated through mechanics or choices. No scene shows her stripping away distractions or guiding students through the process. The method is thematic claim, not dramatized action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The velvet library is established early with autumn light and stained glass, providing consistent sensory anchor. It frames the entire scene and recurs in the final third. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter outcome—Emilia could enact the same reflection and resolve in any quiet room. Atmospheric but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" appears once as a phrase describing the duration of Emilia's journey. No timeframe is tracked on the page; the story occupies a single continuous session with the zither. The phrase functions as abstract thematic descriptor, not a clock that tightens decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Emilia's motivation to braid diverse voices is declared multiple times and frames her philosophy. However, it is never dramatized through conflicting wants, obstacles, or costs—no choir tension, no difficult student, no resistance. Desire remains assertion rather than lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" is named twice and permeates the reflective, meditative register throughout. Tone remains stable—no modulation with pressure, since no pressure arises. The final image invokes "traveled stillness" again, creating a purposeful callback that charges the mood, though it does not reconfigure stakes. Coherent and consistent, but static.</comment>
