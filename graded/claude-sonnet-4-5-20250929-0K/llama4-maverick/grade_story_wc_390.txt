<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Azure Coat remains a cipher throughout: "logically emotional mind" is never dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene, only asserted as a label. The artifact protection unfolds without visible internal conflict, trade-offs, or embodied emotion—she simply performs a technical task with therapeutic self-awareness ("deep sense of purpose," "peace that was both logical and emotional"). No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values; the ending delivers satisfaction without foreclosing any path or demonstrating cost. Interiority consists of stock phrasing and abstraction rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when promptly and commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens, building sensory density toward a quiet RR (Earned Stasis: watchful protection as stance crystallization). However, no on-page event narrows options or forces a trade-off; Azure simply completes an unopposed technical procedure and departs satisfied. The dominant stake—artifact safety—is declared but never tested by a complication, reversal, or cost. The ending reconfigures nothing; it restates the opening premise ("artifact is safe… continue to watch") without felt consequence or conceptual repricing, rendering closure ceremonial rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina, weathered cabin, and lighthouse are anchored early with vivid sensory detail (ice creak, golden light, gull cry). Setting description dominates the text yet remains postcard: no spatial constraint alters Azure's path, no environmental feature complicates the artifact procedure. The final image invokes the lighthouse as symbol without tying its physical properties to a choice or cost, missing the micro-setting constraint that would lift the score into higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>One stake is signaled early (protect the artifact) but no opposition, complication, or internal conflict ever materializes. The "delicate process" unfolds without friction, error, or trade-off; vibrational matching succeeds on first attempt with no visible cost or tactic adjustment. No reversal, deepening, or tightening occurs—Azure walks to the cabin, performs the task, walks back. The Accumulative lens cannot compensate for zero escalation or choice under pressure; the ending grants satisfaction without alteration, renunciation, or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Sonic absolution" and "fleshly ethereal" are invoked repeatedly as prompt labels without concrete grounding in action or image. No epiphany is earned; Azure's closing "peace" is asserted rather than dramatized through conflict and consequence. The final paragraph ("symbol of the fleshly ethereal world") moralizes rather than offering a resonant non-literal answer. Theme remains abstract and unearned, a thesis delivered without particulars that would make it legible through character and event.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and diction attempts a meditative register. However, voice lacks perceptual signature: "logically emotional," "fleshly ethereal atmosphere," "deep sense of purpose" are generic abstractions, not character-specific ways of noticing. Syntactic monotony (long parallel clauses, "As she…" openers) flattens rhythm. No dialogue appears. The register occasionally drifts into New Age therapy-speak ("emotional intuition," "vibrational frequency") that sits uneasily with "lighthouse engineer," though it remains internally consistent and does not head-hop.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn drain momentum: "seemed to vibrate… seemed to resonate… seemed to echo" across adjacent paragraphs; "deep sense of purpose… deep sense of satisfaction… deep, rich shade" recycles "deep" without added pressure. Template cadence ("As she [verb]… As the [noun]…") runs through eight sentences. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed," "felt," "could feel") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("soft, velvety blanket," "rich tapestry of sound") and the closing thematic echo ("fleshly ethereal world") cluster near the ending, obscuring the closure image and disqualifying 9+ globally per artifact-penalty rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—engineer protects mystical artifact through sonic tuning—offers mild genre fusion, but the execution is template-safe: unopposed protagonist completes a technical ritual, feels satisfaction, departs. No turn, trade-off, or fresh moral calculus transforms the material. "Logically emotional," "sonic absolution," "fleshly ethereal" remain prompt labels without concrete transformation. The ending restates the opening without cost or surprise, and multiple famous-line echoes ("soft, velvety blanket," "beacon of hope") further reduce originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Azure Coat is present throughout and performs the central action, but her choices create no turns: she walks to the cabin, completes the procedure unopposed, walks back. Observation and procedural execution dominate; no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in setup, middle, and ending, satisfying the gate model's two-of-three for eligibility up to ~6.0, but causal pressure and closure linkage are absent, capping the score near the ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key appears in one beat ("With the crypt keeper's key in hand, she began…") without prior setup or subsequent return. Its function—unlocking or enabling the alignment process—is asserted but not demonstrated; Azure could perform the same procedure without it with minor edits. Missing setup and closure participation; middle development is summary-only. Swappability and late single mention cap the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Sonic absolution" is mentioned three times as a concept Azure studies and approaches, but never shapes an on-page stake or tactic. It remains thematic decoration: no choice hinges on achieving or failing it, no cost is tied to it, no mechanics are demonstrated. Present as abstract goal but absent from closure image. Ornamental use and swappability (could be "harmonic convergence" or "acoustic sanctification" without structural change) place it low in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is asserted twice as a label ("logically emotional mind," "peace that was both logical and emotional") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. No scene shows contradictory impulses or a trade-off between logic and emotion. The trait exists only as telling, not demonstrated through choice with cost. Label-only mention without causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Adapt" anchors the central task (adapting the artifact's resonance to the marina) and is signaled early, developed in the middle beat, and restated at closure. However, the action unfolds without complication, error, or alternative: Azure adapts successfully on first attempt with no visible adjustment or cost. The process is more procedural than transformative; removing "adapt" and substituting "tune" or "calibrate" would require only minor edits. Functional across beats but replaceable, landing mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>"Vibrational matching" is named once in the opening third as the method and implicitly executed in the middle beat ("aligning the artifact's frequency"). Its mechanics—how Azure performs the matching, what tools or gestures are required, what friction arises—are never shown. The method is told rather than dramatized, and success is immediate. Present in setup and middle but summary-only, missing closure participation and causal specificity. Functional but swappable and lacking demonstrated constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is established early with vivid sensory detail (ice creak, golden light, frozen dock) and recurs in the final image ("ice creaking beneath her feet"). However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics: Azure's path is unobstructed, the environment poses no friction. The ice creak functions as atmospheric motif rather than obstacle. Early setup and closure reprise with texture but no causal pressure place it in the lyric-resonance allowance range, eligible up to ~6.3, but lacking the constraint that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "fleeting golden sunset" is signaled in the opening line, tracked through the middle ("golden light of the sunset faded"), and closes with darkness and stars. The timeframe tightens the window for Azure's task and charges the atmospheric progression. However, no on-page moment shows the sunset pressuring a decision or forcing haste; the procedure unfolds at an unhurried pace. Time functions as lyric bracket rather than live clock. Early signal, middle tracking, and closure participation satisfy all three gates; purposeful reprise reweights the mood with undeniable sensory cost (loss of light), lifting the score into mid-band despite lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To protect a sacred artifact" is stated early as Azure's mission and restated at closure ("the artifact was safe"). The desire frames the narrative and appears in all three structural thirds. However, it is never dramatized through conflict, trade-off, or friction between wants and costs: no threat materializes, no alternative desire competes. The motivation is told and fulfilled without on-page complication. Present across beats and in the ending image, satisfying gate eligibility and showing closure linkage, but lacking the friction and cost that would elevate it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" is invoked three times as a label ("fleshly ethereal atmosphere," "fleshly ethereal world") but never modulates with pressure or inhabits syntax and image. The tone remains uniformly meditative and abstract throughout; no tonal shift marks escalation or closure. The phrase functions as thematic tag rather than lived texture. Static mood without cadence shift or charged final image places it in the functional-but-ornamental band, capped by swappability and lack of integration into voice or rhythm.</comment>
