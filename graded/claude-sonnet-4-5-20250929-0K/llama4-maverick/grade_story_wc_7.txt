<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria's gift of tasting memories remains declarative rather than dramatized through bodily sensation or micro-choices under pressure. The motivation "to create something beautiful" is stated repeatedly but never tested by a competing desire or concrete trade-off on the page. Internal contradiction is absent; she moves smoothly through every beat without genuine struggle, ambivalence, or visible cost. The final "gentle rebellion" is asserted rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by ~120 words with no functional delay; no penalty. Drive lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the celestial alignment and seed-planting unfold without escalation or tightening—no option narrows, no knowledge shifts, no pattern breaks. The ending presents a sprout and summarizes thematic satisfaction without an on-page decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with felt cost. Cost proof test fails: no sentence in the final beat makes visible what Aria has forfeited or endured. Closure unit is missing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly sketched with sensory detail (vines, corroded beams, ethereal light). However, spatial choreography remains vague—Aria's movements through the space are not tracked, and the environment does not constrain a single choice or charge the final image. The seed pot and alignment light remain postcard description rather than tools that alter tactics. Micro-setting test not met; cap at 8.8 ineligible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating a dish during the alignment—is signaled early but never faces opposition, complication, or a trade-off. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Aria plants, cooks, and succeeds without obstacle. The alignment reaches peak and the dish transports diners as promised, but no on-page cost appears and no live option is foreclosed. Escalation absent; band guardrails for 8.0+ not met.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of rebirth from decay is stated overtly in the final paragraphs ("healing," "nurtured a piece of the future") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The knowledge fruit seed functions as a symbolic convenience introduced mid-story to illustrate the theme rather than constrain choice. Thematic Echo penalty: the final lines articulate the thesis in prompt-like language ("gentle rebellion," "beauty forged from ruins") that replaces scene pressure. Apply −0.6 for sermonizing in closure paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Aria. Perceptual signature is generic; her "way of noticing" does not reveal character-specific bias or professional filter. Diction is elevated and consistent but lacks the textural specificity of an individual mind—phrases like "synaptic plasticity" and "rewoven fabric of time" feel authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue appears to judge. Rhythmic control is adequate; no head-hopping or tense drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "testament to forgotten dreams" / "memories…lingered"; "gentle reverence" / "reverence" repeated within three lines; "create something beautiful" appears three times across the text. Template cadence in opening paragraphs: repeated "In…," "Here…," "The…" stems. Stock metaphor strings: "dance on her palate," "fabric of time," "beacon for the future." Apply −1.2 cumulative for loops, template stems, and stock phrasing; no artifact touches closure directly, so remain within Q7. Information density is low; many sentences restate the same thematic claim without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—chef with memory-tasting gift in abandoned garden—closely matches widely used "magical culinary artist" templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The celestial alignment, knowledge fruit seed, and gentle rebellion are invoked as symbolic elements rather than integrated constraints. Derivative Premise Guardrail: apply −1.0 for template reliance. The ending offers no specific synthesis or turn that grows from prior particulars; thematic resolution is asserted rather than discovered.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Aria the chef is present throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics or options. Her gift of tasting memories is declared but never dramatized in a choice under pressure. She plants, cooks, and succeeds without friction; no cost tied to her character trait appears on the page. Setup present, development absent (no middle choice constrained by this trait), payoff ornamental (final summary only). Late first-third introduction, ornamental use −1.0, swappability −0.6, label-only trait −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed appears mid-story, is planted in one beat, and sprouts by the end. Two beats (planting, sprouting) but no causal pressure—it does not narrow options or enable a tactic. The sprout functions as a thematic symbol in the final image but is not reweighted with cost; it simply illustrates rebirth. Setup ~40%, development minimal (planting is descriptive), payoff ornamental. Late introduction −0.4, ornamental closure cameo −0.8, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion is named five times but never shapes an on-page choice or tactic. It remains a thematic label applied to Aria's work rather than a stake that forces trade-offs. No friction between rebellion and consequence appears. Ornamental use −1.0, label-only theme claim −0.3, summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Informally wise" is declared once ("informally wise demeanor") and never constrains or enables an action. No on-page moment shows this trait altering a choice or imposing cost. Label-only mention trends low. Ornamental −1.0, label-only trait −0.3, single-beat cameo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Pruning is described in one paragraph as "gentle reverence" and metaphorically linked to rebellion, but no major turn traces to this action. Aria's pruning does not change her options or the story's direction; it is easily swappable with any preparatory garden task. One beat, no causal pressure. Ornamental −0.8, swappability −0.7, summary rather than dramatized −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>0.8</grade><comment>Synaptic plasticity is mentioned once in a summary line ("hoping to coax it into life through synaptic plasticity") without mechanics, cost, or causal role. It does not shape any attempt or tactic on the page. Single ornamental mention; missing all gates. Ornamental −1.0, late mention −0.5, no beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is established early and provides atmospheric description throughout. It does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, but it frames the entire scene and returns in the final image as "crucible for transformation." Setup strong +0.6, closure linkage (thematic reprise) +0.5, but no causal pressure or constraint on tactics. Ornamental use in middle beats −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.3</grade><comment>The celestial alignment is introduced early and frames the cooking scene, but it imposes no time pressure—no clock tightens Aria's decisions. The alignment "reaches its peak" without consequence if missed. It functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Setup +0.5, closure present (peak moment) +0.4, but no causal pressure −1.0, swappable with any atmospheric event −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to create something beautiful from the ruins" is stated three times and drives Aria's actions, but it is never conflicted by a competing want or tested by cost. No friction between desire and obstacle appears. Setup +0.6, present across beats +0.6, but told-only without dramatized trade-off −1.2, no visible cost −0.5.</comment>
