<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The queen's motivation to unravel her recurring dreams is declared but never embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("sense of trepidation," "sense of purpose") rather than concrete, character-particular perception. The companion remains a silent prop with "deep sadness" as her only trait, applying no relational pressure. The final "truth that was both wondrous, and terrible" is withheld entirely, undercutting any earned change or renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece opens with spatial anchors (cobalt grotto, ridge, clouds) but the Orientation Test is borderline: "who" remains vague (disenchanted from what? ruling where?), and "when" after the final warning carries no on-page constraint. The drive lens reads as attempted Accumulative/Textural (bleeding starlight, lacy imagery), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the queen simply climbs, gazes, and steps forward without narrowing options or reweighting cost. Closure is withheld: "a truth that would change her forever" is summary-only, providing no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing on the page. The "after the final warning" frame is never dramatized or used to constrain a single choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto, ember grotto, and sea of clouds are visually vivid but function as postcards rather than constraints. Spatial choreography is coherent (edge → darkness within → climb to ridge → into ember grotto), and sensory detail is present (ozone, smoke, ash). However, no environmental feature shapes a choice or alters tactics: the queen moves through spaces without resistance, tools, or micro-setting friction. The "lacy glow" and "fiery heart" are ornamental rather than purposeful, and the final descent into darkness remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery of recurring dreams—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The queen's climb is unopposed: no reversal, no trade-off, no visible cost paid en route or at the ending. The companion, the darkness, and the bleeding starlight apply atmospheric pressure but no concrete obstacle that narrows options. The withheld "truth" at closure means no agency, no renunciation, and no foreclosen path is legible. Under any lens, escalation is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of reality unraveling is asserted through "bleeding starlight" and the hooded figure's warning but never enacted through specific events or images that constrain choice. The final paragraph's "wondrous, and terrible" declaration is a thematic echo rather than an earned insight from particulars. Subtext is minimal—gesture, silence, and implication are scarce in the queen's solo monologue-walk. The "lacy menace" tone modulates atmospheric flavor but does not reweight prior material at closure. No motif recurs with shifted meaning; the ember grotto appears twice but remains static.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the queen, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "felt a thrill," "sense of purpose," "shiver run down her spine" recur without character-particular idiom. The one line of dialogue ("Come, let us climb...") is functional but not distinct in rhythm or subtext. Free indirect style is clean, but diction drifts into elevated register ("portentous," "malevolent energy," "foreboding") that flattens voice under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation; the narrative maintains tour-guide clarity throughout the ascent without compression or intimacy shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences pervade: "sense of trepidation... sense of purpose... sense of foreboding... sense of wonder... sense of determination... sense of curiosity... sense of purpose" across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence dominates with "The queen felt..." and "It was as if..." stems recycled without variation. Stock metaphors abound: "sea of clouds," "shimmering expanse of silk," "living, breathing entity," "shadows... writhe and twist." Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed," "gazed") dull immediacy throughout. The closure beat—"a truth that was both wondrous, and terrible"—is the weakest line, reducing potential cost to abstract summary. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops (−0.6), template cadence (−0.5), stock metaphor strings (−0.4), filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (−0.5) = baseline −2.0 in Q7, with artifacts touching the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—queen seeks truth in mystical grotto after prophetic warning—is familiar high-fantasy template without fresh synthesis. The "bleeding starlight" and "lacy menace" offer surface texture but no non-obvious stakes or moral calculus. The withheld revelation and open-ended "journey had only just begun" closer lean on generic portal-fantasy moves. Transformation test: plot and arc function unchanged with different names and places. No bold structural risk or inflection that grows inevitably from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen is on-page throughout but makes no key choices. She declares intent ("let us climb"), ascends without obstacle, and steps forward into the grotto—all momentum without decision or visible cost. Observation and atmosphere dominate; agency is absent at closure, where the "truth" is withheld. Present throughout (setup ✓) but ornamental in middle and ending beats (development ✗, payoff ✗). Late arrival cap does not apply, but lack of causal pressure and closure participation caps the score at ~2.8; swappability and summary-only use lower it further to 2.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears in two beats: mentioned in paragraph 2 as distant memory, then reached and entered in the final third. Its "fiery heart" and "lacy glow" are described but never handled or used to alter tactics. Static description across both appearances; no reweighted meaning at closure—it remains backdrop for the withheld truth. Setup ✓ (mentioned early), development ✗ (middle choice absent), payoff ✗ (cameo in final image, not causally active). Two-gate eligibility (~6.0 ceiling) reduced by ornamental use (−0.7) and late first functional appearance (−0.4) = 4.9, rounded to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is present in setup (paragraph 4 legend, paragraph 8 warning, paragraph 17 intensity) but never shapes on-page stakes or tactics. The queen does not interact with it, test it, or let it constrain a choice. Its mechanics remain abstract; closure withholds whether it causes the "truth." Present as atmospheric motif but causally inert. Setup ✓, development ✗, payoff ✗ (mentioned in final third but not causally active). Ornamental use (−0.8), summary-only (−0.5), swappability (−0.5) = 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" appears once in paragraph 5 as a voice label without constraining or enabling any on-page action. No cost, no tradeoff, no beat involvement. Label-only mention. Setup ✗ (appears mid-story), development ✗, payoff ✗. Ornamental (−1.0), label-only trait (−0.3), swappability (−0.8) = 1.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The climb structures the entire second half: queen and companion ascend to the ridge (paragraph 6–10), then descend into the ember grotto (paragraph 15–19). Two distinct beats; causal linkage weak but present (climb enables discovery). However, the climb itself is unopposed and easily swappable with "journey" or "descent" without structural loss—it supplies transit, not transformation. Setup ✓ (signaled paragraph 6), development ✓ (two beats), payoff ~ (present in final third but closure is withheld). Beat involvement (+0.9), early signal (+0.4), swappability (−0.6), ornamental transit (−0.5) = 5.8, rounded to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>0.9</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears once in paragraph 10 as a lyric image without mechanical setup or constraint on tactics. Ornamental atmosphere; does not shape any attempt or reappear at closure. Setup ✗ (appears late, past 40%), development ✗, payoff ✗. Late introduction (−0.8), ornamental (−1.0), swappability (−0.7) = 0.5; micro lyric presence prevents zero = 0.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto frames the opening and interior darkness is entered at closure, supplying two beats. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the grotto never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the queen moves through it without resistance or resource constraint. Postcard description dominates. Setup ✓ (paragraph 1), development ✗ (no middle choice shaped), payoff ~ (entered at end but withheld truth provides no visible cost tied to the space). Two-gate eligibility (~6.0 ceiling) reduced by ornamental use (−0.9) and no causal pressure (−0.7) = 4.4, rounded to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the final warning" is mentioned in paragraph 8 but never tracked or used to tighten decisions. No on-page clock, no urgency test, no temporal constraint that alters moves. The warning's content ("The starlight bleeds...") is echoed thematically but does not shape tactics. Setup ✓ (signaled early), development ✗, payoff ✗. Ornamental frame (−0.9), summary-only (−0.6), swappability (−0.7) = 1.8; vague presence lifts to 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The motivation to unravel recurring dreams is declared in paragraph 7 and paragraph 19 (final push into grotto). Present in two beats but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—the queen's desire is narrated, not tested. No friction between want and fear on the page. Setup ✓ (paragraph 7, ~33%), development ✗ (no middle choice shaped by this desire), payoff ✗ (closure withholds whether dreams are solved). Told-only (−0.7), ornamental declaration (−0.6), swappability (−0.5) = 4.2; two-beat presence lifts to 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" appears as label in paragraph 12 and "lacy glow" in paragraph 11; tone of dread and atmospheric threat is sustained through "malevolent energy," "foreboding," "oppressive" darkness. Coherent across turns but static—no modulation with pressure, no charge to the final image (which withholds content). Single mood maintained without crescendo or cadence shift at closure. Setup ✓ (paragraph 11–12, mid-story), development ~ (present in atmosphere, not shaping choice), payoff ✗ (tone present but does not reweight the withheld truth). Ornamental consistency (−0.8), static mood (−0.6), label reliance (−0.4) = 3.2; coherent presence lifts to 3.4.</comment>
