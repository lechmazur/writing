<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority remains generic and stock: "shiver run down her spine," "mind begin to clear," "sense of wonder growing within her." The motivation to restore lost faith is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. No meaningful internal contradiction acts in scene; her emotions are summarized in sequential blocks rather than layered. The final "sense of cautious enchantment" reads as a label without embodied cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece lacks on-page closure with cost. Maya completes the excavation and "felt a sense of pride"—no decision narrows options, no path is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The narrative reads as pure summary across weeks ("days turned into weeks") with no causal linkage or decisive change at the end. Orientation is present early (who/where), but the accumulative lens never crystallizes a final image that reweights prior material. The ending paragraph asserts restoration without dramatizing what was risked or lost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard anchors early with vivid particulars: roots snaking between bones, dappled shadows, scent of blooming flowers and damp earth. The sundial base receives concrete attention (grooves, worn smooth stone). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Maya works "tirelessly" without spatial or material friction. The tomb's "dark corridors" and "passageways" remain abstract; no object or micro-setting charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs—Maya excavates smoothly across weeks with no setback, cost, or forced trade-off. "The process was meditative" and she "felt her mind begin to clear" summarize rather than dramatize pressure. The resolution is asserted ("rebuilt something within herself") without agency-driven choice or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of heritage and belonging is declared rather than emergent: "reconnect with her own heritage," "restore lost faith," "sense of belonging." The sundial base recurs but does not shift meaning—it remains a static symbol. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had rebuilt something within herself, a sense of faith and belonging that had been lost." No resonant, non-literal answer arises from particulars; the text tells its thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—Maya notices in tourist-catalog mode ("the way the sunlight filtered," "dappled shadows"). Stock interiority dominates: "shiver run down," "heart began to race" (implied), "sense of wonder growing." Diction is consistent but generic; no character-specific filter shapes what she notices or omits under pressure. No dialogue present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She was warmly curious... she began to explore... she stumbled upon..." and "As she worked... As she worked... As the days turned into weeks... As she made her way... As the excavation drew to a close" create mechanical rhythm. Synonym churn: "sense of homecoming," "sense of responsibility," "sense of wonder," "sense of awe," "sense of pride," "sense of cautious enchantment" (six instances). Stock metaphors: "shiver run down her spine," "thoughts untangling like the roots." High scaffold and low information density across the final third touching closure. Apply Q7 artifact cap and disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The diaspora-returnee-restores-heritage premise is a widely used template executed without fresh transformation. The catacomb orchard offers a vivid detail, but Maya's journey follows a predictable arc: arrival → exploration → meditative work → completion → epiphany. No risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; the emotional and thematic beats could transfer to any heritage-recovery story with minor edits. The sundial base and bones remain scenic rather than driving an irreplaceable turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout but makes no key choice that alters tactics. She observes, explores, and excavates without dramatized decision or cost. The character functions as a passive vehicle for the heritage theme.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sundial base appears in paragraphs 2 and 6—two beats. It anchors Maya's curiosity early ("shiver run down her spine") and returns as "a focal point" and "a symbol of the connection" in the final paragraph. However, it is not handled or used to constrain choice; its meaning does not shift. Present in closure image but ornamental there, not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Interrupted journeys" is mentioned once in paragraph 1 ("interrupted journeys and fragmented memories") but never shapes on-page stakes or alters tactics. It reads as thematic backdrop rather than a constraint or pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears in paragraph 2 and motivates exploration, but no on-page cost or tradeoff is tied to the trait. It functions as a label for her mood rather than a constraint that complicates choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Rebuild" threads through the narrative (paragraphs 4, 8: "rebuilding," "restoring," "rebuilt") and frames the dominant stake. However, the rebuilding itself is summarized over weeks without a specific turn where the action redefines options. Present in closure ("rebuilt something within herself") but as assertion, not dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is named in paragraph 3 and described ("spend hours uncovering... meditative"), but the mechanics do not matter to the outcome. It could be replaced with "careful excavation" or "patient work" without structural change. The method is present but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard anchors the opening and recurs (roots, bones, trees, tomb structure). It pressures Maya's attention and supplies the excavation site, shaping at least one beat (discovery of the sundial base). The final image places her "surrounded by the bones and the trees." Present across setup, middle, and closure, but never constrains a choice with cost—postcard pressure rather than tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("days turned into weeks") is mentioned in paragraph 6 but remains vague. No ticking clock or deadline tightens decisions; the excavation proceeds without temporal pressure. Time is present as duration but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Restore lost faith" is declared in paragraph 4 as the motivation and reasserted in the final paragraph ("rebuilt... a sense of faith"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. No on-page friction between what restoration costs and what Maya wants otherwise. The motivation frames the plot but lacks embodied tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is named in paragraphs 3 and 8, bookending the piece. The tone reads as meditative wonder with restraint ("unsettling sense," "quiet beauty," "awe... both exhilarating and daunting"). It modulates subtly with discovery beats and charges the final image. However, the tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure; no tonal turn intensifies the ending.</comment>
