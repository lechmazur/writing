<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The painter's interiority is heavily abstracted through stock phrasing ("heart swelled with hope," "eyes shining with accomplishment") rather than embodied contradiction. Motivation remains declarative—proving strangers remember kindness—but never faces a concrete on-page test or tradeoff. The final "accomplishment" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path, reading as summary rather than earned renunciation or decision. Internal conflict is told in alternating summary blocks rather than shown as simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a legible closure unit with on-page cost. The painter begins creating, continues creating, and finishes creating with "accomplishment" and "hope" declared but no visible before/after in options, knowledge, or stance. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (rooftop greenhouse, painter, night). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural but no decisive cadence shift or pattern break reweights the stake; the ending restates the opening mood without reconfiguration or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse and smog are anchored early and the moon recurs across beats, but setting remains postcard-descriptive rather than constraint-active. The brush is handled once; no tool, spatial fact, or environmental feature alters a choice or charges the closure image. Sensory detail defaults to visual cataloging ("ethereal glow," "silver glow") without urgency modulation or POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reviving lost languages to prove strangers remember kindness—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the painter moves from contemplation to creation without opposition, tradeoff, or cost. Agency is passive (gazing, pondering, feeling) until the final act of painting, which proceeds without friction. Pressure remains static; coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme—connection and kindness amid urban alienation—is stated overtly in multiple paragraphs rather than emerging from particulars. The lost languages function as a declared symbol without constraining choice or accumulating pressure. The ending offers a moral summary ("beauty and connection were always within reach") instead of a resonant non-literal answer. The calligrapher's brush and "saffron quiet" are introduced as atmospheric tokens without earned recurrence or reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("ethereal," "transcribe," "kaleidoscope") that fits the painter's interiority, though diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("power of kindness and creativity"). Perceptual signature is weak; the narrator's noticing defaults to generic lyricism rather than character-specific bias. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") stack in reflective passages without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "heart swelled with hope" / "promise of a brighter future," "saffron quiet of the night" recurs three times without reweighting. Scaffold phrasing: "As she [verb]" opens five sentences; "The painter's [noun]" opens six. Stock metaphors cluster without coherent vehicle: "sea of color and sound," "flame of hope," "whispers of the past." Information density is low; multiple paragraphs restate the project's purpose without advancing action or altering stance. Template cadence and synonym churn reduce propulsion across the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—urban artist reviving lost beauty—follows a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The lost languages remain abstract; no specific script, character, or linguistic rule shapes tactics. Calligraphy as a vehicle for connection and the rooftop sanctuary amid pollution read as median symbolic choices. No turn or inflection grows from prior particulars to surprise or reweight in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Insomniac painter is present throughout but makes no pivotal choice. She gazes, ponders, recalls, and finally paints—each action flows without opposition or tradeoff. The insomnia trait is mentioned in the opening clause and never constrains a decision or tactic. Observation and summary dominate; no agency-driven turn alters the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Calligrapher's moon-tipped brush appears in paragraph 5 (workbench description), is picked up in paragraph 17, and used across two beats of creation. It does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the final image references it generically ("stroke by stroke, with the calligrapher's moon-tipped brush") without charging the moment. Functional but replaceable; no unique property matters.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lost languages are declared as the project's subject and repeated across multiple paragraphs ("revive the lost languages," "forgotten tongues," "lost languages seemed to pulse"). The concept never shapes on-page tactics, constrains a choice, or supplies a concrete obstacle. It remains thematic wallpaper rather than a causal driver or closure participant.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" appears once in paragraph 2 as a facial descriptor and never recurs or enables/constrains an action. The painter's hope is asserted throughout but the "methodically" modifier does no causal work. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears in paragraph 9: "began to rouse a sense of purpose within her." The action is interior and passive, triggering a declarative shift in motivation rather than a concrete turn. The story could replace "rouse" with "awaken" or "spark" without altering beats. It does not redefine options or drive the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Daydreams sparked by moonlight" is named in paragraph 9 but the mechanics are never shown. The painter recalls memories and then paints; no on-page demonstration of how moonlight triggers specific images or choices. The method is asserted, not dramatized, and does not shape attempts or constrain the creative process.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Rooftop greenhouse in smog-choked city is anchored early and recurs across beats. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure a choice or alter tactics. The greenhouse is a sanctuary; no feature (access, plant, tool, spatial fact) constrains the painter's action or charges the closure image. Postcard-level integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Waxing moon appears in paragraphs 2, 22, and 31 as a lighting source and atmospheric anchor. Time progression from night to dawn is noted but does not tighten decisions; the painter works uninterrupted. No live clock alters moves or imposes cost. The timeframe is descriptive rather than pressure-active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To prove that strangers remember kindness" is stated in paragraph 11 and restated in paragraphs 12 and 24. The motivation is never dramatized through a choice that conflicts with another want or imposes a cost. It remains a declared thesis rather than a friction-generating desire tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears in paragraphs 8, 23, and 33, anchoring a consistent atmospheric register. Tone does not modulate with pressure; the mood remains static across all beats. The phrase recurs without reweighting or charging the final image, functioning as a repeated label rather than a tonal shift that deepens stakes.</comment>
