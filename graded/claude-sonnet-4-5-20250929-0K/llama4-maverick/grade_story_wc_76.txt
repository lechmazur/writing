<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The clock maker remains a label throughout; his "neatly inventive mind" is asserted repeatedly but never embodied in a micro-choice under pressure. No internal contradiction appears—he moves from curious to excited to exhilarated in a smooth upward arc without friction. The final transformation is declared ("he would never be the same") rather than earned through visible cost or foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed (who/where/when crystallize only after multiple paragraphs of atmospheric setup), triggering the −0.3 penalty. The piece presents a linear sequence—enter, find stone, descend, find yoyo, solve puzzle, glow—with no meaningful reversal or tightening; each step succeeds without obstacle. The "closure" is a declaration of transformation and future possibility rather than a decisive change with visible cost on the page. Under a causal lens (the dominant mode attempted here), the puzzle's solution lands off-page in summary ("the puzzle finally yielded"), and no felt price appears in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, rocky island, and low tide frame the action, and sensory details (salt, seaweed, candlelight, wind) are present. However, the environment never constrains a choice—the clock maker navigates "dimly lit corridors" and finds hidden compartments without friction. Spatial choreography is vague (we never learn the lighthouse's layout or how deep "the depths" are). The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking the hunger stone's latent radiance—is signaled early but faces no opposition. The clock maker descends, finds the yoyo exactly where legend promised, and reverse-engineers it with a mind that "worked tirelessly" in summary. No choice narrows options, no failure forces adaptation, and the resolution is given rather than earned. The puzzle's difficulty is asserted ("painstaking") but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of stepping beyond fate and transformation is stated explicitly in the final paragraphs rather than emerging from particulars. The hunger stone and yoyo function as magical keys that unlock power without moral calculus or ambiguity. "Latent radiance" and "bleak exhilaration" are invoked as labels but not embodied in image or action. The ending moralizes ("a reminder of the power that lay hidden") instead of offering a resonant non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent third-person limited stance with elevated diction ("forsaken place," "bowels," "reverent hands"). However, the lexicon drifts toward stock fantasy phrasing ("otherworldly light," "beacon of hope") and the perceptual signature never individualizes—what a clock maker notices is identical to what any fantasy protagonist would notice. The prose reads competent but generic, with no rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "mysterious lighthouse" recurs six times, "neatly inventive" three times, and the final four paragraphs restate transformation in synonym cycles ("changed," "transformed," "carry the latent radiance within him"). Template cadence dominates ("As he [verb]" opens five sentences in close succession). Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "felt") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("heart pounded," "wind whipping") and therapy-speak ("bleak exhilaration") reduce specificity. Applying the artifact penalty pack: −1.2 in Q7 for loops, cadence, and stock phrasing touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—mystical puzzle-solving in a lighthouse—follows a familiar template without fresh inflection. The clock maker's profession never informs his approach (no clock-making skill applied to the yoyo). "Latent radiance" and "stepping beyond fate" are abstract quest-fantasy labels rather than specific lived stakes. The yoyo, hunger stone, and lighthouse could be swapped for any magical objects and setting without altering the emotional arc. No risk-taking or transformation of tropes appears.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The clock maker is present throughout but makes no choice that creates a turn—he follows a linear path of discovery. His decisions (touch the stone, descend, lift the yoyo) are curiosity-driven moves with no cost or alternative. Observation and assertion dominate; no beat hinges on his agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hunger stone appears in beat one (discovery) and beat three (glowing at closure), meeting setup and payoff. However, its use is passive: the clock maker touches it, carries it, and watches it glow. It does not constrain a choice or alter tactics mid-story. The stone's "cryptic symbols" are mentioned but never engaged. Present across beats but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Latent radiance" is introduced as legend, asserted as growing during the puzzle, and then manifests as glowing light. It never shapes tactics or creates a trade-off—the clock maker does not wrestle with whether to unlock it or weigh a cost. The concept remains thematic decoration rather than on-page stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Neatly inventive" is a label repeated three times but never demonstrated in action. The reverse-engineering process is summarized ("his mind worked tirelessly, piecing together fragments") without showing inventive problem-solving or a cost tied to this trait. No on-page tradeoff or constraint appears.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Initiate" appears once in narration ("he would have to…initiate this power") and again at the end ("he had initiated a new path"). The action is not dramatized—the puzzle's solution is summarized, and the glow happens to the stone rather than being triggered by a specific act. The term is present but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The yoyo is discovered in beat two and reverse-engineered in beat three. Its "intricate carvings and mysterious symbols" are mentioned, but the mechanics of the puzzle are never shown—only that "the clock maker's neatly inventive mind worked tirelessly." The method is told, not demonstrated, and does not shape attempts or create friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse frames all action and supplies the yoyo's hiding place. The "rocky island" and "crumbling walls" set atmosphere, and the descent into "musty bowels" structures movement. However, the setting never pressures a choice—corridors are navigated without obstacle, and the hidden compartment is simply found. Setup and development present; payoff weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"Under the slow exhale of low tide" appears twice as a lyric refrain but does not function as a clock. No urgency tied to the tide is dramatized—the clock maker's timeline is leisurely. The phrase decorates but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"To step beyond fate's design" is stated as motivation in the middle and echoed at the end. The desire is never dramatized in friction or choice—no moment shows the clock maker wrestling with fate or paying a price to transcend it. The motivation is asserted rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" appears once near the end and the piece sustains a tone of atmospheric mystery throughout. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully—the clock maker moves from curiosity to excitement to triumph in a smooth arc. The "bleak" element is label-only; no cost or shadow charges the final image.</comment>
