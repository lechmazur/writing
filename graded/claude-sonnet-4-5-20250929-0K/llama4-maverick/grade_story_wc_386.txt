<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aria remains abstract throughout—her "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" role is asserted but never dramatized through specific choices under pressure. Interiority relies on stock phrases ("weight of her mission," "sense of wonder") rather than embodied contradiction. The vision sequence tells us she "felt" and "sensed" without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; she simply "steps out" with purpose declared but not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—we lack clear anchors for who Aria is beyond labels, where precisely she sits, or what immediate problem drives the scene. The piece reads as a single extended vision without causal linkage: each revelation ("she saw," "the vision shifted") is told rather than motivated by prior choice. No on-page closure effect lands; Aria's exit with the globe is asserted purpose, not a decisive change with visible cost. Drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal, never settling.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine and glacier ice provide vivid texture ("frozen floor," "melting ice scent"), and the melted snow globe is handled twice (touched, then carried out). However, setting never constrains a choice—Aria could conduct this vision anywhere. The final walk onto "the glacier's vast expanse" arrives too late to pressure tactics, reading as postcard backdrop rather than lived constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to salvage something pure from the wreckage"—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the vision unfolds in a passive "and-then" chain with no protagonist agency driving turns. The snow globe "began to glow" and "windows of connection" open without Aria making a choice that narrows options or incurs cost. Coincidence (the vision arriving, the pattern forming) provides all movement.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of connection and salvage is stated directly ("weave these fragments into a tapestry of truth") rather than emerging from dramatized events. The snow globe as motif appears three times but never constrains a choice—it's ornamental recurrence, not resonance. The ending substitutes abstract hope ("sense of purpose," "promise of connections") for a concrete image that reweights prior material. No earned insight arises from specific struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature leans toward the mystical ("ethereal glow," "borrowed starlight"), but diction often drifts into generic high register ("realm of the subconscious," "invisible threads") that doesn't feel character-particular. Repeated template stems ("Aria's eyes," "Aria felt," "As she") create rhythmic monotony. No dialogue present to judge. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "saw") dominate without contributing voice texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "wreckage" and "salvage" churn across a dozen lines without adding pressure; "connection" and "threads" synonym-cycle without progression. Template cadence runs dominate—"Aria's X," "The Y," "As she Z"—across 8+ consecutive paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("stars on a moonless night," "broken shell") lack fresh angles. The closure paragraph stacks five generic assertions ("mysteries," "guidance," "darkness didn't seem so overwhelming") that deflate rather than propel.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—ghost whisperer analyzing dream cameos from a glacier shrine—assembles exotic elements but doesn't synthesize them into fresh causality; the vision could occur in any mystical setting with minor edits. Core turns (vision arriving, pattern forming, windows opening) feel prompted rather than inevitable. The "wreck-diver" trait and "weaves truth carefully" attribute are mentioned once each without shaping action. Emotional arc is generic quest-for-meaning without particularized stakes or transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Aria is present throughout but makes no key choices—she observes visions and "steps out" at the end. The "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" label appears once in paragraph two and never informs tactics or costs. Removing her specific occupation would not alter the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in three beats: on the pedestal (touched, igniting memories), glowing during the vision, and carried out at the end. It reweights slightly—solid to melted to empty—but does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff. Present early, involved in the vision climax, but replaceable with any mystical focus object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is introduced late (final third) and functions as thematic label rather than shaping stakes. The phrase appears twice—once when the windows "swing open" and once as retrospective summary. It does not alter Aria's tactics or create on-page cost; it's a metaphor for what has already happened passively.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears once as exposition ("a trait that had become both her gift and her curse") in paragraph three. No on-page action demonstrates this trait, no cost or constraint arises from it, and removing the sentence would not affect any beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Expose" is mentioned twice: Aria aims "to expose the hidden patterns" and later "to expose the truth that lay hidden." Both instances are summary declarations of intent, not dramatized actions. No beat shows her choosing to reveal something with consequence; the visions unfold passively. Swappable with "discover" or "uncover."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The method—analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams—is introduced in paragraph ten and explained once ("by analyzing these appearances"). It does not shape the mechanics of the vision scene; Aria passively receives images. Mentioned as her general practice but not enacted with specific cost or friction on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice is established early (paragraphs one and two) and supplies vivid texture. Aria sits within it, and the candles are noted multiple times. However, the setting does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter outcome—she could conduct this vision in any enclosed mystical space. The glacier's "vast expanse" at the end is postcard description.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Timeframe required element is None.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated twice—once as Aria's motivation (paragraph eleven) and reprised near the end (paragraph twenty-three). It frames her general desire but is never tested by an on-page choice with competing costs. Told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and obstacles.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears early as atmospheric descriptor ("atmosphere was one of borrowed starlight") and returns in the final paragraphs ("borrowed starlight still lingered"). Tone is consistent—ethereal, mystical, soft—but does not modulate under pressure or charge the final image with new meaning. Static mood rather than dynamic tonal shift that reweights stakes.</comment>
