<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael functions primarily as observer rather than agent—his "investigation" produces no micro-choices that alter tactics or foreclose options until the very end when he picks up the boutonnière. The stranger's interiority is gestured at ("a flicker of something—a memory, perhaps") but remains label-only; no embodied contradiction acts in scene. The final gesture of retrieving the boutonnière lacks visible cost or a credible path foreclosed by that choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening lines. The closure unit—Kael retrieving the boutonnière and returning to the lighthouse—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than undeniable on the page. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (mist, lighthouse lore, borrowed memories build density), yet the ending does not decisively reweight prior material; the stranger's departure and Kael's retrieval feel like a graceful fade rather than a crystallized choice or reconfiguration with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (salt, damp earth, swirling fog). The setting charges atmosphere throughout, and the lighthouse legend subtly pressures the stranger's gaze and Kael's final retrieval. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains backdrop rather than active constraint at closure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early but never tightens into a live choice with visible cost. Kael's "investigation" involves passive observation; no reversal narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The stranger's departure and Kael's retrieval lack the escalation or deepening required under the Accumulative lens; pressure dissipates rather than crystallizes, and the final act feels like acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The borrowed-memories conceit and the boutonnière as "key" gesture toward theme without overt moralizing, and the final image (Kael holding the boutonnière, "a tangible connection") offers a quiet, non-literal answer. However, the thematic question never sharpens into a choice or contradiction that the ending reweights with undeniable cost. The closing paragraphs lean toward summary ("the weight of the memories, a cumulative burden") rather than letting the image speak, and lines like "a reminder of the lives that had touched his own" edge into articulated theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though vocabulary occasionally drifts elevated ("nautical twilight," "repository of sorts") in ways that feel more writerly than character-specific for a lighthouse keeper. The perceptual filter is selective (scuffed shoes, the stranger's gaze) but lacks a truly idiosyncratic signature. Free indirect style is clean, and the rhythm modulates appropriately across beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean with varied sentence structure. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "lost in thought" recurs three times; "mist swirled" / "mist...swirling" / "mist continued to swirl" across adjacent paragraphs; "witnessed isolation" is named twice in quick succession. Template cadence runs appear ("As the stranger stood... Kael began... He noticed..."). These artifacts dull momentum in the final third but do not obscure causality. Information density is moderate; many sentences advance atmosphere rather than doing double duty with character or pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse-as-memory-repository and the boutonnière as mnemonic key are evocative but not freshly synthesized—the borrowed-memories premise reads as a stock metaphor for place and nostalgia. The "by observing gaps" investigative method is declared but never dramatized with specificity. Kael's passivity and the stranger's vague departure prevent the ending from feeling inevitable in hindsight. The tonal register is competent but safe, avoiding bold structural or perspectival risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael appears in the opening beat and frames the investigation, but his "choices" are limited to passive observation until the very end when he retrieves the boutonnière—a gesture that does not alter tactics or foreclose a path with visible cost. He is present at setup and closure but lacks middle development through decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The boutonnière appears in three distinct beats: the stranger inhales it (establishing a memory link), it lies "abandoned at [Kael's] feet" after the stranger departs, and Kael retrieves and carries it to the lighthouse. The object gains reweighted meaning across these touches and shapes the final image, but its causal pressure remains oblique—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Borrowed memories are introduced as lighthouse lore in the middle third and echo thematically in Kael's reflection at the end ("borrowed memories that connected him"). The concept never constrains an on-page choice or alters tactics; it remains atmosphere and theme rather than a stake-shaping force. It is present in setup (as legend) and closure (as reflection) but lacks middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" describes the stranger's stride in the opening and recurs as "a softly persistent presence" for the mist at the end. The trait is label-only; it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Swappable with "steady" or "quiet" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Investigate" is named explicitly ("Kael began to investigate the scene") and drives Kael's observations (scuffed shoes, the stranger's gaze). However, the investigation produces no key turn—Kael's method yields no discovery that changes his options or the stranger's departure. The action is present in setup and middle but does not decisively shape the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is declared as Kael's method ("observe the gaps—the small inconsistencies") but never demonstrated with specificity. No gap is identified on the page, and the method does not shape an attempt or discovery. Mentioned once in exposition without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The opal dock in mist is established early, revisited across beats, and appears in the final image ("the memories that lingered on the opal dock"). The setting charges atmosphere and frames the encounter but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. It is present in all three gates (setup, middle, closure) but remains decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is named in the opening and closing ("at nautical twilight," "the last remnants of light faded"), establishing a temporal frame. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure forces Kael's hand. It provides mood but does not alter tactics or escalate stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Decoding the stranger's gesture is named as Kael's goal ("to decode the stranger's final gesture") and frames his observations throughout. The motivation is dramatized in his curiosity and final retrieval of the boutonnière. However, the desire never faces friction or cost—Kael's investigation encounters no obstacle, and the stranger's departure leaves the question unresolved rather than forcing a choice. Present in all three gates but lacks pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is named twice and sustained through imagery (mist, the solitary dock, the sentinel lighthouse). Tone remains coherent across beats and modulates slightly from curiosity to melancholy. The final image charges the mood with Kael alone, holding the boutonnière. However, the tone does not shift decisively under pressure—it remains a single static mood rather than reweighting the stake at closure.</comment>
