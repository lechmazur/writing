<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The novelist's interiority consists almost entirely of abstract, therapy-speak labels ("turmoil," "sense of calm," "sense of wonder") without embodied contradiction or specific micro-choices under pressure. The woman in white functions as a symbolic prop rather than an on-page character applying relational pressure. The final "success" and "gratitude" are asserted rather than earned through dramatized struggle with visible cost. Internal conflict is told in summary ("fear of failure held her back") rather than shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when remain vague past 120 words—"feral nexus" is never anchored spatially or temporally, and the mist setting offers no concrete geography or clock. Apply −0.4 for orientation debt; cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit is a stated completion ("she had succeeded") without visible cost or a legible change in options; the woman's approval is asserted, not dramatized. The piece reads as a single extended reflection with no because/therefore linkage—encounters happen to the protagonist (woman appears, words flow) rather than arising from her choices. No clear drive lens emerges; accumulative designs require pattern-teaching and cadence shift, neither of which is present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The "feral nexus" remains an abstraction without spatial anchors, sensory hierarchy, or physical constraint. The mist "swirls" decoratively in opening and closing without altering tactics or access. The shell is described visually but never handled, moved, or used to constrain a choice. No body, tool, or environment constrains the protagonist's options or charges the final image—setting functions as atmospheric wallpaper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—overcoming writer's block—is signaled early but never tested by on-page choices with visible cost. The woman's appearance is coincidental and solves the problem (words begin to flow) without the protagonist earning the shift through agency or renunciation. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the mist clears and she writes, with no price paid or path foreclosed. Escalation is absent; the piece moves from stuck to unstuck via external validation rather than internal alteration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated directly in final-paragraph moralizing: "she would carry the lessons," "the power of the subconscious," "the magic that lay just beyond." The shell and woman are symbolic tokens invoked repeatedly but never reweighted through specific action. The ending asserts "something true" and "resonance" rather than offering a non-literal answer to a dramatized question. The piece abstracts its own meaning instead of letting particulars speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The voice is consistent but generic literary register ("inexplicable tug," "swirling patterns," "sense of peace") without perceptual signature or character-specific bias. Psychic distance drifts: the woman "seemed to whisper words of encouragement" (uncertain) then definitively "urged her" (certain). No dialogue to evaluate. Diction remains stable but elevated and interchangeable—could belong to any literary narrator describing any creative struggle. Free indirect style is absent; all interiority is neutral summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "sense of calm"/"sense of wonder"/"sense of peace"/"sense of connection"/"sense of completion"/"sense of gratitude" recur without added pressure. Template cadence runs through "she felt" and "she knew" openings across a dozen sentences. Stock phrases cluster: "swimming against the current," "follow her heart," "true voice," "magic that lay just beyond." Apply −1.2 for loops and scaffold across high-frequency beats; the final paragraph is especially dense with synonym churn. Figurative language ("swirling hush") is repeated without evolving meaning.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—writer's block broken by mystical encounter—is a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The woman in white, mist, shell, and "feral nexus" are stock mystical elements assembled without fresh synthesis. The protagonist's journey is told in generic terms ("true voice," "deeper meaning") that could apply to any creative-struggle story. No bold risk or surprising inflection; the ending satisfies expectations without reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The conflicted novelist is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. Her struggle is summarized; the woman's appearance solves the block without the novelist choosing or renouncing. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The spiral seashell fragment appears in paragraph one, is mentioned as "now imbued with new significance" and "now a talisman," and sits on her desk at the end. It is described but never handled, picked up, or used to constrain a choice. Functional in closure reprise but swappable with any symbolic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Against the current" is mentioned twice as metaphor ("swimming against the current," "navigate against the current") but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. It functions as thematic echo rather than causal pressure. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears once in paragraph six as a label for her mental state while gazing at the shell. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action, create a tradeoff, or affect a choice. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Solemnize" appears once in paragraph seven: "she had to solemnize her thoughts, to commit them to paper." It names an intention but is not enacted; no turn traces to this action. Easily swappable with "formalize" or "record." Functional mention without causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Through ephemeral cameo appearances" is signaled in paragraph fifteen and enacted twice (woman in white appears, vanishes, reappears). The method matters—her appearances frame the before and after—but it does not constrain tactics or generate friction. Present in setup and closure; functional but replaceable with other mystical visitation devices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The "feral nexus" is named in paragraphs one, thirteen, twenty-three, and twenty-six but never given spatial properties or used to constrain a choice. It functions as atmospheric label rather than lived setting. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" appears once in paragraph sixteen as metaphor. No clock or deadline tightens the protagonist's decisions; time is untracked. Ornamental phrase without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To collect the shapes of different hopes" is stated twice (paragraphs fifteen and twenty-seven) as thematic claim but never dramatized in a choice with cost. The motivation is told rather than tested; we do not see her pursuing or weighing different hopes on the page. Functional mention without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Swirling hush" appears explicitly three times and the tone is coherent—quiet, lyric, reflective—throughout. It modulates slightly (mist closes in, clears, closes again) in step with her internal shifts. Present in setup and closure; tone supports the concept but does not charge the final image with new pressure. Functional and consistent but static.</comment>
