<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to confront the ultraviolet forest is declared but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority relies heavily on abstract trauma labels ("trauma responses guiding her") rather than embodied, character-particular sensation. The proprioceptive enhancement is mentioned but never constrains a choice or reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost. Arin's presence applies minimal relational pressure; his concern is stated, not tested.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—"after the anesthesia wore off" and "makeshift clinic" emerge gradually—but the effect doesn't charge closure, triggering a −0.3 penalty and Q3 cap at 7.0. The drive lens reads as hybrid causal-textural: Elara's decision to enter the forest is causal, but the forest sequence shifts to accumulative sensory description without clear because/therefore linkage. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing ("mathematics of mercy") with stated peace, but the cost is asserted ("ultraviolet penance lifting") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or image that reweights prior material. The rescue mission and interrogation backstory are referenced but not anchored in present causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vivid and recurs across beats, and its "pulsing light growing brighter" subtly pressures Elara's approach. However, spatial choreography inside the forest is vague—trees "twisting and writhing" without clear distance, proximity, or path logic. The clearing's "intense, pulsating energy" charges the conceptual climax but remains abstract; no tool, body constraint, or micro-setting detail alters Elara's tactics or final choice. The cap at 7.0 due to orientation debt in Q2 applies.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confronting trauma to understand mercy—is signaled early, but escalation is weak: Elara walks into the forest, remembers pain, then grasps the truth without a meaningful tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The forest "responding to her presence" and light "growing brighter" imply accumulative pressure, yet no on-page reversal or cost-legible choice occurs. The ending asserts relief ("sense of peace") and closure ("I remember") without demonstrating what was risked or forfeited. Agency defaults to endurance rather than decision with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—mercy's mathematics, trauma reckoning—is present but relies on abstract terms ("mathematics of mercy," "ultraviolet penance") that are stated rather than dramatized through concrete particulars. The forest's pulsing light and Elara's tears suggest emotional resonance, but the epiphany arrives as summary ("finally grasped the truth") without a non-literal image or action that reweights prior material. The ending's "sense of peace" and "I remember" read as tidy resolution rather than a question answered through specific experience. No recurring motif (pewter mask strap appears once) constrains the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with clear psychic distance. Diction is generally consistent, though phrases like "proprioceptively enhanced senses screamed in protest" and "mathematics of mercy" drift toward elevated register without clear character grounding. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Arin's lines pursue a goal (keeping Elara safe) but lack subtext or tension. Perceptual signature is generic—"eyes snapped open," "gaze drifted"—and does not reflect trauma-specific filtering. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are sparse and acceptable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Template cadence appears in the forest sequence: "Elara felt... She recalled... Elara's proprioceptively enhanced senses... She was getting close, she could feel it" (−0.4). Paraphrase loop: "The memories came flooding back as she recalled the pain" immediately after "trauma responses were still there" restates without advancing pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor: "screamed in protest," "pulsed with otherworldly energy." Sentence openings repeat "Elara's" and "She" across adjacent lines, creating mechanical rhythm. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance. Clarity is intact, but propulsion sags in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise—trauma survivor enters mystical forest for redemption—follows a recognizable template (journey-to-healing arc) without a fresh inflection in character choice, world logic, or moral calculus. The "ultraviolet forest" and "mathematics of mercy" are novel labels, but their function defaults to generic revelation-space. The pewter mask strap is mentioned once and dropped, suggesting checklist use rather than organic integration. No turn or image feels inevitable in hindsight; Elara's epiphany could be swapped for another mystical insight with minor edits. Derivative premise penalty −0.8 applies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara (enhanced interrogation survivor) is present throughout and her backstory frames the stakes, but her survivor status does not drive key turns—her decision to enter the forest and her epiphany occur without on-page choices that test competing impulses or cost. She observes and endures more than she decides. Early setup and closure presence meet two gates, but causal pressure and specificity are weak. Late penalty does not apply; swappability moderate (survivor trait could be replaced with other trauma). Band guidance: functional but replaceable, nearing the low edge of shaping one turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The pewter mask strap appears once in backstory memory ("the feel of the pewter mask strap digging into her skin") and is mentioned again in the final third as "a distant memory," but it is never handled on the page, does not constrain a choice, and its return does not reweight meaning—Elara simply notes it is past. Setup gate met (first third); development and closure gates missing. Ornamental use −0.7, summary-only −0.5, no causal work. Cap for missing middle development at 3.4, further reduced by frictions.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance is named and the forest is described as "a place of reckoning," shaping Elara's motivation to enter, but the concept does not constrain tactics or choices within the forest—she walks, remembers, and receives insight without friction. The "penance lifting" is asserted at closure but not dramatized as a cost or trade-off. Setup gate met (motivation stated early); closure gate met (mentioned in ending); development gate weak (no middle choice shaped by it). Swappability high (could be "karmic debt" or "soul trial"). Cap at 3.8 for swappability, additive signals modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Proprioceptively enhanced is mentioned three times ("screamed in protest," "stiff from prolonged immobility," "on high alert") but never constrains or enables a choice with visible cost—it describes sensation without altering tactics or creating a trade-off. Label-only use −0.6, no causal pressure. Setup gate met (first paragraph); development and closure gates missing. Cap for missing middle development at 3.4, reduced by label-only friction and lack of cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Brace is stated as Elara's intention ("brace herself for what was to come") and recurs at the clearing approach ("Elara steeled herself"), shaping her decision to persist, but the action itself does not create a turn—no moment where bracing alters outcome or cost. It reflects resolve rather than driving escalation. Setup gate met; development weak (middle mentions are restatements); closure gate absent (final image is peace and memory, not bracing). Causal involvement modest; one beat shaped +0.4, but swappability moderate and no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses is stated early ("trauma responses guiding her") and recurs in the forest sequence ("trauma responses guiding her through the dark memories"), shaping Elara's navigation, and the ending hinges on "I remember." Setup and closure gates met; development gate met (guides middle choices). However, the mechanics are vague—how trauma responses guide is not dramatized—and the method could be swapped for "instinct" or "sensory triggers" with minor edits. Causal pressure weak, swappability −0.6, summary-only −0.4. Band guidance: functional but replaceable, nearing the low edge of shaping one turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is present throughout, its pulsing light "growing brighter" as Elara approaches the clearing, and it frames the climax location. Setup, development, and closure gates all met. The forest pressures Elara's advance (light guides, energy intensifies) and the clearing is where she grasps the truth. However, no micro-setting detail (terrain, distance, obstacle) constrains her tactics; the forest functions as thematic backdrop more than tactical pressure. Causal pressure moderate +0.7, beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but specificity low (could be any mystical space). Band guidance: shapes multiple beats and ending, nearing essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening and Elara's immediate state (waking, disoriented), shaping the setup. The forest journey unfolds in linear present tense with no clock pressure—time is tracked vaguely ("as she walked," "getting close") without tightening decisions. Setup gate met; development and closure gates weak (time does not alter tactics or charge the ending). Early signal +0.5, one beat involvement +0.4, but no escalation or cost tied to elapsed time. Band guidance: shapes one turn.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to discover the mathematics of mercy is stated explicitly ("I need to understand the mathematics of mercy") and drives Elara's decision to enter the forest, shaping the dominant stake. Setup and development gates met; closure gate met (ending asserts understanding achieved). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no friction between mercy and self-preservation, no visible cost at the moment of choice. Causal pressure moderate +0.8, beat involvement (two beats) +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but swappability high (could be "truth" or "peace"). Band guidance: shapes one key turn, nearing essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Displaced rooted tone is gestured at in the phrase "sense of displaced rooted-ness" but not sustained or modulated—Elara's narration remains consistent in register and rhythm throughout, from waking to epiphany, without a tonal shift that charges the final image. The tone reads as somber-serious rather than oscillating between displacement and rootedness. Setup gate weak (one mention); development and closure gates missing (no tonal evolution). Ornamental use −0.7, label-only −0.3, no closure charge. Band guidance: present but not functional.</comment>
