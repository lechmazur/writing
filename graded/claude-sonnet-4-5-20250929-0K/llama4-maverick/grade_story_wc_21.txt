<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Naomi remains a passive observer throughout; her "search for truth" is declared but never tested by on-page choice with visible cost. Ada's retrocognitive state is label-only; we see her arrange debris but no internal contradiction or trade-off emerges. The "parley" is summarized ("their conversation weaving together threads") rather than dramatized, and Naomi's understanding arrives via assertion ("began to grasp") without micro-choices that foreclose options. No credible transformation or endurance with felt cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within opening lines (no orientation penalty). However, closure is absent: the final paragraph loops back to continuation ("would return... again and again") without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes a before/after legible with cost. The zeppelin "sails on" in open continuation rather than crystallizing stakes or foreclosing a path. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (library atmosphere, debris messages, lagoon motif), but no cadence shift or density break reweights the dominant stake at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating library and obsidian lagoon are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (aged paper scent, glassy expanse, sand dunes framing the window). Spatial choreography is clear (narrow aisles, rear window, floor patterns). However, setting remains postcard description: neither the zeppelin's motion nor the lagoon constrains a choice or charges the final image. The micro-setting allowance (Ada's debris floor) is visible but does not alter tactics or drive closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering encrypted diary secrets—is signaled early but never tested by on-page pressure. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Naomi watches Ada, "begins to understand," and the codes "yield their secrets" via summary rather than a choice that narrows options. The "tension between revelation and secrecy" is asserted in narrator voice without a dramatized moment where Naomi pays a cost or forecloses a path. No agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens; the piece presents atmosphere without a pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus secrecy, past colliding with present—emerges through image (lagoon as mirror, debris messages) rather than overt statement. The encrypted diary and retrocognitive trapping are premise-level ideas, not developed through specific on-page cost. The final image ("obsidian lagoon remained below... secrets were fully revealed") offers resonance but repeats the opening question without reweighting prior material; no non-literal answer or stance shift appears. Subtext operates in Ada's silent patterning, a positive, but the ending summarizes intent ("would return") rather than landing a final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance appropriate (Naomi's perception filters detail: "felt an inexplicable connection"). Diction is controlled and literary ("searing reverie," "hypnotic rhythm"), though occasionally elevated beyond urgent scene needs. No dialogue appears on the page (the "parley" is summarized), so dialogue bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("felt," "began to grasp") cluster in key beats without voice-motivated purpose, mildly dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; the archivist lens (civil-rights focus) does not shape what Naomi notices beyond generic "dusty tomes."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths are purposeful. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or character position. However, paraphrase loops appear: "cryptic messages had led her on a winding path, one that had ultimately brought her" restates arrival twice, and "secrets waiting to be unlocked... secrets it held... secrets that had been hidden" cycles the core term without added pressure. Register remains consistent; no mixed metaphors. Proofreading is clean. The scaffold cost (−0.4 for loops) and moderate density prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—floating zeppelin library, encrypted diary, retrocognitive figure, obsidian lagoon—assembles evocative genre elements but does not transform them through specific causality or fresh angle. The emotional arc (archivist seeks truth) and resolution (will continue seeking) could transfer unchanged to a different setting with synonym swaps. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece opts for atmospheric safety over a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Transformation test fails: core elements read as checklist deployment rather than organic inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Naomi is present throughout and signals the dominant stake (uncover truth). However, her choices do not create turns: she watches, feels drawn, reaches out to initiate conversation (summarized, not dramatized), and resolves to continue. Observation dominates; no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with cost. Setup present, middle involvement minimal (no choice), closure participation via continuation promise only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears in two beats: framed view at the rear window (first third) and final paragraph reprise. Both instances are descriptive ("dark, glassy expanse," "dark and enigmatic presence") without handling, use, or mechanics that constrain choice. The reprise reinforces mystery but does not reweight meaning with cost. Setup + closure touch meet two gates, but static description and zero causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Encrypted diary discovery frames the inciting premise and Naomi's motivation. It appears early (first third: "hidden away in a forgotten archive") and at closure ("diary's codes... began to yield their secrets"). However, the discovery itself remains off-page backstory; on-page action centers on watching Ada, not decrypting. The element shapes thematic stakes but not dramatized tactics. Setup + thematic closure touch meet two gates; lack of middle beat constrains score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Ada is "said to be retrocognitively trapped" (label-only). The attribute's mechanics—stuck in memories, reliving moments not her own—are described but never constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. Her debris arranging could occur without this trait. Setup present (introduced mid-piece), no middle development beat, no closure payoff. Ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The parley is named ("Naomi... initiating a parley") and occupies narrative space in the middle third. However, it is summarized ("spoke in hushed tones, their conversation weaving together threads") rather than dramatized with goal pursuit, resistance, or turn. The action could be swapped for "interview" or "exchange" with no structural change. Setup + middle mention meet two gates, but summary treatment and lack of closure turn limit score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Ada arranges beach debris into messages twice: mid-piece ("began to arrange... intricate patterns... messages that seemed to dance") and again later ("messages Ada crafted... continued to appear"). Mechanics are signaled (debris, patterns, symbols), and Naomi "was beginning to understand." However, the method does not shape attempts or constrain choices; it remains atmospheric texture. Setup + middle beat + closure mention meet all three gates, but zero causal pressure and swappability (could be "sketches" or "whispers") cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating library on a zeppelin is established early (first paragraph) and sustained throughout; the setting frames all action. Spatial anchors (shelves, aisles, rear window, floor) are clear and integrated into Naomi's movement. The zeppelin's engines hum as ambient texture and the drifting motion recurs in closure. However, the setting does not pressure choices: Naomi's search and observation could occur in any archive. Setup + middle presence + closure frame meet all three gates; lack of tactical constraint limits score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the letters are found" places the story in aftermath but remains vague. No live clock tightens decisions; the zeppelin drifts with no urgency. Temporal progression is soft ("As she navigated," "As she watched," "As the zeppelin sailed on") without beats that narrow time-based options. The element is present thematically but does not shape tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Naomi's desire to uncover truth is named early ("search for truth") and sustained across beats ("need to uncover the truth, no matter where it might lead"). The motivation frames her approach to Ada and the diary codes. However, it is never conflicted in on-page choices: no friction between wants and costs, no trade-off or renunciation. The piece tells the motivation repeatedly but does not dramatize a moment where uncovering truth forecloses another path with visible cost. Setup + middle assertion + closure continuation meet structure, but lack of on-page friction caps score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone reads as solemn, atmospheric, and contemplative throughout ("solemn civil-rights archivist," "lost in thought," "searing reverie"). Diction is elevated and consistent ("hypnotic rhythm," "enigmatic presence"). However, the tone remains static; no modulation under pressure or cadence shift charges the final image. "Searing" is asserted in narrator summary ("searing reverie that drove Naomi forward") rather than embodied in syntax or sensory intensity. Coherent but without dynamic range; mid-band for execution without closure charge.</comment>
