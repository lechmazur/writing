<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Eli's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through pressure-driven choices. The "delicate, quietly analytic mind" attribution remains label-only; no on-page action tests analytical method against emotional stakes. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("physics of letting go") without embodied contradiction or a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending shift feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when remain vague past the 120-word mark (sunken ship library, but depth, entry method, and timeline anchor arrive late). The closure unit—"embracing the fluidity of existence"—reads as thematic summary rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with on-page cost. The lens wavers between accumulative (lecture fragments, net untangling) and causal without teaching a coherent pattern or paying off with a felt price at the ending image. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence demonstrates what Eli forfeits or gains in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sunken ship library is evocatively seeded (luminescent fish, salt and decay) but remains static backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Eli's choices or charges the final image. Spatial choreography is loose: wading through debris, picking up objects, and moving between areas lack clear distances or physical consequence. The snow globe and fishing net function as symbolic tokens rather than tools that alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the physics of letting go"—is stated but never tested by a live on-page dilemma that narrows options or imposes a trade-off. No reversal or tightening occurs; Eli explores, reads, untangles, and departs without a moment where agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) forecloses a path with visible cost. Pressure remains cerebral and abstract throughout, never escalating to a choice that changes tactics or knowledge in a way that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly (impermanence, release, transience) and is woven through recurring images (snow globe, Amelia Earhart, death lectures). However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "the physics of letting go was not about severing ties, but about embracing the fluidity of existence" is thesis-statement phrasing that replaces scene pressure. The snow globe's return is thematically apt but lacks a non-literal answer; it illustrates rather than reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>First-person POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent melancholic register. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sophisticated sorrow," "intricacies of release") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is steady but generic; Eli's way of noticing does not shift distinctively under pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and scaffold sentences accumulate: "I'd come to understand" echoes "I'd been drawn," "As I continued to explore" repeats the opening move, and the final three paragraphs restate the theme with synonym churn ("transformed," "shifted," "slowly begin to settle"). Template cadence: multiple "I + past verb" stems in succession. Figurative language is sparse but mixed: "darkness closing in like a shroud" and "weight of discoveries settling like snow" juxtapose without tension. Line-level clarity is adequate but density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing knowledge or stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—philosopher-explorer in a sunken library seeking wisdom on letting go—reads as a familiar writing-prompt template without fresh synthesis. The Amelia Earhart reference and snow globe feel assembled rather than inevitable. The net-untangling method and cryptic logbook are stock mystery elements that do not transform through specific lived detail or world logic. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the arc follows a predictable quest-to-insight trajectory without a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Character "first name basis with death" is mentioned thematically (death as a theme in lectures, Amelia Earhart's loss) but no character named or identified as having this relationship makes an on-page choice. Eli contemplates mortality but does not embody "first name basis" through action or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Snow globe appears in three beats: picked up and shaken, observed empty on a shelf, glimpsed at departure. Setup is mid-story (~25% mark), development is passive observation, and closure participation is a simile ("like the snow in the globe") rather than causal pressure. Lyric reprise reweights transience but does not constrain a choice or impose cost; swappable with any symbol of stillness.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core concept "last transmission" appears in the logbook passage and again in Eli's reflection ("not a message from the past, but a whisper from the depths of my own mind"). Setup is late (~40% mark), development is interpretive rather than tactical, and closure link is thematic echo. Does not change options or narrow tactics on the page; could be omitted without breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Attribute "quietly analytic" is stated once as Eli observes the snow globe ("delicate, quietly analytic mind that had crafted this trinket") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The net-untangling beat is the only candidate for analytic method, yet the passage describes intuition ("fingers began to move with a life of their own") rather than deliberate analysis. Label-only mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Action "note" appears when Eli transcribes the net's hidden message into a note. Setup is mid-story, the transcription enables thematic discovery ("To let go is not to release, but to reframe"), and the note is mentioned briefly at closure reflection. One distinct beat with causal link to the theme; not indispensable (message could be remembered or spoken), but shapes a turn in understanding.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Method "by untangling threads" is seeded early ("my fingers began to move with a life of their own, untangling the threads of a nearby fishing net") and yields the hidden message that articulates the theme. Setup is prompt, development occurs in one extended beat, and the insight charges Eli's reflections at closure. One key causal link; swappable with other decoding methods but purposefully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Setting "forgotten sunken ship library" is established early and provides atmosphere (luminescent fish, debris, logbook, lectures). However, it functions as backdrop; no environmental constraint pressures Eli's choices or alters tactics. The wreckage's darkness and "shroud" are mood rather than spatial pressure. Postcard description without micro-setting work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after finding Amelia Earhart's plane" is mentioned once in backstory ("The discovery of Amelia Earhart's plane had sparked this journey") but does not anchor the present scene's timeline, tighten decisions, or impose a clock. No tactics are shaped by this temporal frame; ornamental backstory trigger.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to understand the physics of letting go" is stated early and recurs in reflection, but is never dramatized through a conflicted on-page choice. Eli's journey is contemplative tourism; no moment where the desire to understand clashes with a cost or forces a trade-off. Told-only stake without friction between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone "sophisticated melancholy" is coherent throughout: "shiver," "melancholy," "red-rimmed eyes," "shroud," "weight of discoveries." Modulates appropriately with Eli's deepening reflection. The final image ("weight... slowly begin to settle, like the snow") charges the tone and ties it to the snow globe motif. Solid execution; tone supports rather than transforms the ending.</comment>
