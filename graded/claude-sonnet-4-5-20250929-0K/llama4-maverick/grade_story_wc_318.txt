<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Maestro Elwes remains a label without interior contradiction or embodied choice under pressure. The "mournfully eager expression" is asserted twice but never dramatized through micro-choices or visible tradeoffs. The household's "former occupants" are gestured at as unseen spirits, creating no on-page relationship pressure or status dynamics. No decision alters tactics or forecloses a path with felt cost; the maestro simply performs and succeeds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is vague past 120 words: "household" and "echo chamber tunnel" remain abstract placeholders with no spatial anchors or causal link. The inferred lens is Accumulative, but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—the leaf blower performance succeeds without resistance or reversal. The closure unit attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (laughter restored), yet the cost is invisible: no sacrifice, foreclosed option, or felt price appears on the page. The hourglass timeframe is mentioned once and never constrains action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is invoked repeatedly but never grounds spatial choreography or constrains a choice. Sensory details ("cold stone walls," "vibrating air") remain generic postcards. The leaf blower—potentially a micro-setting object—is described ("worn grip") but does not evolve in use or charge the final image. No tool, environment, or body detail alters tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore lost laughter) is signaled early but faces no on-page opposition or tightening. The maestro's performance proceeds without reversal, failed attempt, or visible cost. Coincidence does not complicate; success is simply declared ("laughter echoed"). No agency choice forecloses a path, and the resolution arrives via summary rather than dramatized escalation under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("tending to the unspoken") is stated overtly rather than emerging from particulars. The leaf blower symphony and restored laughter function as allegorical tokens without specific lived cost. The ending delivers a tidy moral ("power of music to heal") in summary rather than a non-literal answer charged by the final image. No genuine ambiguity or counter-reading persists; the tale resolves into sentimental abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance and avoids head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with scene pressure: "coalesced," "emanate," "bittersweet harmony" read as writerly overlay rather than character-filtered perception. Template cadence runs appear ("The maestro's… The household… The echo chamber…"), and no perceptual signature distinguishes the focalizer's noticing. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression is not taught.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: paragraphs 5–6 restate the hourglass/era concept; paragraphs 13–14 repeat "whispers/hum" without added pressure. Template stems ("The maestro," "The household," "The leaf blower's") create drumbeat rhythm across a dozen sentences. Figurative language appears in most lines without pattern-teaching: "mournful melody," "haunting tapestry," "bittersweet beauty." Mixed metaphors: "macerated the silence" strains physical logic. Stock phrases: "shadows reigned supreme," "etched in the hearts." These artifacts dull the closure image and violate the −1.7 threshold for touching the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (music resurrects lost joy) follows a well-worn template without transformation. The leaf blower as instrument offers mild surface novelty, but the emotional arc and resolution remain generic: declared sorrow → performance → restored laughter. No specific lived detail, non-obvious moral calculus, or risk-taking elevates the material. The final image ("maestro's legacy," "true haunting") relies on abstraction rather than a concrete, irreplaceable synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Maestro Elwes is present throughout but makes no key decision that alters tactics or narrows options. He performs without obstacle, internal conflict, or visible tradeoff. His choices do not create turns; the narrative simply asserts his success.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The pull cord handle appears in paragraph 3 ("grasped the pull cord handle") and paragraph 31 ("pull cord handle worn smooth"). Both mentions are decorative; the object does not constrain a choice, evolve in use, or charge the closure. Late reprise lacks causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Tending to the unspoken" is stated overtly in paragraph 11 and echoed thematically in paragraphs 26–27 but never dramatized as a tactic that shapes on-page choices or alters options. It functions as a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" appears as a descriptor in paragraphs 3 and 19 but does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost. The trait remains label-only without embodied tradeoff or choice friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Macerate" appears once in paragraph 12 ("The leaf blower's howl macerated the silence") as figurative description. It does not drive a major turn or redefine options; the sentence could swap "shattered" or "broke" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" appears in paragraph 9 as atmospheric description. The method is not signaled early, its mechanics do not shape the maestro's attempts, and it does not constrain the performance or closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is invoked in paragraphs 1, 7, 13, 18, 29, and 30. It amplifies sound thematically but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome. Spatial choreography remains vague; the setting functions as backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.7</grade><comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" appears in paragraph 5 as past-tense marker. The timeframe does not tighten decisions, constrain tactics, or create urgency. Time remains untracked and inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The motivation (restore lost laughter) is stated in paragraph 4 and referenced throughout. However, it faces no on-page friction, competing desire, or cost that forces a tradeoff. The goal is achieved without struggle, trending functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"True haunting" is named in paragraphs 25 and 28 and sustained through gothic diction ("mournful," "shadows," "spirits"). Tone remains coherent but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with a felt shift. One continuous mood without decisive reweighting.</comment>
